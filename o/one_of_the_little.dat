25|$|The game's ending {{depends on}} how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, and the fates of non-player {{characters}} Holloway, Poole and Alexander within the game. Eleanor can save Sofia Lamb or allow her to die, {{depending on whether the}} player spared or executed the non-player characters. If Delta rescued all of the Little Sisters he will breathe his last breath in Eleanor's arms, the weather will be sunny and clean, then she will absorb his personality and memories and leave Rapture with the Little Sisters to change the world for the better, dropping the doll that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> sisters give her in the ocean, which slightly resembles Delta, in order to mourn his death, and to make his death count. If Delta harvested all of the Little Sisters then Eleanor will extract Delta's ADAM and become bent on world domination, the weather becoming dark and stormy as the corpses of Rapture's inhabitants float to the surface. A mix between rescuing and harvesting the little sisters gives the player a choice; either Eleanor can absorb his ADAM and become evil, or Delta can stop her and die, in which case Eleanor will mourn his death and make her own way in life.|$|E

Elizabeth's public ordeal was captured by press photographers on the morning of September 4, 1957, after she was prevented from entering the school by the Arkansas National Guard. A dramatic snapshot by Johnny Jenkins (UPI) showed the young girl being followed and threatened by an angry white mob; this and other photos of the day's startling events were circulated around the US and the world by the print press.|$|E
2500|$|Prime, or the First Hour, is a fixed time {{of prayer}} of the {{traditional}} Divine Office (Canonical Hours), said at the first hour of daylight (approximately 6:00a.m.), between the morning Hour of Lauds and the 9 a.m. Hour of Terce. It {{is part of the}} Christian liturgies of Eastern Christianity, but in the Latin Rite it was suppressed [...] by the liturgical reforms following the Second Vatican Council. However, clergy who have an obligation to celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours may still fulfil their obligation by using the Roman Breviary promulgated by Pope John XXIII in 1962, which contains the Hour of Prime. Like all the liturgical hours, except the Office of Readings, it consists primarily of Psalms. [...] It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Hours.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{after two}} or three broadsides {{exchanged}} with Alliance, less than 20 minutes after the first shot, Captain Piercy was astonished to see his opponent (with just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> [...] shots from the Countess of Scarborough stuck in its tough timberwork) move away to rejoin Pallas, which was still waiting for an opportunity to be useful. Landais later claimed that his opponent had sailed away under cover of smoke. Piercy, his ship relatively unharmed, and out of range of any of the four Americans, headed straight for the main battle, {{to see if he could}} help Serapis, but Jones’s close-quarters policy meant that to intervene now would be madness. Quite possibly shots fired by the Countess of Scarborough at the Bonhomme Richard would hit Serapis, or worse still, massive [...] shots from Serapis could accidentally hit the Countess of Scarborough. Instead, Piercy simply gave the impression that he was going to intervene, trying to attract the attention of Alliance and Pallas. Cottineau saw the potential danger (or responded to a request by Landais) and quickly steered towards the Countess of Scarborough, so Piercy slowly retreated, sailing with the wind.|$|E

2500|$|The Little People (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "spirit dwarves") were also said {{to be able to}} confer blessings or spiritual insight (maxpe) to certain individuals.

The Crow tell of two ways to pass through the mountains without being harmed by the Little People, however. Both involved offerings. According to their folklore, the Little People had befriended a young Crow boy. The boy told the Crow that there was a pass through the mountains which the Crow could use, but they would need to shoot arrows ahead of them as they traveled as an offering to the Little People. This pass, now called Pryor Gap, was known to the Crow as [...] "Hits With The Arrows." [...] The Crow name for Pryor Creek was [...] "Arrow Creek," [...] and the Pryor Mountains were known to them as the Baahpuuo or [...] "Arrowhead Mountains." [...] However, other kinds of offerings, such as beads, cloth, or tobacco, could also be left in order to win safe passage through the mountains.|$|E
