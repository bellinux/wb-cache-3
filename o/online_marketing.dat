These games received some coverage in academic and news sources, and PETA's head of <b>online</b> <b>marketing,</b> Joel Bartlett, identified their 2004 Revenge of the PETA Tomatoes and the Frogger parody, Lobster Liberation, {{as some of the}} organization's earliest released games. However it was not until 2007 that PETA began to attract wider attention within the gaming community with its release of Super Chick Sisters, a parody of Super Mario Bros. Controlling two female chicks named Nugget and Chickette, the player sets out to rescue vegetarian actress Pamela Anderson, who has publicly revealed animal cruelty endemic to KFC's food production, from KFC's mascot Colonel Sanders. In 2009, the game was met with a sequel, New Super Chick Sisters, a homage to New Super Mario Bros. In this game, McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald kidnaps Anderson with the intent of using her as a Happy Meal ingredient, and the Chick Sisters must rescue her again.|$|E

25|$|Hotel {{occupancy}} typically reaches 80% {{on weekends}} with about 50% occupancy on weekdays, when rates can be about half. Most visitors are vacationers and about 60% are domestic visitors, {{interested in the}} town's history and role in the Mexican War of Independence. Another attraction for visitors are the two main art/cultural institutions of Instituto Allende and Bellas Artes {{as well as a}} number of Spanish language schools. Most domestic visitors come from Mexico's large urban centers like Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Queretaro. This growth has spurred the development of newer hotels, resort and vacation home developments, especially on the corridor between San Miguel and Atotonilco. There are 149 hotels, nine of which are 5-star. The town has just over 9% of all hotel rooms in the state, and this percentage is growing. Another important sector is restaurants.

25|$|In {{the context}} of the social web, {{engagement}} means that customers and stakeholders, such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. Social media use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services or business practices, or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into buying behavior (or voting or donating behavior in a political context). New <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|E

Analysis of over 1. 5 million online drugs sales shows <b>online</b> drugs <b>markets</b> tend to function without the significant moral hazard problems that, a priori, {{one might think}} would plague them. Only {{a small proportion of}} online drugs deals receive bad ratings from buyers, and <b>online</b> <b>markets</b> suffer less from problems of adulteration and low quality that are a common feature of street sales of illegal drugs. Furthermore, as with legal <b>online</b> <b>markets,</b> the market penalizes bad ratings, which subsequently lead to significant sales reductions and to market exit. The impact of the well-known seizure by law enforcement of the original Silk Road and the shutdown of Silk Road 2. 0 are also studied, together with the exit scam of the market leader at the time, Evolution. There is no evidence that these exits deterred buyers or sellers from online drugs trading, as new platforms rapidly replaced those taken down, with the <b>online</b> <b>market</b> for drugs continuing to grow...|$|R
