30|$|When air was injected, <b>the</b> {{temperature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{middle layer}} was higher at <b>the</b> pressing temperature <b>of</b> 210 °C than at 190 °C.

In particular, <b>the</b> MOR retention <b>of</b> water soaking was higher than that <b>of</b> outdoor exposure. <b>The</b> <b>boards</b> soaked in water have poor mechanical properties solely because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bonding points, and the mechanism for <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties is very simple. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> exposed outdoors have poor properties because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bonding points and biodegradation [10]. These factors interact, resulting in a major reduction in <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> exposed outdoors than in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> soaked in water. These differences between outdoor exposure and water soaking cause different reductions in <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> both <b>boards.</b>|$|R
