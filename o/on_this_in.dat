After recovering, Young made his return in a 2–1 victory away to Cambridge United on 29 August 2006. He joined Northwich for the third time in November 2006 on a one-month loan, having made eight appearances for Halifax up to that point in 2006–07. He made three appearances for Northwich before being recalled by Halifax on 18 December 2006. He made three appearances after returning but his season was ended due to a knee injury sustained on 1 January 2007 in a 1–1 home draw with Altrincham, having made 11 appearances for Halifax that season.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|The chapel {{replaced}} the Mosley Street Chapel (built 1789, demolished 1836) upon its completion for baptisms, burials and marriages. It was originally constructed for the Unitarians.

Restrictions were placed <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> 1856 and prohibited in 1882 except for the removal of remains from graves on the north side to brick vaults {{on the south side of}} the chapel. Baptisms were performed until at least 1912, and marriages until at least 1916. Ministers at the chapel include John James Tayler (until 1853), William Henry Herford (1866–70), Philip Wicksteed (circa 1890), John Trevor (1890–91, left to start The Labour Church) and Edward Walker Sealy (1910-???).|$|E

25|$|Gilruth had {{correctly}} envisaged that, for {{the foreseeable}} future, large-scale private enterprise in Darwin {{would be based on}} the mining, agriculture and cattle industries. The large British conglomerate, Vestey Brothers, proposed setting up a meat processing plant in Darwin and work commenced <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> 1914. An analysis of the negotiations suggested that neither the government nor Vestey Brothers were fully confident {{of the success of the}} venture they were about to undertake. It also showed that Gilruth, as the middleman, was thoroughly influential in its outcome. It was largely through his efforts that Vestey Brothers finally consented to building a meatworks in Darwin.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{accounts}} (now rejected) {{claimed that}} the Picts had migrated to Scotland from Scythia, a region that encompassed Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Buchanan, looking for a Scythian P-Celtic candidate for the ancestral Pict, settled on the Gaulish-speaking Cotini (which he rendered as Gothuni), a tribe from the region that is now Slovakia. This was later misunderstood by Robert Sibbald in 1710, who equated Gothuni with the Germanic-speaking Goths. John Pinkerton expanded <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> 1789, claiming that Pictish was the predecessor to Modern Scots. Pinkerton's arguments were often rambling, bizarre and clearly motivated by his belief that Celts were an inferior people. The theory of a Germanic Pictish language is no longer considered credible.|$|E

25|$|In 1768 John Golborne {{advised the}} {{narrowing}} {{of the river}} and the increasing of the scour by the construction of rubble jetties and the dredging of sandbanks and shoals. A particular problem was the division of the river into two shallow channels by the Dumbuck shoal near Dumbarton. After James Watt's report <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> 1769, a jetty was constructed at Longhaugh Point to block off the southern channel. This being insufficient, a training wall called the Lang Dyke was built in 1773 on the Dumbuck shoal to stop water flowing over into the southern channel. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries hundreds of jetties were built out from the banks between Dumbuck and the Broomielaw quay in Glasgow itself. In some cases this resulted in an immediate deepening as the constrained water flow washed away the river bottom; in others, dredging was required.|$|E

In the 1927 cricket season, Hill played three further matches for Somerset and in the second of these, against Derbyshire at Taunton he finally made an impression as a bowler, taking four wickets for 98 runs in Derbyshire's first innings. He then improved <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> 1928, his best season, by taking five Worcestershire wickets for 36 in the match at Stourbridge, the best return of his career. In his next Somerset match, against Surrey at Taunton, Hill took five for 85 in Surrey's first innings. But just a week later he broke down in the match against Sussex at Hove. He returned for one final first-class match in 1929 but was not successful.|$|E
25|$|In May 1970, the Penn Central {{planned to}} {{discontinue}} service from Dover Plains to Chatham when Amtrak declined {{to take over}} that service. However, the Attorney General maintained that this service was within the commuter area, and therefore not subject to discontinuation. Without the objection, this service would have been eliminated on May 1, 1971 when the Amtrak passenger service went into effect. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) held hearings <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> May 1971, and it ruled on June 28, 1971 that the service to Chatham was intercity–not commuter. On that same day, {{a bill that would}} have extended the power of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to Chatham was vetoed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller. On July 31, 1971, Penn Central announced that it would discontinue all service to Chatham the following day. The railroad claimed that it lost $300,000 a year on the one round trip between Chatham and Grand Central.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{system of}} {{controls}} {{can be used}} on physical cards. Technology provides the option for banks to support many other controls too that can be turned on and off and varied by the credit card owner in real time as circumstances change (i.e., they can change temporal, numerical, geographical and many other parameters on their primary and subsidiary cards). Apart from the obvious benefits of such controls: from a security perspective this means that a customer can have a Chip and PIN card secured for the real world, and limited for use in the home country. In this eventuality a thief stealing the details will be prevented from using these overseas in non chip and pin EMV countries. Similarly the real card can be restricted from use on-line so that stolen details will be declined if this tried. Then when card users shop online they can use virtual account numbers. In both circumstances an alert system can be built in notifying a user that a fraudulent attempt has been made which breaches their parameters, and can provide data <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> real time.|$|E
