5|$|This {{measure of}} {{elasticity}} is {{sometimes referred to}} as the own-price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> for a good, i.e., the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> with respect to the good's own price, in order to distinguish it from the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> for that good with respect to the change in the price of some other good, i.e., a complementary or substitute good. The latter type of elasticity measure is called a cross-price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the {{definition of a}} good (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would tend to have a relatively high elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> because no substitutes exist.|$|E
5|$|Hence, as the {{accompanying}} diagram shows, total revenue is maximized at {{the combination of}} price and quantity demanded where the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> is unitary.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a generalization of the two-echelon (base-depot) inventory system considered by Shanker in which the demands occurring at bases depend now on the total number <b>of</b> <b>demands</b> that have arrived before. Simple probabilistic arguments are used to derive the probability distribution of the number <b>of</b> <b>demands.</b> It is also shown {{that the results of}} Shanker on some conditional distributions related to the arrival <b>of</b> <b>demands</b> remain valid for this more general model. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

5|$|Price {{elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> (PED or Ed) is {{a measure}} used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded of a good or service {{to a change in}} its price, ceteris paribus. More precisely, it gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price (ceteris paribus).|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> {{for a good}} is relatively inelastic (-1 < Ed < 0), the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than that in price. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue increases, and vice versa.|$|E
