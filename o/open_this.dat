5|$|At the ATP World Tour level, Raonic gained {{entry into}} few tournaments, {{compiling}} a main draw record of three wins and five losses over nearly two and half years. In 2009, Raonic again received a wildcard for the qualifying tournament of the Canadian <b>Open.</b> <b>This</b> time, he beat world No. 77 Teymuraz Gabashvili and No. 113 Michaël Llodra {{to qualify for}} the main draw of an ATP World Tour tournament for the first time. In the first round, he held a match point, but lost to world No. 10 Fernando González in three sets. The matches against Gabashvili and González were the first singles matches for Raonic against a top100 player and top10 player, respectively.|$|E

5|$|During Darius's Greek expedition, he {{had begun}} {{construction}} projects in Susa, Egypt and Persepolis. He had linked the Red Sea to the river Nile by building a canal (Darius Canal) which ran from modern Zaqāzīq to modern Suez. To <b>open</b> <b>this</b> canal, he travelled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the Red Sea and Mediterranean. On this visit to Egypt he erected monuments and executed Aryandes on the charge of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, {{he found that the}} codification of Egyptian law had been finished.|$|E
5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{portion of}} this station has two tracks and one island {{platform}} on the upper level of the station complex. The eastern end of the AirTrain platform leads to Parking Area C. Unlike the New York City Subway platforms, the AirTrain JFK platforms are entirely enclosed and feature platform screen doors, which help the station maintain a constant temperature and prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. An array of sensors detect a train's position on the track, and only when it is properly aligned will the train's doors <b>open.</b> <b>This</b> enables the AirTrain to use automatic train operation without drivers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} of the summer hard court swing Federer was {{defeated}} in the final of the Montreal Masters by Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to be fit for the US <b>Open.</b> <b>This</b> injury effectively cost him the #1 ranking as he would have attained it by reaching the Cincinnati final, a tournament he has won seven times. Despite his withdrawal from Cincinnati, Federer had little time to recover for the US Open, and the back injury severely affected his practice sessions. Even from the start, he looked uncomfortable and it took him five sets to win each of the first two rounds against Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny. His campaign at the US Open finally ended in the last 8, where he lost to Juan Martin del Potro in four sets. His game was hampered by unforced errors at crucial points in the match and even he admitted that he never felt {{he had a chance to}} win the tournament.|$|E

5|$|On June 3, 2016, Paes {{completed}} his Career Grand Slam in mixed doubles tennis {{by winning the}} 2016 French Open with Martina Hingis, thus joining an elite league of players to do so. He also broke Owen Davidson's record for most such titles in gentlemen's section. Paes qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Men's Doubles, and partnered with Rohan Bopanna. They lost {{in the first round}} to the Polish pair of Marcin Matkowski and Łukasz Kubot. He later paired up with Andre Begemann, where they reached the final in the Winston-Salem <b>Open.</b> <b>This</b> pair lost {{in the first round of}} 2016 US Open. He turned up for the Davis cup against Spain with Saketh Myneni and this pair lost to Rafael Nadal and Marc López in 4 sets.|$|E
5|$|Most procellariids' nests are in burrows or on {{the surface}} on open ground, with a smaller number nesting {{under the cover of}} {{vegetation}} (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the snow petrel nest in the open, the snow petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting snow petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to skuas, gulls and other avian predators, something the aggressive oil-spitting fulmars are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no wind-chill to contend with. The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on tropical islands is why some shearwaters and two species of gadfly petrel can nest in the <b>open.</b> <b>This</b> has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on coralline islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies nocturnally in order to reduce predation as well. Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the herald petrel, which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal white-bellied sea eagle.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is a {{difficult}} bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so {{than that of the}} African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the <b>open,</b> <b>this</b> crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may feign death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.|$|E
