Eventually, Number One moves in with the now exhausted and inebriated Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him. They agree to a temporary truce and set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day and then disappears during the meal.|$|E
5|$|The Bob Stump Memorial Parkway is a {{relatively}} new freeway in the far northwestern area of the Valley, serving cities such as Surprise, Peoria, Glendale, and northern Phoenix. Currently, there are two segments of freeway. The first <b>one,</b> <b>begins</b> at an at grade interchange with I-17 (a stack interchange is to be constructed). This freeway status continues, with occasional interchanges at Lake Pleasant Parkway, Lone Mountain Parkway, and Happy Valley Parkway (many others are planned), until El Mirage Road.|$|E
5|$|Season <b>one</b> <b>begins</b> with Alex Parrish, {{a former}} FBI recruit, {{becoming}} a prime suspect following {{a terrorist attack}} on Grand Central Terminal. She is taken into custody and charged with treason. Her first escape is orchestrated by Deputy Director Miranda Shaw, her primary instructor at Quantico, who refuses {{to believe that she}} is guilty and feels someone from her class has framed her. Various flashbacks show Parrish and fellow agents, each having their secret reasons for joining the FBI, training at the FBI Academy. The present timeline focuses on the restrained relationship between Parrish and her boyfriend Ryan Booth and fellow trainees and friends, including: Shelby Wyatt, Nimah and Raina Amin, Simon Asher, Brandon Fletcher, Elias Harper and Caleb Haas, who all somehow seem connected to the bombing, while she is on the run to prove her innocence.|$|E

5|$|Director Brad Bird {{wanted to}} open the episode with a close up of Krusty's face. The staff liked the idea and he then {{suggested}} that all three acts of the episode, defined by {{the placement of the}} commercial breaks, should begin with a close up shot. Act <b>one</b> <b>begins</b> with Krusty's face introducing the audience at his show, act two begins with Krusty's face being locked up behind bars, and act three begins with Sideshow Bob's face on a big poster. Krusty's character is based on a television clown from Portland, Oregon, called Rusty Nails, whom The Simpsons creator Matt Groening watched while growing up in Portland. The original teleplay, written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, was 78 pages long and many scenes had to be cut. One scene that had to be cut down was the scene where Patty and Selma show the slideshow of their vacation; it originally contained images of them being detained for bringing heroin into America.|$|E
5|$|As the WSPU gained {{recognition}} and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise the organisation itself. In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any <b>one</b> <b>begins</b> to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|E

25|$|The {{five books}} of the Torah have been broken down into their weekly Torah {{readings}} for convenience. The weekly Torah readings always begin at a parashah break, with the single exception of Vayechi (Genesis 47:28). The division into weekly readings is a prominent feature of the Tiberian masoretic codices along with the division into smaller parashot, and they are indicated with a special flourish in the margin parallel to the line in which each <b>one</b> <b>begins.</b>|$|E

25|$|In menopausal women, sexual {{functioning}} can impact several {{dimensions of}} a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being. During {{the onset of}} menopause, sexuality can be a critical issue in determining whether <b>one</b> <b>begins</b> to experience changes in their sexual response cycle. Both age— and menopause-related events can affect the integrity of a woman’s biological systems involved in the sexual response cycle, which include hormone environment, neuro-muscular substrates, and vascular supplies. Therefore, it can be appropriate {{to make use of}} HRT, especially in women with low or declining quality of life due to sexual difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Bergson {{responds}} {{by saying}} that the antinomies are the result of analysis, not intuition. An example of this is Duration itself, which Bergson maintains isn’t a multiplicity or a unity. Depending on the viewpoint from which <b>one</b> <b>begins,</b> he will either reconstruct the absolute Duration as a unity or a multiplicity. Hence the antinomy of substance pluralism and substance monism, which can only be resolved through showing they are two representations of the same thing via a simple act of intuition. Thus real philosophy consists in placing oneself above the fray of oppositional schools of thought.|$|E
25|$|Python's {{property}} descriptors are similar, {{but come}} with a tradeoff in the development process. If <b>one</b> <b>begins</b> in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable, and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class {{may need to be}} adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby’s design forces all instance variables to be private, but also provides a simple way to declare set and get methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, one never directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside the class; rather, one passes a message to the class and receives a response.|$|E
25|$|Once {{they are}} juvenile, Nephila inhabit their {{individual}} webs then begin the growth by molting process. The {{period of time}} between molts is called an instar and there can be 7-12 of these depending on food availability. Ecdysis, or the shedding of the exoskeleton occurs through {{the formation of a}} soft exoskeleton inside the current one. Once the old exoskeleton is shed the new larger <b>one</b> <b>begins</b> to harden. Ecdysis occurs when the spiders mass becomes too great for the current exoskeleton to support. Once they are mature male spiders seek out females for copulation and live on their webs. When mating season arrives both males and females stop molting and remain the same size for the remainder of their lives.|$|E

25|$|The God Beneath the Sea {{is divided}} into three parts. Part <b>one</b> <b>begins</b> with the image of the infant Hephaestus plummeting from Olympus to the ocean. Thetis saves the baby and takes him to the grotto she shares with Eurynome. They raise the baby, telling him stories of Greek myths and giving him a hammer and anvil to play with. Part one concludes with Hermes {{inviting}} Hephaestus back to Olympus at Hera's bequest, and Hephaestus claiming Aphrodite for his wife. Part two tells the myths of Prometheus and Pandora, and part three tells various myths of gods interacting with mortals. The novel concludes with the Olympians unsuccessfully attempting to overthrow Zeus, and Hephaestus returning to Olympus from Lemnos, having been cast down from Olympus for a second time after reproaching Zeus.|$|E
25|$|Act <b>One</b> <b>begins</b> as {{the alarm}} in Mal and Jill's bedroom goes off, and Mal reaches for it. They rise for breakfast, and Sam, their son, {{tries to get}} Jill to sign a {{permission}} form for an after-school drama group without Mal knowing, but Mal finds the form and rips it up. It is unclear what Mal does not like about it, other than claiming acting is men prancing around in tights. Sam is openly contemptuous of his father, whilst Mal is openly disappointed with his son, unlike his daughter, Chrissie, who worked hard at school, found her man, got pregnant and got married (in that order). Mal's prized son-in-law, Dean, arrives at the house, and prior to setting off for work together, Dean speaks of how successful his marriage is (his proudest example being his wife making him cooked breakfast every day apart from Sunday when he makes her breakfast).|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{structure of}} the play {{is very much in}} keeping with that of Japanese traditional drama forms as a whole. The philosophy of jo-ha-kyū is employed throughout, as actions, scenes, acts, and the play as a whole begin slow (jo), then get faster (ha), and end quickly (kyū). Also, Sugawara follows the traditional five-act structure and the themes traditionally associated with particular acts. Act <b>One</b> <b>begins</b> calmly and auspiciously, including scenes at the Imperial Palace. Act Two features combat and murder. Act Three is something of a sewamono insertion into the jidaimono tale, turning away from the affairs of warriors and politics to focus on the lives of commoners. Act Four, often in other plays a michiyuki journey, metaphorically associated with a journey through hell, features a dramatic storm and an emotional journey for Kan Shōjō, who becomes enraged at the traitorous activities of Shihei, and kills himself, becoming a thunder god. Act Five wraps up the plot quickly and returns to themes of auspiciousness.|$|E
