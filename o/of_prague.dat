5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and vandalism have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava {{in the early to}} mid-2000s, the city was a setting in the 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed in the city and suburbs <b>of</b> <b>Prague,</b> the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion <b>of</b> <b>Prague</b> helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were breaking away from Austrian command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian Littoral {{and elsewhere in the}} Adriatic.|$|E

František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of the correct literary Czech until much later in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Barbarossa, who {{had been}} crowned Holy Roman Emperor, {{received}} the envoys of Manuel I in Nuremberg in July 1156. The Byzantine envoys proposed a joint invasion of Hungary, but Barbarossa refused their offer. On 16 September, Barbarossa stipulated that the dukes of Austria were to support the Holy Roman emperors during a war against Hungary in his charter by which he elevated Austria to a duchy, showing {{that the relationship between}} Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire was still tense. Barbarossa's close advisor, Daniel, Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Prague,</b> visited Hungary in the summer of 1157. On this occasion, Géza promised that he would support Barbarossa with auxiliary troops if the emperor invaded Italy.|$|E

5|$|In 1756, after over-running Saxony, Frederick campaigned in Bohemia; he {{defeated}} the Austrians on 6 May 1757 at the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Prague.</b> Learning that French forces had invaded his ally's territory of Hanover, Frederick moved west. On 5 November 1757, an infantry regiment of about 1,000 men and 1,500 of his cavalry destroyed the combined French and Austrian force of 30,000 at the Battle of Rossbach in a 90-minute battle. In his absence, though, the Austrians {{had managed to}} retake Silesia: the Empresses' brother-in-law, Prince Charles, took the city of Schweidnitz and had moved on Breslau in lower Silesia.|$|E
5|$|On stage, Harlequin Munchausen, or the Fountain of Love, a {{pantomime}} {{based on}} the Raspe text, was produced in London in 1818, and Herbert Eulenberg made the Baron the main character of a 1900 play, Münchhausen. The Expressionist writer Walter Hasenclever turned the stories into a comedy, Münchhausen, in 1934. Grigori Gorin used the Baron as the hero of his 1976 play That Very Munchausen; a film version was made in 1980. Baron Prášil, a Czech musical about the Baron, opened in 2010 in Prague. The following year, the National Black Light Theatre <b>of</b> <b>Prague</b> toured the United Kingdom with a nonmusical production of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption.

5|$|Soon {{after his}} marriage, Schindler quit working {{for his father}} and took a series of jobs, {{including}} a position at Moravian Electrotechnic and the management of a driving school.

5|$|The Prague Spring {{reforms were}} a strong attempt by Dubček to grant {{additional}} {{rights to the}} citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization. The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media, speech and travel. After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. This was the only formal change that survived the end <b>of</b> <b>Prague</b> Spring, though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to liberal democracy with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989.|$|E

Other {{elements}} supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, but it appears only the partial skull was ever present.

5|$|The {{increases}} of the 1630s corresponded with {{a lull in}} the Thirty Years' War. In 1634/5 the German and Swedish armies lost ground in the South of Germany; then Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria moved north. After the Peace <b>of</b> <b>Prague</b> (1635) the French (and the Dutch) decided to support the Swedish and German protestants with money and arms against the Habsburg empire, and to occupy the Spanish Netherlands in 1636. Hence market prices (at least initially) were responding rationally to a rise in demand. However, the fall in prices was faster and more dramatic than the rise. Data on sales largely disappeared after the February 1637 collapse in prices, but a few other data points on bulb prices after tulip mania show that bulbs continued to lose value for decades thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Seven Years' War, Wunsch {{operated}} successfully {{as a light}} troops officer. After the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Prague</b> in 1757, he {{was promoted}} to major. He followed this up with stellar action near Torgau in September, and the following day his troops overran Leipzig. The subsequent Prussian successes at the battles of Breslau and Leuthen led to his promotion, this time by Frederick himself, to lieutenant colonel. The King also gave him command of an independent battalion and awarded him the Order Pour le Mérite. Wunsch made a brief journey to his home town of Heidenheim and returned to his unit in Bohemia.|$|E
5|$|Although Joachim von Ribbentrop {{had been}} named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring {{continued}} to involve himself in foreign affairs. That July, he contacted the British government {{with the idea that}} he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for Czechoslovakia. Neville Chamberlain was in favour of a meeting, and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the Nuremberg Rally that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered. Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the Munich Agreement (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the Sudetenland to Germany. In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president Emil Hácha with the bombing <b>of</b> <b>Prague.</b> Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia.|$|E
50|$|Jews are {{believed}} to have settled in Prague as early as the 10th century.

He is buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery in Josefov, and his grave with its tombstone intact, can still be visited. It is said that the body of Golem (created by Maharal) lies in the attic of the Old New Synagogue where the genizah <b>of</b> <b>Prague's</b> community is kept.
