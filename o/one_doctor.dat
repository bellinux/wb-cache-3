5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, there is only <b>one</b> <b>doctor</b> for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.

Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E

The remainder of the field ambulance, comprising the headquarters with two surgical teams, would be co-located with the brigade and establish their main dressing station in farm buildings to the south of the bridge.|$|E
