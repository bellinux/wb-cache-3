25|$|Originally {{there was}} no R18+ rating for video games, meaning that any game that {{exceeded}} the MA15+ classification (i.e., suitable for adults, but not children) was automatically rated Refused Classification and banned, but on 22 July 2011, a meeting of attorneys-general produced an in-principle agreement to introduce the R18+ classification for videogames, however, NSW Attorney-General Greg Smith abstained from the vote. The Home Affairs Minister, Brendan O'Connor, has said {{the federal government would}} <b>over-ride</b> NSW and implement the R18+ rating regardless of its decision. Legislation introducing the rating was passed by the Senate in June 2012, with a start of 1 January 2013.|$|E
25|$|Tim Noakes, {{based on}} an earlier idea by the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill has {{proposed}} {{the existence of a}} central governor. In this, the brain continuously adjusts the power output by muscles during exercise in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in prior length of strenuous exercise, the planned duration of further exertion, and the present metabolic state of the body. This adjusts the number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, and is subjectively experienced as fatigue and exhaustion. The idea of a central governor rejects the earlier idea that fatigue is only caused by mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral fatigue"). Instead, the brain models the metabolic limits of the body to ensure that whole body homeostasis is protected, in particular that the heart is guarded from hypoxia, and an emergency reserve is always maintained. The idea of the central governor has been questioned since ‘physiological catastrophes’ can and do occur suggesting athletes (such as Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess) can <b>over-ride</b> the ‘‘central governor’.|$|E

25|$|T-55AGM - Ukrainian T-54/T-55 modernization. It {{brings up}} the T-54/T-55 tanks to T-80 standard. It can also be applied to Chinese made Type 59 and Soviet T-62. It is fitted with 5TDFM, {{two-stroke}} liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons which develops 850hp (634kW), improved running gear, automated movement control system with a steering handlebar control, additional passive protection, built-in explosive reactive armour, countermeasures system, new fire suppression system with <b>over-ride</b> facilities at the commander's station, automatic loader which holds 18 rounds and anti-aircraft machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within the turret under a complete armour protection. The anti-aircraft machine gun is installed on the commander's cupola and {{is intended to be}} fired at air and ground targets. The buyer can choose between two main armament options: 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun or 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun. Both of them with use of enhanced performance conventional ammunition and barrel-launched ATGM can defeat modern tanks form distance of 2000–3000 m and up to 5,000 m using the ATGM. The tank can carry at least 30 rounds. The 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds while 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun weighs 2,63 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (50 calibers) and can fire all types of ammunition that meet the requirements of NATO standards and Ukrainian-made ATGM. Both guns have normal recoil length of 26–30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. The tank can be armed with either the KT-7.62 or the PKT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and can carry 3,000 rounds for it. The tank can also be armed with either KT-12.7 or NSVT-12.7 heavy machine gun for AA protection and can carry 450 rounds for it. The approximate successful range is 2km during day and 800 m during night. The AA HMG can be elevated between -5 to +70 degrees. The remote control for anti-aircraft machine gun is stabilized in the vertical axis during automatic mode (by using the TKN-5 sight) and is using the PZU-7 sight for semi-automatic mode.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the fact}} that {{stability}} control can sometimes be incompatible with high-performance driving (i.e. when the driver intentionally loses traction as in drifting), many vehicles have an <b>over-ride</b> control which allows the system to be partially or fully shut off. [...] In simpler systems, a single button may disable all features, while more complicated setups may have a multi-position switch or may never be truly turned fully off.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of a central governor over physiology has been questioned since ‘physiological catastrophes’ can and do occur in athletes (important examples in marathons have been Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess). This suggests that humans can <b>over-ride</b> ‘the central governor’. Moreover, a variety of peripheral factors {{in addition to those}} such as lactic acid build up can impair muscle power and might act to protect against [...] "catastrophe". Another objection is that models incorporating conscious control also provide an alternative explanation [...] (see Noakes’ reply).|$|E

2500|$|In Convention. As to {{judicial}} review and the Congress, the first proposals by Madison (Va) and Wilson (Pa) {{called for a}} supreme court veto over national legislation. In this it resembled the system in New York, where the Constitution of 1777 called for a [...] "Council of Revision" [...] by the Governor and Justices of the state supreme court. The Council would review and in a way, veto any passed legislation violating {{the spirit of the}} Constitution before it went into effect. The nationalist's proposal in Convention was defeated three times, and replaced by a presidential veto with Congressional <b>over-ride.</b> Judicial review relies on the jurisdictional authority in Article III, and the Supremacy Clause.|$|E

Griffith CJ challenged Nicholls to identify any differences between the two which would make the principles from American cases such as McCulloch v Maryland, inapplicable, Nicholls pointing out section 107, which preserves or [...] "saves" [...] the powers of the state parliaments (except for powers given exclusively to the federal parliament). Griffith CJ suggested that there was no material difference between this provision and the Tenth Amendment, but Nicholls argued that section 107 was far clearer, and further suggested that [...] "the contention that the implied powers of the Commonwealth can <b>over-ride</b> State laws seems hardly consistent with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{interplay of}} {{copyright}} law and competition law is increasingly {{important in the}} digital world, as most countries' laws allow private contracts to <b>over-ride</b> copyright law. Given that copyright law creates a legally sanctioned monopoly, balanced by [...] "limitations and exceptions" [...] that allow access without {{the permission of the}} copyright holder the over-riding of copyright law by private contracts can create monopoly activity. Well known limitations and exceptions include fair dealing in the UK and Canada, as well as the fair use doctrine in the US. The undermining of copyright law, and in particular limitations and exceptions to copyright by contract law is an issue frequently raised by libraries, and library groups such as International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions. As a result of this, this issue is increasingly being looked at and discussed at a national governmental level e.g. UK [...] as well as international level such as WIPO – as part of the Development Agenda.|$|E

2500|$|McDonnell {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the redistricting conducted in response to the 2010 census. In a special session of the General Assembly, the redistricting of both the House of Delegates and the State Senate were passed in single bill that was approved by the House with an 86 to 8 vote and the Senate with a 22 to 18 vote. The bill was developed without regard to the advisory commission's recommendations. On April 15, 2011, McDonnell vetoed the bill on the grounds that [...] "the Senate plan is the kind of political gerrymandering that Virginians have ask that we leave in the past." [...] Although McDonnell had the power to amend the bill with his veto, he simply sent it back for the General Assembly to either <b>over-ride</b> the veto or adopt a different bill. Because the Democrats lacked the 2/3 majority necessary to override the veto, the State Senate had to adopt a new plan. At first, Senate Majority Leader Richard L. Saslaw promised to merely readopt the vetoed redistricting map, but then began negotiations with the governor's office about a new plan. Republican members of the House and Senate criticized the Governor for overturning the timetable for approval of new districts prior to the 2011 elections. After lengthy negotiations, on April 28, both houses passed a revised set of district maps and McDonnell announced that he would sign the revised bill.|$|E
