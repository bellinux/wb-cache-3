500|$|Meany {{opposed the}} antiwar {{candidacy}} of U. S. Senator George McGovern {{for the presidency}} against incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972 despite McGovern's generally pro-labor voting record in Congress. However he declined to endorse Nixon. <b>On</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> in September 1972, Meany criticized McGovern's statements that the US should respect other peoples' rights to choose communism {{by pointing out that}} there had never been a country that had freely voted for communism. Meaney accused McGovern of being [...] "an apologist for the Communist world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{continuing}} student {{protests against}} the war brought Agnew's scorn. In a speech on April 28 in Hollywood, Florida, Agnew stated that responsibility of the unrest lay with those who failed to guide them, and suggested that the alumni of Yale University fire its president, Kingman Brewster. The Cambodia incursion brought more demonstrations on campus, and on May 3, Agnew went <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> to defend the policy. Reminded that Nixon, in his inaugural address, had called for the lowering of voices in political discourse, Agnew commented, [...] "When a fire takes place, a man doesn't run {{into the room and}} whisper... he yells, 'Fire!' and I am yelling 'Fire!' because I think 'Fire!' needs to be called here". The Kent State shootings took place the following day, but Agnew did not tone down his attacks on demonstrators, alleging that he was responding to [...] "a general malaise that argues for violent confrontation instead of debate". Nixon had Haldeman tell Agnew to avoid remarks about students; Agnew strongly disagreed and stated that he would only refrain if Nixon directly ordered it.|$|E
500|$|Throughout April, {{the draft}} efforts continued, and Perot {{appeared}} on talk shows, discussing his plans and positions on political issues. During {{an appearance on}} Larry King Live, Perot stated that he was closer to a decision on a potential campaign, {{and that he was}} willing to spend $100 million of his own money to finance it. On the Today Show he was interviewed by Katie Couric, and proposed to cut Medicare and Social Security for [...] "people who don't need it". He appeared <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> later in the month, and argued that wealthy Americans should spend more than average Americans to eliminate the budget deficit. His budget numbers were contested by Tim Russert on Meet the Press, during a heated interview, after which, a frustrated Perot considered dropping out of the race. [...] C-SPAN ran a speech by Perot, where he announced that he hoped to run a campaign without [...] "political pros" [...] to avoid the [...] "dirty tricks" [...] of past campaigns. After this appearance, campaign consultant Raymond Strother explained to Perot that professionals such as pollster Mark Penn were essential to a successful campaign. In late April, Perot hired former Chicago Tribune editor James Squires as press spokesman to handle the large volume of interview requests from the media. At the end of the month, Perot realized that he had spent too much time visiting talk shows, and announced that he would spend his next few weeks focusing on the issues.|$|E

50|$|Syed {{joined the}} Islami Jamhoori Ittehad, a right-wing {{collation}} {{which won the}} 1990 elections. Syed was inducted to the Cabinet of Pakistan as a special assistant by Nawaz Sharif, and broadly assisted the government on Foreign Affairs particularly on Central Asia, he remained so until 1993. In February 1997, he {{was added to the}} cabinet as an Advisor to the Prime Minister Sharif on Tourism, Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs. In March 1997, Syed was elected to the Senate {{as a member of the}} Pakistan Muslim League (N) and was elevated to as the Information Minister of Pakistan. He also apperared as a guest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>on</b> CBS News in 1998.|$|R
500|$|On June 29, 2008, Clark made {{comments}} <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> {{that were}} critical of Republican John McCain, {{calling into question}} the notion that McCain's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president. [...] "I certainly honor [...] service as a prisoner of war", Clark said, [...] "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded—it wasn't a wartime squadron. He hasn't been in there and ordered the bombs to fall." [...] When moderator Bob Schieffer noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he [...] "ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down", Clark responded that, ultimately, Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience, as McCain has done throughout his campaign. Clark's retort, however, is what drew rebuke. In referring to McCain's military experience, he stated: [...] "Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president." [...] Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark's comment. However, Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as MoveOn.org and military veteran groups such as VoteVets.org; Obama ultimately stated that Clark's comments were [...] "inartful" [...] and were not intended to attack McCain's military service. In the days following the controversial interview, Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat. In each program, Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honors McCain's service, he has serious concerns about McCain's judgment in matters of national security policy, calling McCain [...] "untested and untried".|$|E
500|$|On October 24, Trump {{appeared}} on Meet the Press, where {{he announced that}} he would officially join the Reform Party. [...] During the interview, Trump questioned why a politician was better suited to be president than him, commenting [...] "I understand this stuff." [...] He said that the Republican Party has become [...] "too crazy right." [...] Notably, he identified Buchanan as a [...] "Hitler-lover" [...] and mused, [...] "I guess he's an anti-Semite [...] [...] [...] He doesn't like the blacks, he doesn't like the gays. [...] It's just incredible that anybody could embrace this guy." [...] As for his reputation as a womanizer, Trump said he would not run if he believed it would be an impediment. [...] The next day, Trump formally joined the Reform Party, changing his voter registration from Republican to Independence Party, the New York affiliate of the Reform Party. [...] On the same day, Buchanan announced that he too would leave the Republican Party to join with the Reform Party and attempt to obtain its presidential nomination. Buchanan said he refused to engage in a [...] "name-calling" [...] contest with Trump but made a thinly veiled attack against Trump's wealth, arguing, [...] "I don't believe the Reform Party nomination can be bought, and I don't believe the Presidency can be bought." [...] <b>On</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation,</b> Pat Choate, the Reform Party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, said Trump would [...] "make a good candidate," [...] but argued that Buchanan could challenge Trump [...] "on the merits" [...] and that Trump and the media were misrepresenting Buchanan's views through [...] "hate politics." [...] Other party members expressed reservations about Trump's comments and personal life. [...] Verney wondered [...] "what the compelling reason is for him to seek the presidency." [...] Trump acknowledged himself as [...] "certainly controversial" [...] but labeled himself as [...] "a great businessman," [...] who would [...] "make the greatest treaties that this country's seen in a long time." [...] On Fox News Sunday, he criticized U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and said that as president he himself would fill the position and negotiate trade deals with other countries. [...] He identified France, Japan, Germany, and Saudi Arabia as nations taking advantage of badly negotiated trade deals with the United States.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{appearance}} <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation,</b> Wasserman Schultz said, [...] "The Republicans {{have a plan}} to end Medicare as we know it. What they would do is they would take the people who are younger than 55 years old today and tell them, 'You know what? You're on your own. Go and find private health insurance in the health-care insurance market.. Four non-partisan fact-checkers called her claim false. She then came under criticism for her comments on Washington Watch with Roland Martin, in which she said, [...] "You have the Republicans, who want to literally drag us {{all the way back to}} Jim Crow laws and literally—and very transparently—block access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates". The next day, she stated that [...] "Jim Crow was the wrong analogy to use".|$|E
5000|$|On May 14, 1976, Schweiker told CBS Morning News that he {{believed}} the CIA and FBI lied to the Warren Commission. On June 27, 1976, he appeared <b>on</b> CBS' <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> {{and said that the}} Commission made a [...] "fatal mistake" [...] by relying on the CIA and FBI instead of using its own investigators. Schweiker also stated that he felt it was possible that the White House was involved in a cover-up.|$|R

2500|$|Huckabee echoed his {{statement}} {{when he appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> {{on the morning of}} August 12. [...] "We're in fact in the first tier, I think, by everybody's estimation, and here's why," [...] Huckabee told Jim Axelrod. [...] "It wasn't just that we surprised people with a second showing, it's that we did it with so few resources. I mean, this really was feeding the 5,000 with two fish and five loaves, an amazing kind of day for us." [...] Looking beyond Iowa, former Governor of South Carolina and Huckabee supporter David Beasley said that Huckabee is filling the void created by the lack of a social conservative in the race. He said that [...] "I really believe now that the conservative voters will begin to coalesce behind Mike Huckabee...and it's going to be infectious in New Hampshire and South Carolina" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 January 2012, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> that Iran was {{not trying}} to develop a nuclear weapon, but was trying to develop a nuclear capability. [...] He also urged Israel to work {{together}} rather than make a unilateral strike on Iran’s nuclear installations. On 1 August 2012, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta while in Israel said that the United States had [...] "options," [...] including military options, to prevent Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon, should diplomacy fail. [...] In 2012, sixteen U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, reported that Iran was pursuing research that could enable it to produce nuclear weapons, but was not attempting to do so. The senior officers of all of the major American intelligence agencies stated that there was no conclusive evidence that Iran has made any attempt to produce nuclear weapons since 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Republicans had {{nominated}} {{the conservative}} Goldwater, who shared Wallace's {{opposition to the}} Civil Rights Act {{on the basis of}} states' rights and found considerable support among southerners. This caused a precipitous drop in support for Wallace's threatened general election campaign, and on June 18, Wallace biographer Dan T. Carter notes that Goldwater gave [...] "a brief speech whichnbsp&— in substance if not tonenbsp&— could have been written by George Wallace." [...] By July 13, Gallup polls showed that Wallace support in a general election match-up had plummeted to below 3% outside the south. Even in the south, he polled third in a three-way race against Johnson and Goldwater. Goldwater reportedly welcomed Wallace's support but firmly refused him a spot as vice-presidential candidate. With a conservative already facing off against Johnson, Wallace stayed his nascent plans for a third-party run until the 1968 election, ending his campaign with an appearance <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> on July 19; however, he did not endorse Goldwater. In the general election, Goldwater repudiated Wallace and denied courting his vote, which Wallace took as a personal insult.|$|E
50|$|After {{announcing his}} {{campaign}} in Louisville, Kentucky, Paul {{embarked on a}} tour of four early states, which included stops in Milford, New Hampshire, Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, Iowa City, Iowa, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Each event also featured local testimonials and endorsements of Paul's candidacy, including several state legislators, and members of Congress. Following his four state tour, Paul appeared on several Sunday morning shows to discuss his candidacy, with interviews on Meet <b>the</b> Press <b>on</b> NBC, <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>on</b> CBS, and State of the Union on CNN.|$|R
25|$|Following {{several years}} as a stringer, in 1953 he joined CBS News {{as one of the}} {{recruits}} of Edward R. Murrow (becoming part of the later generation of Murrow's Boys). In 1955, with the post-Stalin thaw in the Soviet Union, he received accreditation to open a CBS bureau in Moscow. In June 1957, he obtained an exclusive interview with Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Communist party chief. It aired <b>on</b> CBS's <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation,</b> Schorr's first television interview. Schorr left the Soviet Union later that year, because of Soviet censorship laws. When he applied for a new visa, it was denied by the Soviets.|$|R
2500|$|Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) stated {{shortly after}} the {{meetings}} that [...] "I think, {{if you were to}} hold the vote today, she would not get a majority, either in the Judiciary Committee or on the floor." [...] However, Specter, the committee chairman, rejected the notion that Miers' nomination was shaky. He said that most senators were waiting for the hearings before making up their mind. [...] "There are no votes one way or another," [...] he said <b>on</b> CBS' <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation.</b> <b>On</b> October 19, 2005, Specter and Leahy announced their intent to begin confirmation hearings for Miers on November 7, 2005.|$|R
2500|$|Gingrich has {{frequently}} criticized {{what he termed}} [...] "judicial activism" [...] and in an appearance <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> in 2011 suggested that Congress should subpoena federal judges and force them to explain themselves before Congress. When host Bob Schieffer asked how he would force federal judges to comply with congressional subpoenas, Gingrich said he would send the U.S. Capitol Police or U.S. Marshals to arrest the judges and force them to testify. Gingrich's proposal drew criticism across the political spectrum. Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe (who described it as [...] "a frontal assault on {{the independence of the}} federal judiciary" [...] and [...] "one of the craziest and most obviously unconstitutional things the former Speaker has ever proposed"), prominent conservative lawyer Bruce Fein (who wrote that [...] "Gingrich unwittingly is proposing to overthrow the Constitution that he would be pledged to uphold and defend if elected"), and U.S. District Judge John L. Kane (who wrote that Gingrich's proposal would contravene {{the rule of law and}} the notion of judicial independence as set forth in Federalist No. 78). Eventual 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former Republican Attorneys General Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, conservative attorney Edward Whelan and the nonpartisan Justice at Stake group all criticized Gingrich's comments for similar reasons.|$|E

2500|$|On March 1, 2009 in {{response}} to a question <b>on</b> CBS's <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> as to who spoke for the Republican Party, President Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said it was Rush Limbaugh because [...] "whenever a Republican criticizes , they have to run back and apologize to him, and say they were misunderstood. He is the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party. And he has been upfront about what he views, and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for [...] failure. He said it. And I compliment him for his honesty, but that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} Youth parliament Pakistan {{serves as}} a useful forum to voice views of the Youth about a range of national and international issues. The debates in the Youth Parliament Pakistan are meant to not only help the young members in their personal development as a useful citizen, these also serve the purpose of articulating views of the youth <b>on</b> vital issues <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> and conveying these to the Government.|$|R
5000|$|While {{campaigning for}} the {{presidency}} in 2016, Trump reversed his earlier position, stating on several occasions that the U.S. would be [...] "so much better off" [...] or [...] "100% better off" [...] if Gaddafi remained in charge of Libya. At a Republican primary debate in February 2016, Trump claimed that he [...] "never discussed" [...] the Libyan intervention {{at the time it}} occurred; Politifact noted that this assertion was [...] "patently inaccurate" [...] and gave it its [...] "Pants on Fire" [...] rating. In June 2016, Trump again reversed course, saying <b>on</b> CBS' <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> that he would have supported [...] "surgical" [...] bombing, against Gaddafi in particular. However, during both an NBC presidential forum and a presidential debate in September 2016, Trump once again reversed his position, criticizing Hillary Clinton for her support for the 2011 military intervention.|$|R

5000|$|The Great Wen is a disparaging {{nickname}} for London. The term was coined in the 1820s by William Cobbett, the radical pamphleteer and champion of rural England. Cobbett saw {{the rapidly growing}} city as a pathological swelling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> (A [...] "wen" [...] is a sebaceous cyst.) The term is quoted in his 1830 work Rural Rides: [...] "But, {{what is to be}} the fate of the great wen of all?

2500|$|<b>On</b> CBS's <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation,</b> she {{declared}} Sarah Palin to be unready for the Vice Presidency. [...] "She knows nothing...Quite honestly, the interview I saw and that Americans saw on Thursday and Friday {{was similar to}} when I didn't read a book {{in high school and}} had to read the CliffsNotes and phone in my report", Wasserman Schultz said of Palin's interview with ABC's Charlie Gibson last week. [...] "She's Cliff-noted her performance so far." [...] Wasserman Schultz was also named a co-chair of the Democratic Party's Red to Blue congressional campaign group. Controversy arose in March 2008 when she announced that she would be unable to campaign against South Florida Republican representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Mario Diaz-Balart, and the now-retired Lincoln Diaz-Balart, because of her good friendship with them. Wasserman Schultz and Ros-Lehtinen (R–FL) are both on the LGBT Equality Caucus of which Wasserman Schultz was a Vice Chair. Ros-Lehtinen has been the sole Republican on the 112-member caucus since 2013.|$|R
2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{the commitment of}} more than 20,000 additional troops {{as a part of}} the Iraqi troop surge of 2007. McCain was a leading advocate for the move, leading some Democrats to call the policy the [...] "McCain Doctrine". Days after the announcement, McCain appeared <b>on</b> CBS' <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> and said, [...] "This is a chance under the new leadership of General Petraeus and Admiral Fallon to have a chance to succeed. Do I believe it can succeed? Yes, I do." [...] On February 4, he criticised a bipartisan non-binding resolution opposing the troop buildup, calling it a [...] "vote of no confidence" [...] in the US military. The next day, McCain said, [...] "I don't think it's appropriate to say that you disapprove of a mission and you don't want to fund it and you don't want it to go, but yet you don't take the action necessary to prevent it".|$|R
