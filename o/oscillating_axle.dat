5000|$|Crandall's {{father had}} begun selling baby {{carriages}} in the 1830s which were billed as [...] "the first baby carriages manufactured in America." [...] Jesse designed {{a tool to}} drill the ten evenly spaced holes in carriage wheels {{at the same time}} when he was only eleven years old. [...] Crandall was issued a number of patents for improvements and additions to the standard models. These included adding a brake to carriages, a model which folded, an <b>oscillating</b> <b>axle,</b> and designs for parasols and an umbrella hanger. An 1867 Crandall doll carriage model with a leather hood was once on display at the Museum of the City of New York. [...] As of October 2010, it was still in the Museum's collection.|$|E
5000|$|JLG {{electric-powered}} and engine-powered {{aerial work}} platforms {{are designed for}} a variety of job sites, such as steel mills and chemical plants, airports, convention centers, shipyards and heavy construction. There are models with lift heights ranging from 30 feet to 185 feet, the worlds tallest self-propelled aerial work platform. JLG’s exclusive QuikStik boom design delivers fast cycle speeds - 115 seconds from ground to elevation. In addition, JLG Ultra Series boom lifts come with the only <b>oscillating</b> <b>axle</b> in their boom class, providing enhanced mobility. The Ultra Booms also have full-time four-wheel drive for superior traction. In 2011, JLG introduced the award-winning 1500SJ, which is the first straight boom lift that takes workers to 150 feet without an oversized load permit (over weight permit is required for highway transportation).|$|E

A detailed analysis of problems and causes leading to a tractor overturn have revealed that by improving tractor’s static stability we can positively influence the safety as early as during the concept phase. We designed a mathematical model and a numerical simulation of the static stability of a tractor with an oscillating front axle in relation to its position on a slope. It was followed by analysing the changes of individual parameters, such as {{the position of the}} centre of gravity, the wheelbase, the wheel track width and the height of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>axle</b> mounting point, and their impact on tractor’s static stability in relation to its position on a slope. Results show that manipulating these parameters can significantly increase tractor’s static stability. A better static stability is directly proportional to improved dynamic stability, resulting in a better safety in a view of the tractor overturn, particularly while working on a sloping terrain...|$|E
5000|$|The vehicle had {{air-cooled}} four-cylinder OHC boxer-type {{engine of}} the SUV Type 82 with 2490 cc engine capacity and [...] The front-mounted engine drove through a single-disc dry clutch and a four-speed transmission with synchronized 3rd and 4th Gear to the rear wheels. The attainable speed was 90 km/h. The chassis had a central tube, a front axle with Transverse leaf spring and <b>oscillating</b> rear <b>axles,</b> also with a Transverse leaf spring.|$|R
