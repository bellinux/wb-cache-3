40|$|Being {{originally}} {{concentrated in}} the inner-city centre, tourism accommodation services have increasingly expanded in the last decades toward the semi-periphery and periphery of Rome. The tourism ‘sprawl’ is mostly the result of spontaneous decisions by firms and, partially, of deliberate urban planning strategies. Using historical data on the location of tourism attractions, hotels and <b>other</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>services,</b> the research aims at analysing and interpreting the spatial distribution of tourism within the city of Rome in association with a wider set of urban changes, including suburbanization, the evolution of mobility and gentrification. The aim is to evaluate the main drives of tourism decentralization {{and its impact on}} the centre and on the periphery and, finally, on urban tourism as a human experience...|$|E

In this study, the drivers of P 2 P <b>accommodation</b> <b>services</b> are examined in order to better understand consumer characteristics and behaviour. Based on a survey of Internet users in Finland, the major drivers affecting the use of P 2 P <b>accommodation</b> <b>services</b> are the age of consumers, active use of the Internet and online technologies, and the frequency of international travel.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>accommodation</b> <b>services</b> {{sector is}} a vital {{underpinning}} of the competitiveness of destinations in especially emerging tourism regions of the global economy. Within the environment of Africa building the competitiveness of countries as tourism destinations is inseparable from the challenge of establishing a network of different forms of accommodation at competitive prices and internationally acceptable quality standards. This paper uses a longitudinal approach to analyse {{the development of the}} <b>accommodation</b> <b>services</b> sector in one African country – Malawi – which is scaling up its tourism industry. Using historical evidence the objective is to examine the unfolding evolution of <b>accommodation</b> <b>services</b> as a factor in enhancing tourism destination competitiveness. The chequered pathway followed in Malawi to building the country’s network of hotels and small-scale accommodation establishments is traced from the colonial period to post-independence developments. It is argued that in understanding the historical evolution of <b>accommodation</b> <b>services</b> policy re-orientations have been significant drivers of change...|$|R
5|$|The {{budget of}} the series is {{estimated}} to be £15 million. Filming began in February 2013 and concluded in August 2013, with location shooting largely taken place in Kent and northern France. Filming in Kent was based in Discovery Park in Sandwich and was supported by the Kent Film Office. A former Pfizer facility was used as a number of sets, including the Calais police station and Elise's apartment. The series was filmed throughout five districts: Canterbury, Dover, Shepway, Swale and Thanet. Several prominent locales were featured, including Folkestone Harbour; The Turner Contemporary art gallery; Westwood Cross shopping centre; and the towns of Dover, Folkestone and Margate. Production also made use of the Kent Film Office's legal powers to close certain roads for uninterrupted filming. An estimated £2.5 million of the budget was spent on, among <b>other</b> <b>services,</b> <b>accommodation,</b> locations, parking and catering, providing a boost for the Kent economy. The filming in France was supported by the Nord-Pas de Calais Film Commission and benefited from the Tax Rebate International. Shooting took place over 31 days across Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais and Dunkerque.|$|R

50|$|The {{beginnings}} of Coast Shelter {{started with the}} Rumbalara Youth Refuge in Gosford, New South Wales. Rumbalara was built by Gosford City Council in 1985 and had a twofold purpose; four beds were for homeless youth and two beds were for students {{who were able to}} return home on weekends. Council also ran a service for homeless adults in a separate council property. In December 1991, due to funding restraints council was forced to close these programs, which led to Laurie Maher approaching Jim Grainger of the Catholic Church's Centacare Broken Bay to auspice the service. The move was approved by the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services. By 1992, within eight months of the change, Laurie, working as a volunteer, helped restructure the organisation, obtain additional funds and establish a new management committee. The service was able to be independently established as Gosford Emergency <b>Accommodation</b> <b>Services.</b> Over the years the service auspices other shelters in the Central Coast and were commissioned to run additional services. Today, the organisation operates nine refuges, a community centre and <b>other</b> <b>accommodation</b> properties.|$|R
