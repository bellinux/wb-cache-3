[...] Souter concluded that he would stand by the decisions made in Duro and Oliphant.|$|E

"The comedy {{routines}} in {{the early}} plays are maps to the themes and meaning of the plays as a whole.... <b>Our</b> <b>failure</b> to laugh may be an indication that we, the audience, have come to side (or have been taught to side) with the victim rather than the victimiser." ...|$|E

"Even as {{with the}} American {{rejection}} of the League of Nations, <b>our</b> <b>failure</b> {{to live up to}} our obligations to the United Nations is led by a handful of willful senators who choose to pursue their narrow, selfish political objectives at the cost of our nation’s conscience. They pander to and are supported by the Christian Coalition {{and the rest of the}} religious right wing. Their leader, Pat Robertson, has written that we should have a world government but only when the messiah arrives. Any attempt to achieve world order before that time must be the work of the Devil! Well join me... I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan." ...|$|E

2500|$|At this time, the Minister for Civil Aviation, the Honourable James Valentine Fairbairn, {{mentioned}} that the site was very suitable for training purposes, and directed that it be retained. Captain Johnston, who originally selected the site, also stated that it was suitable for instructional purposes. This decision is likely related to Fairbairn's attendance {{at a meeting in}} Ottawa in December 1939 in which the details of the Empire Air Training Scheme were concluded. Australia had declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, and the importance placed on the retention of Eagle Farm is reflected in Fairbairn's report to Prime Minister Menzies that the [...] "only activity that we have undertaken which could lead to the winning or losing of the war by <b>our</b> <b>failure</b> or success in carrying out our undertaking is the Empire Air Training Scheme".|$|E
2500|$|The {{opening of}} 1915 saw growing {{division}} between Lloyd George and Kitchener over {{the supply of}} munitions for the army. Lloyd George considered that a munitions department, under his control, was essential to co-ordinate [...] "the nation's entire engineering capacity". Kitchener favoured the continuance of the current arrangement whereby munitions were sourced through contracts between the War Office and the country's armaments manufacturers. As so often, Asquith sought compromise through committee, establishing a group to [...] "consider the much vexed question of putting the contracts for munitions on a proper footing". This did little to dampen press criticism and, on 20 April, Asquith sought to challenge his detractors in a major speech at Newcastle; [...] "I saw a statement {{the other day that}} the operations of our army were being crippled by <b>our</b> <b>failure</b> to provide the necessary ammunition. There is not a word of truth in that statement." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 263, Deng Ai, {{a general}} from Shu's rival state Cao Wei, led an army to attack Shu and {{showed up in}} Fu (涪; in present-day Mianyang, Sichuan) after taking a {{shortcut}} from Yinping (陰平; present-day Wen County, Longnan, Gansu). Zhuge Zhan led the Shu forces to Fu to resist the enemy but retreated to Mianzhu (緜竹) when he heard that the Shu vanguard had been defeated. Deng Ai sent a messenger to ask Zhuge Zhan to surrender, but Zhuge refused and executed the messenger. In the ensuing battle at Mianzhu, the Shu forces were defeated and both Zhuge Zhan and Zhuge Shang were killed in action. Before joining his father in battle, Zhuge Shang sighed, [...] "My father and I received grace from the State. <b>Our</b> <b>failure</b> to eliminate Huang Hao earlier on resulted in our State being stuck in this disastrous situation now.

40|$|Failure plays a {{key part}} in our {{professional}} and personal development, but traditionally {{many of us have}} been inclined to sweep <b>our</b> <b>failures</b> under the rug. Librarian and blogger Steven Bell posits that perhaps we are embarrassed at <b>our</b> <b>failures,</b> instead of recognizing that sharing our blunders can be an opportunity to celebrate our creativity (2010). Some brave souls are doing just that, such as the librarians who are sharing their failures through Twitter, using the hashtag #libraryfail. An enormously popular website has grown through shared failures, CakeWrecks ([URL] And a meme has been making the rounds on the internet for some time, titled “Nailed It,” in which people contrast their failed attempts at craft or baking projects with the original perfect creation...|$|R
2500|$|Maria {{occasionally}} {{played with}} her son, who remembered {{sitting on her}} lap when they slid {{down a flight of}} steps on a large silver tray. She also wrote an illustrated alphabet book for Lennart that was published in 1912. However, life at the Swedish court had as many restrictions on Maria Pavlovna as she had had in Russia. Her husband Wilhelm, as a naval officer, had little time to spend with her. She found him [...] "cold, shy, and neglectful", and when she tried to approach him he walked away from her in tears. [...] At the end of October 1911 the young couple was sent, on a five-month trip to Southeast Asia as representatives to the coronation of the King of Siam. Maria had an opportunity to meet other men. The King Vajiravudh and the Duke of Montpesier began to court her and she enjoyed the flirtation. Relations between the couple cooled even more. She told her husband she wanted a divorce. He was devastated by her decision, begging her to give their marriage another chance, [...] "but since he blamed most of <b>our</b> <b>failure</b> on me, we did not make any progress" [...] Maria wrote.|$|E

5000|$|Iestyn Davies, Head of Communications at the Arts Council of Wales, said: [...] "As {{a country}} {{renowned for its}} {{literary}} heritage it is fitting that Wales should have its own national poet, creating new works that celebrate our successes, comment on <b>our</b> <b>failures</b> and raise the profile of Wales through literature." ...|$|R

40|$|It will {{be clear}} from these sketchy {{examples}} that working {{out some of the}} implications of Piagetian theory for an educational program such as ours offers us a continuing challenge. The theory perhaps does more to console us for some of <b>our</b> <b>failures</b> as teachers than to tell us how <b>our</b> <b>failures</b> may be overcome, for if the fault is in the developmental level that our students have attained, then the fault is not in us. Our teaching, Piaget tells us, can play a role in fostering development, but only a fairly limited role. On the other hand if we accept the challenge, we can be more than teachers; we can be the designers of activities that allow students to engage in the spontaneous transformations of objects in thought that are the very essence of knowledge...|$|R
50|$|On 27 July 2012, the title, artwork, {{and track}} {{listing of the}} {{forthcoming}} 11th studio album, A Map of All <b>Our</b> <b>Failures,</b> was announced on the band's website.

60|$|Five {{miles through}} the woods, {{gradually}} descending, led us {{into an open}} plain {{where there was a}} grass-bordered pond full of ducks. Here appeared an opportunity to get some meat. R.C. tried with shotgun and I with rifle, all to no avail. These ducks were shy. Romer seemed to evince some disdain at <b>our</b> <b>failure,</b> but he did not voice his feelings. We found some wild-turkey tracks, and a few feathers, which put our hopes high.|$|E
30|$|Further {{improvements}} in our success rates {{may be possible}} {{with the use of}} longer hysteroscopes.

60|$|Presently I saw the ten battleships {{that had}} been ordered to hold the shaft of Omean. They were {{returning}} at full speed, firing their stern batteries almost continuously. There could be but one explanation. They were being pursued by another hostile fleet. Well, the situation could be no worse. The expedition already was doomed. No man that had embarked upon it would return across that dreary ice cap. How I wished that I might face Zat Arrras with my longsword for just an instant before I died! It was he who had caused <b>our</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And what is <b>our</b> <b>failure</b> {{here but}} a triumph's {{evidence}} [...] For the fulness of the days? Have we withered or agonized? Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence? [...] Why rushed the discords in but that harmony should be prized? Sorrow {{is hard to}} bear, and doubt is slow to clear, [...] Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe: But God has {{a few of us}} whom He whispers in the ear; [...] The rest may reason and welcome; 'tis we musicians know.|$|E
6000|$|Hartman and I {{agreed that}} it was useless to report {{ourselves}} to the local chiefs of the secret service. <b>Our</b> <b>failure</b> so to report would be excused, we knew, in the light of subsequent events. So we headed for the great labor-ghetto on the South Side in the hope of getting in contact with some of the comrades. Too late! We knew it. But we could not stand still and do nothing in those ghastly, silent streets. Where was Ernest? I was wondering. What was happening in the cities of the labor castes and Mercenaries? In the fortresses? ...|$|E
60|$|Yea, {{that which}} maketh Launcelot so {{singularly}} dear {{to all the}} world, {{is that he was}} not different from other men, but like other men, both in his virtues and his shortcomings; only that he was more strong and more brave and more untiring than {{those of us who are}} his brethren, both in our endeavors and in <b>our</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|R
2500|$|As Peter Coyote {{wrote in}} 1998, “It was not J.P.’s music, his adventurous spirit, {{his quest to}} live free and improvisationally, his fascination with “stuff”, nor mine, which exacted these exorbitant costs, it was drugs and <b>our</b> <b>failures</b> of {{character}} and will to refuse them.
