5|$|An {{examination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> stains {{found inside}} 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett {{had been attacked}} in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E
5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E

Spectral analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simulated <b>blood,</b> a thixotropic gel of iron hydroxide (FeO(OH)), shows the absorption spectrum {{to be similar to}} old blood. Many reported characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy <b>blood</b> can be explained by <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> a thixotropic gel. Modifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preparation procedure are attempted to bring the simulation into agreement with fourteenth century alchemical knowledge.

5|$|Copper is {{essential}} to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral {{because it is a}} key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence {{have suggested that the}} blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs.|$|E

5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also {{have a number of}} other functions. They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E

5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates {{following}} interruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and has been documented {{in a variety of}} other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E

5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless.

5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E

Testing may {{be more or less}} extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.|$|E
5000|$|Hemophilia is {{a genetic}} illness that causes {{dysfunction}} in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood's</b> clotting mechanisms.
