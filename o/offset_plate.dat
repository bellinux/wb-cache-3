5000|$|The inking and {{dampening}} systems deliver ink {{and water}} onto the <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> covering the plate cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Indirect {{dampening}} systems (or integrated dampening systems) {{feed the}} water directly {{into one of}} the ink form rollers (ink rollers that touch the <b>offset</b> <b>plate)</b> via a water form roller in contact with it. These systems are known as [...] "indirect" [...] since the water travels to the <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> passing through the inking system and not directly to the <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> as direct systems do. Some indirect systems will have the ability to feed the water into the inking system {{as well as to the}} <b>offset</b> <b>plate.</b> A fine emulsion of ink and water is then developed on the ink form roller. This is one reason printers need to know about [...] "water pickup" [...] or what percentage of water can be taken up by the ink. These systems are also known as [...] "integrated" [...] dampening systems as they are integrated into the inking system. One of the benefits of these systems, is that they do not use covers thus they react more quickly when dampening changes are made. One generally finds this type of dampening systems on newer and faster press equipment today.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{dampening}} systems {{employ a}} water fountain roller which {{picks up the}} water from the water fountain. The water is then passed to a water distribution roller. From here the water is transferred to the <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> via one or two water form rollers.|$|E

40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, bush, pin and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are press fitted with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an <b>offset</b> <b>plate,</b> the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an <b>offset</b> <b>plate.</b> The holes in the <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape chain plate. A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the chain plate as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations. In this context the transmission photoelastic technique has made it possible to identify the stress distribution, its concentration and also to quantify the stress and strain [2 - 3] at any point in the chain plate. This paper explains how transmission photoelastic technique is used to estimate the stress distribution and its concentration zones in a complex chain plate when it isloaded. An epoxy chain plate model was made through the casting method using a Perspex mould [2 - 3]. A loading fixture was used to load the model during stress freezing in the furnace. The integrated fringe pattern of the offset chain plate is shown in Figure 2. Slices are cut in the offset zone to understand the nature of the stress distribution. A Simple photoelastic analysis of this has revealed a wealth of information to take suitable decision on the design of such plates taking into account the constraints in manufacturing...|$|E

40|$|An air Brayton solar {{receiver}} (ABSR) is discussed. The ABSR {{consists of}} a cylindrical, insulated, <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> fin heat exchanger which is mounted at the focal plane of a fully tracking parabolic solar collector. The receiver transfer heat from the concentrated solar radiation (which impinges on the inside walls of the heat exchanger) to the working fluid i. e., air. The hot air would then e used to drive a small Brayton cycle heat engine. The engine in turn drives a generator which produces electrical energy. Symmetrical and asymmetrical solar power input into the ABSR are analyzed. The symmetrical cases involve the baseline incident flux and the axially shifted incident fluxes. The asymmetrical cases correspond to the solar fluxes that are obtained by reduced solar input from {{one half of the}} concentrator or by receiver offset of plus or minus 1 inch from the concentrator optical axis...|$|E
40|$|Plate fin heat exchangers, {{because of}} their compactness, low weight and high {{effectiveness}} are widely used in aerospace and cryogenic applications. This device is made of a stack of corrugated fins alternating with nearly equal number of flat separators known as parting sheets, bonded {{together to form a}} monolithic block. Appropriate headers are welded to provide the necessary interface with the inlet and the exit streams. While aluminum is the most commonly used material, stainless steel construction is employed in high pressure and high temperature applications. The performance of a plate fin heat exchanger is determined, among other things, by the geometry of the fins. The most common fin configurations are - (1) plain (straight and uninterrupted) rectangular or trapezoidal fins (2) uninterrupted wavy fins and (3) interrupted fins such as offset strip, louver and perforated fins. The interrupted surfaces provide greater heat transfer at the cost of higher flow impedance. Here I have designed rectangular <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> fin heat exchanger. I have assumed some data and based on them I have designed heat exchanger. The flowing fluid in heat exchanger is liquid nitrogen and material of heat exchanger is Al. After designing the heat exchanger, rating is also necessary. The heat transfer and flow friction characteristics of plate fin surfaces are presented in terms of the Colburn factor j and the Fanning friction factor f vs. Reynolds number Re, the relationships being different for different surfaces. The laminar flow model under predicts j and f values at high Reynolds number, while the 2 -Layer k-e turbulence model over predicts the data throughout the range of interest. Because most industrial heat exchangers operate with Re less than 3000, and because the j and f data predicted by the laminar and the 2 -layer k-e turbulence model differ little from each other at low Reynolds numbers, we have used the laminar flow model up to Reynolds number of 10, 000, which is considered to be the limit for plate fin heat exchangers operating with gases. Velocity, pressure and temperature fields have been computed and j and f factors determined over appropriate range of Reynolds number and geometric dimensions. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the grouping of book covers on <b>offset</b> <b>plates</b> in order to minimize the total production cost. The mathematical formulation of the problem involves both binary and continuous variables. As exact methods are unable to provide solutions in reasonable time, a heuristic algorithm of the simulated annealing type is proposed. At each iteration, the values of the current solution binary variables are altered in order to yield a neighboring solution. To compute the corresponding values of the continuous variables and the value of the objective function, a linear programming routine is called at each iteration. This constitutes the main originality of the present approach and is in principle applicable in mixed integer programming problems. The procedure is tested on several examples...|$|R

40|$|Background We {{report a}} study {{conducted}} in a realistic dining environment, in which two groups of diners were served the same three-course meal. The presentation of the starter (centred vs. <b>offset</b> <b>plating),</b> the type of cutlery used for the main course, and the shape and colour of the plate on which that dessert was served were varied. Results The results revealed that the weight and type of the cutlery exerted {{a significant impact on}} how artistically plated the main course was rated as being, how much the diners liked the food, and how much they would have been willing to pay for it. The change in the shape and colour of the plate also affected the diners’ liking for the dessert. Conclusions Taken together, these results show that the diners’ appreciation of the food is affected by the type of the cutlery used to eat (in this case, knife and fork), in terms of liking, aesthetic value, and willingness to pay for the food, adding to a growing body of gastrophysics research highlighting the importance of food-extrinsic factors in modulating the diner’s opinion of the meal that they have been served...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} produce nanophotonic {{elements}} for smart packaging, we investigated {{the influence of the}} parameters of screen and <b>offset</b> gravure printing <b>plates</b> on features of printed application of coatings with nanophotonic components and on parameters of their photoluminescence.

The obtained analytical dependencies were used to confirm the explanation of the processes that occur during the fabrication of nanophotonic coverings with <b>offset</b> gravure printing <b>plates.</b> As a result of experimental studies, it was determined that the different character of the dependency of total luminescence intensity of nanophotonic elements from the percentage of a pad is explained by the use of different types of <b>offset</b> gravure printing <b>plates,</b> where the size of raster points remains constant in one case and changes in the other case, while the depth of the printing elements accordingly changes or remains constant.

40|$|Q. Can I use my X-Rite {{densitometer}} {{to verify}} dot area on printing plates {{before going to}} press? A. Yes. Your densitometer {{can be used to}} measure, correct, and control your plate imaging process. To {{get the most out of}} using your densitometer in this way, consider the following factors. The Densitometer’s Forte The first thing to keep in mind is that, color reflection densitometers are designed to read the amount of incident light absorbed by a photograph, press sheet or off-press proof. As a result, these densitometers are designed to accurately measure Black, Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow colorants on a substrate like paper. YES YOU CAN! X-Rite has successfully measured dot area from exposed and processed lithographic <b>offset</b> <b>plates</b> – conventional and digital alike. In addition, comparisons made by leading plate manufacturers have found X-Rite densitometers to be doubly useful. In addition to measuring a variety of plate materials with consistent and reliable results, these manufacturers have used the same instruments to also measure their proofs and press sheets. <b>Offset</b> lithographic <b>plates,</b> however, do not usually have cyan, magenta, yellow, or black images on a white substrate. Instead, the plate material is usually brushed aluminum with a gray color. The color of the image area varies with the plate type and manufacturer; typical colors include green, pink, brown, black and blue. Polyester-based digital plates are nearly the inverse of ink on paper—a near-white image on a flat black sustrate. These color properties introduce unique issues that arise when the plates are evaluated using densitometers. Contrast As a result of plate color properties, the contrast between the image and non-image areas of the plate may be less than ideal. Plate contrast is typically less than half that of ink on paper. In fact, some plate materials do not exhibit enough color difference between image and non-image areas. As a result, the densitometer may not be able to calculate the exact dot area imaged...|$|R
