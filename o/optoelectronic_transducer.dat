30|$|Native diatoms made of {{amorphous}} silica are first converted into silicon structures via magnesiothermic process, preserving the original shape: electron force microscopy {{analysis performed on}} silicon-converted diatoms demonstrates their semiconductor behavior. Wet surface chemical treatments are then performed {{in order to enhance}} the photoluminescence emission from the resulting silicon diatoms and, at the same time, to allow the immobilization of biological probes, namely proteins and antibodies, via silanization. We demonstrate that light emission from semiconductive silicon diatoms can be used for antibody-antigen recognition, endorsing this material as <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>transducer.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} a portable bioanalytical device which was capable for real-time monitoring of binding assays was demonstrated. The device was based on arrays of nine <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>transducers</b> monolithically integrated on silicon chips. The optocouplers consisted of nine silicon avalanche diodes self-aligned to nine silicon nitride waveguides all converging to a single silicon detector. The waveguides were biofunctionalized by appropriate recognition molecules. Integrated thick polymer microchannels provided the necessary fluidic functions to the chip. A single sided direct contact scheme through a board-to-board receptacle was developed and combined with a portable customized readout and control instrument. Real-time detection of deleterious mutations in BRCA 1 gene related to predisposition to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer was performed with the instrument developed using PCR products. Detection was based on waveguided photons elimination through inte raction with fluorescently labeled PCR products. Detection of single biomolecular binding events was also demonstrated using nanoparticles as labels. In addition, label-free monitoring of bioreactions in real time was achieved by exploiting wavelength filtering on photonic crystal engineered waveguides. The proposed miniaturized sensing device with proper packaging and accompanied by a portable instrument can find wide application as a platform for reliable and cost effective point-of-care diagnosis...|$|R

The space-time development of lightning in gaps was recorded by a motion picture camera and an <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>transducer.</b> The electric field at different points in the gap was measured using a Pockels device both in the leader stage and in the stage of the return stroke. Experimental results of the streamer zone length measurements in the gaps with lengths up to 65 meters are presented.

40|$|An optical {{real-time}} affinity biosensor, {{which is}} based on a monolithic silicon <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>transducer</b> and a microfluidic module, is described. The transducer monolithically integrates silicon avalanche diodes as light sources, silicon nitride optical fibers, and p/n junction detectors and efficiently intercouples these elements through a self-alignment technique. The transducer surface is hydrophilized by oxygen plasma treatment, silanized with (3 -aminopropyl) triethoxysilane and bioactivated through adsorption of the biomolecular probes. The use of a microfluidic module allows real-time monitoring of the binding reaction of the gold nanoparticle-labeled analytes with the immobilized probes. Their binding within the evanescent field at the surface of the optical fiber causes attenuated total reflection of the waveguided modes and reduction of the detector photocurrent. The biotin-streptavidin model assay was used for the evaluation of the analytical potentials of the device developed. Detection limits of 3. 8 and 13 pM in terms of gold nanoparticle-labeled streptavidin were achieved for continuous- and stopped-flow assay modes, respectively. The detection sensitivity was improved by silver plating of the immolilized gold nanoparticles, and a detection limit of 20 fM was obtained after 20 -min of silver plating. In addition, two different analytes, streptavidin and anti-mouse IgG, were simultaneously assayed on the same chip demonstrating the multianalyte potential of the sensor developed...|$|E
40|$|Performed in {{this work}} is a {{comprehensive}} theoretical computer analysis of performances inherent to two types of multichannel optical rotary connectors (ORC) of compensation operation based on mirror and prismatic compensators. This analysis relies on exact analytical expressions obtained for light ray paths in ORC models with a mirror compensator made {{in the form of}} bilateral mirror placed between two optical hemispheres and with prismatic compensator made in the form of Dove prism placed between two non-aberrational elliptic lenses. Found in ORC with the mirror compensator is the essential deficiency inherent to all these constructions, which is related with considerable rotary oscillations in the value of optical signals in mirror angular positions when the mirror halves the input light beam. In these mirror positions, the amplitude value of optical signal oscillations exceeds 95 %, and optical losses are higher than – 13 dB, when the rotor turns. One deficiency more in these constructions is also strict technical requirements to the accuracy of making the optical components and mechanisms at the level of 1 … 2 µm. Concerning the ORC construction with a prismatic compensator as well as collimator and focusing lenses common for all the channels, one should note the inadmissibly high optical losses of the signal value (higher than – 30 … 40 dB) in the case of construction with fiber-optic interfaces, and large dimensions and mass in the case of active construction with <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>transducers</b> at the inputs and outputs of ORC. For example, when the number of channels N = 10 the longitudinal dimension of optical transfer channel (prism and lenses) exceeds 300 mm, and this dimension increases with increasing the number of channels. When this dimension is lower than 100 mm, the facility can be equipped with only one optical communication channel containing one LED and one photodiode located on the rotation axis. Optical losses in these constructions cannot be also considered as the satisfactory ones, since the respective loss value is higher than – 18 dB for the number of channels N = 10...|$|R

40|$|Meсhanoluminescent sensor is a {{solid-state}} <b>optoelectronic</b> light-generating pressure <b>transducer,</b> which directly converts mechanical impulse into optical signal. Such sensors can {{be integrated}} into systems with fiber-optical lines, the latter being intensively used in an environment with intensive electromagnetic interference and high explosive danger. There is a proposal to use mechanoluminescent sensors in the robot tactile sensing systems {{that are used in}} extreme operating conditions. Mechanoluminescent sensor-based grippers are capable of providing information about the presence of the manipulation object, its shape and size, as well as its holding force. An informative sensor output signal is converted and processed according to a specific algorithm, which is based on a mathematical model of mechanoluminescence. The mechanoluminescence effect displays itself when luminescent centers interact with the moving dislocations accompanying the deformation process. The proposed mathematical model describes the mechanoluminescence effect for different luminescent centers, activating mechanoluminescent material – belonging to intracenter and recombination type. The model allows us to calculate the output optical signal parameters of the sensor depending on the parameters of input dynamic pressure. A range of the input pressures corresponding to the maximum values of the mechanoluminescent sensor signal was determined by simulation. The most intense signal is observed in case of a pulse load. The proposed mathematical model can be used in evaluation of the reverse transformation that is to determine the parameters of the input mechanical impulse corresponding to the output optical signal of mechanoluminescent sensor...|$|R
40|$|ZnO {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important multifunctional materials. Its properties are well known and confirmed in different application areas such as: gas sensors, UV lasers, solar cells, electroluminescent and <b>optoelectronic</b> devices, piezoelectric <b>transducers,</b> hydrogen-storages, rubber industry and plastic processing, cosmetics and pharmacy, and it is also used as an antibacterial agent. In this work, we propose a low-temperature hydrothermal method for the synthesis of phase-pure ZnO powders with a controlled morphology and narrow particle size distribution. This simple and low-cost method allows tailoring of the shape and size of ZnO particles, from micro-rods via hexagonal prism-like to nano-spheres, by choosing the appropriate pH of the reaction solution, tuned by the varying of [Na+]:[Zn 2 +] molar ratio. The agglomeration of the powders was prevented with the assistance of PVP as a capping agent. The synthesized powders were characterized by XRD, TEM, SEAD and HRTEM methods to examine the phase purity and crystallinity. FE-SEM measurements were used for the morphology characterization, while the results of Raman and UV-Vis DRS measurements were used for the study of optical properties. The relationship between the particle size and morphology and the optical properties is discussed. Diffuse reflectance spectra of ZnO powders with different size and morphology revealed characteristic R curves with the absorption edge near 380 nm, but with obvious difference in the absorption in the visible region. The micro-sized powder ZnO 8 revealed the lowest reflectance (∼ 70 %), compared to submicro- (∼ 80 %) and nano-sized (ZnO 12 and ZnO 13, ∼ 90 %) powders. Thus, the reflectance of the ZnO powders decreases with the increase in the average particle size...|$|R
