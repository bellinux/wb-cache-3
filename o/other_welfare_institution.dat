30|$|Historically speaking, both {{countries}} share {{a commitment to}} comprehensive public schooling. The notion of a public, egalitarian school encompassing all strata of society is a fundamental tool to reduce the effect of socioeconomic inequalities on citizen’s education, professional careers, and political participation. The classic social democratic comprehensive school model, developed in tandem with <b>other</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> in the ‘golden decades’ of social reformism (roughly late 1940 s to the early 1970 s), puts emphasis on creating equal opportunities, a sense of national and social unity, and the democratic skills and knowledge required to effectively participate in democratic decision-making (Telhaug, Mediås, & Aasen, 2006). In both Denmark and Sweden, public schools were modelled to reduce class conflict and inequalities, not to bridge or bond ethno-religious differences.|$|R

In 1938, it was separated into two schools, as had been done for white children: the School for the Blind and the School for the Deaf. That year, superintendent Dr. J.S. Clark was succeeded by his son, Dr. Felton G. Clark, at the School for the Deaf. In 1978, state of Louisiana merged the Southern School for the Deaf with LSD. Black students were relocated to the Mayflower Campus (North Campus). They occupied this area until 1985, and completion of more of the new buildings on what is now described as the South Campus on Brightside Lane, south of Louisiana State University.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This exploratory study of 40 re-married couples and their children was begun in June 1977. Couples {{in the study were}} interviewed three times. Preliminary analysis demonstrated that material from such structured interviews provided an important source of information about the experience of re-marriage and subsequent family life. Recordings and interview transcripts derived from 62 interviews were created. Detailed analysis of the interview data focuses on: partner's comparison and evaluation of first and subsequent marriage; the effects of continuing relationships with ex-partners and non-custodial parents on the married couple and their new family; experience of public interest and control though legal institutions; <b>other</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> and social work; beliefs about blood-ties and step-relationships within the wider kin network; attempts to recreate 'normal' family life. Main Topics : Stepfamilies; family life; divorce; marriage; step-parents; children; child care; household budgets; friends; kinship; social work; social welfare; family law. <br...|$|R
50|$|Once it was {{established}} that a health problem {{could not be}} treated adequately at a center, patients were directed to hospitals, either to one of about thirty local hospitals {{with some degree of}} specialization, or to one of about twenty hospitals, five of which were university teaching hospitals, that could offer highly specialized care. In addition, there were institutions with a single concern, such as the sixty psychiatric hospitals, and others that dealt with orthopedics, epilepsy, rheumatism, or plastic surgery. Given the great drop in the incidence of tuberculosis in Finland, the country's dozen sanatoria were gradually being taken over for other purposes. Hospitals were usually operated by federations of municipalities, as their maintenance was beyond the power of most single municipalities. By the mid-1980s, the country's public hospitals had about 50,000 beds, and its 40-odd private hospitals had roughly 3,000. There were another 20,000 beds for patients at health centers, homes for the elderly, and <b>other</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions.</b>|$|R

This study examined the process of development of social <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> in Japan, Korea, and the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China. As a research methodology, both quantitative longitudinal research method and qualitative case studies were used. ^ The results of empirical study concerning the role of industrialization economic development presented a counter-argument to the notion of automatically positive correlations between economic growth and industrialization, and social welfare development. Most of the evidence suggested that the levels of industrialization and economic development were necessary but not an immediate determinant of social <b>welfare</b> <b>institution</b> development in East Asian countries. ^ Strong kinship network and filial piety have made family status quite stable during the periods of rapid industrialization and economic development in East Asian countries. The effect of this culture for the development of social <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> in East Asian countries was to postpone the enactment of social welfare legislation dealing with social problems such as the aged and industrial risks. ^ It was also found that the level of development of social <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> in Japan and Korea is low because conservative parties in the two countries wield strong influence in national socio-political scenario. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{illuminate}} how child <b>welfare</b> <b>institution</b> {{workers can}} help unaccompanied minors process traumas, and how clinical psychologists can contribute through guidance. A semi structured interview with workers in Child <b>Welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> was undertaken {{to answer the}} above questions. Through a thematic analysis, there were seven themes that occurred as main focus: The relationship with the minor, prerequisites for trauma processing, trauma processing, culture, sleep, how guidance can help and what they missed in guidance.

Other important aspects considering trauma processing was to be culture sensitive and a focus on sleep. The guidance from the clinical psychologist seemed to be helpful by giving support and a new perspective. It was also useful for getting knowledge about trauma and culture. Some informants missed a focus on how their work affected their own feelings and wanted more concrete advices. The {{results indicate that the}} child <b>welfare</b> <b>institution</b> workers contribute greatly to processing of trauma. They can also facilitate clinical treatment. It is not a substitute for psychological treatment but can be complementary. Guidance from a clinical psychologist can be useful and can also be an effective way to spread knowledge and advice for trauma processing. It can also be valuable for emotional support...|$|R
