5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury <b>or</b> <b>damage,</b> {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on August 11 and gradually organized. The next day, an atmospheric circulation developed. Based on this, this system {{was classified as}} Tropical Depression Nine on August 13. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hilary. The system gradually accelerated to the northwest and reached its peak strength on August 15 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It became a depression on August 16, turned {{a little bit more}} westward, and dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death <b>or</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted {{for a few more}} days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to the surroundings.|$|E

5|$|Hence, {{weakness}} of shrug {{on one side}} and head-turning on the other side may indicate damage to the accessory nerve {{on the side of the}} shrug weakness, <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> along the nerve pathway at the other side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch {{due to the}} large influx of people expected during the holiday weekend. As such, {{there was a significant}} drop in tourism, although no significantly adverse weather occurred along the Outer Banks. High waves and some minor beach erosion was reported, but there were no deaths, injuries, <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> from Ella. By the time the hurricane passed Newfoundland, the strongest winds were to the southeast of the center, and as a result, no significant impact was reported on Canada.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two ships}} {{recorded}} tropical storm-force winds, {{both of which}} were away from the center. Some higher surf was recorded along the New Jersey coastline. In September 2001, two men sought to break the record for sailing the quickest time from New York City to Melbourne, Australia; Humberto disrupted their early path slightly, but they ultimately broke the record by 28 hours. Later in its path, there were several marine warnings issued for offshore Newfoundland, although no severe weather affected coastal Atlantic Canada. Overall, there were no reports of casualties <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> from the hurricane.|$|E
