40|$|Griffonia simplicifolia leaf lectin II (GSII), a plant defense protein against certain insects, {{consists}} of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) -binding large subunit with a small subunit having sequence homology to class III chitinases. Much of the insecticidal activity of GSII is attributable to the large lectin subunit, because bacterially expressed recombinant large subunit (rGSII) inhibited growth {{and development of the}} <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid,</b> Callosobruchus maculatus (F). Site-specific mutations were introduced into rGSII to generate proteins with altered GlcNAc binding, and the different rGSII proteins were evaluated for insecticidal activity when added to the diet of the <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid.</b> At pH 5. 5, close to the physiological pH of the <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> midgut lumen, rGSII recombinant proteins were categorized as having high (rGSII, rGSII-Y 134 F, and rGSII-N 196 D mutant proteins), low (rGSII-N 136 D), or no (rGSII-D 88 N, rGSII-Y 134 G, rGSII-Y 134 D, and rGSII-N 136 Q) GlcNAc-binding activity. Insecticidal activity of the recombinant proteins correlated with their GlcNAc-binding activity. Furthermore, insecticidal activity correlated with the resistance to proteolytic degradation by <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> midgut extracts and with GlcNAc-specific binding to the insect digestive tract. Together, these results establish that insecticidal activity of GSII is functionally linked to carbohydrate binding, presumably to the midgut epithelium or the peritrophic matrix, and to biochemical stability of the protein to digestive proteolysis...|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{resistant}} {{plant varieties}} with multiple resistance factors against insects {{rather than a}} single resistance factor {{may result in a}} broader spectrum of insecticidal activity, a higher level of protection, and an increase in the useful life of the resistant varieties. Given that genetic engineering may be used to introduce multiple resistance genes into a crop plant, the possible interactions of two or more anti-insect dietary proteins fed in the artificial diet of <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> (Callosobruchus maculatus) were investigated. The anti-insect dietary protein that was tested in combination with other anti-insect dietary proteins was a soyacystatin N (scN). scN is a cysteine proteinase inhibitor, an inhibitor of one of major enzymes in the midgut of <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> larvae. ^ Combinations of scN and E- 64 (another cysteine proteinase inhibitor with a known toxic effect on C. maculatus) were synergistic when fed to <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchids.</b> Similar results were observed using combinations of scN together with inhibitors of different mechanistic classes of proteinases, e. g., Kunitz inhibitor, a serine proteinase inhibitor, and pepstatin A, an aspartyl proteinase inhibitor. Mixtures of scN and wheat alpha-amylase inhibitor were synergistic, while scN mixed with GS II lectin was not. The results of these experiments indicated that not all of combinations of resistance factors will have additive or synergistic effects on suppressing the development of the <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid.</b> ^ The mechanism of the synergism was investigated using SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The synergistic effect appears to be related to protection of the protein toxin against degradation by digestive cysteine proteinases and/or aspartyl proteinases in the bruchid midguts. These results confirmed another function of major proteinases in the gut of <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> larvae. They serve not only to release free amino acids from dietary proteins, but also have a defensive role in helping reduce the concentration of a toxic dietary proteins. ...|$|R

The plant wood ash, powder and latex were tested at rate 2 g/ 20 g of cowpea seeds. Adult mortality and adult emergence of the insect were investigated. Result showed that wood ash of J. carcus evoked 100 % mortality of adult <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> after 4 days of application. This is followed by powder of J. carcus which caused 92. 5 % mortality while powder of J. gossypifolia was the least effective that caused 90 % mortality of adult bruchids. There was no adult emergence in seeds treated with wood ash and latex of both J. carcus and J. gossypifolia compared with untreated that had 81. 1 % adult emergence. The result obtained from this study revealed that J. carcus and J. gossypifolia wood ash and latex were effective in controlling C. maculatus and could serve {{as an alternative to}} synthetic insecticides for the protection of stored <b>cowpea</b> against <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> for the poor resource farmers in developing countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Under {{challenge}} by a dietary soybean cysteine protease inhibitor (scN), <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchids</b> overcome the inhibitory effects by reconfiguring the expression profiles of their major digestive enzymes, the cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases (CmCPs). In addition, <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchids</b> activate transcription of the counter-defensive cathepsin B-like cysteine protease (CmCatB). I undertook {{an interest in}} understanding the molecular mechanisms utilized by bruchids to differentially regulate cysteine proteases in response to plant inhibitors. First, to investigate the functional significance of the differential regulation of CmCPs, I expressed CmCP proprotein isoforms (proCmCPs) in E. coli, and characterized their activities. Among proCmCPs, proCmCPB 1 exhibited the most efficient autocatalytic processing, the highest proteolytic activity, {{and was able to}} degrade scN in the presence of excessive CmCPB 1. Second, to dissect the molecular mechanisms behind the differential function of CmCPs, I swapped domains between two representative subfamily members B 1 and A 16. Swapping the propeptides did not qualitatively alter autoprocessing in either protease isoform. Incorporation of either the N- or C-terminal mature B 1 segment into A 16, however, was sufficient to prime autoprocessing of A 16. Bacterially expressed isolated propeptides (pA 16 and pB 1) showed that pB 1 inhibited B 1 enzyme less than pA 16 due to its protein instability. Taken together, these results suggest that <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchids</b> selectively induce specific cysteine proteases for their superior autoprocessing, proteolytic efficacy, and scNdegrading activities, and modulate proteolysis of their digestive enzymes by controlling cleavage and stability of propeptides to cope with plant inhibitors. Third, to understand the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of CmCatB hyperexpression that underlies bruchid adaptation, I cloned a portion of its promoter and demonstrated its activity in Drosophila S 2 cells using a CAT reporter system. Gel shift assays identified <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> Seven-up (CmSvp, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor homolog) in scN-unadapted insect midgut, and <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> HNF- 4 (CmHNF- 4, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4) in scN-adapted insect midgut. When transiently expressed in S 2 cells, CmSvp repressed, while CmHNF- 4 activated CmCatB expression. CmSvp antagonized CmHNF- 4 -mediated transactivation when they were present simultaneously in the cell. Thus, the data suggest that transcriptional regulation of CmCatB in response to plant inhibitor depends, at least partly, on the cellular balance between positive and negative regulators...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} {{interaction}} between plants and insects I performed the experiments {{to find out the}} counter-defense mechanism of insects when insects were attacked by the defense protein of plants. Jasmonate (JA) {{is one of the most}} important plant hormones that is involved in plant defense mechanism. I studied to find out the components of JA signal transduction by T-DNA insertion mutant screening. In the first study, transcriptional regulation in <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> guts during adaptation to a plant defense protease inhibitor, <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid,</b> when fed on a diet containing the soybean cysteine protease inhibitor soyacystatin N (scN), activates an array of counter-defense genes to adapt to the negative effects of the inhibitor and regain its normal rate of feeding and development. A collection of 1, 920 cDNAs was obtained by differential subtraction with cDNAs prepared from guts of the 4 th instar larvae of scNadapted (reared on scN-containing diet) and scN-unadapted (reared on regular scN-free diet) <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchids.</b> Subsequent expression profiling using DNA microarray and northern blot analyses identified 94 transcript species from this collection that are responsive to dietary scN. The full-length cDNA of an scN-inducible cathepsin B-like cysteine protease was obtained. Its transcriptional response to scN during larval development contrasts with the pattern of the cathepsin L family, the major digestive enzymes. These results suggest cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases may play a crucial role in <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> adaptation to dietary scN. In the second study, screening of mutants that are altered in jasmonate-regulated signal transduction pathways using Arabidopsis thaliana was performed. Mutant screening strategy using T-DNA insertion mutagenesis and AVP-LUC as a reporter enabled to find JA-signal transduction mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, 9 underregulated mutants and 6 over-regulated mutants. 20 B 15 showed reduced VSP 1, THI 2. 1 expression and increased PDF 1. 2 expression as compared to wild type when treated with JA. These data strongly suggested that 20 B 15 is a JA signaling mutant. 49 R 1, 49 R 2 and 49 R 3 had same T-DNA insertion site (At 1 g 53540) and showed about 10 -fold higher AVP-LUC expression level than wild type when JA was treated.

How sub-lethal applications {{of this method}} affects the reproductive fitness of target pests, however, is still not fully understood. We examined how low levels of ambient oxygen influence the reproduction of the female <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> (Callosobruchus maculatus), a pest of cowpea. We used three low-oxygen atmospheres— 2 %, 5 % and 10 % (v/v) oxygen—and observed their effects on: (1) the number of eggs laid by bruchids compared to insects held in normoxic (~ 20 % oxygen) conditions; (2) {{the total number of}} eggs laid; and (3) the number of progeny that reached maturity. Low oxygen did not significantly affect the number of eggs laid during 48 or 72 h of exposure, but 2 % and 5 % oxygen did negatively affected total egg production. Increasing the exposure time from 48 to 72 h further depressed lifetime reproductive output. Maternal and egg exposure to hypoxia reduced the number of progeny that reached adulthood. Lower adult emergence was observed from eggs laid under low oxygen and longer exposure times.

40|$|The {{impact of}} cowpea variety on the {{response}} of <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid,</b> Callosobruchus maculatus, to malathion was investigated. The interaction of six cowpea varieties (Adamawa Brown, Ife BPC, Ife Brown, Lilongwe, Ntcheu and NCRI-L 25) with the geographical strains of C. maculatus (Brazil and Cameroon), temperature (23, 25, 27 C) and insecticide concentration were considered. Cowpea variety (V) had an unpredictable effect on C. maculatus response to malathion. Bruchid populations produced by Ife BPC were the most susceptible to malathion while those yielded by NCRI-L 25 were the most tolerant. Regardless of the cowpea variety, the Brazil strain showed higher tolerance than the Cameroon strain. There was significant effect of temperature (T) and insecticide concentration (C) on malathion tolerance in both strains (S). Likewise, there was significant impact of all two-way interactions on <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> tolerance except V x C. Significant three-way interactions on C. maculatus tolerance to malathion was only observed in S T V and S T C.

40|$|CmCatB, a {{cathepsin}} B-type cysteine protease, is {{insensitive to}} inhibition by the soybean cysteine protease inhibitor (scN). <b>Cowpea</b> <b>bruchids</b> dramatically induce CmCatB expression when major digestive proteases are inactivated by dietary scN, which is presumably an adaptive strategy that insects use to minimize effects of nutrient deficiency. In this study, we cloned the <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (CmHNF- 4) and demonstrated its involvement in transcriptional activation of CmCatB in {{the digestive tract}} of scN-adapted bruchids. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that CmHNF- 4 binds to a CmCatB promoter region containing two tandem chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP) sites, {{which is also the}} cis-element for Seven-up (CmSvp), a previously identified transcriptional repressor of CmCatB. Although CmSvp is predominantly expressed in unadapted insect midgut, CmHNF- 4 is more abundant in adapted bruchids. When transiently expressed in Drosophila S 2 cells, CmHNF- 4 substantially increased CmCatB expression through COUP binding. CmSvp inhibited CmHNF- 4 -mediated transcriptional activation {{even in the absence of}} its DNA-binding domain. Thus antagonism resulted, at least in part, from protein-protein interactions between CmSvp and CmHNF- 4. Association of the two transcription factors was subsequently confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. Interestingly, anti-CmHNF- 4 serum caused a supershift not only with nuclear extracts of scN-adapted insect midgut but with that of unadapted control insects as well. The presence of CmHNF- 4 in unadapted insects further supported the idea that interplay between CmSvp and CmHNF- 4 controls CmCatB transcription activation. Together, these results suggest that coordination between CmHNF- 4 and CmSvp is important in counter-defense gene regulation in insects...|$|R

30|$|Among the {{different}} leguminous grain crops present in Africa, cowpea still {{stands out as}} the most important crop which has high nutritional content and provides income for millions of poor farmers on the continent [1]. According to [2], cowpea provides food for over 200 million residents in Africa. It has been estimated that around 80 % of the cowpea trade in the world is in West and Central Africa [1]. In effect, cowpea production has gone a long way to cut down the problem of hunger in most parts of Africa. However, post-harvest losses usually caused by <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchids</b> remain a key problem for many farmers [1, 3, 4].

Losses in stored food products are highly prevalent in developing countries, especially among smallholder farmers. Among sub-Saharan African countries and other developing countries, these losses come as a result of inadequate use of highly improved post-harvest technologies during storage. Faced with such devastating losses, many farmers do not want to risk their cowpeas. Instead, they sell them at harvest time when prices are the lowest.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of insects}} is dictated {{by a combination}} of factors and may vary considerably between individuals, but small insects are often considered en masse and thus these differences can be overlooked. For example, the <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> Callosobruchus maculatus F. exists naturally in two adult forms: the active (flight) form for dispersal, and the inactive (flightless), more fecund but shorter-lived form. Given that these morphs show dissimilar biology, it is possible that they differ in odour-mediated orientation and yet studies of this species frequently neglect to distinguish morph type, or are carried out only on the inactive morph. Along with sex and age of individual, adult morph could be an important variable determining the biology of this and similar species, informing studies on evolution, ecology and pest management. We used an olfactometer with motion-tracking to investigate whether the olfactory behaviour and orientation of C. maculatus towards infested and uninfested cowpeas and a plant-derived repellent compound, methyl salicylate, differed between morphs or sexes. We found significant differences between the behaviour of male and female beetles and beetles of different ages, as well as interactive effects of sex, morph and age, in response to both host and repellent odours. This study demonstrates that behavioural experiments on insects should control for sex and age, while also considering differences between adult morphs where present in insect species. This finding has broad implications for fundamental entomological research, particularly when exploring the relationships between physiology, behaviour and evolutionary biology, and the application of crop protection strategies...|$|R

To begin to understand fundamental mechanisms that enable insects to cope with oxygen deprivation, we constructed a 3 '-anchored cDNA library from 4 (th) instar larvae subjected to normoxic and hypoxic treatments (respectively), and performed 454 -pyrosequencing. Quality filtering and contig assembly resulted in 20, 846 unique sequences. Of these, 5, 335 sequences had hits in BlastX searches (E  =  10 (- 6)), constituting a 2, 979 unigene set. Further analysis based on gene ontology terms indicated that 1, 036 genes {{were involved in a}} diverse range of cellular functions. Genes encoding putative glycolytic and TCA cycle enzymes as well as components of respiratory chain complexes were selected and assessed for transcript responses to low oxygen. The majority of these genes were down-regulated, suggesting that hypoxia repressed metabolic activity. However, a group of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs) was induced. Promoter analyses of representative HSP genes suggested the involvement of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 (HIF 1) in regulating these hypoxia-induced genes. Its activator function has been confirmed by transient co-transfection into S 2 cells of constructs of HIF 1 subunits and the HSP promoter-driven reporter...|$|R

[Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae] infestation. Percentage seed damage and pest tolerance, Phytate, tannins and oxalate contents were determined using standard methods. The result showed significant variations in both % seed damage and pest tolerance among the cowpea cultivars tested. Cultivars MIT 04 K- 399 - 1, MIT 07 K- 299 - 92, IT 96 - 610, MIT 06 K- 281 - 1, MIT 07 K- 187 - 24, MIT 06 K- 121, MIT 07 K- 304 - 9 and EIT 07 K- 291 - 69 were the least susceptible to C. maculatus with 100 % pest tolerance. The result of anti-nutritional factors clearly showed that cowpea seeds contain more phytate than oxalate and tannin. The mean phytate content in seeds was (3. 10 mg/g) which was about three times higher than that of oxalate (0. 78 mg/g) and five times higher than tannins (0. 31 mg/g). Cultivar MIT 04 K- 339 - 1 recorded the highest amount of phytate while cultivar MIT 03 K- 337 - 6 recorded the lowest. The amount of oxalate ranges from 0. 42 mg/g to 0. 92 mg/g.

The results obtained shows that, these plant material powdered leaves had remarkable effects on all the parameters measured. There were 76. 34 % and 77. 20 % undamaged seeds recorded respectively, when cowpea seeds were stored with these plant material powdered leaves compared to the control, 7. 50 %. High mortality of 84. 61 % and 85. 51 % respectively, was obtained in these plant material powdered leaves and the least was in the control, 16. 84 %. Likewise, there was only 7. 67 and 6. 01 number of adults that emerged while the control had 23. 85. High number of eggs laid was recorded in the control. It was also found out that, these plant material powdered leaves are promising candidates for developing botanical, biodegradable and ecologically friendly insecticides which can be integrated with other pest management procedures and could replace the use of synthetic insecticides on small farmers holding.

A significant (p < 0. 05) increase in carbonyl protein (CP) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) contents in bio-insecticides and insecticides exposed groups compared to the control indicates the extent of vital organs damage. These stresses caused similar and significant increase of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione synthetase in response to insecticides and bio-insecticide exposure in a dose-dependent manner. There was no post-translational modification of glutathione transferases expression induced. The alterations of the insect glutathione-dependent antioxidant enzyme activities reflect the presence of a functional defense mechanism against the oxidative and nitrosative stress and are related firmly to the glutathione demands and metabolism but appear inadequate by the significant reduction in glutathione reductase (GR) activity to prevent the damages.

40|$|Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata (L.) Walp] is an {{important}} food legume cultivated widely in the arid and semi-arid tropics of the world. Insects are the major challenge to cowpea production and storage in West Africa, where nearly {{two thirds of the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s cowpea is produced and consumed. In the introductory chapter, I discuss the importance of cowpea, its major field and storage problems, and recent advances in biotechnology that offer hope for solving these problems. In the first chapter, I present results from a field survey looking for wild host plants of Maruca vitrata to assess if these can serve as natural refuges when Bt-cowpea is deployed. In the second, third and fourth chapters I describe (i) applications of the molecular barcoding approach for studying global populations of M. vitrata; (ii) results from expressed sequence tag library sequencing of M. vitrata and molecular marker discovery; and (iii) the mitochondrial genome of M. vitrata. In the fifth chapter, I discuss the mode of action of hermetic storage of cowpea grain. ^ In the first major section of the work, two aspects of insect resistance management - needed for M. vitrata resistant Bt-cowpea deployment — have been investigated. The first is the status of wild alternate host plants of M. vitrata in the cowpea growing regions of northern Nigeria (Kano and Zaria) and southern Niger (Maradi). Results from field surveys done in these regions suggest that wild hosts are not abundantly present and thus aren 2 ̆ 7 t available to serve as refugia for M. vitrata. Lack of molecular markers for M. vitrata was one of the constraints to characterizing its populations. I sought to fill this gap by generating genomic DNA- as well as EST-based molecular markers. I also demonstrated that molecular barcoding using cytochrome c oxidase I can be applied to distinguish global populations of M. vitrata. Data from the barcoding study strongly suggests that the genus Maruca may be a species complex or has undergone a recent genetic bottle-neck. ^ In the second major section of the dissertation — dealing with the mode of action of hermetic storage of cowpea grain — I was able to estimate that each <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> requires approximately 8 - 10 ml of pure O 2 during its development to adult hood. Feeding behavior studies, done to investigate the cause for feeding cessation in storage, show that it is the level of O 2, not CO 2, that influences the bruchid feeding behavior. More importantly the larval susceptibility, visible evidence in the form of desiccated larvae, and the respiratory quotients during development suggest that inability of bruchids to make water in the absence of O 2 may be a major contributing factor {{to the success of the}} hermetic method of storing cowpea grain. ...|$|R

We investigated whether grain protectants from Hyptis spicigera and H. suaveolens (Lamiaceae) disturb parasitism and post embryonic growth of the parasitoid. When <b>cowpeas</b> containing <b>bruchid</b> larvae were treated before being placed {{in the presence of}} D. basalis females, the rate of parasitism decreased on average up to 24 and 47 % respectively in the presence of leaves dry powder and essential oils from both plant species. The estimated larval mortality was higher on treated (9. 5 to 28. 6 %) than on non treated parasitized hosts (2. 8 %), depending on the plant species and the plant extract tested. Additional larval mortality was higher for essential oil, and for H. suaveolens [...] An in-depth analysis of the pre-imaginal development in capsules adapted for this purpose showed that without treatment, mortality was recorded only for eggs and the two first larval stages. In the presence of treatment, mortality not only significantly increased on eggs but also spanned over all other pre-imaginal stages. Pre-imaginal development was also significantly extended in the presence of treatment, {{depending on the type of}} extract and dose used. In conclusion, both plant species exert acute toxicity on D. basalis larvae and also act as growth inhibitors.

40|$|Dioclea megacarpa Rolfe is {{the correct}} synonym for D. relexa var. grandiflora. This species belongs to Fabaceae, the legume family. Previous studies, {{realized}} in our research group, showed the presence of active proteins for several phytopathogenic fungi in the seeds of this species, among of them Aspergillus niger. Thus, the present work was proposed {{with the objective of}} determining the bioactivity of protein(s) from D. megacarpa seeds against fungi, leading to its/their purification and partial characterization and further investigation of its/their action mechanism. Another approach of this work it was analyze the insecticidal potential of glucose/mannose-specific lectin, isolated from D. megacarpa seeds (Moreira et al., 1983), against the <b>cowpea</b> <b>bruchid</b> Callosobruchus maculatus. For this, seed flour was placed in contact with 0. 15 M NaCl (1 : 5, w/w), followed by stirring for 3 h, filtration through a nylon cloth, re-extraction for 1 h, centrifugation at 11, 500 x g, for 30 min, at 4 oC. The supernatant obtained, named total extract, showed antifungal activity against A. niger and presented several bioactive proteins, including lectin (129. 27 UH/mgP, using trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes), trypsin inhibitor (18. 91 mg de tripsina inibida/gF), urease (47. 50 U/gF), toxin (LD 50 119. 60 mgP/Kg mice body weight), chitinase (1. 66 nKat/mgP) e &# 946;- 1, 3 -glucanase (0. 55 nKat/mgP). On the other hand, peroxidasic and proteolytic activities were not detected. For purification of antifungal principle, several chromatographies were performed on Sephadex G- 50, Chitin and Resource Q, this last connected to an FPLC system. The purified antifungal protein, named Dm-PAF, with apparent molecular mass of 67 - 68 kDa (SDS-PAGE), did not show any haemagglutinating or chitinolytic activity and presented its NH 2 -terminal sequence blocked. Dm-PAF, at a very low concentration (0. 015 ÂgP/ÂL), it was able to inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida tropicalis yeasts. The investigation of the antifungal action mechanism excluded the possibility of interaction between Dm-PAF and H+-ATPase pumps. In addition, the glucose/mannose-specific lectin, obtained from Sephadex G- 50 column, exhibited a potent insecticidal activity against C. maculatus, interfering in important parameters related to life cycle of this insect.
