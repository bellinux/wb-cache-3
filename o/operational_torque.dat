This mechanical system is used to automation motion sequence to feed material or pieces in the working area of a machine tool. A stepper motor on its operation allows a compact mechanical design based on gears. This motor supplies a maintenance torque at zero steps/s that holds up position of the carrousel avoiding to employ a brake. Its feedback control system carried out with a programmable logic controller allows an easy maintenance, good reliability and a low cost. Carrousel dynamics has been evaluated with a virtual instrument that works out the discrete time fourier transform on the signal supplied by a tachometric sensor. Taking account signal spectral analysis, angular speed was measured and finally the <b>operational</b> <b>torque</b> has been estimated. Key-Words:- Carrousel, dynamics, sensors, signal processing. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{technical}} feasibility of providing nearly continuous solar energy to a world-distributed set of conversion sites {{by means of}} a system of orbiting, large-area, low-areal-density reflecting structures is examined. Requisite mirror area to provide a chosen, year-averaged site intensity is shown. A modeled reflector structure, with suitable planarity and ability to meet <b>operational</b> <b>torques</b> and loads, is discussed. Typical spatial and temporal insolation profiles are presented. These determine the sizing of components and the output electric power from a baselined photovoltaic conversion system.

The evaluation made after consecutive bit runs with the mentioned metal-to-metal directional drilling system, proved wear of rotor and stator; however, the power section was still <b>operational</b> and provided <b>torque</b> values according to manufacturer’s specifications (Stefánsson et al. 2018). In general, the prototype of a directional system for geothermal wells up to 300  °C proved to work successfully during the IDDP- 2 drilling operations (Friðleifsson and Elders 2017; Friðleifsson et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} two new {{technologies}} are investigated {{with a view}} to improving the efficiency and reducing the vibrations of large electrical machines. These machines are used for high powered industrial applications. Individually controlled conductors are part of an active stator project that Converteam Ltd are developing. This involves individual conductors located in each stator slot that can be controlled separately. These replace traditional polyphase windings in order to provide a high level of control over the operation of the machine. A linear magneto-mechanical finite element model has been used here to show that this control method can enable a 44 % reduction in the copper loss from the machine compared to a sinusoidal supply whilst maintaining the same <b>operational</b> <b>torque.</b> This method introduces extra Fourier harmonics into the excitation pattern supplied to the machine that are not present in the supply current to traditional polyphase windings. These extra harmonics utilize saliency advantageously to produce torque. However, they also increase the vibration of the stator and may increase hysteresis loss in the iron. The bimorph concept is an idea that is unique to this thesis. This concept involves individually controlled conductors positioned through the root of each stator tooth. On application of a relatively small power input to these conductors a magnetic field is created in the stator which distorts the existing magnetic field. Under certain conditions, the magnetostriction phenomenon causes the teeth to act as a vibration absorber. The effect of this method on the Maxwell forces in the air gap is small. This enables the cancellation of components of vibration of the stator whilst the machine torque is maintained. This is a vibration control method suited to high frequency vibrations where the deformed shape of the stator includes a rocking motion of the teeth and where the resultant stator vibrations lead to tonal noise emission from the machine. This thesis investigates the two technologies mentioned above with a magnetomechanical finite element model and two experimental investigations. The thesis also contains background information relevant to this study including an introduction to electrical machines and power electronics, noise radiation and sources of noise in electrical machines, finite element modelling, vibrations of electrical machines and vibration absorbers.

40|$|In {{agreement}} with extensive development in power electronics, the induction motor became {{widely used in}} industrial, commercial and residential applications, being responsible for a huge consumption of energy. Basic inverter switching, normally results in non-sinusoidal output voltages and currents, which may affect {{the performance of a}} non-linear load. The generation by the inverter of an "a. c. " waveform with low harmonic content is extremely important, harmonic filters are not an option, when controlling speed, due to the large range in the frequency spectrum at the inverter output. With the inverter feeding an "a. c. " motor, the frequency variation at the inverter output terminals must be followed by a change in the applied voltage, in order to keep unchanged the magnetic properties at the machine's air-gap. A double control is necessary. The first through an external robust fuzzy speed control loop and the second through an internal "PID" current control loop. This work presents a driving scheme in which the machine's three windings are fed through a static converter. Such tool is responsible for the machine's speed and current control. The aim is to improve the speed response and to eliminate <b>operational</b> undesirable <b>torque</b> oscillations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{presents}} a control architecture for robotic-assisted {{surgery in the}} presence of physiological motions. Dynamic and kinematic models, <b>operational</b> space, computed <b>torque,</b> discrete state space and stochastic design are addressed in the control. Inner loops are based on position and velocity signals and outer loops have force measurements. Two active observers (AOBs) are introduced for force control and motion compensation. The first AOB is responsible for model-reference adaptive control to guarantee a desired closed loop dynamics for the force. The second AOB performs control actions to compensate physiological motions. Such motions are described by a second-order stochastic equation, without apriori knowledge of signal characteristics. Simulation results are presented for sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal motions, highlighting merits of the approach...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{analytical}} modelling of fractional-slot concentrated-wound (FSCW) interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines and establishes a basis for their magnetic and electrical analysis. In {{the state of the}} art methods for analyzing such machines, the non-homogeneous magnetic saturation and the non-linear B-H curve of the rotor iron are not considered. Moreover, the effect of the FSCW stator on the machine magnetic characteristics is overlooked. Aiming at precise modelling of FSCW IPM machines’ magnetic and electrical characteristics, a comprehensive mathematical treatment of the stator magneto-motive force (MMF), the IPM rotor non-homogeneous magnetic saturation, and its airgap flux density are presented. The FSCW stator spatial MMF harmonics are analytically formulated, based on which, a novel heuristic algorithm is proposed for the design of optimal winding layouts for multiphase FSCW stators with different slot/pole combinations. The non-homogeneous magnetic saturation of the rotor iron due to its B-H curve and the residual flux of the embedded magnets is modelled and a saturation map is proposed for the rotor iron. Accordingly, a novel airgap function is proposed for FSCW IPM machines taking into account the effect of the FSCW stator and the non-homogeneously saturated rotor. A precise mathematical model is then proposed for calculation of the airgap PM flux density. The proposed mathematical models for the FSCW stator and the IPM rotor are combined to derive detailed mathematical expressions for its <b>operational</b> inductances, electromagnetic <b>torque,</b> torque ripple and their respective subcomponents, as a function of the machine geometry and design parameters. Both normal operation of the machine and open-phase fault condition are considered in the aforementioned formulations. A “maximum torque per ampere” algorithm is then proposed for the machine under an open-phase fault condition in which customized currents are injected such that maximum average torque with a low torque ripple is guaranteed. Lastly, the derived geometry-based models for the machine characteristics are used to propose an extended dq model for FSCW IPM machines which takes into account its non-sinusoidal parameters. The proposed theories and analytical models are validated using finite element analysis and experimental tests on a prototype FSCW IPM machine...|$|R
40|$|The {{market share}} of wind energy is {{continuously}} increasing. The EU has set a target for 300 GW to be installed by 2030, after the first goal of 100 GW of installed power was achieved in 2008. This rapid growth drives new technological improvements which aim at increasing capacity, improving reliability and reducing the overall cost of wind turbines. The continuous demand for the increase in power output for new wind parks under strict cost constraints, the greater wind resource at elevation {{and the desire for}} fewer machines per Megawatt to reduce operations for both installation and maintenance has resulted in a demand for bigger machines. This so-called upscaling of turbines has caused a quick evolution in turbine size from the kilowatt to the multi-Megawatt range. These bigger machines require new simulation tools to better quantify the margins available in the design. Traditional safety factors are insufficient in this regard. As total system reliability depends upon the individual components reliability, wind turbine manufacturers demand high quality from their suppliers, a. o. gearbox manufacturers. In {{order to be able to}} guarantee a robust and reliable gearbox design, gearbox manufacturers are spending a lot of effort in the development of reliable calculation methods and simulation models. With increasing size of wind turbines, loads acting on the different components are no longer comparable to conventional stationary industrial applications. Loads acting on a wind turbine include aerodynamic loads at variable wind speeds, gravitational, inertial, <b>operational</b> loads (generator <b>torque,</b> loads induced by certain control actions like blade pitching, starting up, (emergency) braking or yawing). These loads are characterized by a high level of dynamics such as peak loads, load reversals, aero-elastic vibrations, etc. transferred towards the drive train. In general the belief has risen amongst gearbox manufacturers that some of the gearbox problems which have plagued modern wind power industry since its initial growth period may stem from a lack of understanding of the dynamic behavior of the drive train and the influence of the wind turbine on the drive train. Traditional aeroelastic codes, used for simulation of the mechanical loads acting on the wind turbine components, focus mainly on rotor loads and dynamic behaviour of the overall wind turbine, thereby yielding no insight in internal gearbox dynamics. Main concern for the gearbox manufacturer is the lack of insight in the drive train behaviour during various transient phenomena. In [1], Peeters suggested the multibody technique for realizing these dynamic load simulation models. Outputs of these multibody models are reactionforces and displacements at each subcomponent of the wind turbine gearbox. Traditionally flexibility within multibody models is represented using spring-damper systems. All gearbox subcomponents are considered rigid. However due to the increasing size ofthe wind turbines, flexibility within the drive train is becoming more and more of influence on overall wind turbine behavior under dynamic loading. Therefore these flexibilities need to be modeled accurately. The flexible multibody technique enables the modeling of the flexibility of the different drive train components in the model. This is achieved by representing drive train components, such as for example shafts and planet carrier using modally reduced finite element (FE) models [2]. Where Peeters mainly focused on the comparison of different modelling techniques, we focused on the detailed investigation of the influence of flexibility within these models. Besides structural flexibilities, special focus within this research was on the flexible modelling of gear meshing, given the importance of accurate gear mesh stiffness description for flexible internal and external gears. The dynamic coupling between the different gearbox subcomponents is particularly important in this regard. [1] J.
