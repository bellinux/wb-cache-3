5|$|After {{settling}} at Glen Noe, {{the chiefs}} {{are said to}} have held the land for centuries. While presumably owning the property outright originally, it is generally agreed that at some, uncertain date, they acquired a feudal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Campbells of Breadalbane. Initially, this entailed only a symbolic payment. Tradition identifies this as a snowball supplied at midsummer and a white calf surrendered but then killed and shared by landlord and tenant as a token of mutual esteem.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 1860, {{two members}} of the company's board of {{directors}} wrote a letter requesting Helm's resignation; they claimed they had voted for his re-election as president of the company with the understanding that he would resign when the main line between Louisville and Nashville was finished. Helm maintained that he felt an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> citizens of Logan County – many of whom he had personally sold stock to – to remain president until the Memphis branch through their county was built. The rift between Helm and the directors continued to widen, however. Helm resigned on February 21, 1860, and was replaced by James Guthrie. The Memphis branch was completed on September 24, 1860.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>To</b> {{describe}} <b>the</b> ethical {{concept of}} the fetus as a patient and identify its implications for the deliberative practice of perinatal medicine. Methods: We describe secular medical ethics and its two fundamental principles, beneficence and respect for autonomy. We articulate the ethical {{concept of the}} fetus as a patient {{on the basis of}} the ethical principle of beneficence. Results: In the deliberative practice of perinatal medicine guided by the ethical concept of the fetus as a patient, the perinatologist should always identify and balance beneficence-based <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fetal patient and beneficence-based and autonomy-based <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pregnant patient. Directive counseling is appropriate when the fetus is a patient. Non-directive counseling is appropriate when the fetus is not a patient. Conclusion: Counseling pregnant women about the clinical management of their pregnancies should always identify and balance beneficence-based <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fetal patient and beneficence-based and autonomy-based <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pregnant patient. </p...|$|R

25|$|Objections to Prestwich's {{dominance}} of the parish existed from an early time; {{there had been a}} chapel of ease at Crompton since at least the early 16th century but, due to ecclesiastical arrangements in Prestwich-cum-Oldham, the inhabitants were obliged to contribute money towards Oldham Church, which in turn had <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mother Church of St Mary the Virgin at Prestwich. On several occasions during the 15th and 16th centuries, the Archdeacon of the Chester had to intervene because Crompton's inhabitants refused to contribute monies towards holy bread and candles used at Prestwich.|$|E
25|$|The {{legal dispute}} between Black Flag and Unicorn tied the band up {{for almost two}} years, during which time they {{released}} Everything Went Black, a double album of pre-Rollins outtakes, under {{the names of the}} individual musicians and vocalists on the record. Unicorn ended up filing even more legal briefs, claiming that Black Flag had violated a court injunction against releasing new records. Ginn and Dukowski ended up doing several days in Los Angeles County Jail for contempt of court, but the case fizzled out soon afterward when Unicorn went out of business, freeing Black Flag of any further <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> label.|$|E

A general missionary fund covers the basic living expenses of single Mormon missionaries.

25|$|Since HELOCs are {{intended}} by banks to primarily sit in second lien position, they normally are only capped by the {{maximum interest rate}} allowed by law in the state wherein they are issued. For example, Florida currently has an 18% cap on interest rate charges. They are risky to the borrower {{in the sense that}} they are mostly indexed to the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which is considered a Spot Index, or a financial indicator that is subject to immediate change (as are the loans based upon the Prime Rate). The risk to borrower being that a financial situation causing the Federal Reserve to raise rates dramatically (see 1980, 2006) would effect an immediate rise in <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borrower, up to the capped rate.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans had a {{much larger}} force. Recent studies and Ottoman archival data state that there were about 50,000–80,000 Ottoman {{soldiers}} including between 5,000 and 10,000 Janissaries, an elite infantry corps, and thousands of Christian troops, notably 1,500 Serbian cavalry that the Serbian lord Đurađ Branković was forced to supply {{as part of his}} <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman sultan—just a few months before, he had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of Constantinople. Contemporaneous Western witnesses of the siege, who tend to exaggerate the military power of the Sultan, provide disparate and higher numbers ranging from 160,000 to 200,000 and to 300,000(Niccolò Barbaro: 160,000; the Florentine merchant Jacopo Tedaldi and the Great Logothete George Sphrantzes: 200,000; the Cardinal Isidore of Kiev and the Archbishop of Mytilene Leonardo di Chio: 300,000). At this time cannons were being made.|$|E

Thirty-one years earlier, the Siwanoy Indians sold their land to Thomas Pell. His land patent was confirmed by his nephew, John Pell, who became lord of Pelham Manor - a feudal domain with its own civil and criminal courts. It was from John Pell and his wife that Jacob Leisler, acting as an agent {{for a group of}} Huguenots in New York, purchased the land upon which they would settle for a sum of 1,675 pounds. In 1689 Pell officially deeded 6,100 acres (25km2) to Leisler {{for the establishment of a}} Huguenot community. In addition to the purchase money, Jacob Leisler and his heirs and assigns were to yield and pay unto John Pell and his heirs and assigns (Lords of the Pelham Manor) one 'Fat Calf' yearly as acknowledgement of their feudal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Manor.|$|E

25|$|On {{the death}} of Bertha in early 1156, her son, Conan IV, {{expected}} to inherit the ducal throne. However, he was denied his inheritance by his stepfather Odo, Viscount of Porhoët (also known as Odo II), Bertha's second husband; Odo II refused to relinquish his authority over Brittany. To consolidate his hold on power, Odo II entered into a pact with the disinherited Hoel, Count of Nantes, to divide Brittany between them. But at the same time, Hoel was under threat of rebellion in Nantes, sponsored by Geoffrey Fitzempress, {{and he could not}} send any aid to Eudas. Conan IV landed in Brittany and took Rennes, while his ally Raoul de Fougères captured and imprisoned Eudas. Conan IV was formally enthroned as Duke of Brittany in Rennes. While Conan IV was consolidating his inheritance in 1156, Geoffrey FitzEmpress successfully took Nantes from Hoel. On Geoffrey's death in 1158, Conan IV seized Nantes, reuniting the Duchy once again. However, Henry II, now King of England, seized the Earldom of Richmond, Conan's paternal inheritance. Henry demanded the return of Nantes, and when he obtained control of it from Conan IV, became the Count of Nantes, without <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Brittany (later dukes would eventually reunite Nantes to Brittany).|$|E
