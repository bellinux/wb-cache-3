5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for a heightened sense <b>of</b> <b>smell.</b> This suggests that the sense <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E

The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E

40|$|Bad {{smell is}} a key concept in {{software}} refactoring. We have a bunch <b>of</b> bad <b>smells,</b> refactoring rules, and refactoring tools, {{but we do not}} know which kind <b>of</b> bad <b>smells</b> should be resolved first. The resolution of one kind <b>of</b> bad <b>smells</b> may have impact on the resolution <b>of</b> other bad <b>smells.</b> Con-sequently, different resolution orders of the same set <b>of</b> bad <b>smells</b> may require different effort, and/or lead to differ-ent quality improvement. In order to ease the work and maximize the effect of refactoring, we try to analyze the re-lationships among different kinds <b>of</b> bad <b>smells,</b> and their impact on resolution orders <b>of</b> these bad <b>smells.</b> With the analysis, we recommend a resolution order <b>of</b> common bad <b>smells.</b> The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} motivate the necessity to arrange resolution orders <b>of</b> bad <b>smells,</b> and recommend a resolution order <b>of</b> common bad <b>smells...</b>|$|R

5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense <b>of</b> <b>smell.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Code {{and design}} smells are {{recurring}} design problems in software systems {{that must be}} identified to avoid their possible negative consequences on development and maintenance. Consequently, several smell detection approaches and tools have been proposed in the literature. However, so far, they allow the detection <b>of</b> predefined <b>smells</b> but the detection <b>of</b> new <b>smells</b> or smells adapted to {{the context of the}} analysed systems is possible only by implementing new detection algorithms manually. Moreover, previous approaches do not explain the transition from specifications <b>of</b> <b>smells</b> to their detection. Finally, the validation of the existing approaches and tools has been limited on few proprietary systems and on a reduced number <b>of</b> <b>smells.</b> In this paper, we introduce an approach to automate the generation of detection algorithms from specifications written using a domain-specific language. This language is defined from a thorough domain analysis. It allows the specification <b>of</b> <b>smells</b> using high-level domain-related abstractions. It allows the adaptation of the specifications <b>of</b> <b>smells</b> to the context of the analysed systems. We specify 10 smells, generate automatically their detection algorithms using templates, and validate the algorithms in terms of precision and recall on Xerces v 2. 7. 0 and GanttProject v 1. 10. 2, two open-source object-oriented systems. We also compare the detection results with those of a previous approach, iPlasma...|$|R

5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
