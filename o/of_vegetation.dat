5|$|The Botanic Garden (1791) {{is a set}} of two poems, The Economy <b>of</b> <b>Vegetation</b> and The Loves of the Plants, by the British {{poet and}} naturalist Erasmus Darwin. The Economy <b>of</b> <b>Vegetation</b> celebrates {{technological}} innovation, scientific discovery and offers theories concerning contemporary scientific questions, such as the history of the cosmos. The more popular Loves of the Plants promotes, revises and illustrates Linnaeus's classification scheme for plants.|$|E
5|$|As such {{examples}} demonstrate, The Economy <b>of</b> <b>Vegetation</b> {{is part of}} an Enlightenment {{paradigm of}} progress while The Loves of the Plants, with its focus on an integrated natural world, is more of an early Romantic work.|$|E
5|$|Grebes {{are small}} to medium-large diving birds with lobed toes and pointed bills. They are seen mainly on lowland waterbodies and coasts. They feed on aquatic animals and nest on a {{floating}} platform <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b> There are about 19 species worldwide with five in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

40|$|The {{patterns}} of distributing <b>of</b> halophytic <b>vegetation</b> in North–Western Priazov’ya {{on the whole}} and {{on the coast of}} the Molochny estuary, in particular were considered. The distribution caused by the location of saline soils and degree of their salinity. The <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> saline soils can be expressly divided into two groups: <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> marine and estuaries banks, and <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> saline lands. The natural <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> right bank of the Molochny estuary tested considerable anthropogenic influence, that’s why it is preserved mainly on the steep slope of right bank the estuary. Here, some three groups were selected: <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> near-estuary part, <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> slope of the right bank, and <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> uplifted plateau...|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> the western Grassland Biome in South Africa. The {{classification}} <b>of</b> the <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> the Bd and Ea land types forms part of a research programme on the synthesis <b>of</b> the <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> the western Grassland Biome in South Africa. This is a first formal classification <b>of</b> the <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> the study area. Using a numerical classification technique (Twinspan) as a first approximation, the classification was refined by applying Braun-Blanquet procedures. The result is a phytosociological table where one new order, three new alliances and eight new associations are recognized. The new syntaxa are ecologically interpreted as well as described. Associated gradients in habitat are identified by using an ordination algorithm (Decorana). This study should contribute to the present knowledge and ecological understanding <b>of</b> the <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> the western Transvaal grassland...|$|R

5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} {{vegetation}} in two principal ways, vegetation {{can influence the}} deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b> Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> {{in northern}} West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation. For example, {{the foothills of}} the Himalayas, the Dooars, are densely wooded with sal and other tropical evergreen trees. Above an elevation of , the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above , temperate forest trees such as oaks, conifers, and rhododendrons predominate.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem has}} consisted, first, of a mapping {{of the soil}} types present in Haskell County; second, a {{collection}} <b>of</b> the existing <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> each soil type; third, an identification <b>of</b> the <b>vegetation</b> collected and observed; fourth, and lastly, a comparative study <b>of</b> the <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> each soil type {{in an effort to}} establish a correlation between the vegetation and the soil type...|$|R
40|$|A {{main feature}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of bacterial endocarditis is the activation of the coagulation system via the extrinsic pathway, resulting in the formation <b>of</b> infected endocardial <b>vegetations.</b> Earlier studies gave indirect evidence that monocytes {{play an important role}} in the procoagulant response during the course of the disease. In this study, we assessed the role of monocytes more directly. We compared weights and tissue factor activities (TFA) <b>of</b> endocardial <b>vegetations</b> <b>of</b> normal rabbits infected with Streptococcus sanguis with those of rabbits which were treated with the cytostatic drug etoposide (Vepesid; Bristol-Myers Squibb B. V.) to induce a selective monocytopenia. Furthermore, the importance of the presence of bacteria was determined through the influence of antibiotic treatment on TFA, vegetational weight, and infection <b>of</b> the <b>vegetations.</b> The TFA <b>of</b> the <b>vegetations</b> was measured chromogenically by monitoring the factor VII-dependent activation of factor X with an amidolytic assay for factor Xa. We found that the degree of infection and the weight <b>of</b> <b>vegetations</b> <b>of</b> rabbits treated with the cytostatic drug etoposide did not differ from that of untreated rabbits. Their TFA, however, was significantly lower than the TFA <b>of</b> <b>vegetations</b> <b>of</b> rabbits not treated with etoposide. We also found that, as with the monocytopenic rabbits, the weight <b>of</b> the <b>vegetations</b> was not reduced in penicillin G-treated rabbits. The degree of infection and TFA, however, were significantly lower. We conclude that monocytes indeed are involved in the activation of the coagulation system during the course of bacterial endocarditis and that the degree of infection is positively correlated to the TFA <b>of</b> the <b>vegetations...</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack <b>of</b> <b>vegetation)</b> in urban areas. With a decreased amount <b>of</b> <b>vegetation,</b> cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|Adonis {{originally}} was a Phoenician god of fertility representing the spirit <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b> It is further speculated {{that he was}} an avatar of the version of Ba'al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first encountered the myth. However, {{it is clear that the}} Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.|$|E

5|$|Armies facing {{service in}} {{different}} theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle and desert camouflage uniforms are common. Patterns can {{to some extent}} be adapted to different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> to the uniform. Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for the same purpose. Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform to suit the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
