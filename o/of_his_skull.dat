25|$|In 2011, Ned Kelly's {{remains were}} once again exhumed and {{returned}} to his surviving descendants for a proper family burial. The identified remains of Kelly did not include most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull.</b> DNA testing also established another complete skull believed to be Kelly's was not in fact his.|$|E
25|$|The head is well {{balanced}} {{in proportion to}} the size of the dog and is deeper than broad with the length of muzzle and the length of skull approximately equal. With close fitting eyelids, the eyes are set into the skull upon a slight oblique; the eyes are medium-sized, almond shaped, and colored dark brown. The ears are fleshy, moderately sized, and pendant shaped, with sufficient substance to hang close to the skull and drop the tip of the ears level with the inside corners of the mouth. The Leonberger's ears rise from halfway between the eye and the top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> to level with the top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull.</b> Though level bites and slight anomalies not affecting the robustness of the lower jaw are common, the ideal Leonberger capably possesses a strong scissor bite with full dentition.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} {{game of the}} 1948 season, Hirsch {{sustained}} a fracture {{on the right side}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> after being kicked in the head during a game against the Cleveland Browns. Hirsch did not return to action during the 1948 season, totaling 101 receiving yards and 93 rushing yards in five games.|$|E
25|$|Rainer {{continued}} {{to be held in}} high regard after the Revolution, when light was shed on various other aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. A 2001 exhibit <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skulls</b> collection at Galeria Catacomba made a point <b>of</b> reintroducing <b>his</b> work to the cultural circles of the day. The anthropological center that Rainer helped established was renamed in his honor in 2007.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} many {{problems}} associated with his work, Gall {{made significant contributions to}} neurological science. He died in Paris, on 22 August 1828. Although married, he remained childless. Some direct descendants <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brothers lived in Germany until 1949. A collection <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skulls</b> can be seen at the Rollett Museum in Baden bei Wien, Austria, where several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> relatives now live.|$|R

25|$|On February 22, using thermal imagery, the {{soldiers}} discovered Marach Agha curled {{in a ball}} by a roadside. Gibbs and Spc. Michael S. Wagnon shot him and placed a Kalashnikov next to the body to justify the killing. Morlock pleaded guilty for his death. The Army later said it believed Marach Agha to be deaf or mentally retarded. The soldiers kept part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1863 Beethoven's body (and {{also that}} of Schubert, who was buried nearby) was exhumed, studied and reburied, in {{proceedings}} {{paid for by}} the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. At that time, fragments from the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull,</b> which had been separated during the autopsy, were acquired by the Austrian doctor Romeo Seligmann, which are also now in the Center for Beethoven Studies. His remains were moved in 1888 to the Zentralfriedhof.|$|E
50|$|His relics, now {{consisting}} <b>of</b> only <b>his</b> <b>skull,</b> are venerated in the Church of St. Titus, Heraklion, Crete, {{to which}} it was returned in 1966 after being removed to Venice during the Turkish occupation.|$|R
50|$|After <b>his</b> death <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> {{was taken}} to Britain {{and placed in the}} Phrenological Society of Edinburgh. When Ceylon gained {{independence}} from the British in 1948, Keppetipola was declared a national hero, because he'd fought against foreign rule.

25|$|Gongadze {{was buried}} in the Mykola Naberezhny Church in Kiev on 22 March 2016. Gongadze had {{remained}} unburied until then, as Lesya Gongadze, the journalist's mother, has refused to have the body interred until Gongadze's head had been found. In 2009, according to the Prosecutor's General Office, the remains <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> were found but Lesya Gongadze had refused to acknowledge that the found remains belonged to her son. Lesya Gongadze died on 30 November 2013.|$|E
25|$|Euronymous used Dead's suicide {{to foster}} Mayhem's 'evil' image and claimed Dead had killed himself because death metal had become 'trendy' and commercialized. In time, rumors spread that Euronymous {{had made a}} stew with bits of Dead's brain and had made {{necklaces}} with bits <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull.</b> The band later denied the former rumor, but confirmed that the latter was true. Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy, which was confirmed by several {{other members of the}} scene, like Bård 'Faust' Eithun and Metalion.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, they were {{embedded}} with the U.S. 4th Infantry Division, traveling in an Iraqi MT-LB. Woodruff and Vogt were standing with their heads above a hatch, apparently filming a stand-up. Both men were wearing body armor and protective helmets at the time. Woodruff sustained shrapnel wounds; Vogt was struck by shrapnel in the head, and suffered a broken shoulder. Both men underwent surgery for head injuries with a joint Army and Air Force neurosurgical team at the U.S. Air Force hospital south of Balad, located in Camp Anaconda, and were reported to be in stable condition. Tom Brokaw reported on the Today show that Woodruff had also undergone surgery, with a portion <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> being removed to reduce the damage from brain swelling.|$|E

25|$|According {{to medical}} staff who {{examined}} {{his body in}} Cork and in Dublin, there were two wounds to Collins' head: an entry wound at the hairline on the front left of his forehead and a large exit wound at the rear <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull,</b> just behind his right ear. There was no complete post mortem as it was evident from his head wounds as to the medical cause of his death. His field diary was taken by General Emmet Dalton {{who had been with}} Collins throughout his tour of the south. Collins' body was taken first to Shanakiel Hospital in Cork, a small military establishment. It was then taken by ship around the coast to Dublin where it was laid out in St Vincent's Hospital Dublin (at the hospital's first site). From there it was taken to City Hall beside Dublin Castle where it lay in state.|$|E
25|$|The {{skull and}} roses design was {{composed}} by Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse, who added lettering and color, respectively, {{to a black}} and white drawing by Edmund Joseph Sullivan. Sullivan's drawing was an illustration for a 1913 edition of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Earlier antecedents include the custom of exhibiting the relic skulls of Christian martyrs decorated with roses on their feast days. The rose is an attribute of Saint Valentine, who according to one legend, was martyred by decapitation. Accordingly, in Rome, at the church dedicated to him, the observance of his feast day included the display <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> surrounded by roses. This was discontinued in the late 1960s when Valentine was removed from the Roman Catholic canon, along with other legendary saints whose lives and deeds could not be confirmed. Kelley and Mouse's design originally appeared on a poster for the September 16 and 17, 1966 Dead shows at the Avalon Ballroom. Later, it was used as the cover for the album Grateful Dead (1971). The album is sometimes referred to as Skull and Roses.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2005, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Madeeha Khattab, the Dean of the School of Medicine at Cairo University, Tutankhamun was removed from the tomb and a CT scan (computerized tomography) was performed on the mummy. The scan allowed for accurate forensic reconstruction of his body and face, as well as further evidence of his cause of death. Testing showed there was no traumatic injury to the head, he had a small cleft palate that went probably unnoticed, and the elongated shape <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> was within the normal range and appeared to be a family trait after some studies were done on mummies that were believed to have been related to Tutankhamun. Based on bone maturity and his wisdom teeth, Tutankhamun was confirmed to be 19 {{years old at the time}} of his death. The CT scan proved Tutankhamun was in good health and did not show any signs of disease that would have affected his build. Study concluded he was not murdered from traumatic head injury, but a non-violent murder could still not be ruled out. There appeared to be no indication of any long-term disease.|$|E

60|$|His {{companion}} {{was quick}} to prove {{the accuracy of the}} Character Marker. Seeing the boy's back turned, he seized a long iron bar that was used to operate the telescope, and struck at Rob so fiercely that had he not worn the Garment <b>of</b> Protection <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> would have been crushed by the blow. At it was, the bar rebounded with a force that sent the murderous Frenchman sprawling upon the roof, and Rob turned around and laughed at him.|$|R
25|$|Maerth {{asserted}} that the eating of brain produces an aphrodisiac effect (presumably due to the vast amount of hormones in it), and that this initially caused apes to become addicted to them, organizing brain hunts wherein the males of another tribe were eaten and the females raped {{in a frenzy of}} brain-induced sex and violence. However, this diet also inadvertently increased brain size and intelligence while triggering the loss both of body hair and of our innate psychic abilities. Thus man gradually came into being, remaining cannibalistic until 50,000 years ago. Modern humans, alienated from their surroundings now that they've no telepathic contact with nature and each other as animals do, suffering from a distorted sexuality resulting from hormonal imbalances, and driven insane from the constant pressure of their unnaturally large brains pressing on the inside of their skulls, are inevitably destroying themselves with pollution, overpopulation, racial integration and ultimately, nuclear war. He foresees a return to cannibalism in the near future, and suggests that the reader should drop out of society, embrace a vegetarian diet, steep himself in the wisdom of the East and perhaps employ various wooden frames and wire devices to alter the shape <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> as some ancient cultures did, thus relieving the pressure on the brain and partially restoring psychic powers.|$|E
500|$|On 5 February 2013 Professor Caroline Wilkinson of the University of Dundee {{conducted}} a forensic facial reconstruction of Richard III, {{commissioned by the}} Richard III Society, based on 3D mappings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull.</b> The face is described as [...] "warm, young, earnest and rather serious". On 11 February 2014 the University of Leicester announced the project to sequence the entire genome of Richard III {{and one of his}} living relatives, Michael Ibsen, whose mitochondrial DNA confirmed the identification of the excavated remains. Richard III thus became the first ancient person of known historical identity to have their genome sequenced.|$|E

2500|$|The {{practice}} of trepanning continues today due to belief in various pseudoscientific medical benefits.

500|$|Archaeological {{findings}} in the late 20th century {{shed light on the}} final moments of the battle. In 1996 workmen at a construction site in the town of Towton uncovered a mass grave, which archaeologists believed to contain the remains of men who were slain during or after the battle in 1461. The bodies showed severe injuries to their upper torsos; arms and skulls were cracked or shattered. [...] One exhumed specimen, known as Towton 25, had the front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> bisected: a weapon had slashed across his face, cutting a deep wound that split the bone. The skull was also pierced by another deep wound, a horizontal cut from a blade across the back.|$|E

500|$|A {{search for}} Richard's body began in August 2012, {{initiated}} by the Looking for Richard project {{with the support of}} the Richard III Society. The archaeological excavation was led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services, working in partnership with Leicester City Council. On the first day a human skeleton belonging to a man in his thirties was uncovered showing signs of severe injuries. The skeleton, which had several unusual physical features, most notably a severe curvature of the back, was exhumed to allow scientific analysis. Examination showed that the man had probably been killed either by a blow from a large bladed weapon, probably a halberd, which cut off the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>skull</b> and exposed the brain, or by a sword thrust that penetrated all the way through the brain. Other wounds on the skeleton had probably occurred after death as [...] "humiliation injuries", inflicted as a form of posthumous revenge.|$|E
