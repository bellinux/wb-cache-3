25|$|Crisis {{intervention}} {{is an integral}} part <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>psychology.</b> School administrators view school psychologists as the school’s crisis intervention “experts”. Crisis events can significantly affect a student’s ability to learn and function effectively. Many school crisis response models suggest that a quick return to normal rituals and routines can be helpful in coping with crises.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{important}} {{figure to}} the origin <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>psychology</b> was Granville Stanley Hall. Rather than {{looking at the}} individual child as Witmer did, Hall focused more on the administrators, teachers and parents of exceptional children He felt that psychology could {{make a contribution to}} the administrator system level of the application <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>psychology.</b> Hall created the child study movement, which helped to invent the concept of the [...] "normal" [...] child. Through Hall's child study, he helped to work out the mappings of child development and focused on the nature and nurture debate of an individual's deficit. Hall's main focus of the movement was still the exceptional child {{despite the fact that he}} worked with atypical children.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{significant}} {{event in}} the foundation <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>psychology</b> {{as it is today}} was the Thayer Conference. The Thayer Conference was first held in August 1954 in West Point, New York in Hotel Thayer. The 9 day-long conference was conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA). The purpose of the conference was to develop a position on the roles, functions, and necessary training and credentialing of a school psychologist. [...] At the conference, forty-eight participants that represented practitioners and trainers of school psychologists discussed the roles and functions of a school psychologist and the most appropriate way to train them.|$|E
2500|$|The Thayer Conference {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} events in the history <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>psychology</b> because it was there that the field was initially shaped into what it is today. [...] Before the Thayer Conference defined school psychology, practitioners used seventy-five different professional titles. By providing one title and a definition, the conference helped to get school psychologists recognized nationally. [...] Since a consensus was reached regarding the standards of training and major functions of a school psychologist, the public can now be assured that all school psychologists are receiving adequate information and training to become a practitioner.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges school psychologists face with systemic approaches is cooperation between schools and families. [...] This is sometimes hard to achieve simply due to conflicting schedules, cultural differences, and lack of trust between schools and families. [...] Leaders in the field <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>psychology</b> recognize the practical challenges that school psychologists face when striving for systems-level change and have highlighted a more manageable domain within a systems-level approach – the classroom [...] [...] School psychologists offer many services to teachers and students on a classroom level. [...] For example, school psychologists help develop classroom behavior modification plans and alternative teaching strategies. [...] School psychologists are often consultants to teachers within the classroom level of systemic school psychological services.|$|E
2500|$|Lightner Witmer {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} as the founder <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>psychology.</b> Witmer {{was a student}} of both Wilhelm Wundt and James Mckeen Cattell. While Wundt believed that psychology should deal with the average or typical performance, Cattell's teachings emphasized individual differences. Witmer followed Cattell's teachings and focused on learning about each individual child's needs. Witmer opened the first psychological and child guidance clinic in 1896 at the University of Pennsylvania. Witmer's goal was to prepare psychologists to help educators solve children's learning problems, specifically those with individual differences. Witmer became an advocate for these special children. He was not focused on their deficits per se, but rather helping them overcome them, {{by looking at the}} individual's positive progress rather than all they still could not achieve. Witmer stated that his clinic helped [...] "to discover mental and moral defects and to treat the child {{in such a way that}} these defects may be overcome or rendered harmless through the development of other mental and moral traits". He strongly believed that active clinical interventions could help to improve the lives of the individual children.|$|E
