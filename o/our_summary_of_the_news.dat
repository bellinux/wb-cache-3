40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{thorough}} research showing many positive benefits of school choice. However, many questions remain on how school choice works. Rigorous school choice experiments can only determine if access to school choice programs alters student outcomes; they cannot confidently identify the specific mechanisms that mediate various outcomes. Two commonly theorized mechanisms in school choice programs that lead to positive outcomes are (1) an increased access to higher-quality schools and (2) an improved match between schools and students. We examine the existing empirical evidence and the theoretical arguments for these two primary mechanisms. While there is evidence supporting both mechanisms, no studies are able to isolate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> quality schools independent of families selecting schools that match their preferences. Since <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> this research is descriptive and has limited causal interpretation, theory is essential in guiding interpretation and policy implications.

40|$|Reading The Newly Published Synthesis Report (SYR) on Climate Change 2014 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2015), {{it becomes}} clear that there is {{increasing}} scientific evidence of anthropogenic impact, i. e. influence of human activities, on global climate change. Of particular concern are <b>the</b> continued increases <b>of</b> CO 2 emissions and CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere. The SYR notes that CO 2 concentrations are increasing at the fastest observed decadal rate of change (2. 0 0. 1 ppm/yr) for 20022011 (ibid. : 44). This reflects <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changes <b>of</b> CO 2 concentrations using previous IPCC and IEA data (Zhang and Yazdani, 2014). <b>The</b> magnitude <b>of</b> annual CO 2 emissions was 30. 3 gigatonnes in 2010 and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> CO 2 concentration reached 400 parts per million (ppm) in 2013 (IEA, 2012; IPCC, 2013). Over <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> 23 years between 1990 and 2013 <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> CO 2 concentration rose from 353 ppm to 400 ppm giving it an average annual increase of 2. 04 ppm/yr. If this trend remains unchanged CO 2 concentration will by circa 2037 have reached <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> 450 ppm which is <b>the</b> baseline <b>of</b> CO 2 concentration stabilisation used by many researchers for modelling global climate change. The IPCC experts estimate with high confidence that about 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cumulative CO 2 emissions generated by human activities during the industrial period between 1750 and 2011 occurred in the last 40 years (IPCC, 2015 : 45). Indeed, in the last 30 years or so the world has witnessed marked changes in <b>the</b> contributions <b>of</b> CO 2 emissions by some leading nations. As the leading industrialised country the US had been the largest CO 2 emission contributor until 2007, when it was overtaken by China.

40|$|Introduction: Recent {{research}} has confirmed <b>the</b> increasing burden <b>of</b> bronchiectasis, in affluent and developing countries. Bronchiectasis, the destruction and dilation of airways, {{is due to}} a variety of causes and is characterised by a self-perpetuating cycle of airway inflammation, infection and obstruction that results in substantial morbidity and mortality. Improved therapies that address these three components, and the diseases that both cause and result from bronchiectasis are required. Areas covered: In this review, we update <b>our</b> previous <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinical features, pathophysiology and epidemiology of bronchiectasis among adults and children, highlighting the most recent advances in therapeutics. We discuss current treatment strategies and then identify key goals for future research on the causes and treatments of a variety of types of bronchiectasis. Expert opinion: Bronchiectasis remains an orphan disease with respect to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> new therapies. There has been progress in the recognition and studies but further research is now required on the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of bronchiectasis in order to decrease its high burden.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{assessment}} <b>of</b> health-related {{quality of}} life (HR-QOL) is {{an essential element of}} healthcare evaluation. Hundreds of generic and specific HR-QOL instruments have been developed. Generic HR-QOL instruments are designed to be applicable across a wide range of populations and interventions. Specific HR-QOL measures are designed to be relevant to particular interventions or in certain subpopulations (e. g. individuals with rheumatoid arthritis). This review examines 7 generic HR-QOL instruments: (i) the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short Form (SF- 36) health survey; (ii) the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP); (iii) the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP); (iv) the Dartmouth Primary care Cooperative Information Project (COOP) Charts; (v) <b>the</b> Quality <b>of</b> Well-Being (QWB) Scale; (vi) the Health Utilities Index (HUI); and (vii) the EuroQol Instrument (EQ- 5 D). These instruments were selected because they are commonly used and/or cited in the English language literature. <b>The</b> 6 characteristics <b>of</b> an instrument addressed by this review are: (i) conceptual and measurement model; (ii) reliability; (iii) validity; (iv) respondent and administrative burden; (v) alternative forms; and (vi) cultural and language adaptations. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> instruments reviewed, the SF- 36 health survey is the most commonly used HR-QOL measure. It was developed as a short-form measure of functioning and well-being in the Medical Outcomes Study. The Dartmouth COOP Charts were designed to be used in everyday clinical practice to provide immediate feedback to clinicians about <b>the</b> health status <b>of</b> their patients. <b>The</b> NHP was developed to reflect lay rather than professional perceptions <b>of</b> health. <b>The</b> SIP was constructed as a measure of sickness in relation to impact on behaviour. The QWB, HUI and EQ- 5 D are preference-based measures designed to summarise HR-QOL in a single number ranging from 0 to 1. We found that there are no uniformly `worst' or `best' performing instruments. The decision to use one over another, to use a combination of 2 or more, to use a profile and/or a preference-based measure or to use a generic measure along with a targeted measure will be driven by <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurment. In addition, the choice will depend on a variety <b>of</b> factors including <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population (e. g. age, health status, language/culture) and the environment in which the measurement is undertaken (e. g. clinical trial, routine physician visit). We provide <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> evidence in <b>the</b> literature regarding each instrument's characteristics based on the review criteria. <b>The</b> potential user <b>of</b> these instruments should base their instrument selection decision on the characteristics that are most relevant to their particular HR-QOL measurment needs.

The annual conference has become one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year for nurses and midwives – affording {{as many as possible}} the opportunity to come together to discuss issues of central importance to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profession. Entitled Team-Working to Support Excellence in Patient Care, this year’s conference was addressed by the Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, TD, and <b>the</b> Chief Executive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Health Service Executive, Professor Brendan Drumm. In this edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Review, we continue <b>our</b> analysis and <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSE’s Transformation Programme, focusing on this occasion on <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> bed capacity in acute hospitals. The Review considers <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a study of bed use in acute hospitals with emergency departments that was carried our between November 2006 and February 2007 and published in May 2007.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Fever in {{neutropenia}} {{is the most}} frequent potentially life-threatening complication of chemotherapy {{in children and adolescents}} with cancer. This review summarizes recent studies that refine our knowledge of how to manage pediatric fever in neutropenia, and their implications for clinical practice and research. Recent findings Many studies have focused on improving risk stratification based on clinical and laboratory characteristics, and on stepping-down treatment in low-risk episodes. New diagnostic strategies are in their infancy, including use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods and cross-sectional imaging. Increasing use of systematic review and meta-analysis has helped to consolidate research and to reduce or identify uncertainties in many areas. <b>Summary</b> <b>Our</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> fever in neutropenia has been improved by PCR-based diagnostics, but the clinical implications remain unclear. Many risk-prediction models have been developed, but none is useful for clinical practice as yet. First-day outpatient management, with oral or intravenous antibiotics, is now known to be efficacious and cost-effective for pediatric low-risk fever in neutropenia. Before implementing this regimen as new standard of care, its safety should be assessed. Internationally supported evidence-based guidelines for pediatric fever in neutropenia are being developed. They have the potential to rationalize everyday practice, and stimulate further research...|$|R
40|$|Mood-incongruent {{psychotic}} features (MICP) are familial {{symptoms of}} bipolar disorder (BP) that also occur in schizophrenia (SZ), and may represent manifestations of shared etiology between the major psychoses. In {{this study we}} have analyzed three large samples of BP with imputed genome-wide association data and have performed a meta-analysis of 2196 cases with MICP and 8148 controls. We found several regions with suggestive evidence of association (P< 10 – 6), although no marker met genome-wide significance criteria. The top associations were on chromosomes: 6 q 14. 2 within the PRSS 35 /SNAP 91 gene complex (rs 1171113, P= 9. 67 × 10 – 8); 3 p 22. 2 downstream of TRANK/LBA 1 (rs 9834970, P= 9. 71 × 10 – 8); and 14 q 24. 2 in an intron of NUMB (rs 2333194, P= 7. 03 × 10 – 7). These associations were present in all three samples, and both rs 1171113 and rs 2333194 {{were found to be}} overrepresented in an analysis of MICP cases compared with all other BP cases. To test <b>the</b> relationship <b>of</b> MICP with SZ, we performed polygenic analysis using the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium SZ results and found evidence of association between SZ polygenes and <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> MICP in BP cases (meta-analysis P= 0. 003). In <b>summary,</b> <b>our</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MICP phenotype in BP has provided suggestive evidence for association of common variants in several genes expressed in the nervous system. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> our polygenic analysis provides support for a modest degree of genetic overlap between BP with MICP and SZ, highlighting that phenotypic correlations across syndromes may be due to <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> polygenic risk factors...|$|R

40|$|Background: It is {{important}} that NHS resources are used to their full extent, but efforts to reduce costs may have an adverse effect on patient outcomes. Our research {{is designed to provide}} a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inter-relationship between costs and health outcomes among NHS providers (hospitals) for common surgical procedures. Objectives: In England, patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) are collected from patients undergoing one of four elective procedures: unilateral hip replacement, unilateral knee replacement, groin hernia repair and varicose vein surgery. We identify variation in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) across hospitals, assess the relationship between the cost and outcomes among NHS hospitals for these procedures, and {{determine the extent to which}} variations in outcomes and costs are due to differences in hospital performance. Data sources: We link Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data with reference cost data and PROM data for patients having the four treatments between April 2009 and March 2010. Methods: <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empirical analysis focuses on variation in different dimensions of self-reported health status. We argue that each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EuroQol- 5 D questionnaire (EQ- 5 D; European Quality of Life- 5 Dimensions) dimensions should be assessed separately. <b>Our</b> graphical <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> differential impact that hospitals have on PROs indicates <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> reporting a given health outcome and shows how these probabilities vary across EQ– 5 D dimensions and hospitals. <b>The</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empirical analysis focuses on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> hospitals and <b>the</b> inter-relationship between PROs and resource use. Results: We find that poorer post-treatment health status is associated with lower initial health status, higher weighted Charlson score, more diagnoses and lower socioeconomic status. We find significantly unexplained variation among hospitals in outcomes for patients undergoing hip replacement, knee replacement or varicose vein surgery, but not for hernia patients. For all four treatments we find significant unexplained variation in resource use among hospitals, whether measured by cost of treatment or length of stay. This suggests that hospitals can improve their utilisation of resources. Limitations: Our analyses are based on the HES. If data are missing from the medical record, or extracted and coded inaccurately, HES will contain errors. Hospitals should minimise these errors. Our study suffers from a large number of missing data, mainly because some hospitals were better than others at administering the baseline survey. Conclusions: There is no general evidence that hospitals with lower resource use have worse health outcomes. There is a significant positive correlation for varicose veins, but this is sensitive to <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> resource use and PRO measures. For hip and knee replacement the correlation is either insignificant or negative (depending on the resource use and PRO measures), implying that promoting health outcomes and controlling costs are not contradictory objectives. Indeed, we are able to identify hospitals with better than expected outcomes where resource use is below average. Future research should address how to handle missing data, evaluate hospital performance within the broader health economy, communicate PROMs to prospective patients, evaluate <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> PROMs on patient choice and provider behaviour and evaluate PROMs for people with chronic conditions.

40|$|Recent {{lung cancer}} {{studies have focused}} on {{identifying}} <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes, among which DNA repair genes are increasingly being studied. Genetic variations in DNA repair genes are thought to modulate DNA repair capacity and are suggested to be related to lung cancer risk. In this study, we tried to assess reported studies of association between polymorphism of human 8 -oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG 1) Ser 326 Cys and lung cancer. We conducted MEDLINE, Current Contents and Web of Science searches using "hOGG 1 ", "lung cancer" and "polymorphism" as keywords to search for papers published (from January 1995 through August 2010). Data were combined using both a fixed effects (the inverse variance-weighted method) and a random effects (DerSimonian and Laird method) model. The Cochran Q test was used for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by both Begg’s and Egger’s tests. We identified 20 case-control studies in 21 different ethnic populations. As two studies were not in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, 18 case-control studies in 19 different ethnic populations (7, 792 cases and 9, 358 controls) were included in <b>our</b> meta-analysis. <b>Summary</b> frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cys allele among aucasians and Asians based on the random effects model were 20. 9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 18. 9 – 22. 9) and 46. 1 % (95 % CI = 40. 2 – 52. 0), respectively. <b>The</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cys allele was significantly different between Asians and Caucasians (P &lt; 0. 001). The Cys/Cys genotype was significantly associated with lung cancer risk in Asian populations (odds ratio = 1. 27, 95 % CI = 1. 09 – 1. 48) but not in Caucasian populations. This ethnic difference in lung cancer risk may be due to environmental factors such as cigarette smoking and dietary factors. Although the summary risk for developing lung cancer may not be large, lung cancer is such a common malignancy that even a small increase in risk can translate to a large number of excess lung cancer cases. As lung cancer is a multifactorial disease, further investigations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on the hOGG 1 polymorphism-associated lung cancer risk may help to better understand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecular pathogenesis <b>of</b> human lung cancer...|$|R
