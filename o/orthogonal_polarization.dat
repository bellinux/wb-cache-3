5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarization.</b>|$|E

25|$|Stereoscopic {{displays}} {{were developed}} based on liquid crystal polarized spectacles, {{and while this}} had been very expensive on the PS2, it now became a commodity item. A common alternative was to add a polarizable screen {{to the front of}} the display and to provide viewers with extremely cheap spectacles with <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarization</b> for separate eyes. With projectors such as Barco, it was possible to project stereoscopic display onto special silvered screens and supply an audience of hundreds with spectacles. In this way molecular graphics became universally known within large sectors of chemical and biochemical science, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the backgrounds of many displays were black by default, it was common for modelling sessions and lectures to be held with almost all lighting turned off.|$|E

50|$|A new {{pattern of}} {{spectral}} sidebands was first experimentally observed on the polarization-resolved soliton spectra of the polarization-locked vector solitons of fiber lasers. The new spectral sidebands {{are characterized by}} the fact that their positions on the soliton's spectrum vary with the strength of the linear cavity birefringence, and while one polarization component's sideband has a spectral peak, the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarization</b> component has a spectral dip, indicating the energy exchange between the two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarization</b> components of the vector solitons. Numeric simulations also confirmed that the formation of the new type of spectral sidebands was caused by the FWM between the two polarization components.|$|E

First, using a full-vector finite-element method we modeled the wavelength dependence of the phase and group effective indices for the fundamental and higher-order linearly polarized (LP) modes in two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarizations.</b> Then we evaluated the wavelength dependence of the phase and group modal birefringences for both LP modes and the intermodal dispersion in two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarizations</b> as well. Second, we used different interferometric techniques, including time-domain and spectral-domain ones and a lateral force method, to measure in a broad spectral range the wavelength dependence of the phase and group modal birefringences for the fundamental and higher-order LP modes. Employing a white-light spectral interferometric method, we also measured the wavelength dependence of the intermodal dispersion for two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarizations</b> of the two LP modes.
