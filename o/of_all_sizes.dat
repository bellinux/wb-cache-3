Very large female Murray cod can have egg counts as high as 80,000–90,000, although a recent, very large 33-kg specimen yielded an egg count of 110,000 viable eggs.

5|$|As the Japanese ships {{continued}} to pound the Tsesarevich, the battleship , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet, boldly charged Tōgō's battleline {{in an attempt}} to divert the Japanese shellfire. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away. Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized. Peresvet received a total of 39 hits <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>sizes</b> that killed 13 men and wounded 69. Her forward 12-inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding; compartments of the double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her stability. Repairs took until late September.|$|E

5|$|Threats to Bridgeoporus nobilissimus include {{extirpation}} {{of known}} and unknown habitats by logging, fire, or other disturbances, and forestry practices {{that lead to}} the loss of large-diameter Abies procera and Abies amabilis trees and large-diameter stumps and snags in managed forests. Due to the scarcity of its mature tree hosts, B.nobilissimus was listed in 1995 as an endangered species by the Oregon Natural Heritage Program, making it the first of the fungi to be listed as endangered by any private or public agency in the United States. It is the sole fungus in category A of the survey and management guidelines for fungi under the Northwest Forest Plan, meaning pre-disturbance surveys and site management are needed before developing areas known to harbor the fungus. There were 13 known sites with the fungus before 1998; extensive surveying in the Pacific Northwest increased this number to 103 sites by 2006. Although it is infrequently observed, the fungus is more abundant than fruit body appearance indicates. Using genetic markers to detect the fungus mycelium in hosts, researchers found that B.nobilissimus was present at low to moderate levels and widespread in forest stands containing at least a single visible fruit body. It was detected in trees <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>sizes,</b> and in species not previously thought to harbor the fungus. B.nobilissimus may require decades of mycelial growth in its host before fruit body production is initiated. The fungus has not been successively grown in vitro despite several attempts.|$|E

40|$|The {{utility of}} multivariate foliar physiognomy, {{specifically}} the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP), to yield reliable estimates of enthalpy and hence paleoelevation {{has been demonstrated}} by comparison with other proxies, yet concerns have arisen regarding uncertainties arising from 1) apparent ambiguities in the scoring regime and 2) the way leaf size is scored. Regarding 1) scoring ambiguities are examined by reporting on scoring tests with novice users and inter-laboratory comparisons. The uncertainties {{were found to be}} less than those arising from the statistical methodology underpinning CLAMP. In respect of 2) the effect <b>of</b> removing <b>all</b> <b>size</b> data both from modern test sites and fossil data was tested. Specifically the effect of removing leaf size data from the 15 Ma Namling data set from south central Tibet, was investigated. Removal <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>size</b> data from modern sites demonstrated that size data contributes little to estimates of MAT (Mean Annual Temperature) and enthalpy. Similarly the removal of leaf size information from the Namling data set alone, but with calibration unchanged, and from both the Namling site and calibration sites, this time with recalibration, still yield paleoelevation estimates that have been independently matched by oxygen isotope techniques. Moreover the removal <b>of</b> <b>all</b> leaf <b>size</b> information results in only small increases in uncertainty (± 52 m) ...|$|R

40|$|Size-selective {{predation}} {{by small}} (30 - 50 mm carapace width) and large (90 - 110 mm) Callinectes sapidus when feeding on three different {{size classes of}} Litopenaeus setiferus was investigated. Laboratory experiments using no-choice and multiple-choice designs were carried out. Active and passive components of predation were evaluated by comparing the probability of attacking (active) and capturing (passive) shrimp. Small C. sapidus consumed shrimp <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>size</b> classes in similar frequencies during multiple and no-choice experiments, and the probability of attacking and capturing shrimp <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>size</b> classes was similar. Large crabs consumed large shrimp with a significantly higher frequency during multiple than during no-choice experiments, and the probability of capturing large shrimp {{was significantly higher than}} medium and small ones. Results in the present study suggest that size-specific consumption rates of C. sapidus are mainly the result of a passive mechanism associated with the salience of shrimp to predation. However, an active component of foraging behaviour related to the decision to attack an alternative prey whilst consuming one that has already been captured, helps to explain the differences in shrimp consumption between multiple and no-choice experiments. The complex interaction between active, passive components and satiation is discussed...|$|R
