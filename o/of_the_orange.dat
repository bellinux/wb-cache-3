5|$|Portal is a single-player first-person action/puzzle {{game that}} was first {{available}} as part <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Orange</b> Box. The game consists primarily {{of a series}} of puzzles that are solved by creating portals through which the player and simple objects can use the portals in order to reach an exit point while being ordered by an AI-programmed robot named GLaDOS throughout the game. The portal system and the unusual physics it creates are the emphasis of this game. Portal was a surprise favorite <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Orange</b> Box, receiving widespread praise and several Game of the Year awards.|$|E

5|$|For Reitz, Afrikaans was {{predominantly}} {{a language}} of culture, not of government, where he propagated {{the use of the}} official language of the Boer republics, Dutch.

5|$|In 1873 Reitz {{was asked}} to {{represent}} the district of Beaufort West in the Cape Parliament. The day he took his seat, 30 May, his father, who was the representative for Swellendam, announced his retirement from the Assembly. As so many of Reitz's activities up to that point, his parliamentary career was short-lived. Only two months later, President Johannes Brand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State offered Reitz the position of chairman of the newly formed Appellate Court <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State, {{despite the fact that}} Reitz was not fully qualified (inter alia too young).
