5|$|Dunster Castle is {{a former}} motte and bailey castle, now a country house, {{in the village of}} Dunster, Somerset, England. The castle lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> steep hill called the Tor, and has been {{fortified}} since the late Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege {{during the early years of}} the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma murrayi, {{commonly}} known as the yellow unicorn Entoloma or the unicorn pinkgill, is a species of fungus in the Entolomataceae family. First described from New England (USA) in 1859, the species is found in eastern North America, Central and South America, and southeast Asia, where it grows on the ground in wet coniferous and deciduous forests. The fungus produces yellow mushrooms that have a characteristic sharp umbo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conical cap. The mushroom is inedible and may be poisonous. Other similar species can be distinguished from E.murrayi by differences in color, morphology, or microscopic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Windsor Castle was {{originally}} built by William the Conqueror {{in the decade}} after the Norman conquest of 1066. William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London; each was a day's march– about – {{from the city and}} from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis. Windsor Castle, one of this ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames, a key medieval route into London, and Windsor Forest, a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings. The nearby settlement of Clivore, or Clewer, was an old Saxon residence. The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man-made motte, or mound, protected by a small bailey wall, occupying a chalk inlier, or bluff, rising 100ft (30m) above the river. A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward. By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle. In design, Windsor most closely resembled Arundel Castle, another powerful early Norman fortification, but the double bailey design was also found at Rockingham and Alnwick Castle.|$|E
