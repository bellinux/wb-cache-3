On the contrary, I have to assert, in a temper profoundly venerant of it, that though we must not suppose {{everything}} is right when this is aroused, we may be sure that something is wrong when this is not aroused. The something wrong may be in the spectator or in the picture; and if the picture be demonstrably in accordance with truth, the <b>odds</b> <b>are,</b> <b>that</b> it is in the spectator; but there is wrong somewhere; for the work of the picture is indeed eminently to get at this imaginative power in the beholder, and all its facts are of no use whatever if it does not.

In this country, at least, however it may have been in the States, Josh Billings was by no means the favourite or leading American humorist. If phonetic spelling were universal, much of his fun would disappear. His place was nearer that of Orpheus C. Kerr than of Artemus Ward, or of Mark Twain. It has long been the English habit to look for most of our broad fun across the Atlantic. Americans say we are not a funny people. A chivalrous and mediaeval French writer, not unfrequently quoted, once made a kindred remark. We are not at present a boisterously comic lot of geniuses, and if you see the tears running down the eyes of a fellow-countryman reading in a railway carriage, if he be writhing with mirth too powerful for expression, the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> he has got hold of a Yankee book.|$|E
6000|$|Much may {{be done by}} re-writing {{your book}} on the proof sheets, {{correcting}} everything there which you should have corrected in manuscript. This is an expensive process, and will greatly diminish your pecuniary gains, or rather will add to your publisher's bill, for the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> {{you will have to}} publish at your own expense. By the way, an author can make almost a certainty of disastrous failure, by carrying to some small obscure publisher a work which has been rejected by the best people in the trade. Their rejections all but demonstrate that your book is worthless. If you think you are likely to make a good thing by employing an obscure publisher, with little or no capital, then, as some one in Thucydides remarks, congratulating you on your simplicity, I do not envy your want of common sense. Be very careful to enter into a perfectly preposterous agreement. For example, accept [...] "half profits," [...] but forget to observe that before these are reckoned, it is distinctly stated in your [...] "agreement" [...] that the publisher is to pay himself some twenty per cent. on the price of each copy sold before you get your share.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] At a {{time when}} the nation is wrestling with the {{question}} of reforming welfare and forging policies that bridge the gap between dependence and work, the fact <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> for millions, work does not allow them to provide a decent standard of living for their families. Three key reasons for the poverty of the working poor come from a recent report of the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) : 1. Low earnings: Low-wage work with below poverty earnings was the biggest single cause of poverty. Low wages, low earnings, and low income trap millions of American working men and women in a vicious cycle of poverty. 2. Involuntary part-time work: If you want a fulltime job and a full-time paycheck, but you can only find part-time work, the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> high <b>that</b> you will fall below the poverty line. 3. Unemployment: If you lose or can’t find a job, if you suffer spells of unemployment, the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> high <b>that</b> your total earnings and your total income are going to be low, and you will be in poverty...|$|R

40|$|What is {{it about}} {{computer}} and video games <b>that</b> has <b>been</b> slowing transforming television viewers into game players? Games invariably rely {{on the idea of}} success and failure, and continually ask of us success against the <b>odds,</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> through perseverance, bravery, or lateral thinking; in a word, forms of heroism. If we can term this process as heroic, {{what does that mean for}} a generation of media-aware children versed in the systematic vanquishing of terrible odds and endless evil via quick thinking and rapid hand-eye co-ordination? This paper attempts to approach these concepts from the direction of the stories and logics themselves.

60|$|But his style! Ah, if Stevenson {{had only}} {{realized}} how beautiful and nervous {{was his own}} natural God-given style, {{he would never have}} been at pains to acquire another! It is sad to read the much-lauded anecdote of his imitating this author and that, picking up and dropping, in search of the best. The best is always the most natural. When Stevenson becomes a conscious stylist, applauded by so many critics, he seems to me like a man who, having most natural curls, will still conceal them under a wig. The moment he is precious he loses his grip. But when he will abide by his own sterling Lowland Saxon, with the direct word and the short, cutting sentence, I know not where in recent years we may find his mate. In this strong, plain setting the occasional happy word shines like a cut jewel. A really good stylist is like Beau Brummell's description of a well-dressed man--so dressed that no one would ever observe him. The moment you begin to remark a man's style the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> there is something the matter with it. It is a clouding of the crystal--a diversion of the reader's mind from the matter to the manner, from the author's subject to the author himself.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Lever's biographer has {{not been}} wholly {{successful}} in pleasing the critics, {{and he does not}} seem to affect very critical airs himself, but he tells a straightforward tale. The life of Charles Lever is the natural commentary on his novels. He was born at Dublin in 1806, the son of a builder or architect. At school he was very much flogged, and the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> he deserved these attentions, for he had high spirits beyond the patience of dominies. Handsome, merry and clever, he read novels in school hours, wore a ring, and set up as a dandy. Even then {{he was in love with}} the young lady whom he married in the end. At a fight with boys of another school, he and a friend placed a mine under the ground occupied by the enemy, and blew them, more or less, into the air. Many an eyebrow was singed off on that fatal day, when, for the only time, this romancer of the wars [...] "smelled powder." [...] He afterwards pleaded for his party before the worthy police magistrate, and showed great promise as a barrister. At Trinity College, Dublin, he was full of his fun, made ballads, sang them through the streets in disguise (like Fergusson, the Scottish poet), and one night collected thirty shillings in coppers.|$|E
60|$|Such are the {{benefits}} of Melancholy, when she is only an occasional guest, and is not pampered or made the object of devotion. But Melancholy, though an excellent companion for an hour, is the most exacting and depressing of mistresses. The man who gives himself up to her, who always takes too long views, who broods {{on the future of}} this planet when the sun has burned out, is on the high-way to madness. The <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> he does not travel all the way. He remains a self-tormented wretch, highly profitable to his medical man, and a frightful nuisance to his family. Now, there are, of course, cases in which this melancholy has physical causes. It may come of indigestion, and then the remedy is known. Less dining out (indeed, no one will ask the abjectly melancholy man out) and more exercise may be recommended. The melancholy man had better take to angling; it is a contemplative pastime, but he will find it far from a gloomy one. The sounds and sights of nature will revive and relieve him, and, if he is only successful, the weight of a few pounds of fish on his back will make him toss off that burden which poor Christian carried out of the City of Destruction. No man can be melancholy when the south wind blows in spring, when the soft, feathery March-browns flit from the alders and fall in the water, while the surface boils with the heads and tails of trout.|$|E

60|$|To embroil the confusion, {{and make}} it {{impossible}} to arrive at any general statement,--when we have insisted on the imperfection of individuals, our affections and our experience urge that every individual is entitled to honor, and a very generous treatment is sure to be repaid. A recluse sees only two or three persons, and allows them all their room; they spread themselves at large. The statesman looks at many, and compares the few habitually with others, and these look less. Yet are they not entitled to this generosity of reception? and is not munificence the means of insight? For though gamesters say that the cards beat all the players, though they were never so skilful, yet in the contest we are now considering, the players are also the game, and share the power of the cards. If you criticise a fine genius, the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> you are out of your reckoning, and instead of the poet, are censuring your own caricature of him. For there is somewhat spheral and infinite in every man, especially in every genius, which, if you can come very near him, sports with all your limitations. For rightly every man is a channel through which heaven floweth, and whilst I fancied I was criticising him, I was censuring or rather terminating my own soul. After taxing Goethe as a courtier, artificial, unbelieving, worldly,--I took up this book of Helena, and found him an Indian of the wilderness, a piece of pure nature like an apple or an oak, large as morning or night, and virtuous as a brier-rose.|$|E
6000|$|Presently {{the buck}} were {{within range of}} some of the guns in the carts, and a regular fusillade began. About twenty blesbuck turned and came {{straight}} past John, at a distance of forty yards. Springing to the ground he fired both barrels of his [...] "Express" [...] at them as they tore along--alas and alas! without touching them. The first bullet struck under their bellies, the second must have shaved their backs. Reloading rapidly, he fired again at about two hundred yards' range, and this time one fell to his second barrel. But he knew that it was a chance shot: he had fired at the last buck, and he had killed one ten paces in front of it. In fact this sort of shooting is extremely difficult till the sportsman understands it. The inexperienced hand firing across a line of buck will not kill once in twenty shots, as an infinitesimal difference in elevation, or the slightest error in judging distance--in itself no easy art on those great plains--will spoil his aim. A Boer almost invariably gets immediately behind a herd of running buck, and fires at one about half-way down the line. Consequently if his elevation is a little wrong, or if he has misjudged his sighting, the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> he will hit one either in front of or behind the particular animal fired at. All that is necessary is that the line of fire should be good. This John soon learnt, and when he had mastered the fact he became as good a game shot as the majority of Boers, but it being his first attempt, much to his vexation, he did not particularly distinguish himself that day, with the result that his friends the Dutchmen went home firmly convinced that the English rooibaatje shot as indifferently as he lied.|$|E
6000|$|Now Nature is {{all very}} well. I {{have nothing to say}} against her of a Sunday, or when trout are not rising. But she was no comfort to me now. Smiling she gazed on my discomfiture. The lovely lines of the hills, curving about the loch, and with their deepest dip just {{opposite}} where I sat, were all of a golden autumn brown, except in the violet distance. The grass of Parnassus grew thick and white around me, with its moonlight tint of green in the veins. On a hillside by a brook the countryfolk were winning their hay, and their voices reached me softly from far off. On the loch the marsh-fowl flashed and dipped, the wild ducks played and dived and rose; first circling high and higher, then, marshalled {{in the shape of a}} V, they made for Alemoor. A solitary heron came quite near me, and tried his chance with the fish, but I think he had no luck. All this is pleasant to remember, and I made rude sketches in the fly-leaves of a copy of Hogg's poems, where I kept my flies. But what joy was there in this while the [...] "take" [...] grew fainter and ceased at least near the shore? Out in the middle, where few flies managed to float, the trout were at it till dark. But near shore there was just one trout who never stopped gorging all day. He lived exactly opposite the nick in the distant hills, and exactly a yard farther out than I could throw a fly. He was a big one, and I am inclined to think that he was the Devil. For, if I had stepped in deeper, and the water had come over my wading boots, the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> my frail days on earth would have been ended by a chill, and I knew this, and yet that fish went on tempting me to my ruin. I suppose I tried to reach him a dozen times, and cast a hundred, but it was to no avail. At length, as the afternoon grew grey and chill, I pitched a rock at him, by way of showing that I saw through his fiendish guile, and I walked away.|$|E
