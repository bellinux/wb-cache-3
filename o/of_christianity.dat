5|$|In Ancient Judaism, {{his fourth}} major {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors {{that resulted in the}} early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity. He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections. This fundamental characteristic <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy.|$|E

5|$|The Celtic Church is a {{term that}} has been used by {{scholars}} to describe a specific form <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick. This form <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions and ideologies of primarily French origin began to take root in Scotland. The Celtic form <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> has been contrasted with that derived from missions from Rome, which reached southern England in 587 under the leadership of St. Augustine of Canterbury. Subsequent missions from Canterbury then helped convert the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, reaching Northumbria in the early eighth century, where Iona had already begun to have a presence. As a result, Christianity in Northumbria became a mix of Celtic and Roman influences.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> {{from the}} margins of Scotland was key {{to the development of}} this period, as it became the religion of many inhabitants. Initially influenced by the Celtic tradition originating from what is now Ireland, {{by the end of the}} era it had become integrated into the organisational structures of the Catholic Church. This period produced some highly distinctive monumental and ornamental art, culminating in the development of the Insular art style, common across Britain and Ireland. The most impressive structures included nucleated hill forts and, after the introduction <b>of</b> <b>Christianity,</b> churches and monasteries. The period also saw the beginnings of Scottish literature in British, Old English, Gaelic and Latin languages.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{there are}} more than 500 million Pentecostal and charismatic believers across the globe, and it is the {{fastest-growing}} form <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> today. The Azusa Street Revival is commonly regarded as the beginning of the modern-day Pentecostal Movement.|$|E

5|$|Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially {{received}} in Spain and Rome, {{it happened at}} a time when Japan was moving toward the suppression <b>of</b> <b>Christianity.</b> European monarchs such as the King of Spain thus refused the trade agreements Hasekura had been seeking. Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.|$|E
5|$|Among evangelical Christians, {{the five}} men are {{commonly}} considered martyrs and missionary heroes. Books {{have been written}} about them by numerous biographers, most notably Elisabeth Elliot. Anniversaries of their deaths have been accompanied by stories in major Christian publications, and their story, as well as the subsequent acceptance <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> among the Huaorani, has been turned into several motion pictures.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> in territory, which is today Poland, {{there were a}} number of different a pagan tribes. Svetovid was among the most widespread pagan gods worshiped in Poland. Christianity arrived around the late 9th century, most likely around the time when the Vistulan tribe encountered the Christian rite in dealings with their neighbors, the Great Moravia (Bohemian) state.|$|E
6000|$|If {{the twenty-first}} century studies their history, it will find that the <b>Christianity</b> <b>of</b> {{the middle of the}} nineteenth century {{recognised}} them only as objects of vilification. It is for you and such as you, Christian young men, to say whether this shall be as true <b>of</b> the <b>Christianity</b> <b>of</b> the future as it is of that of the present. I appeal to you to say [...] "No," [...] in your own interest, and in that <b>of</b> the <b>Christianity</b> you profess.|$|R

5|$|Constantine {{enforced}} {{the prohibition}} of the First Council of Nicaea against celebrating the Lord's Supper {{on the day before}} the Jewish Passover (14 Nisan) (see Quartodecimanism and Easter controversy). This marked a definite break <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> from the Judaic tradition. From then on the Roman Julian Calendar, a solar calendar, was given precedence over the lunisolar Hebrew Calendar among the Christian churches of the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} 18 churches {{located within the}} city limits of Cooper. These include congregations of the United Methodist Church and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, {{as well as those}} of Baptist, Catholic, Pentecostal, Methodist Episcopal, and other {{denominations}} <b>of</b> <b>Christianity.</b> Six of the churches are of Baptist denomination, and three are Methodist, as well as several which are of other Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Geographically, the Magyar invasions {{interfered}} with the previously highly influential contacts between Central Europe and centers of Byzantine Christianity.

5000|$|Apollonius was {{not afraid}} to die, because, he said: [...] "There is waiting for me {{something}} better: eternal life, given {{to the person who}} has lived well on earth." [...] And he argued for the superiority <b>of</b> <b>Christianity's</b> concepts <b>of</b> death and life.|$|R
5|$|He {{was educated}} in the Episcopal Church, to which he always adhered; and my {{conviction}} is, that he believed in the fundamental doctrines <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> as usually taught in that Church, according to his understanding of them; but without a particle of intolerance, or disrespect for the faith and modes of worship adopted by Christians of other denominations.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the Lithuanians {{were not}} {{prepared}} to accept Christianity, and Mindaugas's baptism had little impact on further developments. The {{majority of the population}} and the nobility remained pagan; his subjects were not required to convert. The cathedral he had built in Vilnius was superseded by a pagan temple, and all the diplomatic achievements made after his coronation were lost, although the practice <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> and intermarriage were well tolerated.|$|E
5|$|In the First Council of Dvin (506), the Armenian Church {{broke off}} from the rest <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> by rejecting the dual nature of Christ, which was agreed upon in the Council of Chalcedon of 451. Thus the Armenians found {{themselves}} in direct confrontation with the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Justinian I persecuted the Monophysite Armenians, forcing them to leave Jerusalem.|$|E
50|$|Chalcedonian Christianity {{is a large}} subset <b>of</b> Nicene <b>Christianity.</b> In {{addition}} to subscribing to the Nicene Creed, Chalcedonian Christians also subscribe to {{the decisions of the}} First Council of Ephesus in 431 AD and of the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD. The great majority of Nicene Christians are also Chalcedonian Christians. However, some portions <b>of</b> Eastern <b>Christianity,</b> such as the Oriental Orthodox Churches, adhere to the Nicene Creed, but not the Chalcedonian Definition, and are therefore part <b>of</b> Nicene <b>Christianity</b> but non-Chalcedonian.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, when the {{scholastic}} system took over literary criticism, genre theory was still based on the essential nature of genres. This is most likely because <b>of</b> <b>Christianity's</b> affinity for Platonic concepts. This state of affairs persisted until the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|In {{another type}} of example, it is {{recorded}} {{that there are three}} Dogrib prophets who had claimed to have been divinely inspired to bring the message <b>of</b> <b>Christianity's</b> God to their people. This prophecy among the Dogrib involves elements such as dances and trance-like states.|$|R
