5|$|The {{front of}} the console {{features}} an illuminated slot-loading <b>optical</b> <b>media</b> drive which accepts only 12cm Wii Optical Discs and 8cm Nintendo GameCube Game Discs. (Units sold in South Korea and later revisions do not support GameCube discs.) The blue light in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console is turned on, and pulses when new data is received through WiiConnect24. After the update (including System Menu 3.0), the disc-slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc-slot light remains off during game play or when using other features. Two USB ports are located at its rear. An SD-card slot is located behind the cover on the {{front of the}} console.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fifth}} era (1994–present), digital {{versions}} {{have been developed}} and released on <b>optical</b> <b>media</b> and online. In 1996, the Britannica was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, Britannica.com Inc., developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua, who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the Britannica name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, {{announced that it would}} not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last.

25|$|Universal Disk Format (UDF) version 1.50 {{and above}} has {{facilities}} to support rewritable discs like sparing tables and virtual allocation tables, spreading usage {{over the entire}} surface of a disc and maximising life, but many older operating systems do not support this format. Packet-writing utilities such as DirectCD and InCD are available but produce discs that are not universally readable (although based on the UDF standard). The Mount Rainier standard addresses this shortcoming in CD-RW media by running the older file systems {{on top of it}} and performing defect management for those standards, but it requires support from both the CD/DVD burner and the operating system. Many drives made today do not support Mount Rainier, and many older operating systems such as Windows XP and below, and Linux kernels older than 2.6.2, do not support it (later versions do). Essentially CDs/DVDs are a good way to record {{a great deal of information}} cheaply and have the advantage of being readable by most standalone players, but they are poor at making ongoing small changes to a large collection of information.

40|$|Light wave {{reflection}} from <b>optical</b> disordered <b>media</b> is always associate with its phase, and the phase statistics influence the reflection statistics. We report a detailed numerical {{study of the}} statistics of the reflection coefficient RR* and its associated phase(theta) for plane electromagnetic waves reflected from one dimensional (1 D) Gaussian white-noise <b>optical</b> disordered <b>media,</b> ranging from weak to strong disordered regimes. We solve numerically the full Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for the joint probability distribution in the RR* - phase(theta) space for different lengths of the sample with different disorder strengths. The statistical optical transport properties of 1 D <b>optical</b> disordered <b>media</b> are calculated using the full FP equation numerically. This constitutes a complete solution for the reflection phase statistics {{and its effects on}} light transport properties in a 1 D Gaussian white-noise disordered optical potentials. Our results show the regime of the validation of the random phase approximations (RPA) or uniform phase distribution, within the Born approximation, as well as the contribution of the phase statistics to the different reflection averages for strong disorder regimes.
