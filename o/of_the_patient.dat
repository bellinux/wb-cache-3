5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and the technology.

The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim.

Methods. Over a five-year period (January 1, 2000 -December 31, 2004), the kidneys were examined by ultrasonography in 2718 patients, 1452 males and 1266 females, mean age 47. 52 ± 17 years, (16 - 92 years). The examination included <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kidneys, evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condition <b>of</b> parenchyma and pyelo-calix, detection of simple cysts, calculi and tumor. The conventional portable ultrasonographic devices ALOKA SSD- 500 and SSD- 1000 (B-mode) with a convex 3. 5 and 5 MHz sonde were used. Results. <b>The</b> size <b>of</b> kidneys was normal in 95 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> while they were enlarged in 1. 3 % and reduced in 1. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> A normal ultrasonographic recording was noted in 68. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> double pelvis in 0. 1 %, while hydronephrosis was revealed in 0. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> A reduced renal parenchyma was observed in 16. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> Nephrolithiasis was found in 10. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> and simple cysts of kidneys in 8. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> finding <b>of</b> polycystic kidneys was seen in 0. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> An ultrasonographic recording of angiomyolipoma was noted in 0. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> and <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> other tumors in 0. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> Adrenal tumors were found in 0. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> Conclusion.

5|$|The {{prognosis}} after different treatments varies and {{is based}} on several factors which include the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate. It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.|$|E
5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E

There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
5|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy {{may be required}} to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> may dictate the modality used.

In patients who undergo hemodialysis, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal {{replacement therapy}} in patients with HRS remains unclear.|$|E
