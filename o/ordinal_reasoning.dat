40|$|<b>Ordinal</b> <b>reasoning</b> plays a {{major role}} in human cognition. This paper {{identifies}} an important class of classification problems of patterns taken from ordinal domains and presents efficient, incremental algorithms for learning the classification rules from examples. We show that by adopting a monotonicity assumption of the output with respect to the input, inconsistencies among examples can be easily detected and the number of possible classification rules substantially reduced. By adopting a conservative classification criterion, the required number of rules further decreases. The monotonicity and conservatism of the classification also enable the resolution of conflicts among inconsistent examples and the graceful handling of don't knows and don't cares during the learning and classification phases. Two typical examples in which the suggested classification model works well are given. The first example is taken from the financial domain and the second from machining...|$|E

With the special designed spatial rule knowledge base put into practice, this paper adopts the precondition base and the consequent base to respectively store the precondition and consequent of spatial knowledge rules. In addition, with the help of rules of the spatial data mining and extraction, it makes a case study on the spatial knowledge reasoning about two house relics in the prehistoric Jiangzhai settlement through three methods of reasoning, <b>ordinal</b> <b>reasoning,</b> converse reasoning, and mixed reasoning that combines ordinal and converse reasoning together. What’s more, with a desired effect, the research successfully introduces ideas and methods into the study about the interior structure of site in the single settlement site...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Winner’s Curse (WC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} robust and {{persistent}} deviations from theoretical predictions that has been established in experimental economics and claimed to exist in many field environments. There have been many attempts to explain the winner’s curse, such as ignoring the cognition process of other agents, having a cursed system of beliefs, the presence of level-k heterogeneity and beliefs, and/or misunderstanding the game. In order to capture the underlying roots of this behavior, we design and implement in the laboratory a simplified version of the Acquiring a Company game. Our transformation reduces the game to an individual-choice problem, but one that still retains the key adverse-selection issue that results in the WC. We also conduct a treatment in which one can vastly simplify the problem using <b>ordinal</b> <b>reasoning</b> rather than cardinal reasoning. Our main results find that the WC is alive and well in all of these environments where equilibrium theories, based on relaxed belief structures, are mute. Our results also suggest that the WC is better explained by bounded rationality of the form that people have difficulties either performing Bayesian updating or performing contingent reasoning on future events. To delve more deeply into the issue, we added a treatment that presents the game as a choice among simple lotteries that are equivalent to the bidding choices available, but which circumvents the need to perform contingent reasoning on future events...|$|E
