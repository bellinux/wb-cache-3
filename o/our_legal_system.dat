500|$|The Commission {{recommended}} various changes, such as {{reducing the}} use of the death penalty, allowing defendants access to legal counsel, legal aid and the abolition of peine forte et dure as a torture mechanism. Dissolved on 23 July 1652 after producing 16 bills, none of the Commission's recommendations immediately made it into law, although two (to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages) were brought into force through statutes by the Barebone's Parliament. Almost all of the recommendations eventually became part of English law, with John Hostettler, in his biography of Hale, writing that if the measures had been put into law immediately, [...] "we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> and the concept of justice".|$|E
500|$|Although {{alternative}} {{options to}} {{doing business with}} China are few for the business sector, many companies large and small, including within the important financial sector, are uneasy about the changing political climate. The head of the one business association in Hong Kong said: [...] "The middle-class, the professionals, even the accountants: people are just freaked out {{about what is going}} on... The last bastion of Hong Kong's guarantees is the law. What we have left is <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> but people fear that this may be under attack too". Steve Vickers, the principal of one local risk assessment firm said: [...] "The Hong Kong government appears to now have considerably diminished autonomy and the liaison office seems to be strengthening its position, [...] certainly sent a chill through the business and social arenas in Hong Kong".|$|E
500|$|Academic {{debate over}} the Commission's value has been strong. On the one hand, William Holdsworth wrote that the Commission was riven by strife between its lawyerly members and those of a more radical nature, and that its {{proposals}} were sometimes extreme. Other academics argued that the reform scheme was of great merit, and Hostettler, writes that [...] "there {{is no evidence to}} confirm the belief of Sir William Holdsworth that the lawyers had a difficult time with the laymen". Mary Cotterell, writing in the English Historical Review, notes that 13 of the 21 members were certainly not radicals, although Moyer and Bemers, Blount and Peters certainly were. The lawyers, all moderates, nevertheless dominated the discussions. Debate was on a highly technical level which prevented many of the laymen contributing much, although six of them had been educated at the Inns of Court. The large number of meetings and sheer volume of work produced also suggests that there was little dissent and argument. John Hostettler, in his biography of Hale, has suggested that if the measures had been put into law immediately, [...] "we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> and the concept of justice".|$|E

40|$|Cognitive Linguistics (CL) {{believes}} {{that the study of}} language can be informative with regards to human thought processes. If language is built on top of more basic, non-­‐‑linguistic cognitive skills, then some of the mechanisms behind language must surely also be used in other areas of cognition. This means that some of the explanations proposed by CL could help us clarify aspects of human behavior that go well beyond language. The present work is an attempt at looking at a number of mechanisms used in CL to explain language, and see how they shed light on one specific human area: that of <b>our</b> current <b>legal</b> <b>system.</b> The claim is that the processes that constitute <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> can be seen from a fresh perspective and can probably be better understood using some of the insights of cognitive linguistics. We will focus preferentially on mechanisms such as categorization processes, the windowing of attention, and framing strategies, including the use of metaphors...|$|R

Decades thereafter, the rationale behind <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system’s</b> policy to protect indigenous people’s rights sprang from theories originally presented in the Journal. On several occasions, the Journal advocated the advancement of reforms to the law curriculum and legal education, the formation of policies protecting academic freedom.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago {{from the}} aspect of “law and literature”. As a starting point, it argues that its “legal” reading is of a high relevance, since it helps us to better understand both the reality of Soviet law and the achievements of <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to illustrate this, it examines various legal layers embedded in the work: legal history, sociology of the punishment, criminal investigation, organizational sociology and psychology, and legal theory. In addition, the essay also focuses {{on the role of}} Western Law as a contrast in Solzhenitsyn’s work, and analyzes its metaphorical language about law. To conclude, it argues that this book could caution lawyers of the consequences of a politically-oriented approach to law that disregards the fundamental values of Western law...|$|R

2500|$|Eve Darian-Smith {{and others}} have {{asserted}} {{that the impact of}} gaming on Indian culture in general is a loss of a cultural myth. According to Ronald Wright, these ideas are based on stereotypes and are [...] "construed by the dominant society in an effort to control and justify the enduring inequalities and injustices that permeate <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> and social landscape." [...] One perspective is that Native American gaming is not so much damaging Native culture as it is merely changing a cultural myth, the way the general population perceives Native Americans. [...] Additionally, Native American gaming {{can be viewed as a}} means to rejuvenate and preserve tribal culture. [...] For instance, many tribes use revenues generated from gaming toward museums and cultural centers. [...] Tribes are not only able to fund themselves independently but can also afford to preserve their individual histories.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a gender}} gap in {{perceptions}} to the case. According to a USA Today/Gallup Poll of 1,010 respondents, {{about two-thirds of}} Americans (64 percent) believed Casey Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] or [...] "probably" [...] murdered her daughter; however, women {{were much more likely}} than men to believe the murder charges against Anthony and to be upset by the not-guilty verdict. The poll reported that women were more than twice as likely as men, 28 percent versus 11 percent, to think Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] committed murder. Twenty-seven percent of women said they were angry about the verdict, compared with nine percent of men. On the day Casey Anthony was sentenced for lying to investigators in the death of her daughter, supporters and protesters gathered outside the Orange County Courthouse, with one man who displayed a sign asking Anthony to marry him. Two men who drove overnight from West Virginia held signs that said, [...] "We love and support you Casey Anthony," [...] and [...] "Nancy Grace, stop trying to ruin innocent lives. The jury has spoken. P.S. <b>Our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> still works!" [...] The gender gap has partly been explained by [...] "the maternal instinct". The idea of a mother murdering her own child is a threat to the ideal of motherhood. For example, the trial was compared to the 1960s trial of Alice Crimmins, who was accused of murdering her two small children.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to provide a {{background}} review to assist experimental, survey and field studies that will start emerging on the effects of robot crime interviewers on children and on forensic investigations. The paper captures topics such as describing how, historically, technology has determined <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>systems,</b> criminal investigations and, of course, children’s forensic testimonies. It discusses studies that have already explored the idea of robot crime interviewers in the context of relevant ethical concerns as well as experimental studies on the different ways in which children react in an interview elicited by a human compared with a robot interviewer. The article continues by suggesting research methodological designs that could benefit studies exploring robot interviews with children such as a robot exposure phase prior to the main data collection, the robot’s “personality” and the instructions given to children for semi-autonomous interviewers. This is based on the available literature on human–robot interactions. There is an attempt here to provide a literature review and methodological suggestions to form future studies on robot crime interviewers...|$|R
40|$|One can divide {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} legal issues into three major branches: (1) {{the use of}} scientific empirical analysis by litigants to attempt to prevail in individual cases, (2) the use of social scientific empirical analysis in individual cases, and (3) {{the use of the}} empirical methods to describe the <b>legal</b> <b>system’s</b> operation.

40|$|This Article {{suggests}} an alternative, internal rationale for why judges follow precedents. The Article posits that stare decisis has evolved {{as a result}} of judges' preference for the doctrine. The Article begins with an assumption that judges are primarily motivated by a desire to impose their normative views, beliefs, and mores on the society in which they live. Using simple tools from game theory, it shows that where judges' normative views differ, an agreement to follow each other's precedents eliminates nonproductive competition that would result if judges were unconstrained in their efforts to have their own, rather than other judges', normative views define the legal consequences of individual behavior. As a result, judges are better off under a rule of stare decisis. This Article also considers what a stare decisis agreement might entail and how tacit collusion by judges might survive over time. Although the model presented is abstract and somewhat unrealistic (because it peels away much of the detail of judicial decision-making), this Article attempts to expose a nugget of truth about the evolution and persistence of stare decisis. Finally, the informal model predicts some specific phenomena found in <b>our</b> <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> and is, to some extent, empirically testable...|$|R
