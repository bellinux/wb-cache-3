40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the development of}} configurations for bio-inspired self-healing cellular arrays known as Embryonics (embryonic electronics). In the Embryonics design, the configurations are employed to define the functionality and connections of each cell. However, developing configurations <b>of</b> the <b>Embryonics</b> is a time-consuming and challenging work {{due to lack of}} effective tools. In this article, an approach is proposed to develop configurations using graphic mapping, which also optimizes the length of configurations for the Embryonics. Using metric embedding, the problem of configurations is exactly formulated to binary quadratic assignment problem and routing problem with constraint <b>of</b> the <b>Embryonics</b> architecture. Since binary quadratic assignment problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard, a genetic algorithm is used to tackle this problem for achieving high-quality placement. Due to the limitation of communication bandwidth, how to resolve congestion is also an important issue. An improved ant colony algorithm is presented to realize routing <b>of</b> the <b>Embryonics</b> based on the result of placement. Configurations <b>of</b> the <b>Embryonics</b> are formed according to the result of placement and routing. Experimental result on a 4 × 4 multiplier demonstrates that developing configurations for lookup table–based Embryonics using graphic mapping can lower the difficulty <b>of</b> the <b>Embryonics</b> design and optimize placement and routing <b>of</b> <b>Embryonics...</b>|$|R

5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages <b>of</b> <b>embryonic</b> development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain embryonic {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that they were at a late stage in development when they died. Their wings and shoulders are especially well-developed. Only the modern megapodes and the little tern exhibit a comparable degree <b>of</b> <b>embryonic</b> ossification in the arm and shoulder bones. It is likely that Gobipipus hatchlings, like megapodes and little terns, {{would be able to}} fly very soon after hatching.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution <b>of</b> <b>embryonic</b> development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration <b>of</b> <b>embryonic</b> cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Kumar, et al., first {{described}} a sequence tag {{corresponding to the}} NEDD9 3′ untranslated region based on the cloning {{of a group of}} genes predominantly expressed in the brain <b>of</b> <b>embryonic,</b> but not adult mice, a group of genes designated neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated. In 1996, two groups independently described the complete sequence of the NEDD9 gene, and provided initial functional analysis of NEDD9 protein. Law et al. overexpressed a human cDNA library in S. cerevisiae, and screened for genes that simultaneously affected cell cycle and cell polarity controls, inducing a filamentous yeast budding phenotype, and thus identified the HEF1 protein (Human Enhancer of Filamentation 1). This study identified HEF1/NEDD9 as an interactive partner for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connecting it to integrin signaling. Separately, Minegishi et al. cloned the gene encoding a protein hyperphosphorylated following ligation of β1-integrins in T cells and hypothesized {{to play a role in}} the process of T cell costimulation, designating this gene Cas-L (Crk-associated substrate-related protein, Lymphocyte type).|$|E
