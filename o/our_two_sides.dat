50|$|The Luminous Ground, {{the fourth}} book of The Nature of Order, {{contains}} what is, perhaps, the deepest revelation in the four-volume work. Alexander addresses the cosmological {{implications of the}} theory he has presented. The book begins with a critique of current cosmological thinking, and its separation from personal feeling and value. The outline of a theory in which matter itself is more spirit-like, more personal in character, is sketched. Here is a geometrical view of space and matter seamlessly connected to our own private, personal, experience as sentient and knowing creatures. This is not merely an emotional appendix to the scientific theory of the other books. It {{is at the core}} of the entire work, and is rooted in the fact that <b>our</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> - our analytical thinking selves, and our vulnerable emotional personalities as human beings - are coterminous, and must be harnessed at one and the same time, if we are ever to really make sense of what is around us, and be able to create a living world.|$|E
40|$|In {{writing this}} chapter, we (a constructivist and a situativity theorist) {{struggled}} with the distinction between situativity and constructivism. and the implications {{in terms of the}} design of learning contexts. In clarifying (and justifying) <b>our</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides,</b> we created straw man and pOinted fingers with respect to the limitations of each other's perspectives. We found that although discussions of situativity and of constructivism draw on different references and clearly have specialized languages, actual interpretations of situativity and of constructivism share many underlying similarities. Further, {{when it came to the}} design of learning contexts predicated on our respective theories, we found ourselves continuously forwarding similar principles and advocating for similar learning contexts. We are dealing with evolving concepts-and people use new terms to include and extend old ones. Constructivism was the label used for the departure from objectivism; however, even among those who call themselves constructivists there are different perspectives and different sets of assumptions (see Cobb, 1994, 1995; Phillips, 1995). Now the term more commonly used is situated, reflecting the key proposal from both the constructivist and situativity perspective that knowledge is situated through experience. In the context of this chapter, we found it trivial to distinguish among those learning theories and principles related to constructivism and those related to situativity theory. Rather, we discuss the various learning theories that have informed our understanding all unde ~ the heading of situativity learning theories. This term, and its associated assumptions and current interpretations, seemed to better capture the essence of the learning contexts we are forwarding as useful. However, even within the context of situativity theories we found it necessary to make distinctions, and it was these distinctions (not the distinction between constructivist and situativity views) that best captured the essence of this chapter...|$|E

60|$|And when I write thus of our selves I mean {{our bodies}} {{quite as much}} as <b>our</b> imaginations; the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> of us are covered up alike and put alike into disguises and unnatural shapes, we are taught and forced to hide them for the same reasons, from a fear of {{ourselves}} and a fear of the people about us. The sense of beauty, the sense of one's body, the freedom of thought and of desire and the wonder of life, are all interwoven strands. I remember that in the Park of Burnmore one great craving I had was to take off my clothes there altogether, and bathe in a clear place among loosestrife and meadowsweet, and afterwards lie wet and naked upon the soft green turf with the sun shining upon me. But I thought also {{that that was a}} very wicked and shameful craving to have, and I never dared give way to it.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{optimizing}} a ramp for a snowboarder to travel. <b>Our</b> approach is <b>two</b> <b>sided.</b> We first address the “forward problem ” of modeling the motion of a snowboarder on a ramp assuming a given ramp and initial conditions for the snowboarder. We derive a second order ODE which we solve numerically. The second aspect of our approach, and arguably the more interesting and useful, is the “variational problem”, i. e. finding the optimal ramp for a snowboarder to travel on, given initial conditions for the snowboarder and a given jumping strategy for the snowboarder. To do this, we consider the space of all possible halfpipe curves and maximize final angular velocity by applying an adapted version of the Euler-Lagrange equations in several variables. We use use Taylor series approximations to get a differential equation that is numerically tractable. The solution to this differential equation traces out a curve which represents an approximation to a candidate solution fo...|$|R
60|$|There is a magic {{quality in}} moonshine; it touches {{all that is}} sweet and beautiful, {{and the rest of}} the night is hidden. It has created the fairies, whom the {{sunlight}} kills, and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight of it, the voices of the filmy route, and their faint, soul-piercing melodies. By the moonlight every man, dull clod though he be by day, tastes something of Endymion, takes something of the youth and strength of Enidymion, and sees the dear white goddess shining at him from his Lady's eyes. The firm substantial daylight things become ghostly and elusive, the hills beyond are a sea of unsubstantial texture, the world a visible spirit, the spiritual within us rises out of its darkness, loses something of its weight and body, and swims up towards heaven. This road that was a mere rutted white dust, hot underfoot, blinding to the eye, is now a soft grey silence, with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlike in its silver here and there. Overhead, riding serenely through the spacious blue, is the mother of the silence, she who has spiritualised the world, alone save for two attendant steady shining stars. And in silence under her benign influence, under the benediction of her light, rode <b>our</b> <b>two</b> wanderers <b>side</b> by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night.|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the utility of}} three-dimensional preoperative image reconstruction as digital virtual templating for junior surgeons in placing a pedicle screw (PS) in the lumbar spine. Twenty-three patients of lumbar disease were operated on with bilateral PS fixation in <b>our</b> hospital. The <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> of lumbar pedicles were randomly divided into “hand-free group” (HFG) and “digital virtual template group” (DVTG) in each patient. Two junior surgeons preoperatively randomly divided into these two groups finished the placement of PSs. The accuracy of PS and the procedure time of PS insertion were recorded. The accuracy of PS in DVTG was 91. 8 % and that in HFG was 87. 7 %. The PS insertion procedure time of DVTG was 74. 5 ± 8. 1 [*]s and that of HFG was 90. 9 ± 9. 9 [*]s.

40|$|We {{extend the}} now classic {{structural}} credit modeling approach of Black and Cox {{to a class}} of "two-factor" models that unify equity securities such as options written on the stock price, and credit products like bonds and credit default swaps. In <b>our</b> approach, the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> of the stylized balance sheet of a firm, namely the asset value and debt value, are assumed to follow a two dimensional Markov process. Amongst models of this type we find examples that lead to derivative pricing formulas {{that are capable of}} reproducing the main features of well known equity models such as the variance gamma model, {{and at the same time}} reproducing the stylized facts about default stemming from structural models of credit risk. Moreover, in contrast to one-factor structural models, these models allow for much more flexible dependence between equity and credit markets. Two main technical obstacles to efficient implementation of these pricing formulas are overcome in our paper. The first obstacle stems from the barrier condition implied by the non-default of the firm, and is overcome by the idea of time-changing Brownian motion in a way that preserves the reflection principle for Brownian motion. The second obstacle is the difficulty of computing spread options: this is overcome by using results in recent papers that make efficient use of the two dimensional Fast Fourier Transform. ...|$|R
