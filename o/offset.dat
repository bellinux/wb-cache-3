It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles—which {{is referred to as}} the St. Johns River <b>offset,</b> but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing <b>offset</b> may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the <b>offset.</b> Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by Pangaean rifting.|$|E

On 27 December 2002, the Polish Defence Minister announced the F-16C/D Block 50/52+'s selection. According to Stephen Larrabee, the selection was {{heavily influenced by}} Lockheed Martin's lucrative <b>offset</b> agreement (totaling $3.5 billion and 170% <b>offset</b> against Gripen International's €3.2 billion with 146% <b>offset)</b> and by a political emphasis on Poland's strategic relationship with the US and NATO. Both Gripen International and Dassault Aviation (who offered the Mirage 2000-5 Mk 2) described the decision as political. According to a former Polish military defence vice-minister, the JAS 39 offer was better and included research participation proposals.|$|E

The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E

40|$|<b>Offsets</b> {{have taken}} centre stage in defence trade. To date, more than 78 {{countries}} around the world practice <b>offsets</b> and outstanding <b>offsets</b> obligations run into billions of US dollars However, why have <b>offsets</b> gained such a momentum? Increasingly, both sellers and buyers in the arms trade view <b>offsets</b> as an efficient and effective economic compensation tool to justify arms deals. Buyers, consider <b>offsets</b> as a catalyst for industrial and technological development, employment, creation of value-added activities and skills development. Sellers, on the other hand, perceive <b>offsets</b> as providing product differentiation and competitive advantage in an already tough defence market. The question, though is whether, do <b>offsets</b> really work as claimed? The purpose of this dissertation is to empirically verify the above proposition by evaluating the effectiveness of defence <b>offsets</b> in developing a defence industrial and technological base, using Malaysia’s defence industry as a case study. This study employs a Multi-Method or Triangulation Methodological approach (comprising survey, archival sources and participatory observation) to gather data. Fieldwork research employing questionnaires and interviews were undertaken as part of a survey of Malaysian defence companies, international defence contractors and relevant offsets-related government and non-governmental agencies. These data were further substantiated and consolidated via archival sources, such as government and company reports and also participatory observation. Research analysis indicates that <b>offsets</b> have provided mixed results, in the case of Malaysia. The successes have been mainly focused on technology capability-building and human resource development, limited to through-life-support of the defence equipment and the ancillary systems purchased. Morover, <b>offsets</b> have been successfully used to diversify into civil sectors, mainly aerospace and electronics sectors, leading to increased exports, jobs, backward linkages and technology enhancement in these sectors. However, <b>offsets</b> have had minimal effect on creating joint-production, collaborative activities and R&D programmes, requisites for the process of Malaysianisation. Further, <b>offsets</b> have also been less than effective in increasing employment, and dual-use technology programmes that could provide longterm impact on Malaysia’s economic growth. Overall, Malaysia’s <b>offsets</b> policy has been pragmatic and flexible. The government has played a vital role in ensuring that the <b>offsets</b> policy operates in tandem with Malaysia’s national aspirations. Yet, <b>offsets</b> have had a limited impact on developing and sustaining Malaysia’s defence industrial and technology base. The <b>offsets</b> policy aim and objectives have not been clearly reflected in the <b>offsets</b> process and implementation. As defence <b>offsets</b> will continue to be of an essence in Malaysia’s defence procurement activity, initiatives should be taken to review the <b>offsets</b> policy and implementation processes. The review should augment the effectiveness of <b>offsets</b> in developing measurable and value-added programmes that build a sustainable and competitive Malaysian defence industry. To this end, and based on the research findings of this study, a number of important policy recommendations are advanced to raise the effectiveness of Malaysia’s <b>offsets</b> policy.

40|$|California is {{implementing}} {{the most comprehensive}} global warming regulatory program in the United States. A key part of this program is its cap-and-trade system. Integral to the cap-and-trade requirements are provisions for <b>offsets,</b> whereby companies, to meet their caps, can purchase credits from certain unregulated entities whose activities are deemed to have resulted in real and additional emission reductions. California has attempted to avoid the Kyoto Protocol 2 ̆ 7 s project-by-project lengthy and problematic review of <b>offsets</b> with a performance standard approach for domestic <b>offsets</b> and a sector approach for international <b>offsets.</b> <b>Offsets,</b> even if done right. raise serious environmental justice questions as to who will benefit and who will be harmed as <b>offsets</b> are granted. California 2 ̆ 7 s approach, however. also raises questions about how real these <b>offsets</b> will be, which has already lead to litigation. International <b>offsets</b> are even more troublesome.

40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the governance structure in biodiversity <b>offsets,</b> the arguments for and against it as a delivering mechanism to achieve a “no net loss” target in biodiversity and the current process of innovating biodiversity <b>offsets</b> in the UK. In total, I have analyzed 55 biodiversity <b>offsets</b> programs; to see what governance structures (institutions and actors) characterize biodiversity <b>offsets.</b> Then I have studied the arguments in the academic literature regarding what are the potentials of biodiversity <b>offsets</b> and what problems we are facing. Finally, drivers and processes of the process of introducing UK biodiversity <b>offsets</b> program is described and analyzed using the theory of institutional change. Acknowledging some differences even within programs of the same biodiversity <b>offsets</b> types, the analysis shows three distinct types of biodiversity <b>offsets</b> and in all the three shows variations in their governance structures. These are: compensation, one-off <b>offsets,</b> and habitat banking. Interaction for <b>offsetting</b> in the compensation and one-off <b>offsets</b> takes place between landowners/developers and government bodies (protection authorities and regulators) while habitat banking shows the characteristics of a true market in which multiple buyers and seller interaction via trade with the help of traders. The arguments that support biodiversity <b>offsets</b> includes that the system can overcome the antagonistic nature of development and conservation, possibility to bring about measurable conservation outcome in the form of additionality and the business opportunities it may create by its potential in converting liabilities into asset to land owners. Arguments of opposition include, inability to measure complex nature by reducing into single credit and debit, the uncertainties associated with allowing damage believing in <b>offsetting</b> on another site or in the future, time lags between damage and <b>offsets</b> start giving ecosystem service and loss of social benefits. In the UK case, the need for biodiversity <b>offsets</b> come both from the private sector and the public. A private company, the Environment Bank, is acting as broker in testing the feasibility of biodiversity <b>offsets</b> in the UK. The government through the department for environment and rural affairs (Defra) is actively engaged in piloting the <b>offsets</b> and undertaking consultation with stakeholders. On the other side, environmental groups such as the Friend of the Earth UK, Save Our Wood UK are campagning against the introduction of vi biodiversity <b>offsets</b> in the country. The UK is piloting biodiversity <b>offsets</b> and final decisions whether the system will be formally adopted or not will be know in the summer 2014. In general, biodiversity <b>offsets</b> have short history. So far little is documented concerning the effects of this strategy. Hence, it is premature to make any firm evaluations regarding how they can contribute to halt biodiversity loss. M-IE...|$|R
