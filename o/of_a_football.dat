5|$|As the Laws were {{formulated}} in England, and were initially administered solely {{by the four}} British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.|$|E
5|$|F.: The Football League First Division {{was the top}} {{division}} of English football until 1992, when the Premier League became the top division. At the same time, the second, third and fourth tiers of English football {{became known as the}} Football League First Division, Second Division and Third Division respectively. These three divisions were renamed again in 2004 as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Football</b> League re-branding exercise, becoming known as the Football League Championship, League One and League Two respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, York Park was {{the venue}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> match in which Tasmania {{defeated}} Victoria {{for the first}} time. The match was attended by a record crowd of approximately 15,000. Four years later, the southern stand (demolished in 2004) was completed. In the 1970s another stand was added, capable of holding 650 spectators and incorporating sales kiosks and committee rooms.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Feynman sought medical {{treatment}} for abdominal pains and {{was diagnosed with}} liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer. Surgeons removed a tumor the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February3, 1988. A ruptured duodenal ulcer caused kidney failure, and he declined to undergo the dialysis that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Watched over by his wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine, he died on February15, 1988.|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, ITV offered Parry an {{improved}} bid of £34 million per year, which bettered the BBC's joint-bid with BSkyB. East was confident of closing the deal – he {{was supported by}} 11 club chairmen and was informed that ITV's rivals {{would have to come}} up with £100 million a year to better their offer. Parry was undecided as to which bid he preferred; though he favoured a non-exclusive deal with ITV, he wanted the reconsider its decision to work with subscription companies. He harboured the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> channel and noted SBC's approval amongst other clubs. Parry also hoped BSkyB would increase their bid, which they later did.|$|E

5|$|In August 1928, Arsenal, {{alongside}} Chelsea, {{made history}} by {{becoming the first}} football clubs to wear numbered shirts. A year earlier the first ever live radio commentary <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> match took place, between Arsenal and Sheffield United. Arsenal played in the first match broadcast live on television, against their reserve counterparts in 1937 and have since participated in the world's first live 3D and interactive football matches, both with Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> field, and the ball moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured {{at each end of}} the field for the Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E
5|$|The first {{nighttime}} {{football game}} was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary and ended at halftime in a 0–0 tie. The Army-Navy game of 1893 saw the first documented use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> helmet by a player in a game. Joseph M. Reeves had a crude leather helmet made by a shoemaker in Annapolis and wore it in the game after being warned by his doctor that he risked death if he continued to play football after suffering an earlier kick to the head.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} by the 2015 Group {{takeover of the}} club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms, though the Animo et Fide motto was removed, along with a patch of green {{at the base of}} the badge; the flag of Cheshire, featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and Lancashire, owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010–11 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|As {{a product}} tie-in with the 2005–2006 NFL season, Burger King {{introduced}} a 36 piece party pack as {{a limited time}} offer. This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so appeared {{to be involved in}} the game. Some of the players the King replaced include Steve Young, Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The primary packaging was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed to mimic the texture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football,</b> included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Grays Athletic in 2002 and remained in charge until 2006 {{when he took}} over as manager of Stevenage Borough. He led Grays to victory in the Final of the FA Trophy in 2005 and 2006, and repeated the feat with Stevenage in 2007. In November 2007, he became manager <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Football</b> League team for the first time {{when he took over}} at one of his former clubs, Gillingham, but he was unable to prevent the club's relegation from League One {{at the end of the}} 2007–08 season. He led Gillingham back into League One the following season via the League Two play-off Final, but his contract was terminated after the team were relegated back to League Two the following season. On 1 June 2010, Stimson {{was appointed}} as the new manager of League Two club Barnet, but he was sacked on New Year's Day 2011 with the club near the bottom of the table. He later had a spell as manager with Conference club Kettering Town.|$|E

5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium {{from the end of the}} press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe. The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota could add all 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as it is needed (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If expansion is ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> season.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of {{football}} being played on Tyneside dates from 3 March 1877 at Elswick Rugby Club. Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club {{itself can be}} traced back to the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> club by the Stanley Cricket Club of Byker in November 1881. This team was renamed Newcastle East End F.C. in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in Stanley, County Durham. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, Newcastle West End F.C. formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into St James' Park. The two clubs became rivals in the Northern League. In 1889, Newcastle East End became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March. However, on the other hand, Newcastle West End were in serious financial trouble and approached East End with a view to a take over. Newcastle West End were eventually dissolved, and a number of their players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892.|$|E
