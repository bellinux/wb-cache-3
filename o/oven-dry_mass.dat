In thin sections, outer membrane bridges seen to contact the inner sheath layer suggested that the sheath fabric {{was attached to the}} outer layer of the gram-negative cell wall. The capsular polymers showed an affinity for cationic colloidal iron and polycationic ferritin, indicating that they carry a negative charge. Cell-free sheaths were isolated by treatment with a mixture of lysozyme, EDTA, and N-lauroylsarcosine (Sarkosyl) or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Both Sarkosyl- and SDS-isolated sheaths were indistinguishable in microscopic appearance. However, the Mn-oxidizing activity of Sarkosyl-isolated sheaths was more stable than that of SDS-isolated sheaths. The Sarkosyl-isolated sheaths also contained more 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctanoic acid and more outer membrane protein than SDS-isolated sheaths. The <b>oven-dried</b> <b>mass</b> of detergent-isolated sheaths represented approximately 9 % of the total oven-dried biomass of SP- 6 cultures; the oven-dried sheaths contained 38 % C, 6. 9 % N, 6 % H, and 2. 1 % S and approximately 34 to 35 % carbohydrate (polysaccharide), 23 to 25 % protein, 8 % lipid, and 4 % inorganic ash. Gas-liquid chromatography showed that the polysaccharide was an approximately 1 : 1 mixture of uronic acids (glucuronic, galacturonic, and mannuronic acids and at least one other unidentified uronic acid) and an amino sugar (galactosamine). Neutral sugars were not detected. Amino acid analysis showed that sheath proteins were enriched in cysteine (6 mol%). The cysteine residues in the sheath proteins probably provide sulfhydryls for disulfide bonds that {{play an important role in}} maintaining the structural integrity of the sheath (D. Emerson and W.

The main rosewood timber quality parameters are its {{essential oil}} yield and quality. A hydrodistillation method has been developed for yield determination, but it is time consuming. Here we tested the applicability of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for determining essential oil yield directly from wood powder. Essential oil from 139 wood powders was extracted via hydrodistillation. The measurements were based on the ratio between the extracted essential oil <b>mass</b> and the <b>oven-dried</b> wood <b>mass</b> and were correlated with the wood powder NIR spectra. The calibration model statistical findings demonstrated that NIR could be a fast and feasible alternative method for selecting trees with a high essential oil yield potential. NIR-based predictions obtained in an independent validation set indicated a high correlation (r 2 = 0. 92) with laboratory essential oil yield measurements. This NIR model could help wood managers in selecting trees with a high essential oil yield potential and in developing sustainable rosewood management strategies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} abovegroud biomass of silver fir, European larch and black pine trees. The results are presented as <b>oven-dry</b> <b>mass</b> of stem wood, stem bark and branches. The research was conducted at three sites in Craotia (Fig. 2). The sample consisted of 15 silver fir trees, 28 European larch trees and 40 black pine trees (Fig. 1). Stem wood and bark volume were measured by section method and regression equations were constructed (Table 2). Branch mass and their average moisture content was determined (51. 84 % for silver fir branches, 49. 03 % for European larch branches, and 49. 24 % for black pine branches). Dependence of branch mass on DBH was established (Fig. 7). Using the regression equations, wood volume, bark volume and branch mass were calculated for each DBH {{in the range of}} DBH of sample trees. The results were transformed to <b>oven-dry</b> <b>mass</b> by average oven-dry volume weight of wood and bark of researched species (Table 2) and by applying determined average moisture content of branches. Graphs were constructed showing the dependence of mass of dry matter on DBH, with the related regression equations (Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10). Total dry matter mass of silver fir trees ranges from 18. 29 kg (DBH= 10 cm) to 3759. 93 kg (DBH= 80 cm).

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, an {{increasing}} body of evidence has highlighted the role of functional traits as reliable predictors of species resistance to disturbance and response to environmental gradients. However, most studies focused on functional comparisons at the interspecific level while intraspecific functional trait variation has received remarkably little attention. As intraspecific traits variability is {{a necessary condition for}} species to adapt to environmental changes, studying intraspecific functional traits variation along environmental gradients is a major issue in a context of global change. The aim of our study was to evaluate the extent of intraspecific functional variability of four species along an environmental gradient of water stress at a local scale and to compare species response to the gradient. Calcareous grasslands species are present along a xeric gradient from mesophilous to xerophilous grasslands. Changes of exposure, slope and soil depth lead to differences of water availability for plants along the gradient. We measured the maximum vegetative height (MVH), the specific leaf area (SLA, one side area of a fresh leaf divided by its <b>oven-dry</b> <b>mass)</b> and the leaf dry matter content (LDMC, leaf <b>oven-dry</b> <b>mass</b> divided by its water-saturated fresh mass) on randomly selected individuals along a gradient of xericity on three study sites located in south Belgium. Functional traits were measured on about 60 individuals per site and per species. The soil depth was measured around each individual. The exposure and the slope were measured in order to calculate a heat load index for each individual. The extent of local intraspecific functional variability of our data was compared to data covering the species European range. Results are species dependent but for some study species intraspecific functional variability at local scale is not negligible compared to European data. Species functional responses to the gradient (soil depth and heat load index) showed a decrease in SLA and MVH and an increase in LDMC with increasing xericity for all study species. Response extent was species dependent. Main implications for species resistance to disturbance and climate change adaptation will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop an enhanced modular-based structural stand density management model (SSDMM) and associated algorithmic analogue for upland black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill) BSP.) stand-types situated within the central portion of the Canadian Boreal Forest Region. For a given density management regime, site quality, rotation age, stock-type, cost structure and set of merchantability standards, the hierarchical-based SSDMM enabled estimation of the following metrics: overall productivity (e. g., mean annual volume, biomass and carbon increments), volumetric yields (e. g., total and merchantable volumes per unit area), log-product distributions (e. g., number of pulp and saw logs by diameter class), biomass production and carbon sequestration outcomes (e. g., <b>oven-dried</b> <b>masses</b> of above-ground components and associated carbon equivalents by diameter class), recoverable end-products and associated monetary values (e. g., volume and economic value of recovered chip and dimensional lumber products by diameter class and sawmill-type (stud and randomized length processing protocols)), and fibre quality attributes (e. g., maximum branch diameter and wood density). The core modules which were responsible for describing stand dynamics and structural change were developed using 407 (122 from natural stands and 285 from managed stands) temporal tree-list measurements obtained from 269 (142 in natural stands and managed 127 in managed stands) sample plots (note, natural stands are those that naturally regenerated following a stand-replacing disturbance and have no history of density regulation whereas managed stands are those that naturally or artificially regenerated following a stand-replacing disturbance and have a history of density regulation). The modules responsible for predicting log product distributions, and end-product volumes and values, were developed employing relationships derived from taper and sawmill simulation studies. The modules responsible for predicting biomass and carbon outcomes, and log and fibre quality attributes, were developed using data obtained from initial espacement and thinning experiments. The resultant model introduces a number of advancements over its predecessors including those that (1) ensured mathematical compatibility among yield estimates, (2)  accounted for intrinsic density-independent mortality factors, response delay following thinning, and genetic worth effects, and (3) provided increased flexibility in terms of enabling end-users to change merchantability standards, specify product degrade factors, and adjust cost profiles, according to their unique requirements. As demonstrated, the decision-support model can assist in facilitating the transformative shift towards the production of high value end-products, bio-energy feed stocks, carbon credits, and ecosystem services, currently underway within the Canadian forest sector...|$|R

To protect the substrates from rainfall, direct sunlight, and disturbance by other animals, the pits were covered with polythene sheets reinforced with aluminium mesh. The covers were removed once in 10 days, to assess the termite action, to maintain adequate moisture content and to see if any interference of other soil macro fauna like ants, was occurring. After 60  days, the substrate remaining unconsumed by the termites was carefully removed from the termireactors and air-dried. Care was taken to brush off any soil particles adhering to the surface of the residue. Then, the residue was oven dried at 105 °C to constant weight.|$|R

30|$|Sample {{tree biomass}} {{determination}} procedures are outlined below. Typically, eight trees per stand, selected across the DBH range, were felled and their biomass determined. This entailed measuring total height and diameter over bark {{at the base}} (0.1 [*]m), 0.7 [*]m and 1.4 [*]m (DBH), and at 2 -m intervals along the entire stem length for calculation of stem volume over-bark. The <b>oven-dry</b> <b>mass</b> of the crown was determined as follows: the stem was divided into height zones, which varied from 1 to 3 [*]m in length, depending on total tree length. All dead branches below the live crown were removed, placed on a tarpaulin and weighed fresh in the field. Two of these dead branches were randomly selected and weighed fresh in the field, dried at 70 [*]°C to constant weight (the drying temperature used in New Zealand biomass studies), and dry weight recorded. For each height zone within the live crown, all branches {{were removed from the}} stem, partitioned into live and dead branch categories, and each category weighed fresh in the field, and then two representative live branches and one dead branch from each zone were randomly selected, weighed fresh in the field, and oven-dry weight determined separately for dead and live branch matter, foliage, and reproductive parts. If cone shedding was evident (e.g. in Douglas-fir), the biomass of reproductive parts was considered to be unmeasured. The dry weight of the tree crown components in each zone was calculated by multiplying the sample branch component dry weights by the crown fresh weight sampling fraction. Total crown dry weight was obtained by summing all zone component weights. Stem <b>oven-dry</b> <b>mass</b> was determined as follows: A 5 -cm-thick disc sample was cut at the base of each 2 -m stem section (except at 0.10 [*]m where a 2.5 -cm-thick disc was taken). The over- and under-bark diameters of each disc were measured to provide wood and bark volume, and samples dried to constant weight. The total dry weight of each stem was calculated by multiplying the stem disc dry weights by the stem volume sampling fraction. Aboveground live (AGL) biomass was obtained by summing the crown and stem components.|$|E

Lam. submerged in water of 16 ‰ for up to 7 days. In both experiments, loss of dry mass and changes in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and tannins of the leaves were monitored. In the initial experiment there was a mean loss in dry mass of 24. 6 % after 14 days. The chemical analyses revealed that, {{although there was no}} significant decline in nitrogen concentration, there were sharp decreases in the other constituents. The greatest total loss relative to the amount initially present in the litter was in potassium (83 – 95 %), while the losses for phosphorus and tannins were 57 – 87 % and 74 – 85 %, respectively. In general, losses were greater at 16 ‰ than at 32 ‰, and air-dried leaves showed greater initial losses than fresh leaves.

Stem density, basal area, above-ground biomass and above-ground net primary productivity, including the contribution of litterfall, were estimated from two large permanent census plots of 12 and 10 ha, established on contrasting soil types, and censused twice, first in 1992 ¿ 1994, then again in 2000 ¿ 2002. Mean stem density was 512 stems ha¿ 1 and basal area, 30 m 2 ha¿ 1. Stem mortality rate ranged between 1. 51 % and 2. 06 % y¿ 1. In both plots, stem density decreased over the study period. Using a correlation between wood density and wood hardness directly measured by a Pilodyn wood tester,we found that the mean wood densitywas 0. 63 g cm¿ 3, 12 % smaller than the mean of wood density estimated from the literature values for the species occurring in our plot. Above-ground biomass ranged from 356 to 398 Mgha¿ 1 (<b>oven-dry</b> <b>mass),</b> and it increased over the census period. Leaf biomass was 6. 47 Mg ha¿ 1. Our total estimate of aboveground net primary productivity was 8. 81 MgC ha¿ 1 y¿ 1 (in carbon units), not accounting for loss to herbivory, branchfalls, or biogenic volatile organic compounds, whichmay altogether account for an additional 1 MgC ha¿ 1 y¿ 1. Coarse wood productivity (stem growth plus recruitment) contributed to 4. 16 MgC ha¿ 1 y¿ 1. Litterfall contributed to 4. 65 MgC ha¿ 1 y¿ 1 with 3. 16 MgC ha¿ 1 y¿ 1 due to leaves, 1. 10 MgC ha¿ 1 y¿ 1 to twigs, and 0. 39 MgC ha¿ 1 y¿ 1 to fruits and flowers.

40|$|Human {{pressure}} on forest resources increased significantly {{during the past}} decades through land use and land use change, especially in the tropics where forest clearing is {{a major source of}} CO 2 release in the atmosphere. Consequently, forests are the focus of international environmental policies and discussions aiming to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (i. e. REDD+). The capacity of participating countries to regularly provide accurate forests C stocks measurements at a national scale thus represents an important challenge to address. In dense forests, generally only the above ground biomass (AGB) is measured as it accounts for more than 50 % of total C stocks. However, important gaps remain at each scale of measurement, i. e. from felled tree to regional mapping, with the resulting errors propagation through these different scales being probably the most concerning issue. In the present work, we propose to address these issues by using a multi-scale approach in order to improve our global understanding of AGB variations in dense tropical forests of Central Africa. In particular, we studied (i) forest AGB prediction from remote-sensing textural analysis, (ii) the potential role of largest trees as predictor of the entire forest-stand AGB and (iii) intra- and inter-individual radial variation of wood specific gravity (WSG, i. e. <b>oven-dry</b> <b>mass</b> divided by its green volume) and its potential consequences on the estimation of the AGB of the tree. First, we analyzed the potential use of textural analysis to predict AGB distribution based on very high spatial resolution satellite scenes. In particular, we used the Fast Fourier Transform Ordination (FOTO) method to predict AGB from heterogeneous forest stands of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Here, based on 26 ground plots of 1 -ha gathered from the field, plus a successful combination of Geoeye and Quickbird contrasted scenes, we were able to predict and to map AGB with a robust model (R² = 0. 85; RMSE = 15 %) based on textural gradients. Secondly, the research of AGB indicators was focused on the dissection of the role played by largest trees. Here we found largest trees not only hold large share of forest carbon stock but they contain the print of most of forest-stand structure and diversity. Using a large dataset from western Cameroon to eastern DRC, we developed a non-linear model to predict forest carbon stock from the measurement of only a few large trees. We found the AGB of the 5 % largest stems allow to predict the AGB of the entire forest-stand yielding an R² of 0. 87 at a regional scale. Focusing on largest trees species composition, we also showed only 5 % of species account for 50 % of total AGB. In the end, we investigated inter- and intra-individual WSG variations. Despite recognized inter- and intra-specific variations along the radial axis, their ecological determinants and their consequences on trees aboveground biomass assessments remain understudied in tropical regions. To our knowledge, it has never been investigated in Africa. Using a 3 -D X-Ray scanner, we studied the radial WSG variation of 14 canopy species of DRC tropical forests. Wood specific gravity variance along the radial profile was dominated by differences between species intercepts (~ 76 %), followed by the differences between their slope (~ 11 %) and between individual cores intercept (~ 10 %). Residual variance was minimal (~ 3 %). Interestingly, no differences were found in the comparison of mean WSG observed on the entire core and the mean WSG at 1 -cm under the bark (intercept ~ 0; coefficient = 1. 03). In addition, local values of WSG are strongly correlated with mean value in the global data base at species level. I deeply believe these results favor the development of promising tools to map and to estimate accurately the AGB of tropical forest-stands. The information provided by largest trees on the entire forest-stand is particularly interesting both for developing new sampling strategies for carbon stocks monitoring and to characterize tropical forest-stand structure. In particular, our results should provide the opportunity to decrease current sampling cost while decreasing its main related uncertainties, and might also favor an increase of the current sampling coverage.

40|$|Acacia mearnsii, Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus patula are {{the main}} {{commercial}} plantation species grown in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe. They are a potential source of pulpwood for a proposed bleached kraft pulp and paper mill. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate and evaluate the technical factors to be considered when planning pulpwood plantations. An extensive literature survey of important pulpwood properties, with emphasis on measurable and potentially controllable properties, revealed that neither cellulose, lignin nor extractive content are universally reliable indicators of pulp yield. Wood density emerged as the most important pulpwood property affecting wood handling costs, pulp yield, pulp quality and digester productivity. Among the fibre properties, fibre length and fibre coarseness were found to have large influence on paper properties although this is more important where large differences occur such as those found between softwoods and hardwoods. To provide material for assessing the pulpwood quality, the hardwood species were sampled at single sites from 8 year old trees, while P. patula was sampled at two sites (Erin and Stapleford) from two age classes, 14 and 25 years (ie. 6 stands). For investigation of wood properties within trees, 25 mm thick discs were taken at six height levels (0, 10; 30, 50, 70 and 90 % up to 8 cm diameter over bark) from three sample trees from each of the six stands. The material was also used for pulping within tree of P. patula, by simulating utilisation of 7 year old thinnings, toplogs and slabwood. In order to determine the average pulpwood quality, six trees were sampled from each of the P. patula stands and twelve trees from each of the hardwood stands. A single log (15 cm long) was taken from the trees in rotation from the midpoint of the butt, middle and top third of the stem. Wood density was measured by an x-ray densitometric technique along the north and south radii of all sample trees. Fibre length and coarseness were measured by the Kajaani FS 200 fibre analyser. Investigation of fibre length was carried out on the north radii of a single tree from each of the four P. patula site-age classes, and two trees of each of the hardwoods. Fibre coarseness was only investigated on a single tree of each hardwood species. P. patula fibres caused blockages of the Kajaani capillary which frequently stopped the analysis and invalidated the measurement. A technique was developed for preparing whole fibres for determining length distributions and coarseness. Radial ships, while clamped between perforated metal plates, were partially delignified by kraft pulping and bundles of whole fibres were extracted from the pulped still), thereby avoiding the problem posed by cut and broken fibres. A special procedure was developed, using Millipore filters, to estimate <b>oven-dry</b> <b>mass</b> of the fibres in the suspension used in the Kajaani fibre analyser and through this the fibre coarseness. Wood properties were measured and recorded for each growth ring for P. patula and for every 5 mm section from the pith for the hardwoods. Within-tree data for P. patula were analysed on the basis of the age of tree when the growth ring was formed (year-number). Analyses of variance were used ito examine differences in density, fibre length and fibre coarseness between trees, between the north and south radii, between six height levels and between year- numbers or distances from pith. Regression analysis was used to estimate mathematical equations that best described the pattern of the wood property within the tree. Predicted values calculated from the equations were presented as grey scale maps to illustrate visually the within-tree variation pattern of the properties. P. patula showed an increase in wood density with tree age. The area-weighted mean densities of the 14 year old trees of P. patula were 0. 476 and 0. 492 g/cm 3 respectively for samples from Erin and Stapleford. The respective values for the 25 year old trees were 0. 557 and 0. 544 g/cm 3. A. mearnsii and E. grandis had area-weighted mean density values of 0. 811 and 0. 583 g/cm 3 respectively. For the three species, variation of density between trees, between heights and with year-number or distance from pith was statistically significant. For P. patula and A. mearnsii, density decreased with tree height, while density increased after an initial decrease from 0 to 10 % height level in E. grandis. In both P. patula and A. mearnsii, the overall decrease between 0 % and 90 % height levels was about 20 % for all trees. At all height levels, density increased from pith to bark. For P. patula the rate of increase from pith bark was similar at the different heights, resulting in a cylindrically symmetric within-tree pattern, similar to that reported for P. radiata (Cown & McConchie 1980). A similar pattern was found in A. mearnsii, but the central core of low density extended from about 30 % height level upwards. The pattern of wood density in E. grandis requires further work since the regression equation obtained had a low coefficient of determination and there were no obvious trends apparent. Equations from previous studies (e. g. Malan 1988) also failed to describe the density pattern. The corresponding points along the two radii of both P. patula and A. mearnsii were found not to differ significantly. Although a significant difference was observed in E. grandis, the difference was small in practical terms. Fibre length in P. patula increased with tree age. The ring area-weighted mean fibre length for the 14 year old trees were 3. 48 mm and 3. 07 mm respectively for the samples from Erin and Stapleford. Fibre lengths for the 25 year old trees were 3. 55 and 3. 84 mm respectively for Erin and Stapleford. The fibre length of 0. 89 mm for E. grandis was significantly (at the 5 % probability level) longer than the 0. 76 mm recorded for A. mearnsii. Fibre length varied significantly with tree height and with year-number or distance from pith. The general pattern in all three species was for fibre length to increase from a minimum at the butt, reaching a maximum at 10 or 30 % height level before decreasing towards the apex. Radial increase from pith to bark was more than 100 % at most height levels. In P. patula, most of this increase occurred in the first 10 growth rings from the pith. Unlike wood density, the within tree pattern for fibre length was nearly symmetric conically. These patterns closely resemble those reported for P. radiata (Cown & McConchie 1980). Both hardwood species exhibited a cylindrical distribution of fibre length within-tree. This difference arises from the linear radial increase found in the hardwoods as opposed to the curvilinear increase found in P. patula. E. grandis had coarser fibres, yielding an area-weighted fibre coarseness of 6. 19 mg/ 100 M compared to 4. 23 mg/ 100 m for A. mearnsit. The trend in the mean fibre coarseness is different in the two species. For A. mearnsu, fibre coarseness increased up the tree but in E. grandis there was a decrease with tree height. In E. grandis, fibre coarseness increased with distance from pith, while in A. mearnsu it remained relatively constant. The interesting point is that the radial trends are the reverse of those found for density. These results contradict the generally held view that density and fibre coarseness are correlated. More research is needed to clarify this because, while the relationship was statistically significant for E. grandis, that for A. mearnsii was not significant. Basic density of the pulpwood samples was 414 kg/m 3 for E. grandis, 610 kg/m 3 for A. mearnsii, and averaged 370 and 420 kg/m 3 for the 14 and 25 year-old P. patula. To achieve a Kappa number of between 20 and 30, P. patula, required 18 to 19 % active alkali to produce 44 to 45 % screened pulp yield. For Kappa number 20, A. mearnsii required 12. 5 % active alkali to yield 53. 0 % screened pulp and E. grandis 10. 5 % active alkali for 54. 2 % screened pulp yield. The study demonstrated that the two hardwood species can successfully pulped together resulting in a marginally lower screened yield. A. mearnsii had the highest pulp yield per cubic metre of wood (323 kg) followed by E. grandis (224 kg) and P. patula (174 kg). All pulps could be bleached to a brightness of 87 - 89 % ISO. Lightly beaten pulp from the 25 year old P. patula trees had the highest tear index (18 - 21 mN. m 2 /g), and highly beaten pulps from the 14 year old P. patula trees had the highest tensile index (112 - 115 N. m/g) and burst index (about 9 kPa. m 2 /g). Bleaching reduced tear index but increased tensile index. At 300 Csf, the tensile and tear indices for E. grandis pulp (127 N. m/g and 11. 0 mN. m 2 /g) and for A. mearnsii pulp (103 N. m/g and 9. 4 mN. m 2 /g) would be classified as very good and adequate for use in unbleached packaging papers. A. mearnsii pulp had higher opacity (70 vs 65 %) which is crucial for printing papers. Bleaching reduced tensile index by about 14 % in both species. The pulping and papermaking results of A. mearnsii demonstrates that the conventional prejudice against the use of this species as pulpwood in Zimbabwe may be wrong. Its high density means that on a volume basis, there is more wood material that can be transported and higher pulpwood productivity will enable pulp production from less volume of wood for a given digester capacity. These all have beneficial economic consequences to the pulp producer. The species has the added advantage that it can be successfully co-pulped with the other major hardwood species. A new sampling scheme was developed to provide wood formed when trees were 7 years old. This was useful in demonstrating that pulp yield and papermaking properties of the simulated 7 year old thinnings of P. patula were not influenced by tree age from which they were extracted. Bulk density decreased in the order of slabwood, toplog and 7 year old. Slabwood produced pulp with the highest tear index. This property was about the same for toplogs and 7 year old material. The test results for the P. patula components provided an opportunity for correlation analysis of wood density and fibre length with pulp properties (freeness, bulk, tear index, tensile index, stretch, burst index and air permeance). All handsheet properties examined (except freeness and stretch from high tearing strength pulp) could be predicted in terms of wood density and fibre length to the extent of accounting for at least 69 % of the variation. A model was developed for estimating plantation areas required for the production of the proposed pulp grades. It involves three parameters and the associated coefficients of variation, namely pulp yield (Y), basic density of wood (BD) and mean annual volume increment (MA 1). Using the growth rates of similar species in South Africa and test results from this study, it is estimated that the 60 000 t/y mill could be supplied from about 20 000 ha of dedicated pulpwood plantations. The results show that growing P. patula pulpwood on 25 year rotation as against 14 year rotation will provide high strength pulps for packaging papers.
