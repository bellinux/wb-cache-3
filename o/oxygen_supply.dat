5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood. Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to hemoglobin, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and restricting <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply,</b> and carbon monoxide causing brain lipid peroxidation.|$|E
5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply</b> reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup of carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply,</b> which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E

50|$|The Qinghai-Tibet railway connects Xining, Qinghai Province to Lhasa. The 1,080 km section from Golmud to Lhasa {{was opened}} on July 1, 2006. The rail cars have {{personal}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>supplies</b> to prevent altitude sickness.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply,</b> maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|After {{a poignant}} attempt at radio {{communication}} with a fisherman on Earth who speaks only Eskimoâ€“Aleut, Stone resigns herself to being stranded and shuts down the cabin's <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply</b> to commit suicide. As {{she begins to}} lose consciousness, Kowalski enters the capsule. Scolding her for giving up, he tells her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing jets to propel the capsule toward Tiangong. Stone then realizes that Kowalski's reappearance was a hallucination, but has nonetheless given her the strength of will to continue. She restores the flow of oxygen and uses the landing jets to navigate toward Tiangong on momentum.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractSmoldering is {{an oxygen}} control {{reaction}} and its velocity {{is determined by}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>supplying</b> rate. <b>Oxygen</b> volume fraction gradient was used to characterize <b>oxygen</b> <b>supplying</b> rate in roadway according to situation that the velocity of wind flowing is very low during smoldering in roadway. Relationship of smoldering velocity and oxygen volume fraction gradient in roadway during lignite smoldering was researched in experiment drawing support of seam smoldering simulating experiment device in roadway and one-variable linear regression technology was used to establish the relation equation of smoldering velocity and oxygen volume fraction gradient in roadway when lignite was smoldering.

5|$|Operational {{problems}} have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide groundings. Critically, pilots have experienced a decreased mental status, including losing consciousness. There were reports of instances of pilots {{found to have a}} decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional lability and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing, pressure suit malfunction, side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply</b> and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Later {{variants}} of the Z model were developed. The Z-6 {{was to be}} a reconnaissance aircraft, although it was only built as a prototype. During the war only a few were converted from existing combat variants. The type was selected for weather check flights. It was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 variants, but offensive armament was omitted and extra fuel cells fitted. This increased the fuel load to 2,890 l (578 Imperial Gallons). As flights required higher altitude, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply</b> was increased from 20 to 24 bottles. For long-range flights over water, the larger dinghy of the Z-5 with its updated emergency escape equipment was mandatory during operations. The Z-6s were also used for night fighter operations. Some of the few converted Z-6s had the Ju 88C-6 nose installed and were equipped with machine guns and cannons. The nose proved to be unsatisfactory, and it was redesigned. In the tip of the new nose was an infrared spotlight which was soon made redundant after the introduction of Lichtenstein radar which was fitted to some of the Z-6.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>supplied</b> {{at greater}} than {{atmospheric}} pressure {{has been known}} to damage plants, animals, and aerobic bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Some studies have shown that even breathing oxygen at 21% has some damaging effects. The damaging effects vary depending on the specimen used, its age, physiological state, and diet.|$|R

5|$|Professor Calculus, Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Calculus' {{assistant}} Frank Wolff are aboard {{an atomic}} rocket-powered spacecraft leaving the Earth {{bound for the}} Moon. Soon after takeoff they discover that the detectives Thomson and Thompson have accidentally stowed away onboard, putting a strain on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply.</b> The detectives accidentally turn off the nuclear motor, disrupting the artificial gravity and sending everyone floating until Tintin corrects the problem. They then suffered a relapse of the Formula 14 drug (seen in Land of Black Gold (1950)), resulting in their hair growing rapidly in multiple colours. Calculus subsequently administers a cure. Haddock, who has smuggled whisky aboard the rocket, gets drunk and takes an impromptu spacewalk, during which he briefly becoming a satellite of the asteroid Adonis (at which point, Professor Calculus humorously says he will tell Earth that Adonis has a new satellite {{by the name of}} Haddock) but Tintin is able to rescue him.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply</b> by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated by expanding the rib cage. In buccal pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a {{telegram}} to Bohr asking {{him to come to}} Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's bomb bay. During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his <b>oxygen</b> <b>supply</b> when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway. He passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea. Bohr's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.|$|E

40|$|Pressure {{regulator}} for oxygen allows {{gas flow}} shut off on low-pressure (outlet) side rather than high-pressure (inlet) side. In modified pressure regulator initial rush of oxygen occurs in second stage rather than {{first stage of}} pressure reduction. Large volume of second stage prevents excessive heating of gas. High-pressure source remains on, and first stage reamins pressurized at all times. New regulator reduces danger of fire in aircraft and in medical <b>oxygen</b> <b>supplies...</b>|$|R
30|$|Asphyxiant or {{narcotic}} gases cause {{a decrease}} in <b>oxygen</b> <b>supplied</b> to body tissue, resulting in central nervous system depression, with loss of consciousness and ultimately death.

50|$|The first P-30 was {{delivered}} in January 1934. Testing {{showed that the}} gunner's cockpit was uncomfortable and cold at the high altitudes where the P-30 was intended to fight, while the rearward facing gunners were liable to black out when the aircraft was maneuvered. Despite these concerns, on 6 December 1934, the U.S. Air Corps placed an order for a further 50 P-30As, with more powerful V-1570-61 engines driving a three-bladed variable-pitch propeller and with <b>oxygen</b> <b>supplies</b> for the crew.|$|R

40|$|Six anaesthetized, paralyzed, hypothermic (30 Â° C) {{dogs were}} hyperventilated for 2 hours. During the final 30 minutes, die {{inspired}} mixture was altered from oxygen to air.

The turnover rate in venous blood oxygen content proceeded at a considerably slower rate, t^= 0. 90 minutes. The close agreement of results during hypothermia with results obtained during normothermia indicates that hypothermia per se has no signifi-cant effect upon oxygen turnover rate. When the metabolic requirement for oxygen temporarily exceeds the <b>oxygen</b> <b>supplied</b> by ventilation, the immediate oxygen deficit is paid by the oxygen stored in the body.
