40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five papers in applied labor economics. The first two papers {{are related to}} wage discrimination between males and females, whereas the next two papers are related to labor supply and welfare participation, while the last paper analysis early retirement in Sweden. `Endogenous Schooling and the Distribution of the Gender Wage Gap' studies how the unexplained wage gap is affected by treating years of education in a traditional wage equation as endogenous. The result shows that the estimated wage differentials are substantial higher using OLS than using IV and panel data. We find that the gender wage gap differs substantially across different values of work experience and that the unexplained gender wage gap has increased over time. `Occupational Gender Composition and Wages in Sweden' analyzes the relationship between wages and occupational gender segregation in Sweden controlling for non-random selection into an occupation. The result shows that the unexplained gender wage gap is largest in female dominated occupations and smallest in male dominated occupations. Females' experience earnings profile is steeper for women in male dominated occupations. Ignoring occupational segregation produces considerable higher estimates of the unexplained part of the gender wage gap. `Household Labor Supply and Welfare Participation in Sweden' studies the joint effects of the tax and benefit systems on household labor supply. The estimates from the structural model yielded small wage and income elasticities. A tax simulation showed that reducing the progressivity in the Swedish tax system may have considerable welfare effects. The effect on working hours from the reform was quite small, while the evaluation {{of a change in}} the welfare system showed that the stigma-effect had a substantial impact. `Labor Supply and Welfare Participation of Single Mothers in Sweden' analyzes the effects of changes in income taxes, cost of childcare and social assistance on labor supply for single mothers households. The results show that there is a positive and significant stigma-effect associated with welfare participation. Fixed costs of working {{is an important factor in}} a single mothers' decision to enter the labor market. We find a negative covariance between social assistance and labor supply, which implies self-selection into welfare. Welfare effects from the childcare reform are quite similar across all income deciles, even if predicted increases in hours of work are substantial for the poorest single mother households. `Early Retirement in Sweden' studies the determinants of early retirement from the Swedish labor market for both males and females. The result shows that there is heterogeneity in the underlying preference structure and that the probability of a complete early withdrawal from the labor market increases with age. Blue collar workers have lower probability to take part time pension and full early age retirement than workers from <b>other</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>schemes.</b> Finally, we find that economic incitements affect the decision of Swedish workers to leave the labor market.

40|$|The 2010 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) is {{a system}} for {{classifying}} all occupations in the U. S. economy. The term “occupation ” refers to the “collective description {{of a number of}} individual jobs performed, with minor variations, in many establishments. ” 1 Individual workers in an establishment perform a specific set of tasks that is largely dependent on factors such as the employment size and industry classification of that establishment, as well as the tasks performed by other workers in that same establishment. This combination of tasks makes up an individual worker’s job and while the exact group of tasks is often, but not always, unique to that worker, almost every job is similar to a number of <b>other</b> jobs. <b>Occupational</b> classification <b>schemes</b> organize millions of jobs into discrete groups based upon their similarities as determined by the scheme’s classification principles. 2 The SOC system “is used by Federal statistical agencies to classify workers and jobs into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, analyzing, or disseminating data. ” 3 This paper discusses how a task-based system promotes consistency in the method used for classifying the 840 occupations in the 2010 SOC, and thus enhances comparability of data collected by various statistical agencies.

40|$|In many {{countries}} multi-pillar pension systems are being introduced, which include, as one component, privately managed defined contribution pension schemes. These arrangements are frequently mandatory {{and can be}} regarded as substituting for part of the social security system. There is clear public interest in trying to ensure that they deliver a good quality of benefits to participants. Elsewhere provision of complementary pension schemes is voluntary, with employers often encouraged to set up <b>occupational</b> pension <b>schemes</b> and individuals either required or encouraged to belong to them. Those who {{do not have access to}} an <b>occupational</b> pension <b>scheme</b> are usually able to save through personal pension arrangements. Personal pensions are nearly always defined contribution in nature. In some countries <b>occupational</b> pension <b>schemes</b> are also normally defined contribution. Even in those countries where defined benefit <b>occupational</b> pension <b>schemes</b> are common there is a trend towards the establishment of defined contribution arrangements, often replacing defined benefit schemes.

40|$|<b>Occupational</b> pension <b>schemes</b> are one {{pillar of}} the European pension system; the other pillars are public schemes and {{individual}} pension plans.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} “gender model” of job {{research}} instruments {{that are based}} on the Holland <b>Occupational</b> Classification <b>scheme.</b> The six Holland “environments” constitute a ubiquitous base for tests and measures in career counseling and research. Analysis of the 1973 Quality of Employment Survey provides evidence that the Holland Classification scheme replicates the segmentation of women into certain occupations that generate low pay, even after controlling for worker education, job tenure, and age. Comparable data for male wage earners show a significant segregation away from low-income, predominantly female occupations. Thus the Holland <b>occupational</b> <b>scheme</b> and the instruments based upon it are likely to contribute to the replication of sex-segregated labor markets. The findings suggest that current models of “work” and job counseling tests and techniques may reinforce, rather than eliminate, the economic disadvantages for women...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe European Union {{appears to}} be {{promoting}} {{at the same time}} both cross-national mobility of workers and an increased role for occupational pensions. There is, however, a potential tension between these two objectives because workers risk losing (some of) their pension rights under an <b>occupational</b> <b>scheme</b> as a consequence of their mobility. After long negotiations, the EU has addressed this issue through a minimum standards Directive. Shortly before the adoption of this Directive, the Court of Justice also delivered an important decision in the same field, in the case of Casteels v British Airways. By analysing the resulting legal framework for safeguarding pension rights under <b>occupational</b> <b>schemes</b> in the context of workers’ mobility, we argue that the application of the case law developed by the Court of Justice in the field of free movement of workers has the potential to offer superior protection compared to the Directive. We also highlight the fact that the present legal framework seems to afford a much fuller protection to the intracompany cross-national mobility of workers employed by multinational companies, while also seemingly favouring mobility for highly specialised workers...|$|R

30|$|Researchers {{have taken}} {{at least three}} {{approaches}} to resolving this measurement problem. A first is to use occupations as proxies for job tasks. This has a natural appeal since occupations can readily be conceptualized as bundles of tasks that workers are required to perform. Because <b>occupational</b> classification <b>schemes</b> employed by national statistical agencies typically contain hundreds of distinct occupations, however, occupational codes are far too unwieldy in their raw form to serve as task measures. To make this problem manageable, {{it is necessary to}} boil down a large set of occupation codes to a lower dimensional object. One method is to aggregate many detailed occupations into a few broad categories, e.g., professional, technical, managerial, clerical, production, service, etc. This is typically straightforward because most <b>occupational</b> <b>schemes</b> are hierarchical. Hence, detailed codes are readily collapsed upward into their parent categories.|$|R
40|$|Following the Bismarckian social {{insurance}} tradition, the post-war pension system of France {{has been characterized}} by occupational fragmentation, its strong reliance on pay-as-you-go financing, and by the direct involvement of employers and trade unions in their management. Generous benefits offered a combination of statutory public pension and mandatory occupational pensions, initially crowding out any funded private pensions. However, pension reforms that promoted retrenchment both in the two pay-as-you-go-financed statutory public and <b>occupational</b> pension <b>schemes</b> since the 1990 s {{have resulted in the}} gradual development of funded private pensions. In recent years, the governance of mandatory <b>occupational</b> <b>schemes</b> has been harmonized and inequalities between different occupational categories have been reduced. While the regulatory framework governing voluntarily funded plans (both occupational and personal pensions) has been largely unified, access to these schemes remains mostly limited to high-skilled employees...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess how pension providers deal with uncertainty about longevity when assessing their liabilities and how they report the risks involved. It examines the reporting of UK pension arrangements and finds that there are differences between the reporting of the state scheme, life insurers' pension arrangements and <b>occupational</b> pension <b>schemes.</b> In particular, <b>occupational</b> <b>schemes</b> have poor disclosure of the assumptions they make when assessing liabilities, with underestimates of likely future changes in mortality. The paper suggests improved disclosure together with the design of stress tests that illustrate the range of uncertainty around a figure for risky pension liabilities, helping stakeholders understand the limitations of what are estimates in the financial statements. mortality; pension accounting; risk disclosures; risk measurement; stress tests; valuation of liabilities; liability assessment; occupational pensions; UK pension arrangements; United Kingdom; state pensions; life insurance; financial statements. ...|$|R
