40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} effects of 2 regimens of hormone {{replacement}} therapy during the postmenopausal period on {{the profile of the}} major lipoprotein subfractions (HDL, LDL, and VLDL). METHODS: We carried out a cohort study in 38 postmenopausal patients who were starting their hormone replacement therapy due to gynecological indications, for a period of 12 weeks. Analysis of lipoprotein subclasses was performed through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Hormone replacement therapy cause an increase in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>larger</b> subfractions <b>of</b> VLDL and HDL (p= 0. 008 and 0. 03, respectively) and in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>larger</b> particles <b>of</b> VLDL due to a 36 % increase in the levels <b>of</b> <b>larger</b> particles (p= 0. 004), concomitantly with a 15 % reduction in the levels of smaller particles (p= 0. 04). In regard to HDL, the increase occurred only a 17 % increase in the levels <b>of</b> <b>larger</b> particles (p= 0. 002). No significant change occurred in the distribution pattern of LDL subfractions. CONCLUSION: The proportion <b>of</b> <b>larger</b> subfractions <b>of</b> VLDL and HDL increases after hormone replacement therapy. The increase in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>larger</b> particles <b>of</b> VLDL occurs due to an increase in the levels <b>of</b> the <b>larger</b> subclasses concomitantly with a reduction in the smaller particles. However, an increase in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>larger</b> particles <b>of</b> HDL occurs only due to an increase in the levels <b>of</b> the <b>larger</b> subfractions...|$|R
