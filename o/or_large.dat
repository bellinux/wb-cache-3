5|$|The {{instruments}} used {{in musical}} entertainment are either solely the human voice (2, 6) or solely instrumental (1, 3) {{or some combination}} of the two (4, 5, 7, 8). Whether the performance is given by vocalists or instrumentalists, the performers may be soloists or part of a small <b>or</b> <b>large</b> group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual (10), passing by (3), small (1, 2) <b>or</b> <b>large</b> (6, 7, 8, 9). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably a cappella and overtone singing, are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing (7).|$|E
5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, <b>or</b> <b>large</b> and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5000|$|Membrane pore sizes {{can vary}} from 0.1 to 5,000 nm (4×10−9 to 2×10−4 in) {{depending}} on filter type. Particle filtration removes particles of 1 µm in <b>or</b> <b>larger.</b> Microfiltration removes particles of 50 nm <b>or</b> <b>larger.</b> Ultrafiltration removes particles of roughly 3 nm <b>or</b> <b>larger.</b> Nanofiltration removes particles of 1 nm <b>or</b> <b>larger.</b> Reverse osmosis is in the final category of membrane filtration, hyperfiltration, and removes particles larger than 0.1 nm.|$|R
30|$|We {{examined}} the cases with 10  cm <b>or</b> <b>larger</b> tumors. Four (80  %) {{of the five}} cases with metastasis had 10  cm <b>or</b> <b>larger</b> tumors, while only 1 (3  %) of the 62 cases without metastasis had a 10  cm <b>or</b> <b>larger</b> tumor. Comparing metastatic with nonmetastatic cases, the tumor diameters in metastatic cases were significantly larger (Fisher’s exact test: p <  0.0001) (Table  2).|$|R

5|$|Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, {{and their}} chicks and eggs {{may be taken}} by herons, crows or gulls. Less obvious nest predators include ruddy turnstones in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns <b>or</b> <b>large</b> gulls.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small <b>or</b> <b>large</b> a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as airports <b>or</b> <b>large</b> colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E

5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is defined}} as {{vomiting}} or diarrhea due to infection of the small <b>or</b> <b>large</b> bowel. The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while {{the ones in the}} large bowel are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae).|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth <b>or</b> <b>large</b> volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E
5|$|In this period, steamships on rivers {{such as the}} Ohio and Mississippi <b>or</b> <b>large</b> inland {{bodies of}} water such as the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay offered a {{comfortable}} and relatively fast mode of transportation. The first steamboat to serve Baltimore was the locally built Chesapeake, constructed in 1813 to link Baltimore with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Operated by the Union Line, the boat connected with a stagecoach for the overland portion of the journey. Two years later, the Briscoe-Partridge Line's Eagle was the first steamboat to sail the length of Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals <b>or</b> <b>large</b> pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 silky sharks (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|E
5|$|Pied currawongs are {{generally}} tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres above the ground, and thus {{able to share}} territory with the ground-foraging Australian magpie. Birds roost in forested areas <b>or</b> <b>large</b> trees at night, disperse to forage {{in the early morning}} and return in the late afternoon. Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger flocks of fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or struts.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury is {{well known}} in culinary circles for being the namesake of a classic English dessert. Shrewsbury cakes (or biscuits) are {{typically}} crisp and brittle creations that may incorporate fruit. They can be small in size for serving several at a time, <b>or</b> <b>large</b> for serving as a dessert in their own right. Traditionally Shrewsbury cakes have a distinct hint of lemon.|$|E

5|$|The OSO and OAO {{missions}} {{demonstrated the}} important role space-based observations could play in astronomy, and in 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based reflecting telescope with a mirror 3m in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope <b>or</b> <b>Large</b> Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for manned maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable space shuttle indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.|$|E
5|$|While {{pressing}} {{forward with}} the troops at Mantinea, Epaminondas {{was hit in the}} chest by a spear (or, in some accounts, a sword <b>or</b> <b>large</b> knife). Cornelius Nepos suggests the Spartans were deliberately aiming at Epaminondas in the hope of killing him, and thereby demoralizing the Thebans. The enemy who struck the killing blow was variously identified as Anticrates, Machaerion, or Gryllus, son of Xenophon.|$|E
5|$|A {{mesoscale}} convective complex, <b>or</b> <b>large</b> circular area of thunderstorms, {{developed in}} the Ethiopian Highlands of Africa on July28. The complex moved west-southwestward through the continent, waxing and waning until persisting along a tropical wave on August2. The next day, the wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from Guinea. Once over the open Atlantic Ocean, the wave quickly developed and became Tropical Depression Three later that day. The depression moved to the west-northwest and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4. Alberto continued to strengthen, but moved to cooler waters late on August 5 and weakened briefly. However, the storm strengthened again early on August 6, and it was upgraded to hurricane status as an eye became visible. The upgrade was accompanied with a brief westward turn. However, Alberto continued {{to move to the}} west-northwest later that day, reaching its first peak intensity of 90mph (150km/h) on August 7.|$|E
50|$|The Guitaro's strings {{are longer}} than used on {{medium-sized}} <b>or</b> <b>larger</b> autoharps, {{resulting in a}} lower tone than usual. The instruments have 15 chord bars, and have less strings than most medium <b>or</b> <b>larger</b> sized autoharps, all of which somewhat limits their versatility. Like other autoharps, either fingerpicks or a flatpick can be used.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid <b>or</b> <b>large</b> enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E
5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid <b>or</b> <b>large</b> enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E
5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment <b>or</b> <b>large</b> packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry heavy loads of ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E
