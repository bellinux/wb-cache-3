Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. <b>Our</b> <b>bodies</b> became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
5|$|The third book {{continues}} along {{a similar}} vein, condemning cosmetics {{on the grounds}} that it is our souls, not <b>our</b> <b>bodies,</b> that we should seek to beautify. Clement also opposes the dyeing of men's hair and male depilation as effeminacy. He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth which is found in Christ. The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of a hymn.|$|E

25|$|As taste senses both harmful and {{beneficial}} things, all basic tastes {{are classified as}} either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on <b>our</b> <b>bodies.</b> Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons.|$|E
25|$|Pericutaneous space: The space {{just outside}} <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> but {{which might be}} near to {{touching}} it. Visual-tactile perceptive fields overlap in processing this space. For example, an individual might see a feather as not touching their skin but still experience the sensation of being tickled when it hovers just above their hand. Other examples include the blowing of wind, gusts of air, and the passage of heat.|$|E

25|$|Kurzweil {{notes that}} many {{thoughts}} people have {{are related to}} their bodies, and reassures {{that he does not}} believe in creating a disembodied brain. He reviews all the various body implants that existed when the book was published, explaining that <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> are already becoming more synthetic over time. Kurzweil says this trend will continue and that the technology will advance from macroscopic implants, to cellular sized insertions, and finally to nanotechnology.|$|E
25|$|Society often {{constructs}} our behaviours and beliefs, such {{as personal}} developments, physiological and psychological interactions, {{and the common}} “perception of <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> {{as a reflection of}} self worth”. Body image struggles have been prevalent for many centuries now, especially with the rapid constant shifts in ideal body types. In the past, norms were typically set by cultural beliefs, genders, or social standings. Despite these being prevalent today, changes in the fashion and media industries are other influences at hand.|$|E
25|$|Hiding from Humanity extends Nussbaum's work {{in moral}} {{psychology}} {{to probe the}} arguments for including two emotions—shame and disgust—as legitimate bases for legal judgments. Nussbaum argues that individuals tend to repudiate their bodily imperfection or animality through the projection of fears about contamination. This cognitive response is in itself irrational, because we cannot transcend the animality of <b>our</b> <b>bodies.</b> Noting how projective disgust has wrongly justified group subordination (mainly of women, Jews, and homosexuals), Nussbaum ultimately discards disgust as a reliable basis of judgment.|$|E

50|$|In {{physical}} fitness, {{body composition}} {{is used to}} describe the percentages of fat, bone, water and muscle in human bodies. Because muscular tissue takes up less space in <b>our</b> <b>body</b> than fat tissue, <b>our</b> <b>body</b> composition, as well as our weight, determines leanness. Two people of same sex and body weight may look completely different from each other because they have a different body composition.|$|R
40|$|Pain has the {{evolutionary}} function {{of protecting the}} body. It has been proposed that brain activations in response to nociceptive stimuli reflect, at least partly, the activity of a multimodal attentional system which detects potential dangers in the peripersonal space (that is, the space surrounding <b>our</b> <b>body)</b> and organizes appropriate responses. There is growing interest in understanding how the perception of pain is influenced by body and space representation and, viceversa, how pain can shape the representation of <b>our</b> <b>body</b> and the surrounding space. In this talk, evidence will be discussed about how we localize somatosensory stimuli on <b>our</b> <b>body</b> and how conflicts between vision and proprioception, induced by uncommon body postures and {{by the presence of}} central sensitizatio...|$|R
25|$|According to d'Eslon, Mesmer {{understood}} {{health as}} {{the free flow}} of the process of life through thousands of channels in <b>our</b> <b>bodies.</b> Illness was caused by obstacles to this flow. Overcoming these obstacles and restoring flow produced crises, which restored health. When Nature failed to do this spontaneously, contact with a conductor of animal magnetism was a necessary and sufficient remedy. Mesmer aimed to aid or provoke the efforts of Nature. To cure an insane person, for example, involved causing a fit of madness. The advantage of magnetism involved accelerating such crises without danger.|$|E
25|$|In his 2005 book, The Singularity is Near, Kurzweil {{suggests}} that medical advances would {{allow people to}} protect their bodies {{from the effects of}} aging, making the life expectancy limitless. Kurzweil argues that the technological advances in medicine would allow us to continuously repair and replace defective components in <b>our</b> <b>bodies,</b> prolonging life to an undetermined age. Kurzweil further buttresses his argument by discussing current bio-engineering advances. Kurzweil suggests somatic gene therapy; after synthetic viruses with specific genetic information, the next step would be to apply this technology to gene therapy, replacing human DNA with synthesized genes.|$|E
25|$|Nanotechnology has the {{potential}} to reshape the entire world, Kurzweil exclaims. Assembling materials molecule by molecule could solve energy problems, cure cancer and other diseases, strengthen <b>our</b> <b>bodies,</b> and produce self-assembling food, clothing, and buildings. Kurzweil admits that nanotechnology carries a big risk; a self-replicating substance, without the constraints of a living organism, might grow out of control and consume everything. However he points out that today there are already technologies which pose grave risks, for example nuclear power or weapons, and we have managed to keep them relatively safe, so he feels we can probably do the same with nanotechnology.|$|E

25|$|Previously, genetic {{personality}} studies {{focused on}} specific genes correlating to specific personality traits. Today's {{view of the}} gene-personality relationship focuses primarily on the activation and expression of genes related to personality and forms {{part of what is}} referred to as behavioural genetics. Genes provide numerous options for varying cells to be expressed; however, the environment determines which of these are activated. Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways in which <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> can develop, but the interaction between genes and the shaping of our minds and personality is also relevant to this biological relationship.|$|E

I have traveled through all of the province and have inspected all of the villages and, considering carefully the usefulness the Spanish subjugation has brought to us, I have not found a single thing but painful and inexorable servitude....

25|$|Allergic {{diseases}} {{are caused by}} inappropriate immunological responses to harmless antigens driven by a TH2-mediated immune response. Many bacteria and viruses elicit a TH1-mediated immune response, which down-regulates TH2 responses. The first proposed mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was that insufficient stimulation of the TH1 arm {{of the immune system}} leads to an overactive TH2 arm, which in turn leads to allergic disease. In other words, individuals living in too sterile an environment are not exposed to enough pathogens to keep the immune system busy. Since <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> evolved to deal with a certain level of such pathogens, when they are not exposed to this level, the immune system will attack harmless antigens and thus normally benign microbial objects—like pollen—will trigger an immune response.|$|E
40|$|Why {{bones are}} tough {{although}} consisting of brittle materials? Why bones are tough??? Bone {{is a very}} interesting material in <b>our</b> <b>body.</b> All bones put together called skeleton. To say that no part of exist without bones is not an exaggeration. When a child is born his/her skeleton consists of about 276 bones, but as he/she continues to mature, by the time he/she reaches adult age, number reduces to 206. This is because in the process of maturing he/she looses some bones. Skeleton (Bones) gives a shape to the body. Bones, along with muscles, holds up <b>our</b> <b>body</b> in position, and also gives protection to <b>our</b> <b>body.</b> Try to imagine <b>our</b> <b>body</b> without skeleton in it; I {{think it will be a}} scary thing. Although extensive studies and research is done to understand the behavior, structure and etc [...] about bones some of the important properties about it especially origin of toughness is not perfectly understood.

25|$|Natural Rights/Justice Argument: this {{argument}} is based on Locke's idea that a person has a natural right over the labour and/or products which is produced by his/her body. Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind, {{it is possible to}} apply his argument to intellectual property rights, in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another's ideas. Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create. They argue that we own <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what we create. Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.|$|E
25|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to microgravity causes space adaptation syndrome, a self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system. Long-term exposure causes multiple health problems, {{one of the}} most significant being loss of bone and muscle mass. Over time these deconditioning effects can impair astronauts' performance, increase their risk of injury, reduce their aerobic capacity, and slow down their cardiovascular system. As the human body consists mostly of fluids, gravity tends to force them into the lower half of the body, and <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> have many systems to balance this situation. When released from the pull of gravity, these systems continue to work, causing a general redistribution of fluids into the upper half of the body. This is the cause of the round-faced 'puffiness' seen in astronauts. Redistributing fluids around the body itself causes balance disorders, distorted vision, and a loss of taste and smell.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis {{represents}} an excellent therapeutic {{target for the}} treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult. A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.|$|E
