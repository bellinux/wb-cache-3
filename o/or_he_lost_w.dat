60|$|A {{call for}} the {{competitors}} now drew the Quartermaster and his adversary away, {{and in a few}} moments the second trial of skill commenced. A common wrought nail was driven lightly into the target, its head having been first touched with paint, and the marksman was required to hit it, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> his chances in the succeeding trials. No one was permitted to enter, on this occasion, who had already failed in the essay against the bull's-eye.|$|R
50|$|Certainly, King Hussein {{found him}} indispensable. He ruthlessly tracked down the Hashemite ruler's Nasserite enemies during the {{uprising}} of 1958. In 1960, he restored order after pro-Syrian agents had murdered his cousin, the Jordanian prime minister, Hazza' al-Majali. Forced to relinquish overall command to Cairo {{on the eve}} of the Six-Day War in June 1967, and bemused by conflicting orders, <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> the <b>West</b> Bank to Israel.

5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|R

6000|$|But, alas! {{with the}} book the sounds glided away; and [...] "penna" [...] and [...] "pennam" [...] and [...] "pennis" [...] and [...] "pennæ" [...] were confusedly and indiscriminately mingled. He thought it must be Mara's fault; she didn't read right, or she told him {{just as he was}} going to say it, or she didn't tell him right; <b>or</b> was <b>he</b> a fool? <b>or</b> had <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> his senses? ...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to his natural and copy abilities Kirby makes use {{of a variety of}} power-ups and items. In Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby's first appearance, Kirby did not have Copy Abilities.

5000|$|Repeated {{attention}} (S. avasthāpana, Tib. བླན་ཏེ་འཇོག་པ - slan-te ’jog-pa) is {{when the}} practitioner's attention is fixed on the object {{for most of the}} practice session and she <b>or</b> <b>he</b> is able to immediately realize when she <b>or</b> <b>he</b> has <b>lost</b> their mental hold on the object and is able to restore that attention quickly.

5000|$|John Keats {{published}} {{three books}} of poetry {{in his lifetime}} but was dismissed as a middle-class interloper by most critics. He had no advantages of birth, wealth <b>or</b> education; <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> his parents in childhood, watched one brother die of tuberculosis and the other emigrate to America. Poverty kept him from marrying the woman he loved. And he achieved lasting fame only after his early death in 1821. Yet grief and hardship never destroyed his passionate commitment to poetry.|$|R

60|$|The days passed, the weeks. But {{everything}} seemed to have fused, gone into a conglomerated mass. He could not tell one day from another, one week from another, hardly one place from another. Nothing was distinct <b>or</b> distinguishable. Often <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> himself for an hour at a time, could not remember what he had done.|$|R
50|$|Alexander did not contest {{any further}} Parliamentary {{elections}} but in 1938 {{it was reported}} that he was likely to be selected as the candidate of the National Government in the constituency of Bermondsey West in opposition to the sitting Labour MP, Alfred Salter. The intervention of the Second World War meant the general election due to be held by 1940 was postponed and Alexander did not get to contest Bermondsey. It is not clear when <b>or</b> why <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> faith with the Labour Party <b>or</b> why <b>he</b> should have been drawn to Sir John Simon's Liberal Nationals.|$|R
50|$|Although the werewolves did {{completely}} {{recover from}} wounds made by non-silver weapons, the series never explored {{whether or not}} werewolves could regenerate missing limbs. Skorzeny, who wore an eye patch over his left eye, did seem to regenerate his missing eye when he transformed into his werewolf form. But {{when he returned to}} his human form, he once again wore the eye patch. It was never explained why this was, <b>or</b> if <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> the use of the eye or the eye itself when he was in human form.|$|R
60|$|Barbara began rather weakly, but {{her voice}} {{gathered}} strength, and then poured full volume to the end, where it weakened again. He {{knew that she was}} taking refuge from him in the song, and in the magic of her voice he escaped from the disappointment he had been suffering. He let his head drop and his eyelids fall, and in the rapture of her singing he got back what <b>he</b> had lost; <b>or</b> rather, <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> himself again to the illusion which had grown so precious to him.|$|R
5000|$|Off the court, he {{has served}} as a youth {{minister}}.
