5|$|Dayton {{has been}} the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s. According to the National Park Service, citing {{information}} from the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870. The Wright brothers, inventors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane,</b> and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton. The city was also home to James Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E. Morgan's hydraulic jump, a flood prevention mechanism that helped pioneer hydraulic engineering. Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet and novelist, penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became {{an integral part of}} the city's history.|$|E

5|$|Military trials with {{civilian}} airplanes {{were first}} conducted in 1911, resulting in many crashes {{that failed to}} persuade Swiss authorities of the military utility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane.</b> From September 4 to 6, 1911, Failloubaz participated as pilot (his friend Gustave Lecoultre as observer) to an exercise with the 1st Swiss Army Corps and demonstrated the military possibilities of aircraft with his Dufaux 5; {{the beginning of the}} military aviation in Switzerland. Only after the Swiss Officers' Society collected approximately 1,723,000Swiss francs in 1912– a very large sum for the time – in a national fund drive to the create an air force, did the Swiss Federal Council order the establishment of a Fliegerabteilung on 3 August 1914. The government also decreed that only bachelors could become military pilots, to avoid the payment of expensive widow's pensions in the event of casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture and}} flight tests of Koga's Zero is usually {{described}} as a tremendous coup for the Allies as it revealed the secrets of that mysterious aircraft and led directly to its downfall. According to this viewpoint, only then did Allied pilots learn {{how to deal with}} their nimble opponents. The Japanese could not agree more... Yet those naval pilots who fought the Zero at Coral Sea, Midway, and Guadalcanal without the benefit of test reports would beg to differ with the contention that it took dissection of Koga's Zero to create tactics that beat the fabled airplane. To them the Zero did not long remain a mystery plane. Word quickly circulated among the combat pilots as to its particular attributes. Indeed on 6 October while testing the Zero, Akutan Zero test pilot Frederick M. Trapnell made a highly revealing statement: 'The general impression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> is exactly as originally created by intelligence—including the performance'.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 191 brought strong {{criticism}} from the media regarding the DC-10's safety and design. The DC-10 {{had been involved in}} two accidents related to the design of its cargo doors, American Airlines Flight 96 (1972) and Turkish Airlines Flight 981 (1974). The separation of engine one from its mount, the widespread publication of the dramatic images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> missing its engine seconds before the crash, and a second photo of the fireball resulting from the impact, raised widespread concerns about the safety of the DC-10. The final blow to the airplane's reputation was dealt two weeks after the crash, when the aircraft was grounded by the FAA. Although the aircraft itself was later exonerated, the damage in the public's eye was already done.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{incident to}} result in more than 50 fatalities did not involve an airplane. On 21 December 1923, the Dixmude, a rigid airship of the French Navy, was reportedly struck by lightning and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, off Sicily, Italy. All 52 crew and passengers were killed. Nearly 10 years later, the , also a rigid airship, encountered severe weather and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, off Barnegat Light, New Jersey, killing 73 of those on board. It was another 5 years before a fixed-wing aircraft incident claimed more than 50 fatalities. On 24 July 1938, A Curtiss Hawk II crashed into spectator stands in the Santa Ana air show disaster. 52 spectators were killed {{on the ground in}} addition to the pilot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane.</b> One month later on 24 August 1938, the Japan mid-air collision in Tokyo claimed 53 lives on the ground in addition to the 5 crew members aboard both planes.|$|E
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired to the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2004, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) awakens disoriented in {{the jungle}} and notices a yellow Labrador {{retriever}} (Madison) darting through the bamboo forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by the carnage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), enlisting Hurley (Jorge Garcia) to watch her, and administering CPR to Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell), saving her life. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond the beach to tend to his own injuries, when he notices Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping suture a wound on his back. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's galley and distributes them to the survivors. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) refuses chocolate offered by her brother Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), believing that rescue is imminent. A Korean man, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), tells his wife, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), in Korean that she should remain close to him at all times.|$|E
50|$|As {{there is}} {{increasing}} use of composite materials in aircraft construction (e.g. the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350), delamination is an air safety concern, especially in <b>the</b> tail sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplanes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Further {{design changes}} to simplify {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model 8 vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer were implemented in 1947. These changes were alleged to save several hundred man-hours in <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplanes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane,</b> including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007 {{video game}} , Drake tracks a {{treasure}} {{located on a}} remote tropical island. As the game opens, Drake, accompanied by reporter Elena Fisher, recovers the coffin of his (then assumed) ancestor Sir Francis Drake, which he located from coordinates inscribed on a family heirloom: a ring Drake wears around his neck. The coffin contains Sir Francis Drake's diary, which gives the location of El Dorado. Pirates attack and destroy Drake's boat, but Drake's friend Victor Sullivan rescues the two. When Sully and Drake follow the diary to the indicated spot, they learn that El Dorado is a large golden idol that the Spanish had tried to remove from the island centuries ago. After finding a U-boat, mercenaries led by Gabriel Roman intercept Drake, Fisher and Sully. Sully is shot but Drake manages to escape to an island where Sir Francis Drake's diary claims the idol is located. On {{the way to the}} island, anti-aircraft fire forces Elena and Drake to bail out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> and they are separated. Drake heads toward an old Spanish fort to find Elena. Though briefly captured, Drake and Elena reunite and flee to the old customs house on the island. There they find that Sully has survived his gunshot wound. Drake discovers that the idol is located near the customs house, and finds and rescues Sully. Drake realizes that the idol is cursed, and that it turned the Spanish and Kriegsmarine searching for it into zombified monsters. Drake attempts to stop Roman from removing the idol from the island, and arrives in time to see Atoq Navarro, a man hired by Roman, find the statue. Navarro tricks Roman into becoming cursed. Drake then jumps onto the statue and rides it as it is airlifted onto a boat in the bay. There he defeats Navarro and manages to sink the idol {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. Sully arrives and Elena and Drake leave the island with several chests of treasure, after displaying affection towards each other.|$|E

2500|$|The NTSB further {{determined}} that the pilot's faulty mental model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane's</b> automation logic led to his inadvertent deactivation of automatic airspeed control. In addition, Asiana's automation policy emphasized <b>the</b> full use <b>of</b> all automation and did not encourage manual flight during line operations. The flight crew's mismanagement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>airplane's</b> vertical profile during the initial approach led to a period of increased workload that reduced the pilot monitoring's awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilot flying's actions around <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unintended deactivation <b>of</b> automatic airspeed control. Insufficient flight crew monitoring of airspeed indications during the approach likely resulted from expectancy, increased workload, fatigue, and automation reliance.
