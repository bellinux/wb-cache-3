5|$|The Quincy Convention of October 1845 passed resolutions {{demanding}} that the Latter-day Saints withdraw from Nauvoo by May 1846. A few days later, the Carthage Convention called for establishment of a militia that would force them <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{failed to meet the}} May deadline. To try to meet this deadline and to get an early start on the trek to the Great Basin, the Latter-day Saints began leaving Nauvoo in February 1846.|$|E
5|$|Alice Howland, a {{linguistics}} {{professor at}} Columbia University, celebrates her 50th birthday with her physician husband John {{and their three}} adult children. After she forgets a word during a lecture and becomes lost during a jog on campus, Alice's doctor diagnoses her with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Alice's eldest daughter, Anna, and son, Tom, take a genetic test to find <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> will develop the disease. Alice's younger daughter Lydia, an aspiring actress, decides not to be tested.|$|E

First, they secure the {{allegiance}} of the Wildlings, {{who are still}} indebted to Jon for saving them at Hardhome, and are aware the Boltons will wipe them <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> do nothing. They also manage to secure the allegiance of House Mormont when Davos warns the young Lady Lyanna Mormont of the dangers the White Walkers pose. However, {{they are unable to}} secure the allegiance of House Glover, with Lord Robett Glover pointing out how Robb Stark failed to protect his home from the Ironborn.|$|E

5|$|Handled {{the ball}} was {{formerly}} one of the methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It dictated that either batsman can be given <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batsman handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and was a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: {{in the history of}} cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batsman thought that {{the ball was}} going to hit their wicket, and knocked it away from the stumps with their hand.|$|E
5|$|In this period, it {{was common}} for {{aspiring}} Australian artists to seek further training in Europe, particularly London and Paris. Henry Rix arranged to take his family there {{in conjunction with a}} trip he was making to study British education reforms, purchasing first-class tickets to travel in 1906. But Henry, who had been overworked and ill, died suddenly, and for a time it appeared the trip might not happen. Denied a widow's pension (Henry had been 58: too young for his wife to be eligible), the family had to reorganise their affairs and work <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could afford to get to Europe. Finally, by combining an inheritance, rental income from their home, and money raised through the sale of works by both mother and daughter, they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths, and they set sail for England early in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at 15–36 months and males at 4–5 years. Mating may occur anytime after {{reaching}} sexual maturity, but is mostly {{seen in the}} rainy season. In Zambia, young are born in July and August, while elsewhere it is the mating season. Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass, and some males and females start mating {{with each other in}} separate pairs. Males chase the females to find <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are in estrus. They also test the female's urine. Usually, a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with. Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which their hard horns are used. It is 2–4 hours before a female allows a male to mount. Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period. The dominant male can mate with more than one female. Females have a gestation period of 9 months, and give birth to only one calf each time.|$|E

5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should cancel each other <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him {{if he does not}} return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E

25|$|Effectiveness of {{authority}} {{refers to the}} ease in which {{the intentions of the}} political executive can be transformed into legislative or regulatory action. This is important because the governments and agencies can use implied threats of price controls, additional regulation or taxation to induce certain behaviours from companies. Such threats will only have credibility if companies think that these threats will be carried <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> do not comply.|$|E
25|$|Gleeson {{preferred}} to bowl downwind on a greenish surface, since pace from the wicket compensated for his {{not being a}} large spinner of the ball. His accuracy resulted in his mainly being used for defensive purposes, rather than an attacking one. Under the old lbw law, batsmen could not be given <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were struck outside off stump, allowing batsmen to safely use their pads without offering a shot to nullify his googly.|$|E

25|$|The {{regiment}} moved via steamboat from Camp Rector {{down the}} Mississippi and {{back up the}} White River to Pocahontas, Arkansas, where they were sworn into Confederate service. Under the command of Colonel Patrick Cleburne, the unit was transferred from state service to Confederate service on July 23, 1861, at Pitman's Ferry, AR and was initially designated as the 1st Arkansas Infantry; This transfer was not binding on the men, who could opt <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> so desired. The men of Company C (Yell Guards) and Company G (Hindman Guards) declined to transfer to the Provisional Army of the Confederate States, so the men were honorably discharged and their companies were disbanded.|$|E
25|$|Modern alternatives, {{such as the}} telegraph, telephone, telex, facsimile, and email, {{have reduced}} the {{attractiveness}} of paper mail for many applications. These modern alternatives have some advantages: {{in addition to their}} speed, they may be more secure, e.g., because the general public can not learn the address of the sender or recipient from the envelope, and occasionally traditional items of mail may fail to arrive, e.g. due to vandalism to mailboxes, unfriendly pets, and adverse weather conditions. Mail carriers due to perceived hazards or inconveniences, may refuse, officially or otherwise, to deliver mail to a particular address (for instance, if there is no clear path to the door or mailbox). On the other hand, traditional mail avoids the possibility of computer malfunctions and malware, and the recipient does not need to print it <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wish to have a paper copy, though scanning is required to make a digital copy.|$|E

25|$|Each duplex {{sequencing}} read {{contains a}} fixed 5-nucleotide sequence (shown in figures in Black color) located upstream of the 12-nucleotide tag sequence. The reads are filtered <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{do not have}} the expected 5-nucleotide sequence or have more than nine identical or ambiguous bases within each tag. The two 12-nucleotide tags at each end of reads are combined and moved to the read header. Two families of reads are formed that originate from the two strands of DNA. One family contains reads with αβ header originating from strand 1 and the second family contains reads with βα header originating from strand 2 (Figure 2). Then the reads are trimmed by removing the fixed 5 bp sequence and 4 error prone nucleotides located at the sites of ligation and end repair. The remaining reads are assembled to consensus sequences using single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) assembly and duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly.|$|E
500|$|The act had various {{consequences}} - {{as well as}} allowing {{third parties}} to enforce terms it also {{made a number of}} exceptions to the basic rule unnecessary, such as claiming on behalf of another party as seen in Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd [...] 1 WLR 1468. [...] It does not repeal or abolish these exceptions, however, and this allows the courts to accept cases based on the old common law exceptions as well as the 1999 Act. The Act specifically allows parties to exempt the provisions of the Act from contracts, allowing them a way <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> so choose.|$|E
