5|$|The battle {{lasted about}} two hours, and {{involved}} innovative tactics and technology. By {{the end of}} the day, the IAF had destroyed 29 of 30 SAM batteries deployed in the Beqaa Valley and shot down between 82–86 enemy aircraft with minimal losses.

5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites {{went out to the}} fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza <b>on</b> <b>Israel</b> Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E

5|$|Arafat {{was born}} to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where {{he spent most of}} his youth and studied at the University of King Fuad I. While a student, he embraced Arab {{nationalist}} and anti-Zionist ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Returning to Cairo, he served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956. In the latter part of the 1950s he co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organisation seeking the disestablishment of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. In the latter part of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the PLO and in 1969 was elected chair of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon. There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks <b>on</b> <b>Israel,</b> resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{proved to}} be an {{energetic}} and effective constituency member. He also served for a year as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland. However, it became apparent that he was not likely to progress as a minister. His main political interest was the British Army and he was frequently critical of the Army’s leadership. For example, in August 1970 he was quoted as having referred to ”… those bastards in Whitehall”. He gravitated towards {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party. He opposed British membership of the European Community, Rhodesian sanctions, and the arms embargo <b>on</b> <b>Israel.</b> He became a prominent member of both the Monday Club and the Anglo-Rhodesian Society. Mitchell became known as a maverick MP and was one of 39 Conservative rebels who defied the Party whip to vote against British entry to the EEC in the Commons vote on 28 October 1971.|$|E
