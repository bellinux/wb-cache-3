5|$|Still Jennifer Lopez is a women's {{fragrance}} {{endorsed by}} American entertainer Jennifer Lopez, released by Coty, Inc. in October 2003. The fragrance contains notes of sake, mandarin, early grey, pink freesia, honeysuckle, orange flower, sandalwood, amber and <b>orris.</b> Still Jennifer Lopez {{followed in the}} footsteps of Glow by JLo, an international success that shaped the fragrance industry and began a trend in the celebrity endorsement of fragrance. The release of Still Jennifer Lopez was not anticipated due to the negative publicity generated from Lopez's film Gigli (2003) and a fall-out with her manager Benny Medina. Several fragrance industry experts noted that it could ruin the success of Glow by JLo. It was also noted that her public image at the time would have irreparable effects on the fragrance's performance.|$|E
25|$|Rhizomes of the German Iris (I. germanica) and Sweet Iris (I. pallida) are traded as <b>orris</b> {{root and}} are used in perfume and medicine, though more common in ancient times than today. Today Iris {{essential}} oil (absolute) from flowers are sometimes used in aromatherapy as sedative medicines. The dried rhizomes are also given whole to babies to help in teething. Gin brands such as Bombay Sapphire and Magellan Gin use <b>orris</b> root and sometimes iris flowers for flavor and color.|$|E

25|$|Sometime in December 1865, {{crew members}} S.S. Lee, <b>Orris</b> M. Brown, John T. Mason and W.C. Whittle sailed from Liverpool to Buenos Aires, via Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo.

As the animosity of the United States Government began to soften towards them, Brown and Mason returned home; Lee and Whittle returned sometime later.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{botanicals}} or flavouring {{agents for}} gin, besides the required juniper, often include citrus elements, such as lemon and bitter orange peel, {{as well as}} a combination of other spices, which may include any of anise, angelica root and seed, <b>orris</b> root, licorice root, cinnamon, almond, cubeb, savory, lime peel, grapefruit peel, dragon eye (longan), saffron, baobab, frankincense, coriander, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cassia bark or others. The different combinations and concentrations of these botanicals in the distillation process cause the variations in taste among gin products.|$|E

500|$|According to Lopez's parfum {{and beauty}} website, Still Jennifer Lopez [...] "is {{the scent of}} a woman. A scent that captures the way a woman feels when she has {{discovered}} herself." [...] The fragrance is split into three sections of notes, [...] "Sheer", [...] "Captivating" [...] and [...] "Real". Its top note is sake, while also containing mandarine, earl grey, pink freesia, honeysuckle, orange flower, sandalwood, amber and <b>orris.</b> Michele Scannavini stated that the scent's [...] "unusual" [...] top note of sake was Lopez's idea. The bottle is shimmering and personalized with a removable complimentary diamond faux ring at its neck, which was included because of Lopez's love for jewelry.|$|E
500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, <b>orris</b> (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E

2500|$|For <b>orris</b> root production, iris {{rhizomes}} are harvested, dried, and aged {{for up to}} 5 years. In this time, the {{fats and}} oils inside the roots undergo degradation and oxidation, which produces many fragrant compounds that are valuable in perfumery. The scent {{is said to be}} similar to violets. [...] The aged rhizomes are steam-distilled which produces a thick oily compound, known in the perfume industry as [...] "iris butter" [...] or <b>orris</b> oil.|$|E

60|$|The {{old lady}} went {{away with her}} medicine, and Mr. Shaynor and I stamped on the tiled floor behind the counter to keep {{ourselves}} warm. The shop, {{by the light of}} the many electrics, looked like a Paris-diamond mine, for Mr. Cashell believed in all the ritual of his craft. Three superb glass jars-- red, green, and blue--of the sort that led Rosamund to parting with her shoes--blazed in the broad plate-glass windows, and there was a confused smell of <b>orris,</b> Kodak films, vulcanite, tooth-powder, sachets, and almond- cream in the air. Mr. Shaynor fed the dispensary stove, and we sucked cayenne-pepper jujubes and menthol lozenges. The brutal east wind had cleared the streets, and the few passers-by were muffled to their puckered eyes. In the Italian warehouse next door some gay feathered birds and game, hung upon hooks, sagged to the wind across the left edge of our window-frame.|$|E
