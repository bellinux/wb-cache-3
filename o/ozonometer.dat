40|$|Results of {{the total}} column ozone {{measurements}} at the ground-based solar radiation monitoring station in Chisinau, Moldova are presented. Column ozone content {{was derived from the}} ratios of direct solar ultraviolet radiances measured at 3 discrete wavelengths 305 -, 312 -, 320 -nm within UV-B range. Ozone measurements are regularly carried out with hand-held MICROTOPS II <b>Ozonometer,</b> Solar Light Co. Monthly averages of total column ozone content measured with MICROTOPS II <b>ozonometer</b> at the Chisinau site are in close agree-ment with those retrieved from the multi-year (1957 - 2005) measurements carried out at num-ber of ground stations and at the satellite platforms Nimbus- 7, Meteor- 3, and Earth Probe equipped with the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). Total ozone content reveals distinctive seasonal variation at the Chisinau site with maximum and minimum values in spring and fall, respectively. Climatic mean value of total column ozone content derived from TOMS data at the Chisinau site amounts to 334. 7 DU. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Instruments {{are divided}} into two groups, ground based {{instruments}} and satellite-borne instruments. The ground based instruments include a Dobson ozone spectrophotometer, a filter <b>ozonometer,</b> and ozonesondes. The satellite-borne instruments include: a backscatter ultraviolet spectrometer, a high resolution infrared radiation sounder, a infrared interferometer spectrometer, a limb radiance inversion radiometer, and multichannel filter radiometer. A list of investigations using stratospheric satellite data is presented...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} an intercomparison of five total ozone spectrophotometers are presented. These are the Dobson spectrophotometer, the USSR M- 83 <b>ozonometer,</b> the Canterbury filter photometer, the SenTran Company filter photometer, and the Brewer grating spectrophotometer. The {{pertinent}} characteristics of each are described, and conclusions are drawn about {{the agreement of}} each instrument's measurements with the Dobson's values over a time period of nearly one year. A discussion {{of the importance of}} calibration and long-term stability and reliability is included...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is focused on {{validation}} of the recent SCIAMACHY nadir level 2 data by means of comparisons with correlative ground-based measurements over Russia and Western Europe in 2004. The newly available validation dataset, based on the SCIAMACHY level 2 off-line processor version 3. 00 (OL 3. 00), was compared with the measurements of 14 Russian UV filter <b>ozonometers</b> M- 124 and 3 French SAOZ UV-visible zenith-sky spectrometers. According to the results, the new SCIAMACHY dataset, OL 3. 00, demonstrate better agreement with ground-based M- 124 ozone measurements. In addition, our ground-based validation datasets were compared with correlative measurements of ERS- 2 GOME, AURA OMI and SCIAMACHY stratospheric NO 2 column (scientifi...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{latitude}} variation of ozone vertical distribution the complex experiment {{was carried out}} in February to July 1985 between 40 deg N to 70 deg S at the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. The great bulk of their data network were taken by the optical rocket <b>ozonometers</b> at the Southern Hemisphere. The results were compared with reference models containing the most extensive set of ozone observations from VS satellites between 1978 and 1982. To analyze latitude-season ozone variability at fixed altitude levels the experimental ozone concentration data were confirmed with model equatorial data. To compare the experimental data with reference model data, analogous model values were calculated. The results of calculation indicated a good agreement between experimental and reference model data of relative latitude-season variations of ozone concentration. Maximum variability is observed at 50 km in the equator and not exceeded 15 percent in the other regions at all altitude levels...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its light}} {{attenuation}} and scattering properties, aerosols influence radiance measured by satellite for ocean color remote sensing. Therefore, atmospheric correction algorithms require {{the estimation of}} aerosol parameters from the same satellite data. Especially the vertical profiles of aerosol size distribution and concentrations are important in such validations. The measurements were {{carried out in the}} coastal areas of the southern Baltic Sea during eight measurement campaigns between 1998 and 2003 and in Duck N. C. (USA Atlantic coast) during the EOPACE campaign in 1999. The Baltic measurements were made simultaneously on shore and onboard the r/v Oceania using Microtops II sunphotometers and <b>ozonometers,</b> sun-radiometer Hires A, and a lidar system, which provided data regarding the vertical profiles of aerosol size distribution and concentrations. Several campaigns between 2000 and 2002 were aimed at the validation of data provided by the Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (MOS) onboard satellite IRS/P 3. Thus the measurements were made during and beside satellite overpasses. During all campaigns the full meteorological coverage was obtained from the in-situ measurements and the coastal meteorological stations. The air mass trajectories were obtained from the British Atmospheric Data Center. The ground-truth data from the Baltic studies have been successfully used to both radiometric validation of MOS satellite data and for product validation of optical aerosol parameters estimated by atmospheric correction algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Presented are {{the ozone}} {{investigation}} results {{obtained in the}} tropical zone. Measurements of the total ozone content (TOC) were {{carried out by the}} <b>ozonometer</b> M- 124. The <b>ozonometer</b> was automated to investigate the ozone intradiurnal variations and to increase precision of the TOC measurements. Obtained results allowed us to follow the effect of tropical cyclones (TC) on the TOC field. Several days before the TC formation the TOC increase is observed in daily mean course compared with the background one. Three types of trend can be singled out in the TOC intradiurnal course: zero, parabolic, quasi-linear. Maximum velocities of a trend are observed some days before the TC formation. Analogous harmonic constituents are mainly presented as spectrum of daily means of ozone, mean and absolute velocities of trend and dispersion as well as spectra of meteorological, hydrometeorological and actinometric values. Revealed is a number of day-to-day ozone variations concerned with large-scale circulations; moisture content in the atmosphere. Obtained are the data about short-period ozone waves (period less than a day). Thin-film silver sensors were used to measure the vertical ozone distribution (VOD). Atmospheric aerosol and VOD measurements were carried out simultaneously, they gave data of the VOD layered structure, where the VOD local minima coincided with the position of aerosol layers' maxima...|$|E
40|$|Stratospheric ozone is {{normally}} measured using stationary equipments, {{such as a}} Dobson spectrometer and filter <b>ozonometer,</b> which have the disadvantages of large size, high price and high cost for operation and maintenance. In this work, a balloon-borne photostimulated ozone sensor based on indium oxide nanoparticles has been developed to measure stratospheric ozone. Using the remote compact energy-saving room-temperature ozone sensor, a vertical distribution of ozone concentration with a high resolution was obtained, and the ozone concentration at ~ 27 km over sea level between Lake Constance, Germany and Lake Zurich, Switzerland {{was determined to be}} ~ 5. 6 ppm...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of total}} ozone content (TOC) and aerosol optical {{thickness}} (AOT) at 1020 nm are fulfilled with microprocessor-controlled hand-held <b>ozonometer</b> MICROTOPS (MTOPS) # 7351 at the ground-based station at the Institute of Applied Physics since July 2003. It was shown that MTOPS readings {{are very sensitive to}} errors resulting from mispoin-ting of the instrument to the Sun. The errors in retrieved TOC values may reach up to 50 % depending on Sunâ€™s spot position in the sun targeting window of the <b>ozonometer.</b> MTOPS calibration characteristics are analyzed with the Langley calibration plots for clear cloudless days at the Chisinau site. Variability of evaluated calibration characteristics of instrument du-ring period of observation consists of less than 2 %. AOT values at 1020 nm retrieved from MTOPS measurements are found to be smaller than AOT from CIMEL sunphotometer ope-rating at the Chisinau site within framework of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) under the supervision of NASA/GSFC. Discrepancy between AOT values from MTOPS and CIMEL consists, on an average, ~ 0. 028 and {{this is due to the}} absence of temperature correc-tion of 1020 nm channel of MTOPS. Mean ratio of daily TOC from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aboard of Earth Probe (EP) satellite divided by TOC from MTOPS and mean ratio of daily TOC from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard of Aura satellite divided by TOC from MTOPS is 0. 960 and 0. 990, respectively...|$|E
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that both the total amount and the {{vertical}} distribution of atmospheric ozone are presently measured routinely by various ground-based and satellite-borne instruments and by instruments mounted on different carrier platforms such as balloons, aircraft, and rockets. The techniques of observing atmospheric ozone are discussed, {{taking into account the}} determination of total ozone, the Dobson spectrophotometer, the Brewer spectrophotometer, the M- 83 Filter <b>Ozonometer,</b> and satellite techniques. In a discussion of studies of vertical distribution, remote systems are considered along with in situ measurements. Attention is given to ground-based methods, satellite platforms, backscatter measurements, limb observations, electrochemical methods, chemiluminescent methods, optical methods, and rocket observations. A number of graphs showing the observed distribution of atmospheric ozone are also presented, and changes in this distribution are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1979 an {{investigation}} was started involving the intercomparison of five ground based instruments designed to measure total ozone. The instruments considered include the Dobson spectrometer, the Russian M- 83 <b>ozonometer,</b> the Brewer Ozone Spectrophotometer, the New Zealand (Canterbury) filter photometer, and the SenTran Company filter photometer. Three of these instruments use optical filters to make spectrophotometric determinations of total atmospheric ozone. The M- 83 uses glass absorption filters to isolate the ultraviolet bands used. The Canterbury and the SenTran instruments use narrow-bandpass dielectric interference filters for the same purpose. Instruments employing optical filters are very appealing since they can be made small, rugged, and relatively inexpensive. However, {{the results of the}} reported investigation show that serious problems must be resolved before any filter instrument can be considered reliable enough for the conduction of long term, meaningful ozone measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a physically compact, light, robust and relatively cheap filter <b>ozonometer</b> for measuring the amount of ozone in the atmosphere is discussed. Ozone data from the filter instrument and a Dobson spectrophotometer were found to agree {{both in terms of}} relative and change and absolute amount. It can be concluded from this close correlation between data for the complete range of air mass available, that the filter instrument constructed in this project gives ozone values with an accuracy comparable to that of the Dobson spectrophotometer. A good correlation was found, in the limited sample of data available, between the daily mean ozone values from the filter instrument and meteorological upper air parameters. An automatic mode of operation for the filter instrument where the ozone data, collected at preset time intervals throughout the day and recorded directly on paper tape, is described...|$|E
40|$|Description of the {{ground-based}} {{solar radiation}} monitoring complex is presented. Complex comprises {{a set of}} the state-of-the-art solar radiation sensors, automatic sun-tracking unit and electronics, sunphotometer, portable hand-held <b>ozonometer,</b> and automatic weather station. Total ozone content in column of atmosphere, solar broadband irradiances from UV-B to the far IR, spectral aerosol optical thickness (AOT), retrieved column integrated aerosol optical and microphysical characteristics, and main surface meteorological elements are measured at this ground station. AOT observations are fulfilled within {{the frame of the}} global Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) program under supervision of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Radiometric and ozone data are submitted to the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC) and World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Some preliminary results of AOT, shortwave solar radiation, total ozone content, and main meteorological elements acquired at the ground based solar radiation monitoring station are presented...|$|E
40|$|Five {{ground-based}} {{total ozone}} spectrophotometers were intercompared at Wallops Island, VA between October 1979 and January 1981. The {{tests were conducted}} to evaluate the stability and accuracy of each instrument over an extended time period. Acceptable performance regarding these two characteristics is essential if an instrument is to be useful in field measurements and network monitoring of the atmospheric total ozone content. The Dobson spectrophotometer {{was used as the}} standard of comparison for the Brewer grating spectrophotometer, the USSR M- 83 <b>ozonometer,</b> the Canterbury filter photometer, and the SenTran filter photometer. The grating instrument was found to be potentially the equal of the Dobson but was subject to unreliable performance by its rather sophisticated electronic components. The filter photometers performed acceptably for short periods but filter aging and eventual degradation rendered both units unusable {{before the end of the}} intercomparison. Finally, the M- 83 results were found to be in acceptable agreement with the Dobson throughout the period when certain qualifications are invoked. The accuracy of a single M- 83 ozone measurement may be low. Averages tend to improve its agreement with the Dobson...|$|E
40|$|Total column {{ozone data}} {{over the past}} 22 to 30 years from {{ground-based}} Dobson and filter <b>ozonometer</b> stations between 30 N and 80 N are analyzed for residual trends remaining after allowance for the known geophysical variations corresponding to: (1) the change of seasons; (2) the quasi-biennial oscillation; and (3) the 11 -year solar sunspot cycle. Examination of the data from several ground stations between 45 and 55 N indicated a seasonal difference in the long-term ozone series, with statistically significant losses in several winter months. Accordingly, the data from individual stations were analyzed with multiple regression analysis, seeking trends {{on a monthly basis}} after allowance for the known geophysical cycles. Previous statistical analyses were conducted as tests of 1 -D model calculations which do not show any differences with the seasons, and any trend toward change in ozone concentrations is expressed in a yearly trend without seasonal variation. Such a model is inappropriate for calculations with a data set which exhibits a pronounced tendency toward seasonal differences in the trends. Comparisons with model calculations then require 2 -D models into which seasonal and latitudinal differences can easily be programmed...|$|E
40|$|The aerosol studies {{during the}} ARctic EXperiment (AREX) campaigns {{were carried out}} onboard the r/v Oceania {{research}} ship between 1996 and 2004. During each campaign the r/v Oceania cruised for seven weeks (June-August) {{in the area of}} the Arctic between 0 and 14 &# 61616;E and 69 and 79 &# 61616;N. In 2002 the measurements were also carried out from the station in Ny-Ã…lesund on Spitsbergen in co-operation with the AWI team. The aerosol studies were conducted using an ensemble of instruments, including the FLS- 12 lidar, laser particle counter CSASP- 100 -HV-SP, sun-photometers and <b>ozonometer</b> (Microtops II). The laser particle counter was placed on a mast of the vessel and moved vertically, which facilitated the determination of the vertical structure of aerosol concentrations and their size distribution at altitudes of up to 20 m a. s. l. Simultaneously lidar FLS- 12 provided the vertical profiles of aerosol concentrations at altitudes of up to 500 m a. s. l. Those were further used for the calculation of aerosol optical thickness. During the measurements at the Ny-Ã…lesund Koldewey-Station of AWI, the Koldewey Aerosol Raman Lidar (KARL) was used to investigate the different aerosol scenarios. KARL is also regularly operated throughout the year, particularly during spring...|$|E
40|$|First time {{observations}} of spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) at Mohal (31. 9 â—¦N, 77. 11 â—¦E; altitude 1154 m amsl) in the Kullu valley, {{located in the}} northwestern Indian Himalayan region, {{have been carried out}} during Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB), {{as a part of the}} Indian Space Research Organisationâ€“Geosphere Biosphere Program (ISROâ€“GBP). AODs at six wavelengths are obtained using Microtops-II Sunphotometer and <b>Ozonometer.</b> The monthly mean values of AOD at 500 nm are found to be 0. 27 Â± 0. 04 and 0. 24 Â± 0. 02 during March and April, 2006 respectively. However, their monthly mean values are 0. 33 Â± 0. 04 at 380 nm and 0. 20 Â± 0. 03 nm at 870 nm during March 2006 and 0. 31 Â± 0. 3 at 380 nm and 0. 17 Â± 0. 2 at 870 nm during April 2006, showing a gradual decrease in AOD with wavelength. The AÌŠngstrom wavelength exponent â€˜Î± â€™ had a mean value of 0. 72 Â± 0. 05, implying reduced dominance of fine particles. Further, the afternoon AOD values are higher as compared to forenoon values by âˆ¼ 33. 0 % during March and by âˆ¼ 9. 0 % during April 2006 and are attributed to the pollutant lifted up from the valley by the evolving boundary layer. Besides the long-range transportation of aerosol particles by airmass from the Great Sahara and the Thar Desert regions to the observing site, the high values of AODs have also been influenced by biomass burning and frequent incidents of forest fire at local levels. 1...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{measurements}} were taken using the Brewer spectrometer no. 30, the filter <b>ozonometer</b> M 124 no. 200 and the Dobson spectrophotometer no. 71 from September 1987 to December 1988 at Potsdam. The {{performance of the}} instrument types and the compatibility of ozone data was checked under the conditions of a field measuring station. Total ozone values derived from Dobson AD direct sun {{measurements were}} considered as standard. The Dobson instrument had been calibrated at intercomparisons with the World Standard Dobson instrument no. 83 (Boulder) and with the Regional Standard instrument no. 64 (Potsdam), while the Brewer instrument was calibrated several times with the Travelling Standard Brewer no. 17 (Canada). The differences between individual Brewer DS (direct sun) ozone data and Dobson ADDS are within plus or minus 3 percent with half of all differences within plus or minus 1 percent. Less than 0. 7 percent of the systematic difference can be due to atmospheric SO 2. Due to inadequate regression coefficients Brewer ZB (zenith blue) ozone measurements are by (3 [...] . 4) percent higher than Dobson ADDS ozone values. M 124 DS ozone data are systematically by (1 [...] . 2) percent higher than Dobson ADDS ozone with 50 percent of the differences within plus or minus 4 percent, but with extreme differences up to plus or minus (20 [...] . 25) percent. M 124 ZB ozone values are by (3 [...] . 5) percent higher than Dobson ADDS with all the differences within plus or minus 10 percent, i. e. the scatter of differences is smaller for ZB than for M 124 DS measurements, Results for differences in the daily mean ozone values are also addressed. The differences include the uncertainties in the ozone values derived from both types of measurements. They provide {{an indication of the}} uncertainty in ozone data and the comparability of ozone values derived from different types of instruments...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the Joint Laboratory of Atmospheric Optics and Aerosols of Ukraine has been {{carrying}} out atmospheric research in cooperation with international program of climate change studies. Our current research is aimed at studying aerosol and ozone in the Earth's atmosphere, because these constituents have a substantial inÐ°Ð´uence on climate. In Ukraine, atmospheric aerosol remote sensing in the PHOTONS/AERONET network {{has been carried out}} since 2006 in Sevastopol and 2008 in Kyiv. For this research, sunphotometers CIMEL CE 318 have been used. A mobile AERONET station has been developed, which consists of CE 318 N and portable Microtops II sunphotometers, as well as two self-designed experimental portable sunphotometer models and an <b>ozonometer</b> for aerosol and ozone study. The team's findings on aerosol spectral optical thickness, as well as optical and physical properties of aerosol particles (single-scattering albedo, distribution of particles by sizes, Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent), are discussed in the paper. In 2010, upon the establishment of the new regional atmospheric research station Nr. 498 Kyiv-Goloseyev, the team commenced with measurements of the total column density and vertical distribution of ozone, using the Dobson D 040 spectrophotometer, in the framework of the Global Atmosphere Watch Program of WMO. The station has also been equipped with a Vaisala automatic weather station, a surface ozone 49 i analyzer, and an experimental complex for monitoring secondary space rays. The aerosol and ozone measurements have been continuously submitted to data centres of AERONET ([URL] and WMO (www. woudc. org/data/). For aerosol and ozone research, the data from satellite sources (POLDER, MODIS, OMI, and SCIAMACHY) have also been analysed. The work on a proposal to design, build, and launch the space radiometer/polarimeter for global monitoring of atmospheric aerosols has commenced recently. This instrument should have the capability of investigating microphysical properties of aerosol particles. An overview of the devices, methods of data retrieval analysis of aerosol parameters and ozone dynamics, is presented in this paper...|$|E
