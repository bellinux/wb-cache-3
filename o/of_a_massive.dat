5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, the core <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E

5|$|A {{century later}} he was already a legendary figure; William of Tyre {{believed}} that it was Peter who had planted the idea for the crusade in Urban's mind (which was taken as fact by historians until the 19th century). It is commonly believed that Peter's followers consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but indeed there were many knights among the peasants, including Walter Sans Avoir, who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.|$|E
5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles, and increasing the power supply.

Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E
5|$|As the {{conflict}} raged, other Arab governments attempted {{to negotiate a}} peaceful resolution. As part of this effort, Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew sympathy from attending Arab leaders. Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal. A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides, but Nasser died <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> heart attack hours after the summit, and {{the conflict}} resumed shortly afterward.|$|E

5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last Shift (1696) is {{an early}} herald <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> shift in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at {{a moment in time}} before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E
5|$|Colbert is {{co-author}} of the satirical text-and-picture novel , {{which was published in}} 2003 by Hyperion Books. The novel was a collaboration between Colbert, Amy Sedaris, and Paul Dinello, and {{tells the story of a}} small town threatened by the impending destruction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> dam. The narrative is presented as a series of fictional interviews with the town's residents, accompanied by photos. The three authors toured performing an adaptation of Wigfield on stage the same year the book was released.|$|E
5|$|Declassified wartime {{documents}} show that Simonds, {{along with several}} others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on July 23 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> German buildup on the ridge. Some historians, including David O'Keefe and David Bercuson, accused Simonds of being careless with {{the lives of his}} men. Terry Copp and John A. English, wrote that given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds probably had little choice in the decision he made.|$|E
50|$|The {{electromagnet}} has a 1000 mm radius through 72.5° {{to focus}} the secondary ions according to their mass/charge ratio according {{to the principles of}} the Lorentz force. Essentially, the path <b>of</b> <b>a</b> less <b>massive</b> ion will have a greater curvature through the magnetic field than the path <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more <b>massive</b> ion. Thus, altering the current in the electromagnet focuses a particular mass species at the detector.|$|R

5|$|Iridium {{is found}} in meteorites in much higher {{abundance}} than in the Earth's crust. For this reason, the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary {{gave rise to the}} Alvarez hypothesis that the impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66million years ago. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E

It is the largest known explosive eruption on Earth in the last 25 million years. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, it had global consequences for human populations; it killed most humans living {{at that time and}} is believed to have created a population bottleneck in central east Africa and India, which affects the genetic make up of the human worldwide population to the present.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> companion {{brings many}} other possibilities. If Eta Carinae A was rapidly {{stripped of its}} outer layers, {{it might be a}} less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached.

This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} this type of {{supernova}} {{is similar to that of}} novae, in which a white dwarf accretes matter more slowly and does not approach the Chandrasekhar limit. In the case of a nova, the in-falling matter causes a hydrogen fusion surface explosion that does not disrupt the star. This type of supernova differs from a core-collapse supernova, which is caused by the cataclysmic explosion of the outer layers <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> star as its core implodes.|$|E
5|$|When helium is {{exhausted}} at {{the core}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by neon (see neon-burning process), oxygen (see oxygen-burning process), and silicon (see silicon-burning process). Near {{the end of the}} star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.|$|E
