50|$|To summarize, {{the color}} of an object is a complex result of its surface properties, its {{transmission}} properties, and its emission properties, all of which contribute to the mix of wavelengths in the light leaving {{the surface of the}} <b>object.</b> The <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> is then further conditioned {{by the nature of the}} ambient illumination, and by the color properties of other objects nearby, and via other characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Generally, {{white balance}} of a {{conventional}} camera is set by linear adjustment of RGB channel gains. However, spectral sensitivity of human visual trireceptor, LMS cone, is nonlinearly changed according to surround chromaticity and luminance level. Therefore, the <b>perceived</b> <b>colors</b> of the image reproduced on a standard display using the output signals {{of a conventional}} camera are {{quite different from the}} <b>perceived</b> <b>object</b> <b>colors</b> in real photographing place. It is necessary that reproduced colors on a display in standard viewing conditions is perceived as same as the original object colors. In this paper a corresponding color reproduction algorithm based on HVS is proposed. The algorithm transforms the output signals of a conventional camera into the signals to reproduce the same <b>colors</b> as the <b>perceived</b> <b>object</b> <b>colors</b> when human visual system has been adapted chromatically under the various photographing conditions. Experimental results show that the reproduced color using the algorithm is objectively and subjectively better than the conventional method...|$|R
40|$|Our visual {{world is}} made up of colored surfaces. The color of a surface is {{physically}} determined by its reflectance, i. e., how much energy it reflects as a function of wavelength. Reflected light, however, provides only ambiguous information about the color of a surface as it depends on the spectral properties of both the surface and the illumination. Despite the confounding effects of illumination on the reflected light, the visual system is remarkably good at inferring the reflectance of a surface, enabling observers to <b>perceive</b> surface <b>colors</b> as stable across illumination changes. This capacity of the visual system is called color constancy and it highlights that color vision is a constructive process. The research presented here investigates the neural basis {{of some of the most}} relevant aspects of the constructive nature of human color vision using machine learning algorithms and functional neuroimaging. The experiments demonstrate that color-related prior knowledge influences neural signals already in the earliest area of visual processing in the cortex, area V 1, whereas in <b>object</b> imagery, <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> shared neural representations with the color of the imagined objects in human V 4. A direct test for illumination-invariant surface color representation showed that neural coding in V 1 as well as a region anterior to human V 4 was robust against illumination changes. In sum, the present research shows how different aspects of the constructive nature of color vision can be mapped to different regions in the ventral visual pathway...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} {{accuracy of}} object identification across illuminations {{on the basis}} of color cues. Four similarly shaped real objects, three of the same reflectance, were separated into pairs under distinct colored real lights. Observers were asked to pick the odd object. Correct and incorrect identifications formed systematic patterns that could not be explained by color-constancy, contrast-constancy, inverse-optics or neural-signal matching algorithms. The pattern of results were simulated by an algorithm that purposely made the incorrect assumption that color constancy holds, and used similarity between <b>perceived</b> <b>object</b> <b>colors,</b> along the difference vector between illuminant colors, to identify objects of the same reflectance across illuminants. The visual system may use this suboptimal strategy because the computational costs of an optimal strategy outweigh the benefits of more accurate performance...|$|R

40|$|A {{system for}} color {{correction}} has been designed, built, and tested suc-cessfully; the essential components are three custom chips built using sub-threshold analog CMOS VLSI. The system, based on Land's Retinex the-ory of color constancy, produces colors similar {{in many respects}} to those produced by the visual system. Resistive grids implemented in analog VLSI perform the smoothing operation central to the algorithm at video rates. With the electronic system, {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the algorithm are explored. 1 A MODEL FOR COLOR CONSTANCY Humans have the remarkable ability to <b>perceive</b> <b>object</b> <b>colors</b> as roughly constant even if the color of the illumination is varied widely. Edwin Land, founder of the Polaroid Corporation, models the computation that results in this ability as three identical center-surround operations performed independently in three color planes, such as red, green, and blue (Land, 1986). The basis for this model is as follows. Consider first an array of grey papers with different reflectances. (Land designated these arrays Mondrians, since they resemble the works of the Dutch painter Pie...|$|R
40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} {{refers to}} the ability of the human visual system to adjust to the color of the illumination, or other prevailing stimuli, such that <b>perceived</b> <b>object</b> <b>colors</b> vary far less with changes in illumination than would be expected from simple radiometry or colorimetry. Models of chromatic adaptation are generally formulated as extensions of the von Kries hypothesis of some sort of independent gain control mechanisms operating on the three types of cone signals. This paper introduces a new way to model the phenomenon with no requirement for the first stage chromatic processing. This model is referred to as a spectral adaptation model since it acts upon spectra rather than chromatic signals such as tristimulus values. The spectral adaptation model was compared with other models of adaptation both computationally and through limited psychophysical data. It is shown to have reasonable, and flexible, performance and could be of practical value in applications such as spectral image reproduction. A limiting case of the spectral model, a model of perfect color constancy, is also described and compared with traditional chromatic adaptation models...|$|R

2500|$|Finally, since a beam {{of light}} can be {{composed}} of many different wavelengths, {{to determine the extent to}} which a physical color C in Hcolor stimulates each cone cell, we must calculate the integral (with respect to w), over the interval , of C(w)·s(w), of C(w)·m(w), and of C(w)·l(w). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color C (which is an element in Hcolor) a particular <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> (which is a single point in R3color).

40|$|The {{problems}} of brightness constancy (e. g., the constancy of <b>perceived</b> <b>object</b> <b>color</b> under different illumination conditions), {{and of the}} perceptual constancies in general, arise {{from the fact that}} changed sensory stimuli frequently elicit unchanged responses (and vice versa) which follow more closely the variations of distal stimuli (objects) than of the sensory-surface stimulus distributions. This raises difficulties for any formulation of a one-to-one correspondence between stimulus and experience (confusingly called the "constancy hypothesis," [5, p. 86]), which at first sight would seem essential to psychological prediction. Such findings have been used in attempted ("nativistic") refutation of the constancy hypothesis and its associated stimulus-sensation units of analysis (5), and to demonstrate the importance of nonstimulus organizational "forces. " Empiricist "inferential" explanations, on the other hand, retain the constancy hypothesis in sensation, and ascribe the obtained discrepancies to the effects of past experience in perception. Objections to the nativistic position are: (a) some evidence suggests that the accuracy of the perceptual constancies depends on past experience (1); (b) no well-defined analytic units have been presented to supplant the old "sensations, " and in their absence precise prediction is difficult despite the considerable heuristic value of the more or less intuitive Gestalt "laws.
