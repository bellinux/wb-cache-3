50|$|Minority Game:A {{game for}} 22 {{individual}} players.A Yes-No question is asked. (The question itself is irrelevant.) Players vote their answer of either yes or no. The answer with fewest votes wins. Those players continue {{to the next}} round where the game repeats until a tie between two players, or one player winner remains.How to win the Minority Game; Answer 1:Form a team of 8 players; 4 vote yes and 4 vote no. Thus irrespective of the outcome, 4 are guaranteed to give the correct answer and continue to the next round. In the following round, 2 of the 4 vote yes, and 2 vote no. Thus irrespective of the outcome, 2 are guaranteed to give the correct answer and continue to the next round. In the following round, 1 of the 2 vote yes, and 1 vote no. Thus irrespective of the outcome, 1 is guaranteed to give the correct answer. This could result in either an overall win or a tie with a non team-member. This strategy will enable you to know <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>team</b> will win, but you will not know who it will be.How to win the Minority Game; Answer 2:This strategy will enable a specific person to win. Let’s call that person, X.X approaches 7 other players to form a team of 8 and convinces them to play as per strategy 1. X also approaches 7 other players to form a second team of 8 and convinces them to also play as per strategy 1.X also approaches the remaining 7 players to form a third team of 8 and convinces them to also play as per strategy 1.No team knows of any other team apart from player X.In each round, X tells each team s/he will cast a vote for yes. Due to X effectively playing the part of 3 players but only casting 1 vote, X will always be voting on the minority side and will ultimately win the game.|$|E
40|$|People are {{important}} {{asset to the}} organization. Organizations invest a lot of time, money and energy to hire, coach and manage performances of their employees. At {{the end of the}} day an organization gets an identity and success only because of his employees. Therefore, there is nothing more challenging than to focus on employee retention and more upsetting to know that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>team</b> members is set to depart. Exit interviews are critical to any organisations as they provide an opportunity for the employees to express their reasons for exit and enable the organizations to review and improve upon their employee retention policies. This is an unique chance for an organization to understand the perception of departing employees who generally will more open and objective about their perception on organizational policies and practices. However corporate insecurity and defensiveness can act as a barrier in implementing exit interview process objectively. Also the feedback received from the employees during the process are masked due to their personal reason or simply not taking the exit interviews seriously. They even feel that it will block their re- entry in the organization, if so desired and may find it difficult to face an ex-colleague or manager in future if they cross paths...|$|E
