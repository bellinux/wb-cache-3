On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To emphasize the independence of the Speaker's office, Reddy resigned from the Congress Party. His term as Speaker was marked by several firsts including the admission of a No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President's address to a joint session of Parliament, the handing down of a sentence of imprisonment for Contempt {{of the house and the}} setting up of the Committee <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Welfare</b> of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. During his term as Speaker a defamation suit filed against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme Court's ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the 'watchman of the Parliament'. He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party's nominee to succeed Zakir Hussain as President.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of the Napoleonic Wars, {{although}} no formal peace movement was established until the end of hostilities, a significant peace movement animated by universalist ideals did emerge, due to the perception of Britain fighting in a reactionary role and the increasingly visible impact of the war <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> of the nation in the form of higher taxation levels and high casualty rates. Sixteen peace petitions to Parliament were signed by members of the public, anti-war and anti-Pitt demonstrations convened and peace literature was widely published and disseminated.|$|E

25|$|The stepped-up {{pace and}} {{economic}} {{demands of a}} cosmopolitan urban life could impact very negatively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> of the rural poor. Large estates (latifundia) that produced cash crops for export often were managed for absentee owners and used slave labor.

The best lands were usually appropriated for planting, often going to the better-connected socially, politically. These economic and status divisions would become manifest {{from time to time}} in various ways, e.g., the collateral revolt in 238, and the radical, quasi-ethnic edge to the Donatist schism.|$|E

While the party has made numerous proposals on immigration in parliament, it has rarely received majority support for them. Its proposals has largely been rejected by the remaining political parties, as well as the mass media.
