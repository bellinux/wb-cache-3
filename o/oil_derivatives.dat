25|$|Historically, the dry {{and liquid}} bulk {{segments}} have generated {{most of the}} canal's revenues. Bulk cargo includes dry goods, such as grains (corn, soy, and wheat, among others), minerals, fertilizers, coal, and liquid goods, such as chemical products, propane gas, crude oil, and <b>oil</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Recently, containerized cargo has replaced dry bulk as the canal's main income generator, moving it to second place. Vehicle carriers have become the third-largest income generator, replacing the liquid bulk segment. Shipping industry analyses conducted by the ACP and top industry experts indicate that the canal expansion will be beneficial to both the canal and its users because of the demand that will be served by allowing the transit of more tonnage.|$|E

40|$|A {{replicated}} shadehouse experiment {{demonstrated that}} a canola <b>oil</b> <b>derivative</b> gave good {{control of the}} important grapevine disease, powdery mildew (caused by Uncinula necator). Repeated inoculation of potted vines with U. necator lead to severe foliar infection in the unsprayed control treatment. Repeated sprays of the canola <b>oil</b> <b>derivative</b> at rates of 2. 0 and 5. 0 mL (formulated product) per L prevented the development of foliar symptoms as effectively as either wettable sulphur 2 g (formulated product) per L or fenarimol 0. 2 mL (formulated product) per L at label rates. On the final assessment date, when the untreated control vines were very heavily diseased, the lowest rate (1 mL/L) of canola <b>oil</b> <b>derivative</b> gave significantly (P < 0. 05) poorer disease control than the other fungicide treatments though symptoms were significantly (P < 0. 05) less severe than in the control.

40|$|How {{much does}} {{speculation}} contribute to oil price volatility? We revisit this contentious question by estimating a sign-restricted structural vector autoregression (SVAR). First, using a simple storage model, {{we show that}} revisions to expectations regarding oil market fundamentals {{and the effect of}} mispricing in <b>oil</b> <b>derivative</b> markets can be observationally equivalent in a SVAR model of the world oil market à la Kilian and Murphy (2013), since both imply a positive co-movement of oil prices and inventories. Second, we impose additional restrictions on the set of admissible models embodying the assumption that the impact from noise trading shocks in <b>oil</b> <b>derivative</b> markets is temporary. Our additional restrictions effectively put a bound on the contribution of speculation to short-term oil price volatility (lying between 3 and 22 percent). This estimated short-run impact is smaller than that of flow demand shocks but possibly larger than that of flow supply shocks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{development in the}} technology of fluids used for drilling oil and gas wells. The development relates {{to the use of}} novel fluids based on a Malaysian palm <b>oil</b> <b>derivative</b> as an alternative to oil based drilling fluids. The advantages of using oil based drilling fluids are well documented. However, there is increasing awareness of the serious environmental problems associated with these fluids. This has led to restrictions on the use of oil based drilling fluids {{in many parts of the}} world. The ultimate objective must be to eliminate the use of diesel and mineral oil based drilling fluids. There have been significant developments in the technology of water based drilling fluids but there are still many situations where the properties of oil based drilling fluids are required. The Malaysian palm <b>oil</b> <b>derivative</b> can be used to replace mineral oil in the formulation of oil based drilling fluids. These fluids are technically equivalent to oil based muds but are essentially non-toxic, readily biodegradable and based on a renewable raw material that is available locally and in large quantities. The chemistry of the palm <b>oil</b> <b>derivative</b> is described in comparison to that of diesel and mineral oils. Studies on the environmental impact of oil based drilling fluids cuttings are discussed. Biodegradation data is presented which indicates that sea bed recovery should be much more rapid using palm oil drilling fluids than conventional oil based drilling fluids. The formulation and properties of the new fluids are describes with some emphasis on their ability to withstand contamination. It is concluded that fluids based on Malaysian palm oil will form effective alternatives to diesel and mineral oil based drilling fluids in many situations...|$|R

30|$|Owing to {{its rich}} {{properties}} {{and variety of}} end-uses, together with increased interests in biopolymer and bio-fuels industries, the potential for castor oil to play a much larger {{role in the world}} economy has increased dramatically in recent years. For instance, trend shows that castor oil prices steadily rose from $ 946 per tonne in 2002 – 2003 to $ 2390 in 2010 – 2011 [5]. The contribution of castor oil on the world economy is expected to continue increasing and it has been predicted that the global castor <b>oil</b> and <b>derivatives</b> market will reach USD 1.81 billion by 2020 [6]. The increased interest of substitution of conventional fuel by bio fuels, volatile crude oil prices, higher demand from Europe, China and the US, and growth of key end-use industries including cosmetics and lubricants are expected to drive the global castor <b>oil</b> and <b>derivatives</b> market. On the other hand, threat from other vegetable oils in terms of price and application, and high dependency on seasonality may hinder the market growth. Some major companies operating in the castor <b>oil</b> and <b>derivatives</b> global market are: Thai Castor Oil Industries Co. Ltd., Jayant Agro Organics, Hokoku Corporation, ITOH Oil Chemicals Co.
