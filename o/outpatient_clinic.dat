5|$|By 1932, the Vassar {{population}} had outgrown the Alumnae Gymnasium {{and a new}} facility, the Helen Kenyon Hall of Physical Education, was built. Kenyon featured a new indoor pool (which, at , made {{it one of the}} United States' largest indoor swimming pools), as well as tennis, squash, and handball courts. Consequently, in 1933, the Alumnae Gymnasium was renamed Ely Hall after its early benefactor. In that same year, the building underwent minor renovation to convert some of the building's back rooms to an <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinic,</b> nurses' quarters, and doctors' offices.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews {{to leave the}} city within the next two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinic,</b> co-op, kitchen, and dining room for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.|$|E
5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinic</b> where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E

30|$|Both joint <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics</b> {{and special}} <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics</b> {{have their own}} advantages. For example, as for the team {{evaluation}} in joint <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics,</b> every suspected case of child with developmental delay can seek consultation from 3 doctors. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that parents can get a relatively comprehensive evaluation without traveling between hospitals and home. The advantages of special <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics</b> is that they are available everywhere, and that might reduce the waiting time to receive evaluation. To the hospitals with insufficient resources, this can be an appropriate approach.|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{study the}} {{differences}} in views on treatment among patients with cardiovascular diseases in state and private <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics,</b> {{as well as the}} motivation for choosing one of these <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics.</b> Material and methods. Anonymous and voluntary survey of cardiology patients (n= 90) in 2 state (57. 7 %) and 3 private <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics</b> (42. 2 %) was conducted in Saratov. Results. 33. 3 % of respondents were men; the median age was 65 years. Patients of state <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics</b> {{were more likely to have}} retirement age (p= 0. 0008), low income (p= 0. 0006), history of hypertensive crises (p= 0. 0129) and chronic heart failure (p= 0. 0001). Patients of private <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics</b> were more likely to have mental work (p= 0. 0001), higher education (p= 0. 0001), moderate income (p= 0. 0006). The difference in views on the disease and the attitude towards a doctor among patients of state and private clinics was shown. Conclusion. Patients of private <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics</b> were more active, young, aimed at continuation of life. They are more likely to have higher education, mental work and moderate income. Patients of state <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinics</b> are "infatuated with their illness"; it is their “lifestyle”. Paternalistic model of communication with doctors is expressed in all the patients. </p...|$|R

25|$|Hospital Vilardebó is {{the only}} {{psychiatric}} hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardebó Matuliche, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally {{one of the best}} of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, <b>outpatient,</b> <b>clinic</b> and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; {{more than half of the}} patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.|$|E
25|$|Outpatient {{treatment}} involves periodic {{visits to}} a psychiatrist for consultation {{in his or her}} office, or at a community-based <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinic.</b> Initial appointments, at which the psychiatrist conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient, are typically 45 to 75 minutes in length. Follow-up appointments are generally shorter in duration, i.e., 15 to 30 minutes, with a focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patient's mental and emotional functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms (e.g., exercise, cognitive therapy techniques, sleep hygiene—to name just a few). The frequency with which a psychiatrist sees people in treatment varies widely, from once a week to twice a year, depending on the type, severity and stability of each person's condition, and depending on what the clinician and patient decide would be best.|$|E

25|$|In Belgium, {{one year}} of lectures and two years of {{residency}} are required. In the Netherlands, training consists of three years (full-time) of specialization after completion of internships of 3 years. First and third year of training takes place at a GP practice. The second year of training consists of six months training at an emergency room, or internal medicine, paediatrics or gynaecology, {{or a combination of}} a general or academic hospital, three months of training at a psychiatric hospital or <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinic</b> and three months at a nursing home (verpleeghuis) or clinical geriatrics ward/policlinic.

Furthermore, all aspects of working as a GP gets addressed including working with the medical standards from the Dutch GP association NHG (Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap).|$|E
25|$|In 1958, he {{laid the}} {{cornerstone}} for a community hospital to be run according to the strictest standards of Halakha. He petitioned the authorities for a building permit, but was not granted one until the left-wing Minister of Health left office in 1962 and the Health Ministry was given to a religious party. Halberstam spent 15 years raising funds to build the hospital, which would come to be named Laniado Hospital, after the Laniado brothers, two bankers from Switzerland whose estate provided a $300,000 donation for the Rebbe. The hospital's first building, an <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinic,</b> opened in 1975. In the next few years, a maternity ward, emergency room, internal medicine department, a cardiology unit, and an intensive-care unit opened. The hospital continued to expand, and today encompasses two medical centers, a children’s hospital, a geriatric center and a nursing school, serving a regional population of over 450,000. The Rebbe continued to plan and supervise {{the expansion of the}} hospital until his death in 1994.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} in another study that a maximal CIMT value of 0.956mm had 85.7% sensitivity and 85.1% specificity to predict angiographic CAD. The study group consisted of patients admitted to the cardiology <b>outpatient</b> <b>clinic</b> with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. The study showed CIMT was higher in patients with significant CAD than in patients with non-critical coronary lesions. Regression analysis revealed that thickening of the mean intima-media complex more than 1.0 was predictive of significant CAD our patients. There was incremental significant increase in CIMT with the number coronary vessel involved. In accordance with the literature, it was found that CIMT was significantly higher in the presence of CAD. Furthermore, CIMT was increased as the number of involved vessels increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement. However, human clinical trials have been slow to provide clinical & medical evidence, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using carotid intima-media thickness scanning (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography), B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, homocysteine and that reduce neck carotid artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.|$|E
