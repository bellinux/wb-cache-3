5|$|Early Philippine {{sculpture}} {{is characterized}} by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures {{are related to the}} ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu. The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern <b>of</b> <b>imagery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor <b>of</b> <b>imagery</b> was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E

5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use <b>of</b> <b>imagery</b> drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
5|$|Stelae were {{essentially}} stone banners raised to glorify {{the king and}} record his deeds, although the earliest examples depict mythological scenes. Imagery developed throughout the Classic Period, with Early Classic stelae (c. 250–600) displaying non-Maya characteristics from the 4th century onwards, with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>imagery</b> linked to the central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. This influence receded in the 5th century although some minor Teotihuacan references continued to be used. In the late 5th century, Maya kings began to use stelae to {{mark the end of}} calendrical cycles. In the Late Classic (c. 600–900), imagery linked to the Mesoamerican ballgame was introduced, once again displaying influence from central Mexico. By the Terminal Classic, the institution of divine kingship declined, and Maya kings began to be depicted with their subordinate lords. As the Classic Period came to an end, stelae ceased to be erected, with the last known examples being raised in 909–910.|$|E
5|$|The castles made a clear, {{imperial}} {{statement about}} Edward's intentions to rule North Wales {{on a permanent}} basis. As already noted, they were typically located on sites that had {{been associated with the}} former Welsh princes. Caernarfon, in particular, stands out for its use of banded, coloured stone in the walls, statues of eagles and its polygonal, rather than round, towers. There has been extensive academic debate over the interpretation of these features. Historian Arnold Taylor argued that the design of the castle was a representation of the Walls of Constantinople. The conscious use <b>of</b> <b>imagery</b> from the Byzantine Roman Empire was therefore an assertion of authority by EdwardI. Recent work by historian Abigail Wheatley suggests that the design of Caernarfon was indeed an assertion of Edward's authority, but that it drew on imagery from Roman sites in Britain with the intent of creating an allusion of Arthurian legitimacy for the king.|$|E
40|$|According to self-calibration bundle block adjustment, a {{mathematical}} model which solutes exterior orientation elements <b>of</b> the new <b>imageries</b> by using fixed imageries {{in the same area}} is set up at first. The orientation parameters <b>of</b> the fixed <b>imageries</b> are previously obtained. Several sets <b>of</b> aerial <b>imageries</b> at different scales are simulated based on a piece of DOM (Digital Orthophoto Map) with a scale of 1 : 50, 000 and corresponding DEM (Digital Elevation Model) with the interval of grid being 100 meters of some certain area. Finally, the exterior orientation elements <b>of</b> these new <b>imageries</b> and 3 D coordinates of photogrammetric points are calculated by combined bundle block adjustment with the derived mathematical model. The empirical results show that the exterior orientation elements and the coordinates of the photogrammetric points are identical between the mentioned method and the conventional bundle block adjustment for the two periods <b>of</b> <b>imageries</b> at the same scale. However, when the image scales are different the adjusted accuracy has an apparent decrease but can still meet the specification of topographic maps. The experiment has verified that the determination of the orientation parameters <b>of</b> the new <b>imageries</b> by using the fixed imageries is correct in theory and is feasible in practice. And the accuracy of 3 D coordinates of the photogrammetric points, which are purely gained by combined adjustment with two periods <b>of</b> <b>imageries,</b> satisfies the requirement of the specification of topographic maps. That is to say, aerial triangulation without ground control points (GCPs) can be truly realized. It will have glory application future on the map revision, the update of geographic spatial information database and automatic change detection <b>of</b> multi-temporal <b>imageries.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|There is a glyphic {{record that}} {{sometime}} before 731 a lord of Motul {{was captured by}} a lord (Ruler B) of Machaquilá. In 740, Machaquila attacked Motul de San José. Hieroglyphic Stairway 3 at Dos Pilas records that in 745 a lord of Motul was captured by K'awiil Chan K'inich of Dos Pilas. In {{the middle of the}} 8th century AD, Motul de San José was closely allied with the important city of Yaxchilan on the Usumacinta River, as demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} king of Yaxchilan Yaxun B'alam IV ("Bird Jaguar IV") who ruled from 752 to 768, took two wives from Motul de San José. They are named in inscriptions at Yaxchilan as Lady Wak Tuun and Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw. Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw is shown preparing her husband for a battle that took place in 755 on Yaxchilan Lintel 41, now in the British Museum in London. In fact, the alliance with Yaxchilan may date further back to the early 8th century since Yaxchilan Lintel 25 (dedicated in AD 723) used the so-called X-ray style <b>of</b> <b>imagery</b> that is closely associated with the Motul de San José polity. However, relations with Yaxchilan were not always peaceful and Hieroglyphic Stairway 5 at Yaxchilan records that Itzamnaaj B'alam III of Yaxchilan defeated the lord of Motul some time in the latter part of the 8th century.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere is {{a long-standing}} {{debate about the}} neurocognitive {{implementation}} <b>of</b> mental <b>imagery.</b> One form <b>of</b> mental <b>imagery</b> is the <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> visual motion, which is of interest due to its naturalistic and dynamic character. However, so far only the mere occurrence rather than the specific content <b>of</b> motion <b>imagery</b> was shown to be detectable. In the current study, the application of multi-voxel pattern analysis to high-resolution functional data of 12 subjects acquired with ultra-high field 7 T {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} allowed us to show that <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> visual motion can indeed activate the earliest levels of the visual hierarchy, but the extent thereof varies highly between subjects. Our approach enabled classification not only <b>of</b> complex <b>imagery,</b> but also <b>of</b> its actual contents, in that the direction of imagined motion out of four options was successfully identified in two thirds of the subjects and with accuracies of up to 91. 3 % in individual subjects. A searchlight analysis confirmed the local origin of decodable information in striate and extra-striate cortex. These high-accuracy findings not only shed new light on a central question in vision science on the constituents <b>of</b> mental <b>imagery,</b> but also show {{for the first time that}} the specific sub-categorical content <b>of</b> visual motion <b>imagery</b> is reliably decodable from brain imaging data on a single-subject level...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{develops}} {{a new theory}} <b>of</b> visuo-spatial mental <b>imagery.</b> The theory is concretized in a formal framework and implemented as a compu-tational model.
