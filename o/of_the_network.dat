5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage to the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>network,</b> it was converted to the 1500v used on the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> given its different voltage {{and the fact that}} it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>network,</b> making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500v, after which the entire network will be standardised.|$|E

In the first series, prepared using functionalized POP-POE-POP and PDGEBA, hydrophilicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>networks</b> was controlled via cross-linking density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>networks,</b> changing <b>the</b> initial ratio <b>of</b> reactives. In <b>the</b> second series, POP-POE-POP was gradually substituted by POP <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same molecular weight, enabling a control <b>of</b> hydrophilicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>networks</b> at essentially constant crosslinking density.

5|$|From {{the start}} of the great {{depression}} until the closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> only one lot of trams was purchased by the MTT. Due to shortages there was minimal maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> during World War II and post-war shortages prevented the purchase of new trams. In 1951–1952 the MTT lost £313,320 and made the decision to convert the Erindale, Burnside and Linden Park lines to electric trolleybuses. The last trams on these lines ran on 24 May 1952 with the lines lifted from 18 April 1953. A 1953 royal commission was held to inquire into the financial affairs of the MTT resulting in a completely reconstituted board. Late the same year, with driver safety concerns about the conflict with increasing traffic on the road, the Glen Osmond line was temporarily converted to motor buses. The line was never converted back to trams and much comment was made about the continuing maintenance of unused overhead lines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The paper {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> {{intellectual}} property rights (IPRs) in <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise. <b>The</b> issue raised implies to better understand <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> IPRs {{not only in the}} strategy but also in <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise. <b>The</b> paper shows that IPRs have several roles in <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise. <b>The</b> first one can be called a ‘coordination role’, making easier the relationships between all <b>the</b> fragmented parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise. <b>The</b> coordination role is gaining ground in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> collaborative innovation (innovation <b>networks).</b> <b>The</b> second role is the ‘incentive/defensive role’, aiming at protecting and thus giving incentives to <b>the</b> constitution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> firm’s innovation potential, called here ‘knowledge capital’. The third role is an ‘offensive’ one which largely contributes to define <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise within <b>the</b> innovation <b>network</b> to which it usually belongs. The paper concludes by stressing the relationship between <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> IPRs for <b>networked</b> enterprises and <b>the</b> strengthening <b>of</b> IPRs at <b>the</b> global level.
