Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E

500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations.

We hung <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E

Then, she returns home, where she recovers from her {{hangover}} and prepares for another night of partying while trying on numerous outfits. She meets with her friends and goes to a club, where she gets drunk and starts to make <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Subsequently, she goes to the bathroom stall alone and starts to cry. After that, she returns home and collapses into her bed. Scenes interspersed through the main plot of the visual display Lo staring at the camera while lip syncing the lyrics of the song. Miles Raymer of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "clever" [...] video that [...] "showcases Lo's artfully complicated party-girl image as she recreates some of the debauchery in her lyrics, {{as well as some of}} its after-effects". Caitlin White of Noisey said that the [...] "new video for 'Habits' shows the darker side of coping with a lost love" [...] and that it [...] "may remind you of Janis Joplin a bit". Sonya Mann of Bustle considered it [...] "kind of boring". The clip was the fifth most-popular video on VH1 during 2014.

500|$|Horch, who had {{remained}} a devoted follower of the Roeriches since his acceptance of their spiritual quest {{as his own}} in 1923, [...] started to fall <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> for unclear reasons. The Roeriches maintained that Horch's motives were base: through guile and deception they said he had taken control of the Master Building, closed the cultural institutions it contained, and severed them and their associated from everything connected with the building and its contents. Horch countered that the Roeriches had improperly attempted to countermand his decisions as building owner {{and director of the}} cultural organizations it contained. He said they had shown bad faith when they asserted that they alone could receive and interpret the commands of the supreme being whom they all worshiped. On June 8, 1935, he wrote Helena Roerich to say he feared that the Roeriches had lost confidence in himself and his wife Nettie. Then, on July 13, 1935, Nettie wrote Helena of her and Horch's [...] "fourteen years of complete devotion in heart and in deed" [...] and of their enduring [...] "loyalty and selfless sacrifice" [...] over that period. She reaffirmed their [...] "flaming devotion" [...] which they continued to hold in their hearts. And she said the Roeriches' attempt to exert unilateral control over their affairs had caused them to [...] "contemplate, review and think of matters in a new light." [...] These letters explain actions that Horch took on June 5, 1936, to sever relations between the Institute and the other cultural organizations housed at the Master Building and discharge all their employees. The employees who occupied rent-free apartments were told to vacate immediately.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{wrote the}} hip-hop ballad [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] about [...] "thinking that I had {{something}} good, {{what happens when}} it's over, and going forward with my life." [...] The track {{was one of the}} final songs that Milian wrote about the break-up as it [...] "helped me get it all out". While the record is about a break-up, it focuses more on closure and moving past it. Milian and Cool & Dre used the melody of the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song [...] "Tha Crossroads" [...] and changed the lyrics [...] "and I'm gonna miss everybody" [...] to [...] "and I'm gonna tell everybody". The other song, [...] "Who's Gonna Ride", has a more street and gangster vibe, and contain more raw lyrics. Milian wrote the track with Dre, which she said helped because hip hop artists write about real things in their lives and are not afraid to say anything. While writing the track, Milian let her guard down and wrote what she was feeling and tried to be real. Lyrically, the song also deals with [...] "the girls that come around and try to take your man. Or the groupie girls that are around, paying attention to the guys on TV that only hang <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> for those reasons." [...] Milian also said [...] "Who's Gonna Ride" [...] was the hardest song to write because it was not safe, unlike previous songs she had written. The singer explained writing the lyrics was not hard, but the difficulty came from being real and actually writing about her true feelings. When writing the lyrics, Milian removed several lines that she thought were too harsh.|$|E
