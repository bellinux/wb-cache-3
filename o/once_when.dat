5|$|Another tale {{from the}} Devi Bhagavata Purana has a passing {{reference}} to Revanta. <b>Once</b> <b>when</b> Revanta – {{riding on the}} seven headed horse Uchaishravas – went to Vishnu's abode, Vishnu's wife goddess Lakshmi was mesmerized with the horse and ignored a question asked by the Lord. Thus, she was cursed by her husband to become a mare.|$|E
5|$|Chapman sat {{out most}} of the {{following}} season due to pregnancy, as Fulham won a treble of FA Women's Premier League National Division, FA Women's Cup and Premier League Cup. She made the announcement during half-time of a match against Tranmere Rovers, and was promptly substituted by Haugenes – who quipped that he was not permitted to have 12players on the pitch at <b>once.</b> <b>When</b> Chapman returned to action, in the FA Women's Community Shield in August2003, Fulham were no longer a professional outfit. She represented Fulham in that season's Uefa Women's Cup campaign. In March2004 Chapman played in Fulham's Premier League Cup final defeat to Charlton Athletic.|$|E
5|$|I {{then got}} some Coal {{from one of}} the Pits nearest thereunto, which I {{distilled}} in a Retort in an open Fire. At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. <b>Once,</b> <b>when</b> it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, {{in order to try to}} repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E

5|$|John M. Harlan's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} {{towards the end}} of his career. His eyesight began to fail during the late 1960s. To cover this, he would bring materials to within an inch of his eyes, and have clerks and his wife read to him (<b>once</b> <b>when</b> the Court took an obscenity case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife read him Lady Chatterley's Lover). Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.|$|E
5|$|Kashyapa married Manasa to sage Jaratkaru, {{who agreed}} to marry her on the {{condition}} that he would leave her if she disobeyed him. <b>Once,</b> <b>when</b> Jaratkaru was awakened by Manasa, he became upset with her because she awakened him too late for worship, and so he deserted her.

5|$|Puranas are {{the first}} scriptures to speak about her birth. They declare that sage Kashyapa is her father, not Shiva as {{described}} in the Mangalkavyas. <b>Once,</b> <b>when</b> serpents and reptiles had created chaos on the Earth, sage Kashyapa created goddess Manasa from his mind (mana). The creator god Brahma made her the presiding deity of snakes and reptiles. Manasa gained control over the earth, by the power of mantras she chanted. Manasa then propitiated the god, Shiva, who told her to please Krishna. Upon being pleased, Krishna granted her divine Siddhi powers and ritually worshiped her, making her an established goddess.|$|E

5|$|At around 6a.m., {{a passing}} {{labourer}} saw women's items near a water-filled pit. One {{of the items}} was a woman's shoe with blood on it. He raised the alarm. He and others {{were able to use}} a rake to find a body in the pit– that of Mary Ashford. Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near the pit, showing that {{a man and a woman}} had travelled together, almost up to the pit, and that the man returned alone. Ashford was known to many of those who gathered around the pit, as was the fact that she had gone to Tyburn the previous evening. The local mill owner, who took charge, went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party. Daniel Clarke, the landlord, began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton, and encountered him almost at <b>once.</b> <b>When</b> Clarke told Thornton of Ashford's death, Thornton stated that he was with her until 4a.m., and at Clarke's request went with him to Tyburn.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} match, a covered cage sat at ringside, supposedly containing 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats, although {{the contents of}} the cage were not revealed. Bad News Brown controlled most of the early stages of his match against Jake Roberts. Roberts attempted to perform the DDT twice, including <b>once</b> <b>when</b> Brown was arguing with special referee Big Bossman, but Brown blocked the move both times. Outside the ring, Brown hit Roberts with a chair while the Big Bossman was not looking. Roberts gained the advantage by punching Brown repeatedly but was kicked to the outside after Brown reversed a DDT attempt into a back bodydrop. Brown hit Roberts with a chair again but was disqualified when the Bossman saw him. Brown tried to gain revenge after the match by attacking Roberts's boa constrictor, Damien, but the Bossman attacked Brown to save the snake.|$|E
5|$|Henderson made MLB {{history in}} 1983 with his 3rd 100 runs/ 100 stolen bases/ 100 bases on balls season (no modern player, post 1900 {{has done it}} <b>once),</b> <b>when</b> he led the AL in stolen bases (108), walks (103) while {{finishing}} 4th in runs scored (105).

In the final season of his first stint in Oakland Henderson started to develop more of a power stroke hitting 16 home runs while leading the league in stolen bases (66), finishing 2nd in runs scored (113) and 3rd in on base % (.399). After the season, he {{was traded to the}} New York Yankees.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to coronations, the Imperial State Crown is usually worn at State Openings of Parliament, where the Sword of State and two maces are carried in procession.

Many pieces have fallen out of use altogether, like the trumpets and banqueting plate, and some were only designed to be used <b>once.</b> <b>When</b> not in use the Jewels are on public display, mainly in the Jewel House, a vault at the Tower of London where they are seen by around 2.5million visitors from across the world every year.

5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as {{a reference to the}} following legend: <b>Once,</b> <b>when</b> the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who was superior, a fiery pillar—linga (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|E
5|$|Indiana was {{admitted}} to the Union on December 11, 1816. The original 1816 Constitution of Indiana provided for the election of a governor and a lieutenant governor every three years. The second and current constitution of 1851 lengthened terms to four years and set the commencement of the governor's term on the second Monday in the January following the election. Governors were allowed to serve for four years in any eight-year period, but this was extended by a 1972 amendment permitting governors to serve for eight years in any twelve-year period. Should the office of governor become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Nine lieutenant governors have succeeded to the governorship. If the office of lieutenant governor is vacant, the president pro tempore of the Indiana Senate becomes governor; this has happened <b>once,</b> <b>when</b> James B. Ray succeeded William Hendricks.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{frequently}} {{clashed with}} the legislature, including <b>once</b> <b>when</b> the Senate refused to confirm the appointment of Dr. Walter Brashear as lieutenant colonel commandant of the state militia's second regiment. The governor refused to nominate anyone else for the position, saying that Brashear was the best person for it, and he assumed the senators {{would not want to}} be sent a worse nomination. He employed his gubernatorial veto three times {{over the course of his}} tenure, but all three were overridden by the legislature. Measures creating Harrison County and allowing squatters to purchase occupied land on more favorable terms were both vetoed because Scott felt that they had been passed too hastily to allow proper debate. Scott also vetoed the revocation of a pension granted to recently retired Kentucky Court of Appeals justice George Muter, because he felt it undermined citizens' confidence in the promises of their government.|$|E
