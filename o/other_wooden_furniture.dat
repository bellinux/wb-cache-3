Currently, Malaysia is the 8 th largest furniture export country. As an export dominated industry, the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry occupies a significant position in the Malaysian economic development. Since the industry is a challenged and deteriorating in global competition, the research objective is to evaluate the present situation and find out strategies {{on how to improve}} the Malaysian wooden industry's competitiveness. Accordingly, the research question aim to explore internationalism motivations, advantages, issues, actions in Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry. Dunning's ecletic paradigm and Porter's value chain were adopted as basic theories in the current study. The main findings from this project indicates that the challenges of labour shortage, raw materials and product design issues are mostly influencing the development of the Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry. Meanwhile, it was observed that issues exist in any stages in the manufacturing value chain may influence the performing efficiency. Thus, the government, national institutions and <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturers need to rapidly take labour, design and raw materials alternatives and innovative design approaches to promote the performance of the Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> in the global market...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{occupational}} {{accidents in}} the value-added wood products industry, particularly the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry is grossly lacking. Therefore, {{the risk factors}} for injuries to workers in the Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry were studied in fifty wood-furniture manufacturing factories, using a structured questionnaire. The three primary risk factors for accidents in the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry were: Nature of work, workers characteristics and prevailing safety climate, while the use of dangerous machinery and poor layout {{were found to be}} secondary accident causing risk factors. The findings of the study show conclusively that the prevailing safety climate and workers’ characteristics have the strongest influence on accident rate in the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry. It must also be recognized that the production oriented mentality prevalent in the industry appears to contribute towards the compromised occupational safety and health standards in the industry. In this context, it is essential for the policy makers to implement binding legislations that would safe guard the safety and health of the workers, while mandating the factory management to show commitment towards the workers health and safety to ensure a safe working environment in the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturing industry...|$|R

Despite declining supply of local rubberwood timber, the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> {{industry has been}} able to sustain its production and trade. This means that the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry does not wither even though there is local shortage of rubberwood timber supply. The <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry has adapted to the situation of declining rubberwood supply in various ways. First, lesser rubberwood timber is used. The consumption of rubberwood logs by sawmills in Peninsular Malaysia in 2001 was 489, 378 cubic meter. It has declined to 91, 605 cubic meters in 2008. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Therefore, the safety climate, which defines the safety level of the work environment, in the Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry was studied in thirty wood-furniture manufacturing factories, using a structured questionnaire. The study found that although there were four determinants of the prevailing safety climate in the work environment, it was the management responsibility and safety precautions that had the strongest influence on safety climate. Further, the primary health and safety concerns in the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturing industry were the air-borne dust, noise, chemical exposure, materials handling and occupational accidents. In this context, it is essential for the management to show commitment towards health and safety and incorporate safety precautions into the operational system, to ensure a safe working environment in the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturing industry...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} how physical features of a natural setting influenced perceived coherence and three positive outcome variables: preference, pleasure, and (self-reported) restoration. Furthermore, we examined the mediating role of perceived coherence. One hundred thirty-one students evaluated three (virtual) natural environments: an environment with metal furniture, an environment with <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture,</b> and an environment without furniture. Results showed that metal furniture negatively influenced perceived coherence as well as preference, pleasure and restoration, compared to <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> and no furniture. Perceived coherence of the environment with <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> {{was significantly higher than}} the environment with metal furniture, but significantly lower than the environment without furniture. We did not find support that preference for, and experienced pleasure and restoration in the environment with <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> differed from the environment without furniture. Perceived coherence mediated the effect of (metal) furniture on preference, pleasure, and restoration. Scientific and practical implications are discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A study was therefore conducted to evaluate the status and challenges of the ISO 9001 quality system adoption among <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturers in Malaysia and Vietnam. The data were compiled through direct-interviews of 100 <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturers (of which 25 were ISO 9001 certified companies) using a structured questionnaire, which had four parts. The results found that ISO 9001 adoption was relatively low among furniture manufacturers due to its high implementation cost and lack of market demand, although the ISO 9001 certified companies were much more productive than their non-certified counterparts. It was also apparent that the certified furniture manufacturers were focused on producing quality furniture cost effectively, derived primarily from their lower degree of operational inefficiencies. Nevertheless, the demand for ISO certification is market-specific, as Japanese, Korean, European and Middle Eastern furniture buyers show preferences for dealing with certified companies. Therefore, the benefits of ISO 9001 quality system through greater market access and increased productivity in the mills must become more apparent, before significant adoption among <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturers can be realised...|$|R
