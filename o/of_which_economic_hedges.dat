Economic principles are used to review current command and control systems, potential incentive based mechanisms, and the development of appropriate offsets. Implementing offsets in the marine environment has a number of challenges, so alternative approaches may be necessary. The study finds that offsets in areas remote from the initial impact, or even to protect different species, may be acceptable provided they result in greater conservation benefits than the standard like-for-like offset. This study is particularly relevant for the design of offsets in the coastal and marine environments where there is limited scope for like-for-like offsets...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{a change in}} accounting treatment for derivative instruments used to hedge firms 2 ̆ 7 market risk exposures affects corporate risk-management and if so, which factors {{increase the likelihood that}} a change in accounting treatment will affect risk-management. I analyze a sample of firms that restated their financial statements due to the misclassification of <b>economic</b> <b>hedges</b> as accounting hedges, both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> are derivative instruments used to reduce firms 2 ̆ 7 market risk exposures and differ only in accounting treatment. <b>Economic</b> <b>hedges</b> are accounted for under fair value accounting whereas accounting hedges receive hedge accounting treatment, the preferred method because it avoids the increase in earnings volatility associated with fair value accounting. ^ I first examine why certain firms use hedge accounting treatment following the restatement and other firms do not. I find that the type of hedging instrument used, the market risk that was being hedged, and the disclosed reason for the restatement affect the likelihood that firms will apply hedge accounting following the restatement. Firms that do not use hedge accounting following the restatement face a trade-off between continuing the <b>economic</b> <b>hedge</b> <b>which</b> increases earnings volatility, and discontinuing the hedge which avoids the increase in earnings volatility but increases market risk exposure. I find that dividends, tax benefits and firms 2 ̆ 7 historic patterns of reporting positive earnings are associated with the likelihood that firms discontinue <b>economic</b> <b>hedges,</b> increasing market risk exposure. I also find that leverage, growth, distress and analyst following are associated with the likelihood that firms continue <b>economic</b> <b>hedges,</b> maintaining market risk exposure but increasing earnings volatility. This study provides an example of how a change in accounting treatment affects firm behavior and results of this study contribute to our understanding <b>of</b> firm characteristics <b>which</b> influence managers to focus on accounting earnings versus market risk exposure. ...|$|R

The results also indicate that education service exports will become a new engine of bilateral trade in addition to agricultural and mineral products. Furthermore, comparing the results obtained from the three scenarios shows how successful reform will bring more benefits to both China and Australia in trade, which provides useful insights for policy making to facilitate bilateral economic relationship.  ...|$|R

Despite the environmental friendly potential, a certain quantity of bioenergy-related CO 2 is still emitted in China. This paper investigates the temporal dynamics of bioenergy-related CO 2 emissions in 2000 - 2010 in China, and explores the underlying influence factors based on logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI).

40|$|Different {{countries}} of the world faced with the challenges of national development have toggled in the dilemma <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>economic</b> system is more efficient and effective. While the liberals argued that the profit-oriented capitalism is a preferable alternative economic system to promote sustainable national development because it encourages high productivity through competitions; the radicals aver that socialism is a better option given that it is more people-oriented unlike the exploitative capitalism. Although no doubt is expressed with respect to the potentials of the two economic systems to steer sustainable national development, some of the associated merits and demerits that may make or mar economies were identified. Essentially, it is observed that the concept of mixed economy is not necessarily an economic system different from socialism and capitalism, but a synthesis of the values adapted from, but not limited to, the two major contending ideologies. It is submitted that the efficacy of any of the economic systems to promote national development depends more or less {{on the extent to which}} its operations can adequately harness the resources available in the society. 1...|$|R

Academic researchers have instead relied on the variance of performance measures to gauge their relative accuracy. Our analysis pits EVA against earnings as two candidate performance measures. We use a relatively standard principal-agent model, but recognize that while the variability of each measure is observable, their exact information (signal) content is not. The model provides a formal method for ascertaining the relative value of such measures based on two distinct uses of the stock price. First, as is well-known, prices provide a noisy measure of managerial value-added. Our novel insight is that stock prices can also reveal the signal content of alternative accounting-based performance measures...|$|R
