5|$|In 2003, {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> calls between band members {{resulted}} in some low-key rehearsals, and soon {{to a decision}} to reunite. By February 2004, a full tour was announced, and tickets for nearly all the initial tour dates sold out within minutes. The band's four-night run at London's Brixton Academy was the fastest selling in the venue's twenty-year history.|$|E
5|$|The new CSG International grew quickly. The {{convergence}} <b>of</b> <b>phone,</b> internet, on-demand movies, {{and other}} services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG. Professional services and international clients, which were previously not {{a significant portion of}} revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|Woodard was put {{in touch}} with a {{representative}} from record label Victory Records. Victory auditioned the band in June, and following a week-long worth <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> calls, the group were told of Victory's interest in signing them up.|$|E
50|$|The 1100 series <b>of</b> <b>phones</b> was {{originally}} manufactured in 2008 as an evolution <b>of</b> the IP <b>Phone</b> 2004 series <b>of</b> <b>phones</b> from Nortel. As such {{it began as}} a UNIStim only phone which meant that the phone was primarily supported with only Nortel manufactured voice PBX systems.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the number <b>of</b> <b>phones</b> that can be supported by a packet-based multiplexing node, we study the MMBP/D/ 1 queuing model. Similar as in the circuit-switched case, where the Engset formula is used to {{determine the}} number <b>of</b> <b>phones</b> that can be supported by a switch, the fact that not all phones are active and talking all of the time can be exploited in the packet-based case. We investigate the impact of the link rate, the activity grade, the codec bit rate and the silence suppression factor on the number <b>of</b> <b>phones</b> that can be supported. We also compare the number <b>of</b> <b>phones</b> that can be supported by the node according to the MMBP/D/ 1 model with the number <b>of</b> <b>phones</b> that can be supported according to the M/D/ 1 model. If the activity grade <b>of</b> the <b>phones</b> is low, the M/D/ 1 model overestimates the number <b>of</b> <b>phones</b> that can be supported, even for high link rates. Only in the case where the phones are active all the time, the M/D/ 1 model gives accurate results. Reducing the codec bit rate yields a larger gain than expected because aggregating more sources of lower bit rate decreases the burstiness. Activating silence suppression on each phone normally results in the expected gain, because the additional burstiness introduced by silence suppression is negligible, if the activity grade <b>of</b> the <b>phones</b> is not too high. 1...|$|R

5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Barr met Johnny Argent online {{after running}} a writing {{competition}} on her blog and began dating him in 2003, {{after a year}} <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> conversations. They live on a 46-acre macadamia nut farm located on the Big Island of Hawaii. Barr purchased the property in 2007 for $1.78million. Barr has studied Kabbalah at the Kabbalah Centre and frequently comments on the discipline.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013 Whitepages {{purchased}} all {{the interests}} in the company owned by investors for $80 million. In 2015, WhitePages acquired San Francisco-based NumberCorp to improve the database <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> numbers used for scams in the Caller ID app. In April 2016, Whitepages spun-off its caller ID business into a separate company called Hiya {{with a staff of}} 40 in Seattle. In September 2016, Alex Algard stepped down as CEO of WhitePages, in order to focus on the mobile spam-blocking spin-off Hiya. He appointed Rob Eleveld as the new WhitePages CEO.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explains}} the factors influencing the adoption <b>of</b> smart <b>phones</b> by undergraduate students in Nigeria and Republic of Benin. Questionnaire {{was used as}} the data collection instrument, and the design was guided by Rogers’ diffusion theory of innovations. Most of the sampled students agreed that factors such as relative advantage <b>of</b> smart <b>phones,</b> complexity <b>of</b> the <b>phone,</b> trial before buying the phone, observation before buying the <b>phone,</b> and compatibility <b>of</b> smart <b>phone</b> with their lifestyle influence their adoption <b>of</b> smart <b>phones.</b> The study also shows that internet browsing has a major influence on the adoption <b>of</b> smart <b>phones...</b>|$|R

5|$|In late June 2012, {{the group}} {{suffered}} a major computer malfunction, resulting in some customers' account balances not updating correctly. Completions of some new home purchases were delayed, customers were stranded abroad, another was threatened with the discontinuation {{of her life}} support machine in a Mexican hospital, and one man was held in prison. As {{a result of the}} error, RBS and NatWest announced that over 1,200 of their busiest branches would extend their hours throughout the week, including the bank's first Sunday opening, to enable the customers affected to access cash. On 25 June, over 1,000 branches opened for extended hours, and the number <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> staff was doubled.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the evening}} on October 23, a series <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> calls between Green and Farrar {{escalated}} into a confrontation. Farrar {{was convinced that}} Green was continuing to drink heavily while {{she should have been}} caring for the children, and he told Green that he knew she had poisoned him and that Social Services might be called to protect the children if she failed to get her life in order. After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television alone in his apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.|$|E

Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man attempts to steal a book full <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> numbers and leaves three people dead.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm's passage, the Mauritius {{government}} opened 130shelters, {{and also}} provided 5,000rupees to each homeless family. The crop damage from Hollanda, {{in addition to}} a drought, decreased the following year's output by 22%. In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant their crops. Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm. The country's prime minister issued an appeal to the European Union for 67million rupees ($3.6million 1994USD) in assistance, although later dropped it to less than half that total. The requested aid was for the restoration <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> and power utilities. The storm's severe impact on Mauritius caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the overall GDP decreased by 10%.|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} in population caused many adverse effects. Municipal Utilities Service, which operated telephone service, ran out <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> {{numbers and the}} waiting list for phone connections stretched to 1,500 entries. Electric demand was so high that the power company advised homeowners to buy generators to cope with frequent brownouts. Home prices skyrocketed—a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975. Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month. One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.|$|E
