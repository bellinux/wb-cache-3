5|$|Excavations at {{the site}} of Avaris by Manfred Bietak have shown that Ahmose had a palace {{constructed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Hyksos capital city's fortifications.

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether a building stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citadel before the 11th century AD. The Ghouta, the wider {{area in which}} Damascus is located, has been occupied since at least 9000 BC, {{but there is no}} evidence for settlement within the area that is today enclosed by the city walls before the 1st millennium BC. The area occupied by the later citadel was most likely outside this first settlement. The presence of a citadel during the Hellenistic period {{is uncertain}}. Damascus certainly had a citadel during the Roman period, but whether it was located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present citadel is uncertain and subject to scholarly debate.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the seat}} of the Barons of Halton from the 11thcentury until the 14thcentury and it then passed to the Duchy of Lancaster.
