5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels produce sonar {{waves in}} order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while <b>others</b> <b>may</b> repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E
5|$|In those {{receiving}} heparin {{through an}} intravenous infusion, {{a complex of}} symptoms ("systemic reaction") may occur when the infusion is started. These include fever, chills, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and chest pain. This happens in {{about a quarter of}} people with HIT. <b>Others</b> <b>may</b> develop a skin rash consisting of red spots.|$|E
5|$|Many {{psychological}} mechanisms {{have been}} implicated {{in the development and}} maintenance of schizophrenia. Cognitive biases have been identified in those with the diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations. Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss, while <b>others</b> <b>may</b> be related to particular issues and experiences.|$|E

5|$|Some comets are predictable, {{most famously}} Halley's Comet. Yet {{as a class}} of object they remain {{unpredictable}} and can appear at any time. Some have extremely lengthy orbital periods which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. <b>Others</b> <b>may</b> have only ever passed through the Solar System once and so are inherently unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|About {{one percent}} of people who receive {{treatment}} for MTBI need surgery for a brain injury. Observation to monitor for worsening condition {{is an important part of}} treatment. Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but <b>others</b> <b>may</b> not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E

5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while <b>others</b> <b>may</b> trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have patterns in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or <b>others)</b> <b>may</b> accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. <b>Others</b> <b>may</b> have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E

5|$|Discs : Circular fossils, such as Ediacaria, Cyclomedusa and Rugoconites led to {{the initial}} {{identification}} of Ediacaran fossils as cnidaria, which include jellyfish and corals. Further examination has provided alternative interpretations of all disc-shaped fossils: not one is now confidently recognised as a jellyfish. Alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists; the patterns displayed where two meet have led to many 'individuals' being identified as microbial colonies, and yet <b>others</b> <b>may</b> represent scratch marks formed as stalked organisms spun around their holdfasts. Useful diagnostic characters are often lacking because only {{the underside of the}} organism is preserved by fossilisation.|$|E
5|$|Fans may wear a full {{or partial}} fursuit or other costume {{to express their}} {{identity}} and entertain others, though typically less than 15% of attendees bring a costume, and few of these wear them all the time. <b>Others</b> <b>may</b> wear accessories such as ears or a tail, particularly outside the main convention area. Nearly all will wear one or more custom convention badges featuring a depiction of their anthropomorphic persona, some with attached ribbons providing an indicator of social status, such as a notice of affiliation, or sponsorship of the convention.

The school {{requires students to}} live in campus housing unless approved for residing in private off-campus housing or home as a commuter. The College offers on-campus housing options including traditional halls, Greek chapter houses, suite-style halls, and group living units; where some halls are single gender while <b>others</b> <b>may</b> be co-ed by floor, wing, room, or suite. In addition, Lafayette College provides specialty housings that ties to specific academic departments, student organizations, or religious affiliations. Other residences include the McKelvy House, the Arts Houses, the French/German House, Hispanic Society of Lafayette, and the Hillel House.|$|E

5|$|Most species live in forests, {{although}} a few are found in other habitats. Insects and other arthropods form {{the most important part}} of their diet, although small vertebrates are occasionally taken. Most species feed in the understory and midstory of the forest, {{although a}} few feed in the canopy and a few on the ground. Many join mixed-species feeding flocks, and a few species are core members. To various degrees, around eighteen species specialise in following columns of army ants to eat the small invertebrates flushed by the ants, and many <b>others</b> <b>may</b> feed in this way opportunistically.|$|E
5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. <b>Others</b> <b>may</b> experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still <b>others</b> <b>may</b> develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E

5|$|Several {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions—during which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure—have been distinguished by volcanologists.

5|$|The use {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in worship was a divisive topic within the Stone-Campbell Movement from its earliest years, when some adherents opposed the practice on scriptural grounds, while <b>others</b> <b>may</b> {{have relied on}} a cappella simply because they lacked access to musical instruments. Alexander Campbell opposed the use of instruments in worship. As early as 1855, some Restoration Movement churches were using organs or pianos, ultimately leading the Churches of Christ to separate from the groups that condoned instrumental music.|$|E
