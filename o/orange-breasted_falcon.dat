50|$|The <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco deiroleucus) is a bird of the falcon family. It is {{probably}} {{closely related to}} and looks like a larger version of the bat falcon. These two, in turn, are probably closest to the aplomado falcon and constitute a rather old American lineage of Falcos.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} from {{southern}} Mexico to northern Argentina. It's a medium-sized falcon at 35 - 40 cm long and a weight of 325 - 700 g. It is a bird predator, with strong talons that {{enable it to}} catch prey in flight, and is considered by some -such as the German-Brazilian ornithologist Helmut Sick - as filling the ecological niche of the peregrine falcon as a breeding species in tropical America. The <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcon,</b> however, seems to favor more heavily wooded habitats than the peregrine, therefore the species {{does not seem to}} be in ecological competition with peregrine falcons wintering or breeding in South America. The <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcon</b> has a similar plumage to the much smaller bat falcon and is generally considered most closely related to that species now.|$|E
50|$|Falcon {{adenovirus}} A is an avian adenovirus {{capable of}} infecting birds {{of the genus}} Falco, commonly called falcons. The virus was first discovered in 1996 in an epizootic of inclusion body hepatitis and enteritis in aplomado and peregrine falcons. It can also infect <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcons,</b> taitas, merlins, and American kestrels.|$|R
25|$|Tinamou predators include cats, foxes, raccoons, weasels, tayras, and opossums. Legend {{speaks of}} jaguars that imitate {{the call to}} trick and catch them. Nests are {{vulnerable}} to snakes, monkeys and opossums. Giant anteaters have been seen on Marajo Island breaking tinamou eggs. Forest <b>falcons</b> and <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcons</b> have been seen hunting them, and vampire bats lap their blood.|$|R
50|$|Native {{species of}} bird include the rufous-capped warbler, common crossbill, pine siskin, eastern bluebird, stygian owl, king vulture, ocellated turkey, acorn woodpecker, Lesson's motmot, plumbeous vireo, keel-billed toucan and red-lored parrot. Winter {{visitors}} include the hepatic tanager and chipping sparrow. <b>Orange-breasted</b> <b>falcons</b> {{are more common}} in the area than elsewhere in Belize. Other fauna present in the reserve are the frog species Rana juliani (which is restricted to the Maya Mountains) and Eleutherodactylus sandersoni, and the fish species Poecilia teresae. The pine forest has been seriously damaged by the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis, with 80% of the trees showing signs of attack.|$|R
50|$|There is {{abundant}} birdlife in the Macal Basin; for example, in the Mountain Pine Ridge sub-watershed alone are found: the rufous-capped warbler, crossbill, pine siskin and eastern bluebird. Between autumn and spring, the hepatic tanager and chipping sparrow are also evident. Raptors hunt among the valleys of Mountain Pine Ridge, and affords the most probable location in Belize {{to observe the}} <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcon.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since 1970, The Peregrine Fund has hatched {{and raised}} 20 species of rare birds and pioneered {{propagation}} and releasing techniques for numerous species. Species systematically {{released to the}} wild to develop techniques or restore wild populations include the Aplomado falcon, bald eagle, bat falcon, California condor, harpy eagle, Madagascar fish eagle, Mauritius kestrel, <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcon,</b> and prairie falcon. Overall, the organization has monitored, surveyed and worked with more than 100 raptor species in the wild around the world.|$|E
50|$|The Neotropical Raptor Conservation Program {{is part of}} The Peregrine Fund's {{international}} projects. Raptor projects {{include the}} harpy eagle and <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcon.</b> Since 1998, more than 40 harpy eagles have been hatched in captivity and released to the wild in Panama and Belize. In 2007, rare orange-breasted falcons bred in captivity were released {{for the first time}} to the wild in their traditional territory in Belize. The organization has worked with more than 35 raptor species in the wild in this part of the world.|$|E
40|$|In 1996, {{a disease}} {{outbreak}} {{occurred at a}} captive breeding facility in Idaho, causing anorexia, dehydration, and diarrhea or sudden death in 72 of 110 Northern aplomado falcons (Falco femoralis septentrionalis) from 9 to 35 days of age and in 6 of 102 peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) from 14 to 25 days of age. Sixty-two Northern aplomado and six peregrine falcons died. Epidemiologic analyses indicated a point source epizootic, horizontal transmission, and increased relative risk associated with cross-species brooding of eggs. Primary lesions in affected birds were inclusion body hepatitis, splenomegaly, and enteritis. The etiology in all mor-talities was determined by molecular analyses {{to be a new}} species of adenovirus distantly related to the group I avian viruses, serotypes 1 and 4, Aviadenovirus. In situ hybridization and PCR demonstrated that the virus was epitheliotropic and lymphotropic and that infection was systemic in the majority of animals. Adeno-associated virus was also detected by PCR in most affected falcons, but no other infectious agents or predis-posing factors were found in any birds. Subsequent to the 1996 epizootic, a similar disease caused by the same adenovirus was found over a 5 -year period in <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco deiroleucus), teita falcons (Falco fasciinucha), a merlin (Falco columbarius), a Vanuatu peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus nesiotes), and gyrfalco...|$|R

5000|$|This {{species may}} be {{confused}} with the bat falcon (F. rufigularis) and the <b>orange-breasted</b> <b>falcon</b> (F. deiroleucus), which have similar white-black-rust patterns below, but those species are built more like peregrine falcons and have solidly blackish heads and darker rufous bellies. These two species are generally considered to belong to the same lineage as the aplomado falcon. Two other Falco species of the Americas, merlin (F. columbarius) and American kestrel (F. sparverius), seem to be closer to the Aplomado group than most other falcons, but the relationships of all these lineages are fairly enigmatic. All that can be said with some certainty is that they diverged as part of an apparently largely western Holarctic radiation in the Late Miocene, probably around [...]|$|E
