25|$|Cardiac {{output is}} {{primarily}} {{controlled by the}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> of tissues in the body. In contrast to other pump systems, the heart is a demand pump that does not regulate its own output. When the body has a high metabolic oxygen demand, the metabolically controlled flow through the tissues is increased, leading to a greater flow of blood back to the heart, leading to higher cardiac output.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{coronary}} syndrome frequently presents with retrosternal chest {{discomfort and}} difficulty catching the breath. It however may atypically present with {{shortness of breath}} alone. Risk factors include old age, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. An electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes are important both for diagnosis and directing treatment.

30|$|How do {{capillary}} flow and density adapt in normal conditions? In healthy conditions, the microcirculation {{is responsible for}} fine-tuning of perfusion to meet local <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements.</b> This is achieved by recruiting and derecruiting capillaries, shutting down or limiting flow in capillaries that are perfusing areas with low <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements</b> and increasing flow in areas with high <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements.</b> This process implies local control of flow, which needs {{to be driven by}} backward communication. Indeed, release of vasoactive or hormonal substances can only lead to downstream adaptation, but it is upstream adaptation that is required. Two mechanisms may help with this local communication: perivascular sympathetic nerves [17], which mostly influence the control of arteriolar tone, and backward communication along the endothelium, mediated by endothelial cells themselves. In addition, red blood cells may act as intravascular sensors [18]. The decrease in oxygen saturation that occurs as a result of oxygen offloading causes the local release of nitric oxide, leading to capillary dilation at the site where it is needed.|$|R

500|$|Armillaria luteobubalina uses [...] "an elaborate, {{sophisticated}} aeration system" [...] {{that enables}} it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments. When grown in culture, the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust. This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged. Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called [...] "air-pores" [...] near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere {{with the central}} canal of the rhizomorph, to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism's high <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement</b> during growth. This aeration system {{is thought to be}} an important factor in the organism's pathogenicity, allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps, where conditions may be hypoxic. The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern, so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially (where lateral branches grow from a main stem). Although the structure of A.luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions, the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient-rich soil.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, the National Christmas Tree Association (NCTA) {{promotes}} {{the environmental benefits}} of live Christmas trees over the competing artificial alternative.

An independent Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study, conducted by a firm of experts in sustainable development, states that a natural tree will generate 3.1kg of greenhouse gases whereas the artificial tree will produce 8.1kg per year.|$|E
2500|$|For decades β-blockers {{have been}} used in {{cardiovascular}} medicine. They have proved to reduce morbidity and mortality. In acute coronary syndrome, β-blockers have been recommended as a class I-A indication in clinical practice guidelines, because the treatment decreases the mortality rate. β-blockers, along with calcium channel blockers, reduce the workload of the heart and its <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirement.</b> β-blockers are sometimes used in a combination therapy to treat angina, if a β-blocker doesn't work well enough on its own. They are used as anti-arrhythmic drugs in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiac dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. The treatment with β-blockers reduces the incidence of sudden heart failure when the patient has already had a myocardial infarction. The reason is probably because of their anti-arrhythmic effects and also anti-ischemic effects. [...] A β-blocker therapy is also useful in myocardial infarction, independent to heart failure. The therapy has been very helpful for high-risk patients. [...] All β-blockers are able to lower blood pressure and therefore are they the first choice of drugs for hypertension. But if they are used along with calcium channel blockers, β-blockers have more functionality. They also have an effect on cardiomyopathy, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and portal hypertension, to name a few.|$|E

40|$|Air-breathing fish of the Anabantoidei group {{meet their}} {{metabolic}} <b>requirements</b> for <b>oxygen</b> through both aerial and aquatic gas exchange. Siamese fighting fish Betta splendens are anabantoids that frequently engage in aggressive male-male interactions which cause {{significant increases in}} metabolic rate and <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements.</b> These interactions involve opercular flaring behaviour that is thought to limit aquatic oxygen uptake, and combines {{with the increase in}} metabolic rate to cause an increase in air-breathing behaviour. Air-breathing events interrupt display behaviour and increase risk of predation, raising the question of how Siamese fighting fish manage their <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements</b> during agonistic encounters. Using open-flow respirometry, we measured rate of oxygen consumption in displaying fish to determine if males increase oxygen uptake per breath to minimise visits to the surface, or increase their reliance on aquatic oxygen uptake. We found that the increased <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements</b> of Siamese fighting fish during display behaviour were met by increased oxygen uptake from the air with no significant changes in aquatic oxygen uptake. The increased aerial oxygen uptake was achieved almost entirely by an increase in air-breathing frequency. We conclude that limitations imposed by the reduced gill surface area of air-breathing fish restrict the ability of Siamese fighting fish to increase aquatic uptake, and limitations of the air-breathing organ of anabantoids largely restrict their capacity to increase oxygen uptake per breath. The resulting need to increase surfacing frequency during metabolically demanding agonistic encounters has presumably contributed to the evolution of the stereotyped surfacing behaviour seen during male-male interactions, during which one of the fish will lead the other to the surface, and each will take a breath of air.

40|$|While a {{considerable}} amount of evidence has been accumulated about the history of oxygen on this planet, {{little is known about the}} relative amounts to which primitive cells might have been exposed. One clue may be found in the metabolic pathways of extant microorganisms. While eucaryotes are principally aerobic organisms, a number are capable of anaerobic growth by fermentation. One such eucaryotic microorganism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, will grow in the complete absence of oxygen when supplemented with unsaturated fatty acid and sterol. Oxygen-requiring enzymes are involved in the synthesis of both of these compounds. Studies have demonstrated that the oxidative desaturation of palmitic acid and the conversion of squalene to sterols occur in the range of 10 -(3) to 10 (- 2) PAL. Thus, if the <b>oxygen</b> <b>requirements</b> of these enzymatic processes are an indication, eucaryotes might be more primitive than anticipated from the microfossil record.
