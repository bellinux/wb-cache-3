40|$|Digital {{manufacturing}} {{eliminates the}} expense and {{time required to}} develop custom products. By utilizing this technology, designers can quickly create a customized product specifically for their performance needs. But the timescale and expense from the engineering design workflows used to develop these customized products have not been adapted from the workflows used in mass production. In many cases these customized designs build upon already successful mass-produced products that were developed using conventional engineering design workflows. Many times {{as part of this}} conventional design process significant time is spent creating and validating high fidelity models that accurately predict the performance of the final design. These existing validated high fidelity models used for the mass-produced design can be reused for analysis and design of unknown products. This thesis explores the integration of reduced order modeling and detailed analysis into the engineering design workflow developing a customized design using digital manufacturing. Specifically, detailed analysis is coupled with proper orthogonal decomposition to enable the exploration of the design space while simultaneously shaping the model representing the design. This revised workflow is examined using the design of a laboratory scale <b>overhead</b> <b>mixer</b> impeller. The case study presented here is compared with the design of the Kar Dynamic Mixer impeller developed by The Dow Chemical Company. The result of which is a customized design for a refined set of operating conditions with improved performance...|$|E

The objectives were to understand the effect of pressure on dough during kneading in order to optimize dough kneading conditions. The well-known experimental strategy was to knead with overpressure to incorporate gas into the dough and maximize dough aeration then to subdivide the gas bubbles introduced in the previous step by applying a vacuum in the <b>mixer's</b> <b>overhead.</b> The results showed that dough aeration was proportional to the number of rotations of the spiral. The time to reach equilibrium was longer for a larger pressure drop. The kinetics of disentrainment were slower with the highest pressure drop...|$|R
