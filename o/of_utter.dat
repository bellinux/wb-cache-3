5|$|John {{was deeply}} {{suspicious}} of the barons, particularly those with sufficient power and wealth to potentially challenge the king. Numerous barons were subjected to John's malevolentia, even including William Marshal, a famous knight and baron normally held up as a model <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> loyalty. The most infamous case, which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time, was that of William de Braose, a powerful marcher lord with lands in Ireland. De Braose was subjected to punitive demands for money, and when he refused to pay a huge sum of 40,000 marks (equivalent to £26,666 at the time), his wife {{and one of his}} sons were imprisoned by John, which resulted in their deaths. De Braose died in exile in 1211, and his grandsons remained in prison until 1218. John's suspicions and jealousies meant that he rarely enjoyed good relationships with even the leading loyalist barons.|$|E
25|$|Scrope was {{absolutely}} {{not satisfied with}} this explanation of the presence and formation of rocks. He {{and many of his}} contemporaries were probably disturbed by the sense <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> finality, the idea that the earth was in a stage of winding down and would see no further development or change. George spent much time performing research locally and discussing the matter with colleagues.|$|E
25|$|In Coffee {{a picture}} <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> destitution is drawn. Like the story A Little Blade of Grass this story also deals with master-servant relations, but the elderly {{woman who is}} the focus of this story doesn't live in the master's house and consume his food. She knows how to defer to the wealth and status of the wealthy neighbors that {{surround}} her and cater to their every need, but it does her little good in the end.|$|E

25|$|MAD divided {{potential}} {{nuclear war}} into two stages: first strike and second strike. First strike meant the {{first use of}} nuclear weapons by one nuclear-equipped nation against another nuclear-equipped nation. If the attacking nation did not prevent the attacked nation from a nuclear response, the attacked nation would respond with a second strike against the attacking nation. In this situation, whether the U.S. first attacked the USSR or the USSR first attacked the U.S., the end result would be that both nations would be damaged to the point <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> social collapse.|$|E
25|$|On {{arrival at}} the site of the {{accident}} the members of the (surgical) team made their way towards the front of the train, where they were confronted with scenes <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> devastation beyond their previous experience. The third carriage had been cleared of all but one live casualty trapped by her limbs. This passenger was successfully released about one hour later by the surgical member of the resuscitation team. The second carriage had been cleared of the living but there were several victims who were trapped and obviously dead. The front carriage was an indescribable tangle of twisted metal and in it the living and the dead were heaped together, intertwined among themselves and the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{permanent}} heaven or hell in Hinduism. In the afterlife, based on one's karma, {{the soul is}} reborn as another being in heaven, hell, or a living being on earth (human, animal). Gods too die once their past karmic merit runs out, as do those in hell, and they return getting another chance on earth. This reincarnation continues, endlessly in cycles, until one embarks on a spiritual pursuit, realizes self-knowledge, and thereby gains mokṣa, the final release out of the reincarnation cycles. This release {{is believed to be}} a state <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> bliss, which Hindu traditions believe is either related or identical to Brahman, the unchanging reality that existed before the creation of universe, continues to exist, and shall exist after the universe ends.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, Pozzo and Lucky reappear, but {{the rope}} is much shorter than during their last visit, and Lucky now guides Pozzo, {{rather than being}} {{controlled}} by him. As they arrive, Pozzo trips over Lucky and they together fall into a motionless heap. Estragon sees an opportunity to exact revenge on Lucky for kicking him earlier. The issue is debated lengthily until Pozzo shocks the pair by revealing {{that he is now}} blind and Lucky is now mute. Pozzo further claims to have lost all sense of time, and assures the others that he cannot remember meeting them before, but also does not expect to recall today's events tomorrow. His commanding arrogance from yesterday appears to have been replaced by humility and insight. His parting wordswhich Vladimir expands upon laterare ones <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> despair. Lucky and Pozzo depart; meanwhile Estragon has again fallen asleep.|$|E
25|$|Buchanan {{was much}} liked by the Gardaí {{with whom he}} {{established}} a good and effective working relationship. At the Smithwick Tribunal {{more than twenty years}} after his death, several former Garda officers testified they had come to regard him as a personal friend as he frequently visited their stations in his capacity as Border Superintendent. His job also meant that he became known to the Provisional IRA in Dundalk and other towns in County Louth as he would usually travel south in the same car without changing its number plates. He was 5'9 with a large, heavy-set build, and had been described as a man <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> integrity and a dedicated, able and proud police officer who was well respected by his colleagues {{on both sides of the}} border. He was also a devout Christian who was a lay Presbyterian preacher at his church in Lisburn. He had written a book on the history of the Kellswater Reformed Presbyterian Church, located outside Ballymena, County Antrim; it was published after his death.|$|E
25|$|In {{the twelfth}} century Monfragüe was the centre of a Mountjoy commandary before it became the {{headquarters}} of its own order. The earliest reference to the commandary is in an economic transaction involving the commander, Gonzalo Padilla, and his fellow brothers (freyes, freires) of the Order. As early as 1186 the Order had tried to amalgamate with the Templars but failed. The remaining decade of its existence was spent in a state <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> collapse. The Order was united in December 1187 with the Hospital of the Holy Redeemer, but already a distinction had appeared in its ranks between {{the master of the}} order, Fralmo, and his followers on one hand and the commander of the Order in the Kingdom of Castile, Rodrigo González, and his support. By mid-1188 there was a schism in the Order, though it {{does not appear to have}} broken down along the lines Castile and León on one hand and the Crown of Aragon on the other, as sometimes supposed. When the final split occurred in 1196, over the successful amalgamation with the Templars, all opponents of the merger would have had to leave the lands of Alfonso II of Aragon, a strong supporter of the Temple.|$|E

500|$|An area {{of study}} or {{speculation}} that masquerades as science {{in an attempt to}} claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science. Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term [...] "cargo cult science" [...] for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of it but actually lack the [...] "kind <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> honesty" [...] that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Feynman {{delivered}} the Caltech commencement {{address on the}} topic of cargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience {{due to a lack of}} [...] "a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> honesty" [...] on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E
500|$|Total average {{precipitation}} in the Craters of the Moon area is between [...] per year. Most {{of this is}} lost in cracks in the basalt, only to emerge later in springs and seeps in {{the walls of the}} Snake River Canyon. Older lava fields on the plain have been invaded by drought-resistant plants such as sagebrush, while younger fields, such as Craters of the Moon, only have a seasonal and very sparse cover of vegetation. From a distance this cover disappears almost entirely, giving an impression <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> black desolation. Repeated lava flows over the last 15,000 years have raised the land surface enough to expose it to the prevailing southwesterly winds, which help to keep the area dry. Together these conditions make life on the lava field difficult.|$|E

Sarah Hajibagheri from The Times and Armond White, music and film {{critic for the}} New York Press, were not impressed with the song. Hajibagheri said [...] "The appearance of Beyoncé's vocal alongside ringtones on Telephone adds to the sense <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> chaos." [...] White elaborated that [...] " [...] celebrates a heedless refusal to communicate; to mindlessly, heartlessly indulge pop culture—Tarantino style." [...] Melanie Bertoldi from Billboard gave the song a positive review, stating [...] "Much like Kesha's 'Blah Blah Blah', 'Telephone' sets out to silence bugaboos, with whom featured artist Beyoncé is all too familiar. ... By the time [...] "Telephone" [...] surges through a wall of cellular bleeps to return to its simple introduction, Gaga and Beyoncé have left the listener with just one option: surrender to the dancefloor." ...|$|E
500|$|Caesar A. Montevecchio of the University of Notre Dame {{published}} a theological {{assessment of the}} spiritual themes in the film concentrating on the act of priestly renunciation depicted towards the end stating: [...] "This climactic scene of Rodrigues trampling the fumie makes clear that Silence {{is as much about}} the object of Christian faith as it is the experience of that faith. As ambient and live sound are washed out entirely, Rodrigues hears the voice of Christ telling him to trample, that it was to be trampled upon that Christ came into the world. The object of faith becomes a Christ who is a hero of pity, who takes up the weakness and suffering of humankind as his cross, rather than a hero of triumphant resolve. The Jesus of Silence is one <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> kenosis (self-emptying), and one who in the mercy of that kenosis radically sympathizes with the weakness, and frailty, of human beings, even ones like Judas and Kichijiro." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{plates are}} set spaces without fixed boundaries; the mayhem extends outside the frames {{of the picture}} plane in all directions. Thus, they express the {{randomness}} of violence, and in their immediacy and brutality they {{have been described as}} analogous to 19th- and 20th-century photojournalism. According to Robert Hughes, as with Goya's earlier Caprichos series, The Disasters of War is likely to have been intended as a [...] "social speech"; satires on the then prevailing [...] "hysteria, evil, cruelty and irrationality [...] the absence of wisdom" [...] of Spain under Napoleon, and later the Inquisition. It is evident Goya viewed the Spanish war with disillusionment, and despaired both for the violence around him and for the loss of a liberal ideal he believed was being replaced by a new militant unreason. Hughes believed Goya's decision to render the images through etchings, which by definition are absent of colour, indicates feelings <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> hopelessness.|$|E

500|$|The two symphonies divide opinion {{even more}} sharply. Mason rates the Second poorly for its [...] "over-obvious rhythmic scheme", but calls the First [...] "Elgar's masterpiece. ... It {{is hard to}} see how any candid student can deny the greatness of this symphony." [...] However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express {{reservations}} about one or both symphonies. In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in The Gramophone, [...] "For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival work." [...] The critic John Warrack wrote, [...] "There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> grief", whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and angst and is marked instead by a [...] "benevolent tranquillity." ...|$|E
500|$|Show No Mercy was {{met with}} {{polarized}} opinions when it was issued, but in some recent reviews {{it came to be}} considered a classic album. In 1984, Dave Dickson of Kerrang! crushed the album defining it [...] "pure, unadulterated junk", while Bernard Doe of Metal Forces called the record [...] "one of the heaviest, fastest, most awesome albums of all time!" [...] The German magazine Rock Hard gave Show No Mercy a positive review, which remarked how Slayer were [...] "actually the hardest and fastest" [...] in comparison with their contemporaries Metallica and Exciter, and defined their music as [...] "heavy metal punk." [...] AllMusic reviewer Jeremy Ulrey had mixed feelings towards the album, saying that even though the musicianship and production were [...] "amateurish" [...] compared to Slayer's later releases, the album remains [...] "solid, if inessential, part of the Slayer legacy". Users voted 4/5 at AllMusic. Sputnikmusic staff member Hernan M. Campbell described the album as [...] "fast, heavy, and mean, inducing an inescapable atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> atrocity." [...] He noted that the [...] "lo-fi" [...] production quality gives the album a [...] "classic" [...] feeling.|$|E
500|$|The show's writers {{spent time}} researching local California {{politics}} and attending Los Angeles City Council meetings. Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This confirmed his existing impression: [...] "I've been to some community meetings in my life, {{and it is}} often this feeling <b>of</b> <b>utter</b> sparseness. That nobody cares." [...] The depiction of public hearings in several Parks and Recreation episodes was inspired by this perspective, which was also {{the basis for the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur asked urban planners in Claremont, California, whether efforts to turn a construction pit into a park could realistically take several months or longer. They told him that was entirely plausible, and that they had recently broken ground on a park that had been in various planning stages for 18 years. Schur said the pit project was conceived as a device to bring all the characters together, which was partially inspired by the way various characters in The Wire were brought together to work toward a common goal or project. The writers originally envisioned the pit becoming a park only in the series finale, although those plans were later changed and the pit was filled in during the second season.|$|E
