25|$|When fetal {{hemoglobin}} production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult hemoglobin (HbA). Children with sickle-cell disease instead begin producing a defective form of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S which aggregates together and forms filaments that cause {{red blood cells}} to change their shape from round to sickle-shaped. These defective red blood cells have a greater tendency to stack <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and block blood vessels. These invariably lead to so-called painful vaso-occlusive episodes, which are {{a hallmark of the}} disease.|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of ancient India, the {{inscriptions}} were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves. This tradition dates back to over two thousand years. Even after the Indian languages were put on paper in the 13th century, palm leaves where considered a preferred medium of writing owing to its longevity (nearly 400 years) compared to paper. Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to Southeast Asia. The palm leaf was an excellent surface for penwriting, making possible the delicate lettering used {{in many of the}} scripts of southern Asia.|$|E

25|$|The {{match between}} Liverpool and Nottingham Forest began as {{scheduled}} at 3:00pm. Fans were still streaming into pens 3 and 4 {{from the rear}} entrance tunnel as the match began. For some time, problems {{at the front of}} the Liverpool central goal pens went largely unnoticed except by those inside it, and by a few police at that end of the pitch. Liverpool's goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, reported fans from behind him pleading to him for help as the situation worsened. The police at first attempted to stop fans from spilling out of the pens, some believing this to be a pitch invasion. At approximately 3:05pm in match action, Peter Beardsley kicked a shot which struck Nottingham Forest's goal bar. Possibly connected to the excitement, a surge in pen 3 caused one of its metal crush barriers to give way, thrusting people forward <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> and into the pen's front fences.|$|E
25|$|All mountain-building strata {{consists}} of sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic era, that were originally laid {{down on the}} seabed. The base of the mountain comprises muschelkalk beds; its upper layers are made of Wetterstein limestone. With steep rock walls up to 800metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper Triassic that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, arêtes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algae in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-white and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains lead and zinc ore. These minerals were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the Höllental valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from {{the foot of the}} Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder Köpfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze {{it can be seen that}} this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that were piled <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
