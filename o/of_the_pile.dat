40|$|In {{this paper}} we present <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> {{distributed}} fibre optic sensor (DFOS) technology {{to measure the}} temperature and strain of reinforced concrete test piles during construction and during static load tests. Eight test piles were recently instrumented with DFOS, on three construction sites in London, by the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (CSIC), in collaboration with Ove Arup & Partners Ltd. The concrete curing temperature profiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> were used to detect <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> significant defects in <b>the</b> <b>piles.</b> <b>The</b> load test strain profiles along <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> {{were used to determine}} <b>the</b> load capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> and estimate <b>the</b> design parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various soil strata, as well as the internal relative displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> under various loads. Being distributed in nature, DFOS give a much more detailed picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> a test pile, as compared to traditional embedded point sensors, such as vibrating wire strain gauges and extensometers. This is demonstrated with a sample of data obtained from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrumented test <b>piles.</b> This is <b>the</b> author accepted manuscript.

40|$|AbstractThe jet mixing {{anchor pile}} {{is a new}} kind of {{supporting}} technology for foundation pit engineering in soft clay. <b>The</b> engineering features <b>of</b> jet mixing anchor pile as well as the difference between it and normal anchor bolt are introduced. <b>The</b> uplift tests <b>of</b> 4 jet mixing anchor piles are presented in detail to obtain the ultimate bearing capacity and load–deformation relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piles.</b> Load-transfer analysis, which is rarely applied in <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> uplift <b>piles,</b> is carried out on <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> with a hyperbolic calculation model.

25|$|Burn piles can {{and have}} spread {{uncontrolled}} fires, {{for example if}} wind blows burning material off the pile into surrounding combustible grasses or onto buildings.

25|$|UDDTs with {{a single}} vault have {{interchangeable}} containers to collect the fecal material. Depending {{on the size of}} the vault, two or more containers can be stored inside. Containers should be limited to a maximum volume of approximately 50 litres, so that they still can be manually moved when they fill up. Once a container is full, it can be left for further dehydration or removed for further treatment. Removal of the container requires care due to fresh, potentially pathogen-loaded feces being on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> in the container. Because of the limited ventilation within a plastic bucket, such single-vault UDDTs may not reduce the pathogen load as effectively as double-vault UDDTs. Therefore, a post-treatment of the fecal material is usually required. This can be achieved through further dehydration, composting processes or heat treatments.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVertical and {{inclined}} piles {{are used}} in seismic areas {{where they could be}} subjected to oblique harmonic vibration loads. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> closely spaced battered <b>piles</b> on <b>the</b> pile–soil–pile interaction has not yet been fully recognized.

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{additional}} instruments {{are used for}} packing the weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for producing very fine pieces use additional tools. In Kerman, a saber like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In Bijar, a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on in order to compact the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process to compact the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile,</b> warps, and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of slight deviations {{within the same}} colour is called abrash (from Turkish abraş, literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, {{who did not have}} enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a newly planned carpet design.|$|E

Cork were far from finished, however, and when Pa Cronin saw his chance, he picked his spot with an accurate finish to the net, and the sides were level going into the final five minutes.

25|$|An augercast pile, often {{known as}} a {{continuous}} flight augering (CFA) pile, is formed by drilling into {{the ground with a}} hollow stemmed continuous flight auger to the required depth or degree of resistance.

Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed.
