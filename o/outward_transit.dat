50|$|Had {{the ship}} gone through at 0850 {{with the last}} of the tide behind her in keeping with local practice, and as the pilot had advised, she would not have {{encountered}} the unusually strong contrary ebb tide which quickly overpowered the tugs to result in the loss. Captain Hewitt had his reasons for delaying the ship until 0920, but Conway adequately demonstrated that waiting for water in adverse conditions on a big tide was not an option. If it was considered that the ship had insufficient water at 0850, then as Pilot Jones recognised, the <b>outward</b> <b>transit</b> was impossible on such a day, but the pilot's advice was disregarded.|$|E
5000|$|Conway's logbook shows {{she left}} the mooring at 0822 and arrived at Britannia Bridge at 0850, which was the locally {{recommended}} time for starting the <b>outward</b> <b>transit</b> and Jones the pilot naturally advised keeping her going {{with the last of}} the northeast-going flood tide behind her. Instead Captain Hewitt had the ship brought up for half an hour to wait until 0920. The severe wind in the Irish Sea caused the stream in the Strait to turn to the westward earlier which eliminated the brief slack water period. Captain F J Durrant, marine manager of the towing company, observed [...] "The anticipated ten minute slack water did not materialise. The ebb set in immediately the flood ended at 0920." [...] With the ship far too late and sensitive to the adverse conditions the pilot advised going back. Captain Hewitt passed the ship under Britannia Bridge at 0923 even though the ebb tide was already setting against him.|$|E

There has been a 25 per cent growth in international cargo movement to and from Kolkata airport and a 15 per cent increase in <b>outward</b> <b>transit.</b> Automobile parts accounted {{for the bulk of}} the growth in the movement of cargo from the city to other countries. In November 2008 the first Centre for Perishable Cargo (CPC) in West Bengal was opened at the airport. The CPC has an area of 742.5 m2 and an annual storage capacity of 12,000 million tonnes. The CPC had been undergoing trials that started in June 2008 and was built with a [...] grant-in-aid from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) part of the Commerce Ministry. The volume of export was 21,683 ton in 2008-09, during the current fiscal more than 23,042 ton of cargo were handled by the airport authorities. Similarly the volume of import cargo was increased from 16,863 ton to 18,733 ton recording more than ten per cent jump during the same period. However, in 2008-09 the total volume of cargo handled by the airport declined by 4.8% from the previous year.|$|E
30|$|A seductive {{feature of}} the {{alternating}} carrier model for glucose transport is that it rationalizes how accelerated exchange and counter flow of glucose may occur (Thomas et al. 1957; Wilbrandt and Rosenberg 1961). The explanation for accelerated ligand exchange is that the path for ligand exchange via the alternating carrier nodes inwards (Cout[*]→[*]GCout[*]→[*]GCin[*]→[*]Cin) and outwards (Cin[*]→[*]GCin[*]→[*]GCout[*]→[*]Cout) short-circuits the slow path of vacant-carrier <b>outward</b> <b>transits</b> (Cin[*]→[*]Cout) or (Cout[*]→[*]Cin) (Fig.  1 A), where Cin and Cout represent the inwardly and outwardly facing empty carrier site and GCin and GCout the inwardly and outwardly facing liganded sites.|$|R
50|$|Until the mid 20th century, {{cities were}} {{generally}} organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods. For most {{of human history}} this meant a city that was entirely walkable, although {{with the development of}} mass transit the reach of the city extended <b>outward</b> along <b>transit</b> lines, allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as streetcar suburbs. But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies, attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car. Specifically, after World War II urban planning largely centered around the use of municipal zoning ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development, and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing middle class. The physical separation of where people live from where they work, shop and frequently spend their recreational time, together with low housing density, which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms, made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of automobile dependency.|$|R
40|$|This dataset {{was created}} for the {{research}} project: Rotterdam-Antwerp, {{a century and a}} half of port competition, 1880 - 2000. The aim of the project was to investigate different variables that influence competition between these ports and their overall effect on cargo flows. This dataset only contains statistics on Rotterdam. (Dataset D 0095 contains the data collected on the port of Antwerp.) The statistics offer detailed time-series on international cargo flows passing through Rotterdam. Cargo shipped to and from the port by domestic short-sea shipping is not registered by the sources, because in this kind of transport no border is crossed. Furthermore, like sea-borne transport, only hinterland transport from and to Rotterdam that has a foreign origin or destination is registered in the available statistical series. In other words, not all maritime-related hinterland transport is registered: transports within the Netherlands are missing. On the other hand, the hinterland data also contain cargo flows that have no relation with sea-borne transport to and from Rotterdam at all. It is not possible to assess the volume of these so-called continental transports. They consist for instance of exports by Rotterdam manufacturing firms to neighbouring European countries. This is a very important feature of the database. It implies that it is not possible to match the sea-borne traffic with the hinterland transports or, in other words, to assess the total modal split in hinterland transport of cargo that is shipped to and from Rotterdam by sea. The database is organized around the following general categories of cargo flows: 1. imports 2. inward bound transit 3. all incoming cargo 4. exports 5. <b>outward</b> bound <b>transit</b> 6. all outgoing cargo.

5000|$|High {{water at}} Liverpool that morning was 11:18, at {{a height of}} 32'10" [...] and was the highest tide that year. Lavers Almanac quotes high water at Menai Bridge as 28 minutes before high water Liverpool. What is termed 'slack' in the Swellies is {{actually}} {{a brief period of}} uneasy equilibrium between two opposing flood streams which typically occurs 1 hour 42 minutes before local high water, or at 09:08 {{on the morning of the}} move. Owing to the strength of the southwest-going ebb, which runs at 8 knots during a spring tide there is a confused complex tidal flow among the numerous rocks and islets generating many powerful eddies. On a big tide in particular it is vital for an outbound vessel to be through the Swellies before the tide turns against her. It is therefore the local practice to start an <b>outward</b> <b>transit</b> with the last of the northeast-going flood 20 minutes before the 'slack', or at 08:48 on the morning of the move. Captain Hewitt had worked with the Caernarvon harbour master, Captain Rees Thomas, in preparing his plan, and had several times made a passage of the Swellies in the Conways motor boat, checking his timings at 4 kn. He also consulted Conways old log book for the timings of the previous transit, and had planned to arrive at the bridge at 09:20.|$|E
40|$|The {{riverine}} boundaries {{dividing the}} People’s Republic of China from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (the DPRK, or North Korea) remain sites of intense contestation among illegal traders and trafficked individuals, public security bureaus and border forces, and journalists and intelligence agents. Mass media discourse {{has tended to}} regard the region primarily as a site of one-way <b>outward</b> <b>transit</b> of victimized refugees from the DPRK, rather than treating the illegal North Korean border-crossers as pragmatic and capable of agency, or recognizing that legal crossings into China have increased since Kim Jong-un came to power. This article seeks to use a matrix of sources from within North Korea, Chinese government agencies, North Korean state media, defector testimonies and memoirs, along with recent quantitative studies to synthesize a new view of the region focused on security...|$|E
40|$|Predators {{are thought}} to reduce travel speed and {{increase}} turning rate in areas where resources are relatively more abundant, a behavior termed ‘‘area-restricted search. ’’ However, evidence for this is rare, and few empirical data exist for large predators. Animals exhibiting foraging site fidelity could also be spatially aware of suitable feeding areas based on prior experience; changes in movement patterns might therefore arise from the anticipation of higher prey density. We tested the hypothesis that regions of area-restricted search were associated with a higher number of daily speed spikes (a proxy for potential prey encounter rate) and foraging success in southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), a species exhibiting both area-restricted searches and high interannual foraging site fidelity. We used onshore morphological measurements and diving data from archival tags deployed during winter foraging trips. Foraging success was inferred from in situ changes in relative lipid content derived from measured changes in buoyancy, and first-passage time {{analysis was used to}} identify area-restricted search behavior. Seals exhibited relatively direct southerly movement on average, with intensive search behavior predominantly located at the distal end of tracks. The probability of being in search mode was positively related to changes in relative lipid content; thus, intensively searched areas were associated with the highest foraging success. However, there was high foraging success during the <b>outward</b> <b>transit</b> even though seals moved through quickly without slowing down and increasing turning rate to exploit these areas. In addition, the probability of being in search mode was negatively related to the number of daily speed spikes. These results suggest that movement patterns represent a response to prior expectation of the location of predictable and profitable resources. Shelf habitat was 4 – 9 times more profitable than the other habitats, emphasizing the importance of the East Antarctic shelf for this and other predators in the region. We have provided rare empirical data with which to investigate the relationship between predator foraging strategy and prey encounter/ foraging success, underlining the importance of inferring the timing and spatial arrangement of successful food acquisition for interpreting foraging strategies correctly.
