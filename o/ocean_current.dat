This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> that swung Missouri too far to the right during the course correction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>currents.</b> Certain <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> have {{different}} temperatures. Warm <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> warm {{the air above}} it, which warms the coast. Cold <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> cool the air above it, which cools the coast. This helps keep the coast a consistent temperature.|$|R
50|$|Deep <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> {{are driven}} by density and {{temperature}} gradients. Thermohaline circulation {{is also known as}} the ocean's conveyor belt (which refers to deep ocean density driven <b>ocean</b> basin <b>currents).</b> These currents, called submarine rivers, flow under the surface of the ocean and are hidden from immediate detection. Where significant vertical movement of <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> is observed, this is known as upwelling and downwelling. Deep <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> are currently being researched using a fleet of underwater robots called Argo.|$|R
40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{provides an}} overview of some of the major factors that cause coastal and open <b>ocean</b> <b>currents.</b> Topics include longshore and rip currents, and upwelling events, as well as discussions of the Coriolis effect, the Ekman spiral, and thermohaline circulation. There is also information on methods for measuring currents and on how <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> affect human activities. The 'Roadmap to Resources' provides a set of links to other online resources on <b>ocean</b> <b>currents,</b> and there is also a set of lesson plans which integrates information presented in the Discovery Kit with data offerings from the Roadmap to Resources. These lesson plans focus on three major causes of <b>ocean</b> <b>currents,</b> and how mariners predict and compensate for the effects of coastal <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> while navigating their vessels.

5|$|Nansen {{first began}} to {{consider}} the possibility of reaching the North Pole by using the natural drift of the polar ice when, in 1884, he read the theories of Henrik Mohn, the distinguished Norwegian meteorologist. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an <b>ocean</b> <b>current,</b> flowing from east to west all the way across the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E
5|$|The Gulf Stream, {{together}} with its northern extension the North Atlantic Drift, is {{a warm and}} swift Atlantic <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and stretches {{to the tip of}} Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about , it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream, the Canary Current, recirculating off West Africa.|$|E

5|$|Surface {{currents}} only {{affect the}} top few hundred meters (yards) of the sea, {{but there are}} also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt. This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes, the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface, and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.|$|E
5|$|In {{a lecture}} given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, {{one of the}} founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics {{indicated}} the existence of an <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> flowing from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were read with interest by the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, then working as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on the sealer Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in drifting ice. An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland icecap, an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888–89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east–west Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.|$|E
25|$|Warming {{temperatures}} in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> patterns. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} ocean expeditions in oceanography, a major {{interest}} was {{the study of}} the <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> and temperature measurements. The tides, the Coriolis effect, changes in direction and strength of wind, salinity and temperature are the main factors determining <b>ocean</b> <b>currents.</b> The thermohaline circulation (THC) thermo- referring to temperature and -haline referring to salt content connects 4 of 5 ocean basins and is primarily dependent on the density of sea water. <b>Ocean</b> <b>currents</b> such as the Gulf Stream are wind-driven surface currents.|$|R

50|$|Knowledge {{of surface}} <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> is {{essential}} in reducing costs of shipping, since traveling with them reduces fuel costs. In the wind powered sailing-ship era, knowledge of wind patterns and <b>ocean</b> <b>currents</b> was even more essential. A {{good example of this}} is the Agulhas Current, which long prevented Portuguese sailors from reaching India. In recent times, around-the-world sailing competitors make good use of surface currents to build and maintain speed. <b>Ocean</b> <b>currents</b> are also very important in the dispersal of many life forms. An example is the life-cycle of the European Eel.|$|R

25|$|The Subantarctic Front, {{found between}} 48°S and 58°S in the Indian and Pacific Ocean and between 42°S and 48°S in the Atlantic Ocean, defines the {{northern}} {{boundary of the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current (or ACC). The ACC {{is the most important}} <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> in the Southern Ocean, and the only current that flows completely around the Earth. Flowing eastward through the southern portions of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, the ACC links these three otherwise separate oceanic basins. Extending from the sea surface to depths of 2000–4000 meters, and with a width of as great as 2000 kilometers, the ACC transports more water than any other <b>ocean</b> <b>current.</b> The ACC carries up to 150 Sverdrups (150 million cubic meters per second), equivalent to 150 times the volume of water flowing in all the world's rivers. The ACC and the global thermohaline circulation strongly influence regional and global climate as well as underwater biodiversity.|$|E
25|$|The North Sea is {{an arm of}} the Atlantic Ocean {{receiving}} the majority of <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> from the northwest opening, and a lesser portion of warm current from the smaller opening at the English Channel. These tidal currents leave along the Norwegian coast. Surface and deep water currents may move in different directions. Low salinity surface coastal waters move offshore, and deeper, denser high salinity waters move in shore.|$|E

In India, the monsoon lasts for 100 to 120 days from early June and to mid-September. The monsoon winds encounter various atmospheric conditions on their way and hence are pulsating in nature, and not steady.|$|E

25|$|The {{region is}} {{influenced}} by a major <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> system. Off the coast, the west wind drift current splits to create the Alaska and the California currents (the California current system). The direction and strength of the currents regulate the upwelling/downwelling regime along the coast, with a flow towards the equator in summer (California current) and reversal in winter (Alaska current). In addition to these two currents, a large submarine canyon acts as a primary conduit for the transfer of sediment from the continental slope to the deep-sea.|$|E
25|$|Los Angeles in {{particular}} is strongly predisposed to accumulation of smog, because of peculiarities of its geography and weather patterns. Los Angeles is situated in a flat basin with ocean {{on one side and}} mountain ranges on three sides. A nearby cold <b>ocean</b> <b>current</b> depresses surface air temperatures in the area, resulting in an inversion layer: a phenomenon where air temperature increases, instead of decreasing, with altitude, suppressing thermals and restricting vertical convection. All taken together, this results in a relatively thin, enclosed layer of air above the city that cannot easily escape out of the basin and tends to accumulate pollution.|$|E
