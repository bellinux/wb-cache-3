40|$|Hydrous {{pyrolysis}} {{experiments were}} performed on a recent microbial mat sample from Lagoa Vermelha, Brazil, to determine whether crude oil can be generated and expelled during artificial maturation of the Organic Matter (OM). The experiments were conducted at 280 ºC, 330 ºC and 350 ºC during 20 h. Two types of liquid pyrolysis products, assigned as <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> and bitumen, were isolated and analyzed. <b>Free</b> <b>oil</b> represents <b>free</b> organic phase released by hydrous pyrolysis, whereas bitumen was obtained by extraction from the solid pyrolysis residue with dichloromethane. Changes in the OM maturity were determined using Rock-Eval parameters and biomarker maturity ratios of original sample and pyrolysis products. Biomarker compositions of original sample extract and liquid pyrolysates were used for determination of dominant bacterial source. The yields of <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> and bitumen showed that a microbial mat OM has a high liquid hydrocarbons generation potential. Rock-Eval maturity parameters, biopolymer and biomarker compositions indicate a significant increase of the OM maturity during hydrous pyrolysis. At 280 ºC the release of free, adsorbed and occluded compounds was observed; however, without a cracking of the OM. At 330 ºC the generation of bitumen and <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> is mostly related to the OM cracking. The highest yield of <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> was recorded at this temperature.

40|$|A stepwise, {{time-varying}} pumping {{approach is}} developed to improve <b>free</b> phase <b>oil</b> recovery of light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) from a homogeneous, unconfined aquifer. Stepwise pumping is used to contain the floating oil plume and obtain efficient <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recovery. The graphical plots. The approach uses ARMOS©, an areal two-dimensional multiphase flow, finite-element simulation model. Systematic simulations of <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> area changes to pumping rates are analyzed. Pumping rates are determined that achieve LNAPL plume containment at different times (i. e. 90, 180 and 360 days) for a planning period of 360 days. These pumping rates are used in reverse order as a stepwise (monotonically increasing) pumping strategy. This stepwise pumping strategy is analyzed further by performing additional simulations at different pumping rates for the last pumping period. The final stepwise pumping strategy is varied by factors of − 25 % and + 30 % to evaluate sensitivity in the <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recovery process. Stepwise pumping is compared to steady pumping rates {{to determine the best}} <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recovery strategy. Stepwise pumping is shown to improve oil recovery by increasing recoveredoil volume (11 %) and decreasing residual oil (15 %) when compared with traditional steady pumping strategies. The best stepwise pumping strategy recovers more <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> by reducing the amount of residual oil left in the system due to pumping drawdown. This stepwise pumping pproach can be used to enhance <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recovery and provide for cost-effective design and management of LNAPL cleanup...|$|R

40|$|A {{modeling}} {{approach is}} presented that optimizes separate phase recovery of light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) {{for a single}} dual-extraction well in a homogeneous, isotropic unconfined aquifer. A simulation/regression/optimization (S/R/O) model is developed to predict, analyze, and optimize the oil recovery process. The approach combines detailed simulation, nonlinear regression, and optimization. The S/R/O model utilizes nonlinear regression equations describing system response to time-varying water pumping and oil skimming. Regression equations are developed for residual <b>oil</b> volume and <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> volume. The S/R/O model determines optimized time-varying (stepwise) pumping rates which minimize residual oil volume and maximize <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recovery while causing <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> volume to decrease a specified amount. This S/R/O modeling approach implicitly immobilizes the free product plume by reversing the water table gradient while achieving containment. Application to a simple representative problem illustrates the S/R/O model utility for problem analysis and remediation design. When compared with the best steady pumping strategies, the optimal stepwise pumping strategy improves <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recovery by 11. 5 % and reduces the amount of residual oil left in the system due to pumping by 15 %. The S/R/O model approach offers promise for enhancing the design of free phase LNAPL recovery systems and to help in making cost-effective operation and management decisions for hydrogeologists, engineers, and regulators...|$|R
40|$|High {{pressure}} processing (HPP) {{was applied}} as a pre-treatment on Moringa oleifera (MO) kernels, {{for the first}} time, prior to aqueous enzymatic extraction (AEE) of the MO oil, {{and the effect of}} this pre-treatment is reported in terms of the <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recovery {{and the nature of the}} cream emulsions formed. The HPP pre-treatments (50 - 250 MPa, 20 - 60 ⁰C, 10 - 60 min) generally resulted in higher <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recoveries and thinner emulsion layers from ground-sieved kernels than the whole kernels. Optimization of the HPP parameters indicated linear increment in <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recovery with increase in temperature and time, but not the pressure level. Without the pre-boiling step in the AEE process, the use of HPP pre-treatment at 50 MPa and 60 ⁰C for 35 min resulted in approximately 73 % (w/w) <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> recovery with thinner emulsion layer than the use of AEE alone.
