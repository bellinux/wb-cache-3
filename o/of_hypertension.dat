The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> or diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout {{are at increased risk}} <b>of</b> <b>hypertension,</b> diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b>|$|E

25|$|Exposure {{to stress}} {{increases}} sympathetic outflow, and repeated stress-induced vasoconstriction {{may result in}} vascular hypertrophy, leading to progressive increases in peripheral resistance and blood pressure. This could partly explain the greater incidence <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in lower socioeconomic groups, since they must endure greater levels of stress associated with daily living. Persons with a family history <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> manifest augmented vasoconstrictor and sympathetic responses to laboratory stressors, such as cold pressor testing and mental stress, that may predispose them to hypertension.

40|$|Portal {{hypertension}} is {{the main}} cause of complications in patients with cirrhosis.

40|$|Secondary {{hypertension}} {{occurs in}} 5 - 10 % {{of cases in}} the patient population with primary hypertension. The most common forms <b>of</b> secondary <b>hypertension</b> are as follows: parenchymal renal disease (renoparenchymal hypertension), renal artery stenosis (renovascular hypertension), adrenal gland adenoma (primary hyperaldosteronism), a tumour of the adrenal gland marrow (pheochromocytoma) and adenoma of adrenal and pituitary glands (Cushing’s syndrome). In patients with a typical clinical picture <b>of</b> secondary <b>hypertension,</b> the appropriate diagnostic tests should be conducted based on the suspected form <b>of</b> secondary <b>hypertension.</b> Determining a diagnosis <b>of</b> secondary <b>hypertension</b> is gradual. First, the appropriate screening tests are performed. If the screening test is positive, then additional tests to confirm the forms <b>of</b> secondary <b>hypertension</b> are conducted. Once a diagnosis of the appropriate form <b>of</b> secondary <b>hypertension</b> is confirmed, tests to distinguish causes and laterality tests to determine the precise localisation of the pathological process are applied to evaluate the response to therapy.

25|$|Single gene {{mutations}} {{can cause}} Mendelian forms of high blood pressure; ten genes {{have been identified}} which cause these monogenic forms <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> These mutations affect blood pressure by altering renal salt handling.

With the aid of genetic analysis techniques, a statistically significant linkage of blood pressure to several chromosomal regions, including regions linked to familial combined hyperlipidemia, was found. These findings suggest that there are many genetic loci, in the general population, each with small effects on blood pressure. Overall, however, identifiable single-gene causes <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> are uncommon, consistent with a multifactorial cause of essential hypertension.|$|E
