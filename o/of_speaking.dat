40|$|In {{my article}} I argue {{the need for}} an {{existence}} <b>of</b> grammar in <b>spoken</b> language. It would have the same functions as the grammar of written language: describing and explaining the fundamental units <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> language and their features, describing the composition of those units and their conjunction. The basic units in the grammar <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> language can be named as: the sound, the word, the functional unit, the conversational turn and the conversation itself. Further the central characteristics <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> language and their impact on grammar have to be taken into account. They are: the interactivity, the multimodality, the processabihty and the great variability. After displaying my concepts I discuss three alternative concepts of a grammar in spoken language: online-syntax, construction grammar and multimodal grammar. The article concludes by discussing the role <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> language grammar in language and foreign language teaching...|$|R

5|$|In Canada, as {{elsewhere}} in the world of European colonies, the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, {{led to the development of}} Mixed languages. Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable <b>of</b> <b>speaking</b> another language. Plains Sign Talk, which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders, reached across Canada, the United States and into Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 2007 The study {{presented}} here examines the concept <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> English held by tertiary teachers of English as a Foreign Language in China. The {{objective was to}} discover this knowledge so as to inform the design of professional development programs aiming to raise the standards <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> English teaching {{in order to meet}} new government policy objectives. A college in South China was chosen as the research site and 17 EFL teachers participated in the study. Data were collected through the teachers' written responses to samples <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> English, answers to a questionnaire, and focus group discussions. The findings of the study provide a 'map', showing both the range and the focus of how the teachers conceive of the features <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> English across its different domains, and the gaps between these concepts <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> English and those in contemporary theories. Although a wide range of features covering all domains <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> English are included by the teachers as a group, most of them focus more on the features of formal accuracy and fluency than on those in the domain of sociolinguistic and strategic language use. The findings also suggest a number of reasons for this imbalance. These include practical constraints, such as the national examination guides and big class size, and the teachers' lack of confidence and knowledge in certain domains <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> language use. Considered in light of current theories of language teaching, these findings show the knowledge, beliefs and assumptions of a representative group of teachers which can be used to guide the design of on-going professional development programs for such teachers in the area <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> English pedagogy.

5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language Instinct was {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways <b>of</b> <b>speaking,</b> the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E

Methods To measure level <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> language comprehension, two assessments of the Computer Based Instrument for Low Motor Testing (C-BiLLT) were performed with an interval of two years in 26 children with severe CP (mean age 84 months, age range 19 months to 181 months, 11 spastic CP, 15 dyskinetic CP). To acquire information about factors that could have influenced the level <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> language comprehension, a survey was distributed to both parents and speech and language therapists of the participants.
