5|$|A diatom floristic study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species {{and is a}} rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} facultative lagoons {{operated}} by Thames Water treating industrial wastewater in Thailand {{were found to}} be performing poorly, particularly with respect to <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> biological oxygen demand (BOD). A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design parameters for the site found that all <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> are <b>of</b> a sufficient area for the flow and BOD load. However, observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> suggested that there may be significant hydraulic short-circuiting. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling was therefore carried out on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> to establish <b>the</b> hydraulic regime. Two-consecutive simulations were carried out, both with and without baffles; the first to establish steady flow conditions, and the second using a chemical species transport model to obtain the residence time distribution (RTD). <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modelling indicate that <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> do currently suffer from significant short-circuiting, and large dead-zones are present. <b>The</b> installation <b>of</b> baffles in <b>the</b> CFD model improved <b>the</b> plug-flow characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoons,</b> substantially reducing <b>the</b> short-circuiting and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead-zones.

5|$|Group D, finally, was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between {{the sea and}} an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact.

5|$|The {{lifestyle}} of Archaeopteryx {{is difficult to}} reconstruct {{and there are several}} theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude Archaeopteryx from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoon.</b> It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.|$|E
5|$|Group C's 9th Tabor had also, {{like the}} M-24s of Group B, {{struggled}} through the marshes {{during the first}} phase of the operation, and were late in arriving at the jumping-off point for phase two, the canal. At 08:45, Moroccan units of Group C were investigating the village of Phu An on the opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> from Group D's landing area, when they came under heavy fire. Despite being nearer to Group D, the engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in Group C, who were by now some distance away, further inland. This delay, coupled with the failure of many of the units' SCR300 radios, meant that these advance elements of Group C failed to get through until 09:10. At 09:40, the commander of Group C called up various reinforcements from Hué including two companies of Vietnamese trainee NCOs and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of Group C until 18:00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter-attacked and occupied Phu-An. The 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Chasseurs Regiment had been requested to drop at 14:00 to support the advanced elements of Group C but did not jump until 16:50 and thus failed to assemble before the Moroccans themselves occupied Phu-An. With the final capture of Phu-An, the extreme southern tip of the encirclement, the pincer movement was complete.|$|E

40|$|Chironomid larvae were {{collected}} and abiotic variables measured at monthly intervals at 21 sampling stations in two lagoons (Guaraná and Patos) and two tributaries (Baía and Ivinheima) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper Paraná River floodplain.

The similarity in <b>the</b> generic composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chironomids <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> and <b>the</b> Baía River is {{probably due to the}} fact that this river presents hydrodynamic characteristics similar to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoons.</b> <b>The</b> results obtained suggest that <b>the</b> hydrodynamics <b>of</b> these environments are the main factor determining spatial variation in the chironomid fauna. This is intuitively clear, as this factor itself determines sediment type, quantity of organic matter and presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes. However, on a seasonal scale, the flood pulse seems to be the main controlling factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporal variation in densities and dominance of chironomid larvae. Given that this factor has a large influence on <b>the</b> temporal dynamics <b>of</b> several limnological variables, this is again a logical correlation. Our results suggest a strong relationship between the variations in the chironomid community and fluctuations in limnological characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Although prokaryotes {{are small}} in size, {{they are a}} {{significant}} biomass component in aquatic ecosystems and {{play a major role}} in biogeochemical processes. It is generally assumed that <b>the</b> relative importance <b>of</b> prokaryotes to material and energy fluxes is maximized in low-productivity (oligotrophic) ecosystems and decreases in high-productivity (eutrophic) ecosystems. Lagoon and coastal ecosystems are extremely dynamic, typically highly productive and dominated by macro-size organisms (both macrofauna and macrophytes). As such, their functional characteristics are typically evaluated from a "macrobial" perspective. An efficient ecosystem functioning, with fast nutrient cycling, high productivity, low C accumulation and lack of hypoxic/dystrophic crises is, however, intimately dependent on the interaction between microbial and macrobial organisms. We make here an attempt to relate prokaryote biodiversity (genotype richness, using fingerprinting techniques, ARISA) and ecosystem functioning (using a series of parameters including meiofaunal biomass, prokaryote C production and organic matter turnover rates) in different Mediterranean <b>lagoon</b> systems. <b>The</b> <b>lagoons</b> differed significantly with each other for all the variables. While no relationships were observed between <b>the</b> environmental characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> and <b>the</b> bacterial diversity, the latter was significantly and positively correlated with the functioning and efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoons.</b> <b>The</b> investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> links between microbial diversity and functioning in lagoons is still at its infancy, but these preliminary results suggest that a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> prokaryote diversity on ecosystem functioning and efficiency could open new perspectives for the conservation and management of these highly productive and vulnerable ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Benthic microalgae (BMA) play {{important}} roles in shallow coastal systems. Few studies have addressed <b>the</b> combined effects <b>of</b> ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) and nutrient enrichment on <b>the</b> productivity <b>of</b> BMA. Here we use field and microcosms experiments to explore the single and combined effects of ambient and increased UVB and sediment nutrient enrichment on <b>the</b> productivity <b>of</b> BMA in two shallow coastal <b>lagoons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Central Gulf of Mexico. We found few negative effects of ambient and increased UVB levels, even though increased UVB levels were higher than liberal predictions of anthropogenic increase for the studied area.

Such protective responses {{do not appear to}} be limited by ambient nutrient availability. This study indicates that sediment nutrient enrichment is a more important driver for BMA, and by default for <b>the</b> ecological functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> studied, than current and predicted UVB levels. These conclusions, however, may not apply to other coastal systems, where <b>the</b> interactive effects <b>of</b> fertilization and UVB on BMA deserve further investigation...|$|R
