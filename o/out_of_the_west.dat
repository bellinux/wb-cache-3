5|$|Tennessee's first Final Four {{game was}} against SEC foe, Arkansas, the 9th-seed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Region.

Despite a poor first half shooting performance, the Vols led 39–28 halfway through the game. The second half saw the Lady Vols make over half their shots, propelling the team to the national championship with an 86–58, the largest margin of victory in the Women's National Semifinals history.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived on}} 22 July 1718, surprising and trapping a ship commanded by pirate Charles Vane. After negotiations failed, Vane used a captured French vessel as a fireship {{in an attempt}} to ram the naval vessels. The attempt failed, but the naval vessels were forced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> end of Nassau harbour, giving Vane's crew an opportunity to raid the town and secure the best local pilot. Vane and his men then escaped in a small sloop via the harbour's narrow east entrance. The pirates had evaded the trap, but Nassau and New Providence Island were in Rogers' hands.|$|E
5|$|Tenaya, Yosemite, Bridalveil and Pigeon Creeks {{join the}} Merced before it {{breaches}} the glacial moraine at the valley's end. From there the river picks up Cascade Creek and turns south near El Portal, flowing through Merced River Canyon. State Route 140 follows the river <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> {{entrance to the}} national park, a few miles before the South Fork Merced River, the largest tributary, joins from the left. The river arcs northwest to receive the North Fork, and a few miles after it enters Lake McClure, formed by New Exchequer Dam. Below New Exchequer, the river flows west through a heavily irrigated region of the Central Valley, passing through McSwain and Crocker-Huffman Dams and the cities of Hopeton, Delhi and Livingston. It joins the San Joaquin River at Hills Ferry, a few miles south of Turlock.|$|E

5|$|The {{task force}} left Hastings—{{approximately}} 15 minutes' flying {{time from the}} West Side Boys' camp—at approximately 06:15. Downstream from the villages—approximately 15 minutes' flying time, just <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Side Boys' visual and hearing range, the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams time to get into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams were on the ground. Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including {{the roof of the}} building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys {{in the vicinity of the}} captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as safe as possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams.|$|E

25|$|The last ING Cup {{match of}} the month was on 25 November between the Warriors and the Tigers at the WACA Ground, a match that was decided on the last ball – the Warriors batted to 262 for 7 after 72 from Chris Rogers and 66 from Shaun Marsh, but Michael Di Venuto hit a hundred for the Tigers, before three wickets fell for 21 to leave the Tigers at 255 for 7 with an over to spare. After two runs came off the first four deliveries, Scott Kremerskothen hit Steve Magoffin for four off the {{penultimate}} ball before taking two off the last to win the game. On the same day, West Indies batsman Brian Lara hit 202 unbeaten runs {{in the third and}} final Test to become the second batsman to pass 11,000 Test runs, and he broke Allan Border's Test record of most runs on the following day, making 226 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies total of 405. However, Australia replied with 428 after Hussey hit another century, and despite the efforts of Bravo (six for 84 in the first innings, 64 with the bat in the second), West Indies lost by seven wickets after Warne took six wickets in the West Indies' second innings and Hayden hit an unbeaten 87 to take Australia to the target and the whitewash.|$|E

25|$|In the {{cardinal}} directions of Midwestern Native Americans, the wolf represented the west, but it represented the southeast for the Pawnee tribe. According to the Pawnee creation myth, the wolf {{was the first}} creature to experience death. The Wolf Star, enraged at not having been invited to attend a council on how the Earth should be made, sent a wolf to steal the whirlwind bag of The Storm that Comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West,</b> which contained the first humans. Upon being freed from the bag, the humans killed the wolf, thus bringing death into the world. Native Americans have long seen the wolf as an animal of power. Many tribes credit the actual creator of the earth to be a wolf. The Arikara and Ojibwe believed a wolfman spirit made the Great Plains for them and for other animals. Many tribes consider wolves to be closely related to humans. The reason for this belief {{is because of the}} wolf’s dedication to its pack, a trait the tribes attributed with themselves. The Navajo tribe was known for performing healing ceremonies where they would call upon wolves to restore health to their ill. Wolves were admired for their superb hunting skills.Prayers were offered in honor of wolves before they went out of hunting excursions. The Pawnee’s connection with wolves was so great that their hand signal for Pawnee was actually the same one that they had for wolf. Before battles, Apache warriors would pray, sing, and dance to gain the teamwork, strength, and bravery of wolves.|$|E
