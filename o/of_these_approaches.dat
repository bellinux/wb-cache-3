40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} {{two different}} approaches utilized {{in research on}} education: quantitative and qualitative research. A description <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two <b>approaches</b> {{is followed by a}} discussion of how the components <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two <b>approaches</b> differ. Philosophical assumptions, methods/types, purposes/goals, question/hypotheses, those being researched, those conducting the research, and data/data analysis are examined. In order to enhance the understanding <b>of</b> <b>these</b> different <b>approaches,</b> two service-learning research projects are discussed with a focus on these components. Finally, what is gained and lost with each approach is presented. </span...|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} {{approach used}} in business {{school is the}} use of business games that are used in different disciplines such as business, economics, management, etc. Some colleges are blending many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>approaches</b> throughout their degree programs, and even blending the method of delivery for each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>approaches.</b> A study from by Inside Higher Ed and the Babson Survey Research Group shows that there is still disagreement as to the effectiveness of the approaches but the reach and accessibility is proving to be more and more appealing. Liberal arts colleges in the United States like New England College, Wesleyan University, and Bryn Mawr College are now offering complete online degrees in many business curriculae despite the controversy that surrounds the learning method.|$|E

Many Hasidic groups have a tradition to recite the morning kiddush and then have refreshments (such as cake) in the sukkah, but to eat both the evening and morning main meals inside, notwithstanding the Talmudic ruling to the contrary.

25|$|Climate {{engineering}} (mitigating {{temperature or}} pH effects of emissions) {{has been proposed}} as a possible response to ocean acidification. The IAP (2009) statement cautioned against climate engineering as a policy response:Mitigation approaches such as adding chemicals to counter the effects of acidification {{are likely to be}} expensive, only partly effective and only at a very local scale, and may pose additional unanticipated risks to the marine environment. There has been very little research on the feasibility and impacts <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>approaches.</b> Substantial research is needed before these techniques could be applied.|$|E
25|$|Since theorists of {{literature}} often draw {{on a very}} heterogeneous tradition of Continental philosophy and the philosophy of language, any classification of their approaches is only an approximation. There are many types of literary theory, which take different approaches to texts. Even among those listed below, many scholars combine methods {{from more than one}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>approaches</b> (for instance, the deconstructive approach of Paul de Man drew on a long tradition of close reading pioneered by the New Critics, and de Man was trained in the European hermeneutic tradition).|$|E
25|$|While {{physical}} {{limits to}} transistor scaling such as source-to-drain leakage, limited gate metals, and limited options for channel material have been reached, new avenues for continued scaling are open.

Spin-based logic and memory options are being developed actively in industrial labs, as well as academic labs.|$|E
30|$|When the {{execution}} time for reaching {{a solution for}} these problems is a relevant decision factor, metaheuristic optimization approaches are often applied. Metaheuristics can be based on (Boussaïd et al. 2013): single-solution, if they use a single starting point (e.g., local search, simulated annealing, iterated local search and tabu search) or population-based if a population search points are used (e.g., particle swarm, evolutionary algorithms, colony based optimization). Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>approached</b> are inspired by natural processes (e.g., evolutionary algorithms from biology or simulated annealing from physics).|$|R

25|$|One of {{the first}} mathematicians to work with {{different}} types of cohomology was Georges de Rham. One can use the differential structure of smooth manifolds via de Rham cohomology, or Čech or sheaf cohomology to investigate the solvability of differential equations defined on the manifold in question. De Rham showed that all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>approaches</b> were interrelated and that, for a closed, oriented manifold, the Betti numbers derived through simplicial homology were the same Betti numbers as those derived through de Rham cohomology. This was extended in the 1950s, when Eilenberg and Steenrod generalized this approach. They defined homology and cohomology as functors equipped with natural transformations subject to certain axioms (e.g., a weak equivalence of spaces passes to an isomorphism of homology groups), verified that all existing (co)homology theories satisfied these axioms, and then proved that such an axiomatization uniquely characterized the theory.|$|E
25|$|Continuous network {{models of}} GRNs are an {{extension}} of the boolean networks described above. Nodes still represent genes and connections between them regulatory influences on gene expression. Genes in biological systems display a continuous range of activity levels and {{it has been argued that}} using a continuous representation captures several properties of gene regulatory networks not present in the Boolean model. Formally most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>approaches</b> are similar to an artificial neural network, as inputs to a node are summed up and the result serves as input to a sigmoid function, e.g., but proteins do often control gene expression in a synergistic, i.e. non-linear, way. However, there is now a continuous network model that allows grouping of inputs to a node thus realizing another level of regulation. This model is formally closer to a higher order recurrent neural network. The same model has also been used to mimic the evolution of cellular differentiation and even multicellular morphogenesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{resistance}} that the Australians met {{early in the}} campaign was light, as the Japanese had chosen to concentrate their forces further inland in the mountain ridges off what was named MacArthur Ridge. On 15 June, fighting began to clear the Japanese {{out of the area}} that had become known as the Pocket. The 2/28th Battalion was given the task of carrying out the main assault and the 2/11th Commando Squadron were placed in support. Within the area that the Japanese were defending there were several areas of high ground from which the Japanese could observe the Australian advance. As such there were only two avenues of approach for an attacking force. The first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>approaches</b> was a heavily mined track along Lyon Ridge, while the second was a track that ran through a swamp. The 2/11th were given the task of patrolling along Lyon Ridge and report back regarding whether it was passable with tanks.|$|E
50|$|For some breeds, {{opportunities}} for sustainable use are limited. For such breeds, {{to ensure that}} their critical genetic diversity is not lost, conservation programs are required. Several approaches for conservation can be applied, including in situ conservation with live animal populations, and ex situ conservation or cryoconservation involving the freezing of genetic materials. In many instances, both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>approached</b> are used in a complementary manner. In order to establish and strengthen these programs, more research on methods and technologies must be undertaken, especially for less common livestock species, and greater financial investment is required.|$|R
