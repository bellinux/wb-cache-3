5|$|While {{acting as}} {{administrator}} of Nanyang in 31 CE, Du Shi (d. 38 CE) invented a water-powered reciprocator which worked the bellows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast</b> furnace and cupola furnace in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor {{was required to}} work the bellows.|$|E
5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, {{a survey}} {{team from the}} Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T. Reynolds was sent to Hiroshima to evaluate the effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast.</b> From evaluating the effects on objects and structures, Penney concluded that the yield was 12 ± 1 kilotons. Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons. In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons. This figure became the official yield.|$|E
25|$|The {{bombs were}} planted in Tiffin {{carriers}} on bicycles, a pattern {{similar to the}} 13 May 2008 Jaipur bombings. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasts</b> targeted <b>the</b> city bus service of AMTS (Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service), ripping apart portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicles. Two <b>blasts</b> took place inside <b>the</b> premises <b>of</b> two hospitals, about 40minutes after <b>the</b> initial series <b>of</b> <b>blasts.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasts</b> in <b>the</b> hospitals occurred when injured victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial series <b>of</b> <b>blasts</b> were being admitted there.

30|$|Due to this process, it is {{unavoidable}} that <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> particles induces abrasive pollution on the surface, {{giving rise to}} a surface modification {{not only in the}} final roughness but also in the chemical composition, that influences <b>the</b> physicochemical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> surfaces [25]. To minimize the drastic changes produced by <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> process, <b>the</b> posterior acid attack is usually used as a method to smooth titanium surfaces and also to eliminate the residual particles resulting from <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> process [26]. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> HCl posterior to <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> process does not assure that residual hydroxyapatite particles remain incrusted in <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implants. Nevertheless, given <b>the</b> chemical nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ca-P compounds on the surface, its presence could be even considered as beneficial in the osseointegration process.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> {{objective}} <b>of</b> {{this research}} is to present an identification method for elastic moduli of ground rock, through the first-order adjoint equation method using <b>the</b> measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> vibration in tunnel excavation. Parameter identification is a minimization problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> square sum <b>of</b> discrepancy between <b>the</b> computed and observed velocities. For <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> these parameters, <b>the</b> magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> force should be identified beforehand. In this study, propagation of an elastic wave is assumed because <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> such a wave is infinitesimal. After <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> force, <b>the</b> elastic moduli <b>of</b> three layers are identified simultaneously. We assume that <b>the</b> damping <b>of</b> vibration is linear. By applying the identification technique at the Ohyorogi tunnel site, we verify that the method is useful for tunnel excavation. Using measured data from actual tunnel excavation sites, the numerical identification method {{presented in this paper}} is shown to be useful for practical tunnel excavation...|$|R

He observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress that also carried fellow Project Alberta members Harold Agnew and Deak Parsons.|$|E
5|$|An anniversary {{service was}} held in Holy Trinity Church Leverstock Green on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local {{hospital}} would maintain its accident and emergency department, and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen {{opened fire on}} the dazed band members, who had all been knocked down into the field {{below the level of}} the road from the force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast.</b> The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate witnesses to the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing.

40|$|It {{is known}} that <b>the</b> {{corrosion}} resistance <b>of</b> stainless steel is deteriorated by <b>blasting</b> but <b>the</b> reason for this deterioration is not clear. Blasted austenitic stainless steel plate (JIS-SUS 304) has been characterized with comparison to the scraped and non-blasted specimens. <b>The</b> surface roughness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> specimen is larger than that of materials finished with # 180 paper. A martensite phase is formed in <b>the</b> surface layer <b>of</b> both blasted and scraped specimens. Compressive residual stress is generated in <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> specimen and <b>the</b> maximum residual stress is formed at 50 to 100 μm from the surface. <b>The</b> corrosion potentials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> specimen and subsequently solution treated specimen are lower than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-blasted specimen. The passivation current densities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> specimens are higher those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-blasted specimen. <b>The</b> <b>blasted</b> specimen and <b>the</b> subsequently solution treated specimen exhibit rust in 5 % sodium chloride solution; while the non-blasted specimen and ground specimen do not rust in the solution. It is concluded that <b>the</b> deterioration <b>of</b> corrosion resistance of austenitic stainless steel through blasting is caused by <b>the</b> roughed morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface...|$|R
40|$|Design of {{sub-level}} blasting {{rounds and}} optimisation {{has become more}} important now when <b>the</b> sizes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> rings get larger. Sufficient fragmentation is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key factors, and in confined blasting as in sub-level caving, this influences <b>the</b> mobilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> ring. Model scale tests {{have been made to}} understand <b>the</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> rock breakage and therefore fragmentation under relatively confined conditions. By using the acoustic impedance between <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> material and <b>the</b> confining debris, a relationship for fragmentation has been found depending on material, specific charge (powder factor) and physical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debris.

5|$|Modern {{furnaces}} {{are equipped}} {{with an array of}} supporting facilities to increase efficiency, such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail hoppers and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast</b> furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{blast furnace}} {{remained}} in use well until the 20th century. The backyard furnaces favoured by Mao Zedong during the Great Leap Forward were of this type. In the regions with strong traditions of metallurgy, the steel production actually increased during this period. In the regions {{where there was}} no tradition of steelmaking or where the ironmasters knowing the traditional skills or the scientific principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast</b> furnace process had been killed, the results were less than satisfactory.|$|E
5|$|The black {{community}} of Africville, {{on the southern}} shores of Bedford Basin adjacent to the Halifax Peninsula, was spared the direct force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast</b> by the shadow effect of the raised ground to the south. However, Africville's small and frail homes were heavily damaged by the explosion. Families recorded the deaths of five residents. Africville received little of the donated relief funds {{and none of the}} progressive reconstruction invested {{in other parts of the}} city after the explosion.|$|E
30|$|Osanloo and Hekmat (2005) {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} particle size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> material and shovel productivity in a surface mine based on Rosin–Rammler–Bennett expression. It is concluded that 50 % increase in particle size causes 20 % loss in shovel productivity. Moreover, Bogunovic and Kecojevic (2011) quantified <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> bucket fill factor on the shovel production and energy consumption. Furthermore, the efficiency and cost of mining activities are also related to the rock mass mechanical parameters such as RQD, compression strength, joints, discontinuities, etc. The quality, particle size distribution, swell factor and <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> material influence <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> loading and hauling activities (Taherkhani and Doostmohammadi 2015).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{attempt was}} made to coat bio-active calcium {{phosphate}} on a titanium substrate by room temperature blasted-coating process as an alternative for conventional thermal spray or ion beam-assisted coating techniques. Thickness, surface roughness, crystallinity, and Ca and P-dissolution behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coated layer were investigated as a function of pressure and time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> coating process. <b>The</b> <b>blasted</b> coating process offered comparable coating characteristics with those of conventional techniques, including a thickness of 1. 3 µm ~ 6. 3 µm, and a surface roughness of 1. 5 ~ 2. 3 µm. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> coating layer showed higher crystallinity and more favorable dissolution behavior (i. e., constant and long-lasting release of Ca and P) than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convention thermal processes. Based on the comparable or superior characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> coating process at room temperature, it was suggested as a useful technique for calcium phosphate coating on Ti-based medical device...|$|R

5|$|The {{technology}} {{required for}} blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or {{may have been}} an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high. As the Varangian Rus' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route, {{it is possible that the}} technology reached Sweden by this means. High quality ores, water power for bellows for blast and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since blast furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the Haya people, it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently. The step from bloomery to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast</b> and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron and, cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the volumetric flow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember {{the victims of the}} bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each person who was killed as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast.</b> The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|Between 1939 and 1945, {{there were}} many plans to assassinate Hitler, some of which {{proceeded}} to significant degrees. The most well known, the 20 July plot, came from within Germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war. In July 1944, in the 20 July plot, part of Operation Valkyrie, Claus von Stauffenberg planted a bomb in one of Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast.</b> Later, Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900people.|$|E

5|$|The tuyeres {{are used}} to {{implement}} a hot blast, {{which is used to}} increase the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blast</b> furnace. The hot blast is directed into the furnace through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The hot blast temperature can be from 900°C to 1300°C (1600°F to 2300°F) depending on the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000°C to 2300°C (3600°F to 4200°F). Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.|$|E
