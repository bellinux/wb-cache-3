5|$|According to Sundaram Balachander's wife Shanta Balachander, the {{director}} had watched Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) at a film festival, {{was inspired by}} it, and wrote a play in the same narrative style, but the script was rejected by All India Radio. Balachander later approached A. V. Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, and narrated the story for him. Although Meiyappan agreed to produce the story as a film, he was unconvinced with Balachander's idea of making it without songs or stunts; however, he agreed to finance the project because he liked the story and trusted Balachander's talent. Andha Naal thus became the first Tamil film {{that did not have}} any songs <b>or</b> <b>dance</b> sequences, and was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.|$|E
5|$|Bangui has a rich music {{tradition}} and showcases the country's music. Its musicians also perform {{in many countries}} abroad. The Bangui band groups were influenced by Zokela in the 1980s. The innovative music is based on dance bands who have adopted the Congolese music with electronic support. The music is rhythmic and blends with the Congolese rumba (soukous), which was influenced by son cubano, cha-cha-cha, and merengue. Popular Central African music groups <b>or</b> <b>dance</b> bands who perform in the city are Musiki, Zokela, Makembe, Cool Stars, Cannon Stars, and Super Stars. Bokassa, during his tenure as President, established a music recording studio in Bangui and employed musicians to sing his praise with songs extolling his qualities as an emperor and to develop his cult image among his people.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{development was}} dominated by the Occident from 1400 on, indeed, the most profound changes occurred during the Renaissance period. Instruments took on other purposes than accompanying singing <b>or</b> <b>dance,</b> and performers used them as solo instruments. Keyboards and lutes developed as polyphonic instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced tablature. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments. In {{the latter half of}} the sixteenth century, orchestration came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion. The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, <b>or</b> <b>dance</b> allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.|$|E

25|$|Halay (Azerbaijani: Yalli) propagates unanimity, {{unity and}} collectiveness. It {{is a very}} old and very custom dance in Azerbaijan. At first times, it was {{performed}} in form of traditional celebration of fire, which was source of heat, light, and warm food. In this traditional celebration, dancers worship fire as a goddess. Yally starts with a slow speed and finishes in the fast mode with fast steps in form of running. There are many kinds of Yally in Azerbaijan. This dance is performed {{by a group of}} people and in ancient times whoever didn't dance properly was fined by the chieftain who makes him sing a song <b>or</b> <b>dance</b> another dance.|$|E
25|$|Masks in Mexico {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of dance, ceremony, festivals and theatre, with their wearing not {{separate}} from the event in which they are used. The most common uses are with traditional dances, which are a form of theater, with characters, storyline and music, but the performers are not professionals. The purpose of the masks it convert participants into other beings or characters. This element is so important in many events that if a dancer does not use a mask, he often wears dark glasses to indicate that he is not his normal self. A double sense of masking is to use dark glasses over a mask. With few exceptions, dances are performed by males, who play female roles wearing masks. The reason for this is that it was not considered proper for women in Europe to act <b>or</b> <b>dance,</b> a prohibition brought to Mexico by the Spanish. One important character of this type is La Malinche, in dances about the Conquest.|$|E
25|$|Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (or CRs) often {{celebrate}} Samhain on {{the date}} of first frost, or when {{the last of the}} harvest is in and the ground is dry enough to have a bonfire. Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and livestock then walk <b>or</b> <b>dance</b> between as a ritual of purification. For CRs, it is a time when the dead are especially honoured. Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain is a time when more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors. This may involve making a small shrine. Often there will be a meal, where a place for the dead is set at the table and they are invited to join. Traditional tales may be told and traditional songs, poems and dances performed. A western-facing door or window may be opened and a candle left burning on the windowsill to guide the dead home. Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games for the children. The more mystically inclined may also see this as a time for deeply communing with their deities, especially those seen as being particularly linked with this festival.|$|E
