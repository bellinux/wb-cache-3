5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> August 1968, Deep Purple entered De Lane Lea Studios in Kingsway, London, with {{producer}} Derek Lawrence {{and sound}} engineer Brian Aintsworth, who had both worked on their previous album. Tetragrammaton's advance of $250,000 {{had been used}} to book two weeks in the studio, a time which covered songwriting, rehearsals and recording sessions. Time was granted in larger amount than for the making of Shades of Deep Purple in May, feeding the band’s ambition of coming up with better original material than their previous effort.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{played their}} first home conference game in their annual rivalry game, against the Ole Miss Rebels at Tuscaloosa. In the game, 21 second quarter points after the Rebels' briefly held a lead {{resulted}} in the 33–14 Crimson Tide victory. After each team traded punts on their first possessions, Jeremy Shelley connected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> four field goals from 38 yards out to give the Crimson Tide an early 3–0 lead. After Shelley made his second 38-yard field goal to extend the Alabama lead to 6–0, Ole Miss responded with a 13-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with a one-yard Jeff Scott touchdown run that gave the Rebels a 7–6 lead {{early in the second}} quarter. At the time the Rebels' took the lead, it marked the first time Alabama trailed in regulation since their 2011 game against Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Niels Bohr {{and his son}} Aage, a {{physicist}} who acted as his father's assistant, arrived on 30 December <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> several visits as a consultant. Bohr {{and his family had}} escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden. A De Havilland Mosquito bomber brought him to England where he joined Tube Alloys. In America, he was able to visit Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, where he found many of his former students. Bohr acted as a critic, a facilitator and a role model for younger scientists. He arrived at a critical time, and several nuclear fission studies and experiments were conducted at his instigation. He {{played an important role in}} the development of the uranium tamper, and in the design and adoption of the modulated neutron initiator. His presence boosted morale, and helped improve the administration of the laboratory to strengthen ties with the Army.|$|E

5|$|On 10 March, Pułaski {{departed}} Marseille <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> three voyages {{from that}} port. She sailed to Algiers {{and from there}} to Dakar on 13 March. Pułaski left Dakar for Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Konakry, French Guinea, returning to Dakar in early April. Sailing for Marseille on 5 April, the ship returned on 13 April as a part of convoy DF 29. Leaving again about two weeks later, she repeated the trip and returned to Marseille on 29 May as a part of convoy DF 41. By the time of her return, the German invasion of France had been underway for nearly three weeks.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1923, {{during a}} {{procession}} by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Swaraj flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event {{resulted in a}} confrontation between the Congressmen and the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> May, Jamnalal Bajaj, {{the secretary of the}} Nagpur Congress Committee, started the Flag Satyagraha, gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement. The satyagraha, promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the Swarajists, called it inconsequential.|$|E

Cancellara then raced the Tour de Suisse and won the opening and closing stages of the race, which were both {{individual}} time trials. He then closed out June by winning the Swiss National Road Race after he out-sprinted Steve Morabito for the win, which was his second Swiss National Road Race title.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) also {{collected}} {{intelligence on}} Labuan {{and other parts}} of the Brunei Bay area during May. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> the month several RAAF PBY Catalina aircraft carrying SRD personnel overflew Labuan. These aircraft later landed near two native prahu and questioned their crews; two sailors were flown back to an Allied base for further questioning. On 15 May two Malays working for the SRD were landed in Brunei Bay by a Catalina, and sailed to Labuan on board a prahu. These agents recruited a local civilian from Labuan, and the party was extracted by a Catalina near the mainland village of Kampong Mengalong on 19 May. The intelligence gained from these operations provided the Australians with a good understanding of Labuan's geography and infrastructure. In addition, civilians who had been recruited by the SRD's SEMUT 2 team (which had been parachuted into Borneo during April) provided intelligence on the size and movements of Labuan's garrison force.|$|E
5|$|The rhyme {{is made up}} of quatrains, with a rhyming {{scheme of}} abcb (with {{occasional}} internal rhymes), using falling rhymes (where the rhyming sound is on a relatively unstressed syllable: de-emphasising the rhyme) and a trochaic rhythm (with the stress falling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> a pair of syllables), known as a ballad form, which is common in nursery rhymes. The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by the composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs (1870). The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 10266.|$|E
5|$|The {{road race}} {{stages in the}} Netherlands were both marred by {{repeated}} crashes, which led to some unexpected big time gaps before the transfer to Italy. The overall standings were very turbulent in the first week, with four different riders holding the race leader's pink jersey. The 11th stage greatly re-shaped the overall standings, when several riders, including Sastre, gained almost 13minutes against {{the remainder of the}} field. Porte took the pink jersey after this stage. Two days later, Arroyo took the jersey, and kept it for five days. He eventually lost it to Basso <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> two very difficult mountain stages to close out the Giro. Success was fairly widespread among the Giro's 22teams, as 17 of them came away with either a stage win, classification win, or stint in the pink jersey.|$|E

The announcement was made earlier than planned to forestall the possibility of similar events with that discovery, when the MPC told them that their observational data was publicly accessible, and they realized that not only Haumea data {{but by that time}} their Eris data had been publicly accessed.

5|$|Baugh invited some 100 {{players to}} the Titans' first {{training}} camp, which {{opened at the}} University of New Hampshire on July 9, 1960. As NFL teams cut players from their training camps, many were invited to the Titans' or other AFL training camps as the teams sought to fill their 35-man rosters. The franchise's first preseason game took place on August 6, 1960, against the Los Angeles Chargers at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Titans kicked off to begin the game, and Chargers running back Paul Lowe returned the kick 105yards for a touchdown. New York lost, 27–7. On September 11, 1960, the opening regular season game was played in a heavy downpour, the remains of Hurricane Diana. Water poured off Coogan's Bluff, situated above the Polo Grounds, swamping the field, which had poor drainage. The Titans' offense was less affected by the mud {{than that of the}} visiting Buffalo Bills. The Titans won the game 27–3 before a crowd of 9,607 (5,727paid attendance). The following week New York played another home game, against the Boston Patriots. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> many occasions when the team would lose a game after taking a big lead, the Titans were ahead 24–7 in the second half. With the lead reduced to 24–21, the Titans punted from deep in their own territory with seconds left. The punter, Rick Sapienza, fumbled the snap, and the Patriots recovered in the end zone for the victory. The following week, with the Titans playing at the Denver Broncos, New York blocked a punt on the final play to win the game. In their fourth game, New York had a two-point lead when it fumbled with fifteen seconds left against the Dallas Texans. This set off a scramble for the ball, which the Titans recovered as time ran out. Viewers in New York were spared the harrowing ending; in a prelude to the Heidi Game eight years later, the local ABC station had switched to a Walt Disney Davey Crockett special at 6:30p.m. Many viewers called to complain.|$|E
