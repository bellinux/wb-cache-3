The shortages of goods in turn led to inflation, and the decline in trade reduced government revenues from tariffs.

25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater <b>overall</b> <b>amount</b> of light within the low beam, since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the}} same time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different low and high beam light distributions. The high beam is usually a rough copy of the low beam, shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the low beam. However, low beam focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for high beam formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and high beams.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of a}} broach is the rise per tooth (RPT), which is how much material is removed by each tooth. The RPT varies for each section of the broach, which are the roughing section (tr), semi-finishing section (ts), and finishing section (tf). The roughing teeth remove most of the material so the number of roughing teeth required dictates how long the broach is. The semi-finishing teeth provide surface finish and the finishing teeth provide the final finishing. The finishing section's RPT (tf) is usually zero so that as the first finishing teeth wear the later ones continue the sizing function. For free-machining steels the RPT ranges from [...] For surface broaching the RPT is usually between [...] and for diameter broaching is usually between [...] The exact value depends on many factors. If the cut is too big it will impart too much stress into the teeth and the workpiece; if the cut is too small the teeth rub instead of cutting. One way to increase the RPT while keeping the stresses down is with chip breakers. They are notches in the teeth designed to break the chip and decrease the <b>overall</b> <b>amount</b> of material being removed by any given tooth (see the drawing above). For broaching to be effective, the workpiece should have [...] more material than the final dimension of the cut.|$|E
