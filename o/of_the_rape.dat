5|$|In 1110, King Henry I took Cardigan {{from his}} {{appointee}} Owain ap Cadwgan, son of Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, ostensibly {{as punishment for}} a number of crimes including that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> and abduction of his cousin Nest, wife of Gerald de Windsor and ward of King Henry I. In turn Henry gave the Lordship of Cardigan (as the Normans called Ceredigion), including Cardigan Castle, to Gilbert fitz Richard, Earl of Clare, who imposed a string of castles through the lordship.|$|E
5|$|In Erdely's story, Jackie {{disclosed}} to friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{the identity of}} her date to the fraternity party {{and said that he}} was the ringleader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rape.</b> Later media analysis of photos Jackie showed her friends of her date demonstrated that they were pictures taken from the public social media profile of a former high-school classmate of Jackie, who was not a student of the University of Virginia, did not live in the Charlottesville area, and was out of state at an athletic competition the day of the alleged attack.|$|E

50|$|DNA {{evidence}} definitively excluded him as {{a suspect}} in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes,</b> although both <b>the</b> victim and her fiancé continued to insist that Alexander was the perpetrator. Not all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investigators were convinced of his guilt, particularly as three similar rapes occurred while Alexander was in police custody. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> that took place {{while he was in}} custody, Alexander's picture was accidentally placed in a photo-lineup shown to the victim. She selected his photograph as that of her assailant, despite his incarceration at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offense.|$|R

In order to end contact with Coates, Doggett fakes a seizure on her next outing with him and is declared unfit for driving a van. She is replaced as prison van driver by another inmate, Maritza Ramos (played by Diane Guerrero).|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Roman Kingdom {{was founded}} in 753 BC, and was ruled by a {{succession}} of seven kings. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, ruled in a tyrannical manner and, in 510 BC, his son Sextus Tarquinius raped a noblewoman named Lucretia. Lucretia, {{the wife of a}} senator named Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, committed suicide because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rape,</b> and this led to a conspiracy which drove Tarquin from the city. With Tarquin's expulsion, the Roman Republic was founded, and the chief conspirators, Collatinus and the senator Lucius Junius Brutus, were elected as the first Roman Consul (chief-executive). While this story may be nothing more than a legend which later Romans created in order to explain their past, it is likely that Rome had been ruled by a series of kings, who probably were, as the legends suggest, overthrown quickly.|$|E
5|$|Gilly {{moves in}} with Cheryl, and {{they begin to}} rekindle their romantic relationship. But {{when they try to}} become {{physically}} intimate, Gilly becomes overwhelmed with memories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> and cannot go through with sleeping with Cheryl. Later that night, he goes to Rhys' and Jacqui's flat, and in a three-hander episode, the three of them discuss everything that's happened and they all eventually {{come to the conclusion that}} Gilly did indeed rape Jacqui. Jacqui forgives him, and Gilly decides that he must leave the village. He confesses the rape to everyone in his life and says his goodbyes. Cheryl in particular is devastated by Gilly's abrupt departure and begs for him to stay, but he refuses. Jacqui comforts Cheryl as she sobs on the steps outside her flat, while Gilly and Rhys share one final look goodbye before he leaves the village forever.|$|E
50|$|Administering such an {{extensive}} county as Sussex {{as a single}} unit had proved difficult: <b>the</b> traditional meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court <b>of</b> quarter sessions at Chichester in the south-west was a long distance from much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county's population and no single venue met <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> such a diverse county. A statute of 1504 created a system where the sheriff's court alternated between Chichester and Lewes. By the 1590s every administrative arrangement within local control respected <b>the</b> subdivision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county into an eastern division, made up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Hastings, Lewes and Pevensey, and a western division, made up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Arundel, Bramber and Chichester.|$|R

5|$|In the meanwhile, her father's {{fishing boat}} is {{taken away by}} creditors. He sinks {{into a state of}} sadness and begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.|$|E
5|$|Veronica shows one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> victims (Krista Kalmus) {{the photo}} of a suspect, but she doesn’t {{recognize}} him. In criminology class, Veronica does {{a case study of}} Weevil (Francis Capra), and the class enjoys it. After the study, Veronica tells Weevil that she’s dating Logan (Jason Dohring), and he reacts negatively. Veronica then walks into Mars Investigations and finds Cyrus O’Dell and his wife (Jaime Ray Newman) talking with Keith, while Veronica herself does some detective work. Keith informs Veronica that Dean O’Dell’s stepson is dying and that he wants Keith to find the boy’s biological father. At Mercer's (Ryan Devlin) party, two masked men enter and steal everyone’s valuables, including the necklace that Lilly gave Veronica. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is failing his mechanical engineering class, a subject in which he wanted to major. Meanwhile, Keith tracks down the husband, and Veronica accuses Weevil of robbing the party.|$|E
5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree {{on his chest and}} back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters a little boy with a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{this new}} development, Indiana {{prosecutors}} {{came to believe that}} Alexander was in fact not responsible for any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes.</b> In <b>the</b> remaining <b>rape</b> for which he was incarcerated, the evidence against him consisted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victim's tentative identification of his voice and an eyewitness's visual identification <b>of</b> Alexander. <b>The</b> Indiana prosecutor and Alexander's defense attorney filed a joint motion to have Alexander's convictions overturned.|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> and murder and that after having worked {{every day of my life}} for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{specialized}} <b>rape</b> pests prefer turnip rape over oilseed rape.

In the second trial a seed mixture of 95 % oilseed rape and 5 % turnip rape was sown and was compared to oilseed rape in pure crop. In both experiments <b>the</b> turnip <b>rape</b> trap crop was more attractive to cabbage stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala) and pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus) than <b>the</b> oilseed <b>rape.</b> Neither <b>the</b> border strip nor the intercropping was able to reduce <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> infestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> crop and <b>the</b> damage caused by these pests.

40|$|In {{her article}} 2 ̆ 2 Narrating Wartime Rapes and Trauma in A Woman in Berlin 2 ̆ 2 Agatha Schwartz {{examines}} <b>the</b> reception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controversial wartime diary published anonymously first in 1954 in English translation. The {{book is a}} narrative representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass <b>rapes</b> committed by Red Army soldiers during <b>the</b> siege <b>of</b> Berlin in 1945.

Schwartz reflects on how life writing, particularly by women about a difficult chapter of German history can contribute to memorialization of collective trauma outside <b>the</b> frame <b>of</b> national victimhood and defeated masculinity...|$|R

25|$|While {{females have}} been <b>the</b> primary victims <b>of</b> sexual violence, {{men and boys}} are also sexually assaulted. In 2009, several {{non-governmental}} organizations including HRW and Amnesty International (AI) reported that <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> males in <b>the</b> DRC was systematic, and on the increase. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> {{have been carried out}} by militias, such as the Lord's Resistance Army, the Democratic Forces for <b>the</b> Liberation <b>of</b> Rwanda, <b>the</b> Mai-Mai and the Congrès national pour la défense du peuple.

30|$|Diagnosis of drug-facilitated rape is {{difficult}} due to multiple positive drug {{results in the}} patients’ samples (Grela et al. 2018). <b>The</b> real number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> facilitated by drugs is more than that reported because many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims postpone reporting the crime for several days.
