5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>main</b> sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Although {{psychodrama}} is {{not widely}} practiced, {{the work done}} by practitioners of psychodrama has opened the doors to research possibilities for other psychological concepts such as group therapy and expansion {{of the work of}} Sigmund Freud.

The methods of psychodrama are also used by group therapy organizations and also find a place in other types of therapy, such as post-divorce counseling for children.|$|E

Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich Bakassi peninsula (however, this was resolved with the Greentree Agreement) and with Gabon's president, El Hadj Omar Bongo, over personal rivalries.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>main</b> characters.|$|E

The Board of Regents voted to name it Byrd Stadium in honor <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>main</b> advocate. The stadium's capacity was 5,000.

5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>main</b> branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Allied Breweries {{sold its}} 35 per cent {{stake in the}} company, leaving Whitbread 25 per cent and the Boddington family 10 per cent, with the {{remainder}} of company shares held by small shareholders in the Manchester area. That year Guinness Draught stout and Heineken lager were introduced into the tied estate. During the 1970s the company operated within a 70-mile radius of Manchester, and growth was driven by the increasing popularity <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>main</b> product, Boddingtons Bitter. The Observer commented in 1974 that Boddingtons cheap pricing and distinctive flavour afforded it an unusually loyal following. In 1981 the same newspaper commented, what has stood Boddingtons in good stead is the highly distinctive flavour of its brews, especially its bitters. In fact, in the North-West, Boddies is increasingly becoming a sort of cult brew.|$|E

Unable to continue working on the game, Kojima contacted Minami to ask PlatinumGames to work on it. According to Kojima, PlatinumGames was the only studio capable of working on an action game with sword-based combat. The team added stealth elements to the game finding its system too boring and straightforward. Directed by Kenji Saito, the game, titled , was released in 2013 and received generally positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success. It also became the company's first licensed title.|$|E
5|$|McMaster {{purchased}} a large industrial park three kilometres east <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>main</b> Hamilton campus in 2005 {{with the intention}} of creating an array of research facilities for the development of advanced manufacturing and materials, biotechnology, automotive, and nanotechnology. In July 2005 the federal government announced it would relocate CANMET, a federal government materials research laboratory, from its Ottawa centre to Hamilton. This decision helped spearhead the development of the McMaster Innovation Park. The United Nations University-International Network on Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH) is headquartered within the park. UNU-INWEH is the only United Nations agency headquartered in Ontario and the only North American host site for a United Nations University, after moving to McMaster Innovation Park on 23 April 2008.|$|E

Originally, the neighborhood extended {{all the way}} to Broadway on the north, Attwood Street on the south, and Floyd Street on the East; but the northern part was mostly razed for parking lots and light industry, the southern area between Attwood and Avery Streets (now Cardinal Blvd) was razed when the University of Louisville doubled the size <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>main</b> campus, and I-65 was built through the area in the 1960s, which created a physical barrier between it and Shelby Park neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|Responding to {{international}} pressures, in 1991 the Soviet government allowed a joint U.S.-British inspection team to tour four <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>main</b> weapons facilities at Biopreparat.

In 1992 Soviet defector Ken Alibek alleged that the Soviet bioweapons program at Zagorsk had produced a large stockpile—as much as twenty tons—of weaponized smallpox (possibly engineered to resist vaccines, Alibek further alleged), along with refrigerated warheads to deliver it. Alibek's stories about the former Soviet program's smallpox activities have never been independently verified.|$|E
