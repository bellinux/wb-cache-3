5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, {{but since the}} 1970s {{there has been a}} decline in {{traditional}} heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as Land Rover, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being the}} capital city, Kota Kinabalu {{is also the}} main {{industrial}} and commercial centre for Sabah. The economy {{is dominated by the}} primary sector of industry. Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation and economic development, this sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more tertiary-based industry has become more apparent, especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.|$|E

25|$|Finland has {{a highly}} industrialised, mixed economy with {{a per capita}} output {{similar to that of}} other western European economies such as France, Germany and United Kingdom but {{slightly}} lower than Sweden. The largest sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> services at 72.7 percent, followed by manufacturing and refining at 31.4 percent. Primary production is 2.9 percent.|$|E
25|$|Another quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> from {{agriculture}} {{with corn}} and wheat {{as the principal}} crops, along with barley, beans and fava beans. Other crops include apples, peaches, pulque maguey, pears, and capulin. Livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep and domestic fowl accounts for about five percent. It is {{the major source of}} income for a number of communities. There is still some very limited mining of copper, zinc, lead, iron, silver and gold, with some food processing and metal products.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen Aydın going beyond its {{traditional}} {{role as a}} hub for agricultural products, and developing a diversified economy increasingly based on services. One event in this process was the opening in 1992 of Adnan Menderes University, named after a favorite son of Efeler, Aydın Adnan Menderes, Turkey's prime minister during the 1950s. The pace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> determined by the city's location, at only an hour's drive from the seashore. Many residents of Aydın typically have summer houses and investments in or around such centers of tourism as Kuşadası, Güzelçamlı and Didim.|$|E

25|$|The {{county has}} a mixed economy. An {{important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> based on tourism: many visitors are {{attracted by the}} many beaches and the mountains. A {{significant part of the}} county lies within the Snowdonia National Park, which extends from the north coast down to the district of Merioneth in the south; it is much larger than Snowdonia proper. But tourism provides seasonal employment and thus {{there is a shortage of}} jobs in the winter. Another problem with tourism is the demand that it creates for second homes. This pushes house prices out of reach of local people, to the detriment of the position of the Welsh language in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Abu Dhabi's {{government}} {{is looking to}} expand revenue from {{oil and gas production}} to tourism and other sorts of things which would attract different types of people. This goal is seen in the amount of attention Abu Dhabi is giving to its International Airport. The airport, in 2009, experienced a 30%+ growth in passenger usage. This idea of diversification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> also seen in the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 planned by the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council. In this plan Abu Dhabi's economy will be sustainable and not be dependent on any one facet or source of revenue. More specifically the non-oil portion of income is planned to be increased from about 40% to about 70%.|$|E
25|$|The {{most dynamic}} aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> tourism, {{with a number}} of natural {{resources}} which are apt for this purpose, such as the grey whales that come to the area to breed and the natural rock arch at Land’s End is frequently photographed. Tourist attractions are divided into three regions: north (Guerrero Negro to Ciudad Constitución), center (La Paz to Todos Santos) and south (Los Barriles to Cabo San Lucas). There are two main resort areas, Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo, both in the southern tip of the peninsula. A highway known as the Corridor links the two towns. Other attractions include deep sea fishing, golf, tennis, motorcycling, scuba diving and snorkeling, with windsurfing at Medano Beach and surfing at Todos Santos, Pescadero East Cape and Scorpion Bay.|$|E

25|$|Only a {{very small}} {{percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> based on fishing and forestry. Fishing is not a major economic activity as it is limited to the small rivers and lakes of the region. Of the two major lakes, one is shared with neighboring Michoacán state. Of the fish is that is caught or raised, most is carp, followed by mojarra. There are 150,000 hectares of forest in the state, which about half theoretically exploitable. However, forests in this state have been historically depleted with species such as holm oak, pine and oyamel in danger of extinction. The lack of forest cover has led to erosion and other environmental problems. Most forestry products come from pine and holm oak, with most being harvested in the area around the city of Guanajuato.|$|E
500|$|Once {{primarily}} {{a producer of}} raw materials, Minnesota's economy has transformed to emphasize finished products and services. Perhaps the most significant characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> its diversity; the relative outputs of its business sectors closely match the United States as a whole. The economy of Minnesota had a gross domestic product of $262 billion in 2008. [...] In 2008, thirty-three of the United States' top 1,000 publicly traded companies (by revenue) were headquartered in Minnesota, including Target, UnitedHealth Group, 3M, General Mills, U.S. Bancorp, Ameriprise, Hormel, Land O' Lakes, SuperValu, Best Buy and Valspar. Private companies based in Minnesota include Cargill, the largest privately owned company in the United States, and Carlson Companies, {{the parent company of}} Radisson Hotels.|$|E
500|$|The growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> coincided by rapid {{expansion}} in corruption, collusion, and nepotism (Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana ("Tutut"), Hutomo Mandala Putra ("Tommy"), and Bambang Trihatmodjo, {{had grown into}} greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the toll-expressway market which was monopolized by Tutut, national car project monopolized by Bambang and Tommy, and even the cinema market monopolized by 21 Cineplex owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono. The family is said to control about 36,000km² of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000m² of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% {{of the land in}} East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish [...] "strategic partnerships" [...] with Suharto family's companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of yayasans run by Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in [...] "donations" [...] from {{the public and private sectors}} each year.|$|E
