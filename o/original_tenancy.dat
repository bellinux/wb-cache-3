50|$|The Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1972 made {{amendments}} {{equivalent to}} {{those made by}} the Housing Finance Act 1972, i.e. entry into a new contractual tenancy with {{a person who was}} a tenant by succession should not extend the sequence of two successions deriving from the <b>original</b> <b>tenancy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{absence of}} {{statutory}} control {{of commercial and}} industrial leases in Scotland is subject to one minor exception {{in the form of}} the Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Acts 1949 which give limited rights of security of tenure to shop tenants. The <b>original</b> <b>Tenancy</b> of Shops (Scotland) Act was enacted in 1949 as a temporary measure but after a number of yearly extensions, it was made permanent in 1964 by an Act of the same name.|$|E
50|$|TDS was the <b>original</b> <b>tenancy</b> deposit scheme - {{established}} in 2003 which many agents and landlords volunteered to use {{prior to the}} introduction of the legislation.Initially, the DPS offered only a custodial scheme while the TDS and MyDeposits offered only an insurance-backed scheme. From April 2013, the DPS also offered an insurance-backed scheme, and from April 2016, the TDS and MyDeposits both started offering a custodial scheme. Between April and September 2013, Capita also operated an insurance-backed scheme. Deposit protected by Capita was subsequently transferred to MyDeposits.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{purchased}} by architecture firm Fender Katsalidis Architects in April 2008, for $14.2 million, after the <b>original</b> <b>tenancies</b> ran an expression of interest campaign.|$|R
50|$|This {{quotation}} from AK Bell's {{acceptance of the}} Freedom of Perth sums up his approach to philanthropy, and how as a beneficiary of the then booming Scotch Whisky trade, AK Bell prospered {{and was able to}} look to benefit his home city. His first major project in this direction was the building of the Gannochy Housing Estate between 1924 and 1932. This model housing scheme was intended to benefit the hardworking of a younger generation, who had survived the harshness of war and were now looking to better themselves, with many of the <b>original</b> <b>tenancies</b> being granted to workers of Bell & Sons.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building is considerably altered. Room layouts indicate <b>original</b> separate <b>tenancies</b> but openings in the party walls now connect them. Fittings, though ornate, are reproductions and suspended ceilings conceal air-conditioning ducts. A lift and other modern facilities are also installed.|$|R
5000|$|Porthmadog Golf Club at Morfa Bychan {{opened in}} 1906 on land rented {{from a local}} farmer. The <b>original</b> <b>tenancy</b> {{agreement}} stipulated that golfers must not take any game, hares, rabbits or wildfowl and must pay compensation for any sheep or cattle killed or injured by them. The landlord agreed not to turn on to the land any bull or savage cattle. [...] Created by James Braid, five times winner of the British Open, the course {{is a mixture of}} heath and links. The first nine holes head inland over heathland. The final nine, heading back towards the sea, are pure links. The fourteenth hole, known as The Himalayas, is a 378 yd par 4 with a huge natural bunker hiding the green from the tee.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conflict}} {{central to}} the plot arises from opposing claims {{to the land of}} the Alouan on the Uaia continent, with one side (the Uldras) asserting a right derived from <b>original</b> <b>tenancy</b> and the other (the Land Barons or [...] "Outkers") a right based on the strength and determination to defend established property ownership, even if the property in question was originally stolen. Exploring the theme of barbarism versus civilisation, Vance would ultimately seem to argue that a societal mean is the most preferable of all possible worlds. The society of Szintarre has become over-civilised and proves too weak to defend itself when the erjins that the rights-obsessed city-dwellers hypocritically keep as slaves rise up against them. On the other hand, the Land Barons, who are in effect settled reavers and are rustic and quaint in comparison with urbane Szintarre society, nonetheless bring the benefits of civilisation (basic healthcare, education, reliable sources of drinking water, etc.) to the Uldras, curbing their more violent and barbarous customs, while otherwise allowing them to continue their traditional way of life unhindered.|$|E
50|$|The more {{important}} tax {{aspect of a}} transmutation agreement is the effect that it has on basis step-up (or step-down) at death. If the spouses had held the property separately in joint tenancy with a right of survivorship, the surviving spouse would automatically receive his or her half of the property by operation of law through the <b>original</b> joint <b>tenancy</b> title, and not through inheritance or {{any other type of}} succession after death. Consequently, his or her basis would not be stepped up if the property has appreciated, but instead would remain at the original cost basis.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the street, long time {{occupant}} Ministry of Trade, Industry and Public Works also began to extend its reach beyond its <b>original</b> 1848 <b>tenancy</b> in the former gold and silver manufacturer's building (No. 79). Two annexes at Wilhemstraße 80 and the newly constructed Voßstraße 35 were also added to the complex in 1869/1870 and 1875/1876, respectively. In 1878, this block of buildings became the seat of the newly separated (from Trade and Industry) Ministry of Public Works, which was responsible for building construction and railroads above all. The ministry also incorporated a couple buildings on Leipzigerstraße (No. 125) and Voßstraße (No. 34) from 1892 to 1894 and 1892 to 1908, respectively.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the empirical}} determinants of contract length, a key and yet neglected dimension of contractual structure. I estimate contract length and contract type jointly using <b>original</b> data on <b>tenancy</b> agreements signed between 1870 and 1880 {{in the district}} of Siracusa, Italy. The findings indicate that the choice of contract length is driven by the need to provide incentives for non observable investment, taking into account transaction costs and imperfections in the credit markets that make incentive provision costly. The results also illustrate that since both length and the compensation scheme are used to provide incentives within the same contract, joint analysis is important for a correct interpretation of the evidence...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the empirical}} determinants of contract length, a key and yet neglected dimension of contractual structure. I estimate contract length and contract type jointly using <b>original</b> data on <b>tenancy</b> agreements signed between 1870 and 1880 {{in the district}} of Siracusa, Italy. The results indicate that contracts are designed to provide incentives for both current production and investment, with an eye on transaction costs. There is also evidence that credit market imperfections make incentive provision costly and discourage the use of high powered incentives. Finally the analysis illustrates that joint estimation of contract length and type provides an accurate picture of the determinants of contract form. In contrast, focusing only on one dimension can mislead the interpretation of the evidence...|$|R
