5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{had made}} several {{attempts}} {{to create a}} framework for protecting international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the expropriation of foreign direct investment. In 1961, then-General Counsel of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Aron Broches developed {{the idea for a}} multilateral agreement on a process for resolving individual investment disputes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>by</b> case basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult legal experts {{from all parts of the}} world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's board of directors to finalize the draft and have it approved. The board of directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on 18 March 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention establishing the ICSID entered into force on 14 October 1966.|$|E

40|$|Whenever we {{undertake}} {{to evaluate}} the effect of one factor (X) on another (Y), the question arises as to whether we should adjust our measurements for possible variations in some other variable, Z, sometimes called "covariate", "concomitant" or "confounder". Adjustment amounts to partitioning the population into groups that are homogeneous relative to Z, assessing the effect of X on Y in each homogeneous group and, finally, averaging the results. Despite a century of statistical analysis, the basic question [...] whether an adjustment for a given covariate Z is appropriate in any given study [...] continues to be debated informally, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cases</b> <b>by</b> <b>case</b> basis, resting on folklore and intuition rather than on hard mathematics.
