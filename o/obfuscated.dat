25|$|The L2 band signals use {{the same}} FDMA as the L1 band signals, but {{transmit}} straddling 1246MHz with the center frequency 1246MHz + n×0.4375MHz, where n spans the same range as for L1. In the original GLONASS design, only <b>obfuscated</b> high-precision signal was broadcast in the L2 band, but starting with GLONASS-M, an additional civil reference signal L2OF is broadcast with an identical standard-precision code to the L1OF signal.|$|E

25|$|Oddly, Cassini {{seems to}} have {{abandoned}} this reasoning, which Rømer adopted and set about buttressing in an irrefutable manner, using a selected number of observations performed by Picard and himself between 1671 and 1677. Rømer presented his results to the French Academy of Sciences, and it was summarised soon after by an anonymous reporter in a short paper, , published 7 December 1676 in the Journal des sçavans. Unfortunately the paper bears the stamp of the reporter failing to understand Rømer's presentation, and as the reporter resorted to cryptic phrasings to hide his lack of understanding, he <b>obfuscated</b> Rømer's reasoning in the process. Unfortunately Rømer himself never published his results.|$|E

30|$|Private Information Retrieval (PIR) [37, 38] {{approaches}} <b>obfuscate</b> {{data access}} patterns {{and can be}} considered secure against Q&BKD-attackers. Unlike ORAM, PIR can only be applied for data retrieval, not for writing data, which is a common requirement in DaaS scenarios. In contrast to ORAM, PIR approaches can <b>obfuscate</b> query access patterns in a single round of communication. Computational PIR approaches [39 - 42] achieve this {{at the expense of}} increased computational cost for the SPs, while information-theoretical PIR approaches [37, 43, 44] <b>obfuscate</b> access patterns based on non-colluding SPs. To evaluate queries (e.g., range selections) based on probabilistic ciphertexts, PIR approaches can be combined with methods such as encrypted B+ trees. This implies a logarithmic number of communication rounds, which would cancel out the benefits of PIR over ORAM in this regard.|$|R
25|$|In another {{episode that}} focused on myths {{surrounding}} electronic security devices, there was a segment on defeating biometric fingerprint readers using various methods. One of these techniques involved creating a fake 3D fingerprint from a 2D image of the authorized print. After some trial and error, the team successfully cast a viable ballistics gel reproduction using a copper-coated circuit board, {{a picture of the}} fingerprint printed on acetate, and a photochemical acid etching process. After the reproduction was shown to defeat both fingerprint scanners, and although the chemicals used during the etching process are never identified, the narrator still hints at an important step having been edited out and discourages viewers from trying it themselves. None of the other techniques that successfully defeated the fingerprint scanners or the other security devices tested in the episode were censored or <b>obfuscated,</b> perhaps because the rest were all fairly simple and straightforward methods, such as holding up a bedsheet or moving extremely slowly to hide from ultrasonic motion detectors or holding up a pane of glass to defeat thermal motion detectors.|$|E
500|$|As with C, <b>obfuscated</b> code {{competitions}} were a {{well known}} pastime {{in the late}} 1990s. The <b>Obfuscated</b> Perl Contest was a competition held by The Perl Journal from 1996 to 2000 that made an arch virtue of Perl's syntactic flexibility. Awards were given for categories such as [...] "most powerful"—programs that made efficient use of space—and [...] "best four-line signature" [...] for programs that fit into four lines of 76 characters {{in the style of}} a Usenet signature block.|$|E
500|$|In email, Usenet, {{and message}} board postings, [...] "Just another Perl hacker" [...] (JAPH) {{programs}} {{are a common}} trend, originated by Randal L. Schwartz, {{one of the earliest}} professional Perl trainers. In the parlance of Perl culture, Perl programmers are known as Perl hackers, and from this derives the practice of writing short programs to print out the phrase [...] "Just another Perl hacker". In the spirit of the original concept, these programs are moderately <b>obfuscated</b> and short enough to fit into the signature of an email or Usenet message. The [...] "canonical" [...] JAPH as developed by Schwartz includes the comma at the end, although this is often omitted.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{experimental}} plot and dense dialogue were controversially received. Esquires Mike D'Angelo claimed that [...] "anybody who claims {{he fully understands}} what's going on in Primer after seeing it just once is either a [...] or a liar". Scott Tobias writes for The A.V. Club: [...] "The banter is heavy on technical jargon and almost perversely short on exposition; {{were it not for}} the presence of voiceover narration, the film would be close to incomprehensible." [...] For the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano writes: [...] "sticklers for linear storytelling are bound to be frustrated by narrative threads that start promisingly, then just sort of fall off the spool". Some reviewers were entirely put off by the film's <b>obfuscated</b> narrative. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter complained that Primer [...] "nearly gets lost in a miasma of technical jargon and scientific conjecture".|$|E
500|$|Chris Martins of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} album a B+ rating, {{feeling that it}} [...] "offers a new window into the <b>obfuscated</b> Patton oeuvre". Martins also {{compared}} the record to California and felt {{that it would be}} greatly enjoyed by fans of Patton's various side projects. Writing for The Boston Globe, James Reed described Mondo Cane as [...] "offbeat for sure but not off-putting", adding that [...] "language is no barrier with music this lovely". Sputnikmusic's Tyler Monro rated the album three-and-a-half out of five, feeling that it would be, in theory, a bad idea. However, Monro felt that, on listening to the album, it was [...] "his best work in close to a decade", describing it as [...] "a summer-time staple and a faithful reminder that Mike Patton can sing but sadly little else". Writing for PopMatters, John Garratt rated the album seven out of ten, writing [...] "even if this album is a genre exercise, it’s still a very fine one". Garrat felt that [...] "Deep Down" [...] was the album's best song, adding that it [...] "feels like it was written just for Mike Patton to sing".|$|E
500|$|Reviewer James Berardinelli {{found the}} {{production}} of Doomsday to be a mess, complaining, [...] "The action sequences might be more tense if they weren't <b>obfuscated</b> by rapid-fire editing, and the backstory is muddled and not all that interesting." [...] Berardinelli also believed the attempted development of parallel storylines {{to be too much}} for the film, weakening the eventual payoff. Dennis Harvey of Variety said Neil Marshall's [...] "flair for visceral action" [...] made up for Doomsdays lack of originality and that the film barely had a dull moment. He added, [...] "There's no question that Doomsday does what it does with vigor, high technical prowess and just enough humor to avoid turning ridiculous." [...] Harvey considered the conclusion relatively weak, and found the quality of the acting satisfactory for the genre, while reserving praise for the [...] "stellar" [...] work of the stunt personnel. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle also praised the film's stunts, noting that it was reminiscent of [...] "the beauty of the exploitation film era". Hartlaub said of the effect, [...] "Hire a couple of great stuntmen and a halfway sober cinematographer, and you didn't even need a screenwriter." ...|$|E

500|$|Part of the game's {{concept is}} {{a balance between}} puzzle-solving and perception, giving the player the freedom to explore The Witnesss world and {{creating}} a non-linear approach to gameplay. Two of the first puzzles Blow had created involved [...] "clues in objects that populate the world", which led him to recognize he needed to create a world to support these puzzles. This would form a dichotomy between exploration and puzzle solving, which [...] "made a lot of sense" [...] to Blow. Blow created the island as open world, so that players can leave puzzles they are stuck at and work at other ones, as to avoid punishing the player {{for not being able}} to solve a key puzzle, a common issue with other adventure games according to Blow. Blow wanted puzzles to be clearly presented in the open and without any red herrings, an approach he had taken with Braid. Exploration is encouraged through the game's narrative, which are told by audio logs the player can find on the unpopulated island; through these, Blow attempted to create a [...] "feeling of loneliness in a beautiful space" [...] for the player. Because these logs can be found in any order, Blow hopes that each player may have a different perception of the narrative depending on how they have approached the game. Initially, these audio logs were to be more story-driven, but Blow opted later to change these out for more <b>obfuscated</b> and obtuse information, similar to the text elements used in Braid, as to avoid directly relating out the story of the game for the player and let them think about what the narrative means instead. Blow's team designed the narrative that those that solve more of the puzzles will gain more of a concrete understanding of the story.|$|E
