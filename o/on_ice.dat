40|$|Experiments on the {{hydrogenation}} of CO on crystalline and amorphous ice at 15 K {{were carried}} out to investigate the structural effects of the ice surface. The effective rate of H atom addition to CO <b>on</b> the amorphous <b>ice</b> {{was found to be}} larger than that <b>on</b> the crystalline <b>ice,</b> while CO depletion <b>on</b> crystalline <b>ice</b> became larger after long exposure. We demonstrated that the CO-coverage <b>on</b> the <b>ice</b> surfaces dominates the effective reaction rate rather than the surface structure. The larger depletion of CO <b>on</b> crystalline <b>ice,</b> as compared to amorphous ice, suggests easier desorption of CO and/or products by the heat of the reaction.

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight <b>on</b> <b>ice,</b> and that their own horses had been trained to fight <b>on</b> <b>ice</b> without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having slipped on the ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth and nail battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E
