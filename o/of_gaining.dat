40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that intact bovine males gain weight faster and require less feed per unit <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> than castrate bovine males. Further, carcasses from intact bovine males {{have a higher}} percentage of retail or edible product, but meat from intact males {{is generally}} evaluated slightly lower on palatability characteristics, particularly tenderness, than carcasses from castrate bovine males. It has been suggested that much of the advantage of intact vs castrate for rate <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> and composition <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> may be expressed by an age of about 1 year and the disadvantages, including aggressive male behavior, that result in reduced rate and efficiency <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> begin at about 1 year of age (at or immediately after puberty). Thus, there was need {{to determine the effects of}} castration at about 1 year on rate <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> meat characteristics, and behavioral characteristics. Reports have shown that, when the anabolic agent zeranol [6 -(6, 10 -dyhydroxyundecyl) -B-resorcyclic acid-d-lactone] is implanted in intact male calves at or before weaning, rate <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> is increased and rate of testicular growth is decreased.

40|$|This {{study had}} three primary objectives: 1) {{to examine the}} effects that {{individual}} performance and ingredient price factors have on cost of gain; 2) to quantify the annual and/or seasonal trend in cost <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> in Kansas feedlots; and 3) to examine the difference in cost <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> between steers and heifers. For both steers and heifers, corn price was significant and positive, indicating that as the price of corn increases so does cost <b>of</b> <b>gain.</b> The price <b>of</b> hay, which is a feedstuff in the majority of feedlot diets, has a positive, but insignificant, effect on feeding cost <b>of</b> <b>gain.</b> As average daily gain increased, predicted cost <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> decreased for both steers and heifers, but the result was only significant in steers. Death loss had a positive impact on cost <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> but may be a more important factor when feeding steers. The trend over time was positive.

5|$|General Paul D. Harkins, {{commander}} of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much more optimistic assessment of the battle. He considered the operation {{to be a major}} success; after the Viet Cong abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins' evaluation of the battle's success was based on US military doctrine from World War II, in which opposing forces fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, <b>of</b> <b>gaining</b> control of the opponent's territory. The Viet Cong, however, were more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem's regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins' resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their American counterparts and advisers were operating. Largely because of his attitude, neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent <b>of</b> <b>gaining</b> wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings.

We find that the value of the feedback rate at which the transition to coherence collapsed state occurs increases, as the intensity of the nonlinear term is augmented. In order to study the influence of the form <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> saturation, three different forms <b>of</b> optical <b>gain,</b> that result from spectral and kinetic hole burning or carrier heating, with an explicit intensity dependence are considered. The route to chaos is the same for the three forms considered but the parameters at which transition between attractors occur depend slightly on the form <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> saturation used.
