5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put ourselves out <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E

One British volunteer soldier sent home a letter explicitly detailing the British soldiers' hatred of their Boer enemy: [...] "The Cape Dutch and Boers are a dirty treacherous lot and as soon as the Transvaal is subdued and the beggars (those that survive) trek farther out <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> the better. We do hate them down here like poison. The rascally dirty varmints, they must be exterminated; the country swarms with them and their dirty compatriots the German Jew." ...|$|E

Yet Flack wonders {{what to make of}} aspects of Rosenberg's presentation, such as his apparent [...] "dim view of the place for thinking" [...] and his building on Walter Wink's account of the origins <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> of thinking. To Flack, some elements of what Rosenberg says seem like pat answers at odds with the challenging and complex picture of human nature history, literature and art offer.|$|E

2500|$|Before reciting kiddush, the challah, {{which will}} be the next food item eaten in honor of the Shabbat or holiday, is first covered with a cloth. According to Halakha, the blessing over bread takes {{precedence}} to the blessing over wine. However, in the interests of beginning the meal with kiddush, the challah is covered to [...] "remove" [...] it from the table (some do not have the challah on the table at all during kiddush). Some interpret the covering of the challah allegorically, explaining that if we are supposed to go out <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to protect even an inanimate object (the bread) from being [...] "insulted" [...] (by the blessing over wine taking precedence), then certainly we must go out <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to display sensitivity toward the feelings of other people.|$|E

I don't think we should get in the middle of these squabbles. But to go out <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> and say that so-and-so is not a real people?

Brand, a former college president and academic, was expected to bring new priorities to an institution previously governed by Cedric Dempsey, whose background was that of an athlete, coach and athletic administrator. Brand vowed to improve the overall experience for student-athletes, helping them attain both an education and increasing postgraduate opportunities. In a speech to the National Press Club, Brand said that [...] "intercollegiate athletics can be a vital force in America's culture, exemplifying the positive spirit and values <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> of life," [...] but he also expressed his strong belief [...] "that academics must come first." ...|$|E

Hence enabling us to re-visit the spaces <b>of</b> <b>our</b> everyday life and bringing a new flair to <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking and inhabiting place. Our case study focuses on urban gardens in Barcelona. Our fieldwork included a combination of qualitative methods, comprising participant observation (e. g. participation to garden events and assemblies), informal conversations with gardeners, and an ethnographic approach called shadowing. The ambiances that are produced in urban gardens enable us to better understand <b>our</b> own making <b>of</b> place {{in the city and}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> inhabiting it...|$|R
