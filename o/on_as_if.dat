500|$|The {{theater was}} opened and {{dedicated}} on January 2, 1917. The first concert {{took place on}} July 30, 1916, and was by Ignacy Jan Paderewski. During his performance, the Black Tom explosion took place at a munitions works in New Jersey, more than [...] from Scarborough. Frank Vanderlip Jr., ten {{years old at the}} time, later recalled that he saw the detonation shake the jammed theater building, and that Paderewski had played <b>on</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nothing had happened. The automatic fire doors {{at the top of the}} theater had sprung open, and two men were sent aloft to sit on them until the end of the performance to prevent a cold draft from entering the room.|$|E
500|$|In the Herald Sun, Leigh Paatsch {{gave the}} film one star. He criticised the casting, {{describing}} {{the main characters}} as [...] "supposed to be aged about 20 [...] played by blokes who all look as if they’re 30-plus, and carry <b>on</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they’re not yet 10", and also found the film misogynistic, saying [...] "the derogatory manner in which women are spoken of (and often depicted) is relentlessly, callously crass. Sometimes even hateful". A mixed review from Philippa Hawker of the Sydney Morning Herald concluded [...] "The Australian elements seem hastily inserted and incidental: the movie could have been set in any country that had a water park {{and a place to}} get lost. But as a hymn to male bonding, and an exploration of the comic possibilities of what happens when a turd hits a water slide, The Inbetweeners 2 is a precisely crafted, assured piece of work".|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{this episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that though it was [...] "funny {{in all the right}} places, this is an episode of two distinct stories, neither of which mesh together. The whole Ed Begley, Jr. saving the forest bit seems to have been tacked <b>on,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the stuff about Homer finding his name being abused (shades of Mr. Sparkle again?) ran out of steam. Not a bad show, more a sort of 'So what?' show." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating, commenting that [...] "it has a number of really funny scenes and memorable lines", but overall [...] "the storyline didn't really have anywhere to go and the final half of the third act is a complete waste of time." [...] Morgan Larrick of About.com noted [...] "Homer to the Max" [...] as [...] "one of the most unforgettable episodes" [...] when reviewing the complete tenth season.|$|E
500|$|Calgary Sun {{columnist}} Eric Francis called McMahon's {{decision to}} continue the event [...] "sick, disrespectful and wrong. But what else would you expect from the WWF?" [...] He added, [...] "if there's any justice in this world, McMahon will pay dearly for what his organization has done to further pain the Harts". Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, [...] "It was disgusting.... For kids to see that, {{for this to be}} so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry <b>on</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nothing had happened, is just sad." [...] Martha Hart, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} her husband's death. She said that McMahon [...] "absolutely should be there" [...] at the funeral. She also stated, [...] "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, but there will be a day of reckoning". Commenting on the WWF's decision {{to continue the}} show after her husband's death, Martha stated, [...] "After he lost his fight for life they just scooped him up and ordered the next match out. Where's the humanity? Would he have wanted the show to go on? Absolutely not." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the damage}} had been done, and Cambridge, UK, 'declared victory': Levhari was wrong, Samuelson was wrong, Solow was wrong, MIT {{was wrong and}} {{therefore}} neoclassical economics was wrong. As a result there are some groups of economists who have abandoned neoclassical economics for their own refinements of classical economics. In the United States, on the other hand, mainstream economics goes <b>on</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the controversy had never occurred. Macroeconomics textbooks discuss 'capital' {{as if it were}} a well-defined concept [...] which it is not, except in a very special one-capital-good world (or under other unrealistically restrictive conditions). The problems of heterogeneous capital goods have also been ignored in the 'rational expectations revolution' and in virtually all econometric work." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1925, the Duke {{suffered}} a stroke that paralysed him and led to his gradual mental deterioration. Previously a jovial man, the duke became miserable towards his family and others, and suddenly could not tolerate his wife. Their granddaughter-in-law later recalled that [...] "Granny Evie tried to carry <b>on</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nothing had happened but the house and estate lacked a leader and it showed." [...] The Duchess gained more authority over his estates, destroying its Joseph Paxton-designed conservatory and saving expenses by introducing nettle soup to Chatsworth House, but their affairs [...] "gradually went downhill." [...] He died in May 1938; after his death, the Duchess took up residence at Hardwick Hall, where she oversaw {{a significant amount of}} repair work of its tapestries and embroideries.|$|E
2500|$|Scientologists also later {{complained of}} bigotry towards the Church in {{comments}} made by Sweeney during interviews with Scientology members. Sweeney's outburst toward Tommy Davis prompted John Travolta to lobby British MPs {{in an attempt to}} stop the documentary from being aired. Both Sweeney and Sandy Smith apologised for his (Sweeney's) behaviour. Sweeney stated that it was a by-product of the [...] "hijacking of the Holocaust" [...] by the Scientology exhibition which was where the outburst occurredas well as attempts to control his mind. Sweeney said of the incident: [...] "I apologised almost immediately, Tommy carried <b>on</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nothing had happened but meanwhile Scientology had rushed off copies of me losing it to my boss, my boss's boss and my boss's boss's boss, the Director-General of the BBC." [...] Later, he added: [...] "I look like an exploding tomato and shout like a jet engine and every time I see it, it makes me cringe." [...] At the time the Church of Scientology posted its own material regarding the matter on the Internet, one of its spokesmen denied Sweeney's statement regarding a quick apology.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{division}} was engaged {{full time in}} its defensive role as well as maintaining constructed defences, it found little time to provide its battalions with field training. As a result, battalions were switched out with those from the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division {{for a period of}} one month. In the event of an actual invasion, it was intended that the battalions return to their original assignments. For example, the 4th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (Ox and Bucks) moved to the coastal area and replaced a battalion from the Devon and Cornwall Division who then moved inland for training. The regimental history of the Ox and Bucks noted that they had to leave behind equipment and rear area and specialist personnel in order to make up the equipment deficiencies of the beach defence units {{in order for them to}} complete their training. The division did not solely rely on the 48th to provide training, and did engage in its own training activities. However, in an analysis of the use of umpires during such exercises, historian Timothy Harrison Place highlighted an example involving the 8th Battalion, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment: [...] "Lance-Corporal R.I. Higgins ... took part in a night patrol that captured the opposing brigadier and his staff. For their trouble the umpires made Higgins and his comrades the victims of a retrospective artillery concentration and the brigadier carried <b>on</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nothing had happened – as indeed did Higgins' patrol, resurrected after a short rest." ...|$|E
