5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door,</b> and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E

25|$|Archaeologists {{were not}} able to locate the site until 2006 when a group of volunteers {{involved}} in the work of clearing the Varano ridge witnessed a landslide: continuing to dig they brought to light various structures, including a doorway and the hinge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door.</b> After the initial enthusiasm and initiatives to recover the remains, lack of funds has led to villa becoming overgrown again.|$|E

25|$|The side facades {{are similar}} to the front and rear, except for the absence of the arched passageway. Both sides are in five bays, all windows, on the first floor, with the {{exception}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> on the east side. The second-floor openings and balconies match the front with air conditioners generally mounted in the transoms. On the west side one second-floor door has a modern boxed-out bar grille around it.|$|E
25|$|If the {{reference}} {{point is the}} instantaneous axis of rotation the expression of velocity of {{a point in the}} rigid body will have just the angular velocity term. This is because the velocity of instantaneous axis of rotation is zero. An example of instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door.</b> Another example is the point of contact of a purely rolling spherical (or, more generally, convex) rigid body.|$|E
25|$|A door is {{a moving}} {{mechanism}} used to block off, and allow access to, an entrance to or within an enclosed space, {{such as a}} building, room or vehicle. Doors normally consist {{of one or two}} solid panels, with or without windows, that swing on hinges horizontally. These hinges are attached to the door's edge but there are also doors that slide, fold or spin. The main purpose <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> is to control physical access.|$|E

25|$|The {{portions}} where Mike Shinoda raps first {{take place}} in a wasteland with thorny vines sprouting out of the ground, surrounding him and shattering into dust, (first verse) and then grass and plants sprouting up around him (second verse). During the time Mike raps his verses, Chester stands atop a platform with gargoyles on the edges. This platform is in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> {{in the shape of a}} trapezoid. Near the end of the video, the skies turn dark and it begins to rain, and the band performs in the downpour until the end of the song, where the rain stops and the camera pans away from the tower, showing the wasteland where Shinoda had rapped in is now a lush Greenland. During the rain the statues on the tower begin to move.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek and Roman {{doors were}} either single doors, double doors, triple doors, sliding doors or folding doors, {{in the last}} case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In Eumachia, is a {{painting}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at Agrigentum {{there is a single}} four-panel door carved in stone. In the Blundell collection is a bas-relief of a temple with double doors, each leaf with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano, in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the Pantheon are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle. Two other bronze doors of the Roman period are in the Lateran Basilica.|$|E
25|$|A {{high-speed}} door is a {{very fast}} door some with opening speeds of up to 4m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where the speed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> {{has an effect on}} production logistics, temperature and pressure control. high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded. High-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200000 a year. They need to be built with heavy duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections. High Speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the Green and Energy saving requirements.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{hypothesis is that}} learners {{in this type of}} task may be using a “propose-but-verify” mechanism rather than a statistical learning mechanism. Medina et al. and Trueswell et al. argue that, because Yu and Smith only tracked knowledge {{at the end of the}} training, rather than tracking knowledge on a trial-by-trial basis, it is impossible to know if participants were truly updating statistical probabilities of co-occurrence (and therefore maintaining multiple hypotheses simultaneously), or if, instead, they were forming a single hypothesis and checking it on the next trial. For example, if a participant is presented with a picture of a dog and a picture of a shoe, and hears the nonsense word vash she might hypothesize that vash refers to the dog. On a future trial, she may see a picture of a shoe and a picture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> and again hear the word vash. If statistical learning is the mechanism by which word-referent mappings are learned, then the participant would be more likely to select the picture of the shoe than the door, as shoe would have appeared in conjunction with the word vash 100% of the time. However, if participants are simply forming a single hypothesis, they may fail to remember the context of the previous presentation of vash (especially if, as in the experimental conditions, there are multiple trials with other words in between the two presentations of vash) and therefore be at chance in this second trial. According to this proposed mechanism of word learning, if the participant had correctly guessed that vash referred to the shoe in the first trial, her hypothesis would be confirmed in the subsequent trial.|$|E
500|$|The video commences with Inna {{coming out}} from a body of water, {{following}} which she gets chased by a man—played by Yassir Lamrani Selmane—at a bazaar and through the surroundings of a building. This {{is followed by the}} singer and her female background dancers performing choreography. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Inna singing in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door,</b> and her in a desert with a dromedary and dancing around a fire with her backup dancers. Regarding the singer's appearance in the music video, Yohann Ruelle of Pure Charts wrote, [...] "Inna knows how to turn on the temperature!" [...] Valentina Malfroy from website Aficia commended the quality of the visual and saw Inna as charming. An editor of Vagalume thought Inna [...] "plays a girl who abuses her sensuality in typical costumes and a lot of Arabic dance to enchant her love interest." [...] Currin, writing in his own website, praised Inna's choreography and the video overall, whilst Hitfire recommended the clip and said it matched the song. After its release on YouTube, the music video attracted many comments written in Arabic. It received notable airplay in Romania, peaking at number seven on Media Forest's TV Airplay chart.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Dickinson's {{behavior}} {{began to}} change. She {{did not leave}} the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors {{from the other side}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> rather than speaking to them face to face. She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878–1882. Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person. Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders. Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers. Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that [...] "Aunt Emily stood for indulgence." [...] MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called [...] "A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson", thought of her as always offering support to the neighborhood children.|$|E

500|$|Kallie Plagge at IGN remarked how the remaster wasn't as revolutionary a {{game when}} {{compared}} with the original, and that certain aspects, such as the pacing and level design, felt notably dated. She praised the range of visual and technical improvements compared with other remasters, but criticized some minor shortcomings with regards to both graphical and design elements, saying [...] "there are cracks in the facade; a checkpoint-triggered cloud of smoke {{near the end of the}} campaign was jarringly rough around the edges, for instance, and there were times when I'd get momentarily stuck on the geometry <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> and unceremoniously shoved to the side by a scripted ally charging through." [...] Despite this, she complimented the gameplay as having held up remarkably well and which felt more gratifying as a result of being unaltered, stating how it left her [...] "feeling relatively weighed down, encumbered, and more desperate in the fray. [...] It feels urgent, and it's still really satisfying even next to a contemporary, faster CoD." [...] She thought the game felt more classic rather than outdated, saying that [...] "It might not have the same effect it did the first time around, but it works as both a great embodiment of what shooters used to be and one that still plays well." ...|$|E
500|$|Luce {{refused to}} take any action to save himself—he had told Baalham, before the second officer's departure, that [...] "the fate of the ship shall be mine". When {{he could no longer}} render {{assistance}} to those still on board, he climbed with his young son to his command post atop the starboard paddle box, and waited for the end. By this time, many on board had become resigned to their fate; they huddled together for comfort while some sang hymns or recited scripture. A few still frantically sought for means of survival; those who could not find a place on the raft lashed together anything that might float—chairs, stools, caskets, sofas and doors, while Holland continued to fire the cannon. Peter McCabe, a waiter on his first transatlantic voyage, later described the scene: [...] "Several persons were floating about on doors and beds... I seized hold <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> which had been taken down to save passengers, and went into the sea, where I left the door and got upon the raft... A great many persons were trying to get on the raft... Among the number who were on it I saw four ladies". Many were lost from the raft when it fouled the sinking hull—a section broke off, spilling its occupants into the sea. After this, McCabe counted seventy-two men and four women either on or clinging to the structure, as it moved slowly away from the ship.|$|E
