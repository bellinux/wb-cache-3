25|$|In {{defending}} Freud {{against this}} critique, feminist scholar Jacqueline Rose {{has argued that}} it presupposes a more normative account of female sexual development than that given by Freud. She notes that Freud moved from a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> stuck with her 'inferiority' or 'injury' {{in the face of}} the anatomy of the little boy to an account in his later work which explicitly describes the process of becoming 'feminine' as an 'injury' or 'catastrophe' for the complexity of her earlier psychic and sexual life.|$|E
500|$|In 2016, McAdams voiced The Mother <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Girl</b> in an {{animated}} version of The Little Prince, and co-starred with Benedict Cumberbatch in the Marvel superhero film Doctor Strange. Peter Debruge of Variety said McAdams played [...] "the most competent—and human—of Marvel’s window-dressing girlfriends," [...] while Gregory Ellwood of Indiewire remarked: [...] "It {{goes without saying}} that McAdams will never get the credit she deserves for transforming the barely sketched out role of Strange’s former medical colleague Christine Palmer into a captivating three-dimensional character that feels like {{an integral part of the}} storyline even when she isn’t." [...] Also in 2016, McAdams narrated an audiobook version of L. M. Montgomery's novel Anne of Green Gables, released by Audible.|$|E
500|$|It {{seems that}} Marie Eline was so well-disguised {{as a boy}} that the {{reviewer}} for The Nickelodeon was unable to recognize her true gender. The reviewer state [...] "the meeting between the father and his newsboy child also has a touch of originality" [...] and [...] "he child is a fine little actor, easily making himself {{the star of the}} piece." [...] Though this was not lost on the reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror which stated, [...] "The work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> who plays the leading role in this film is a constant wonder to spectators." [...] Eline had proven herself capable of handling male characters, with the first such credit as a young Italian boy in The Two Roses. Eline would also star as Hans in The Little Hero of Holland.|$|E

500|$|Little {{is known}} {{on the actual}} {{production}} of the film, but the The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer provided {{some insight into the}} production. The review and the synopsis are at odds on several aspects including on whether or not the man was fired for drunkenness or for no reason. In this case, it can be assumed that a drunken state was either not depicted or done inadequately. The reviewer states the [...] "impossible parts of the plot are gracefully omitted" [...] in reference to the abduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> played by Marie Eline and the overpowering of the chauffeur. Here the synopsis also differs, saying the girl is enticed away instead of being kidnapped. Though the overpowering of the chauffeur is required and acknowledged in the synopsis, the reviewer makes clear the actual method is not depicted. The reviewer also had a keen eye for detail, stating that the passengers disembarked {{into the middle of the}} street instead of on the sidewalk. The final scene's setting is captured in a surviving film still that shows the little girl persuading her parents to hire Jim in the police station with three officers looking on in the background.|$|E
500|$|While the Doctor alters part of {{the command}} module of Apollo 11, Canton and Amy visit a nearby orphanage, hoping to find where {{the girl in the}} {{spacesuit}} was taken from. Amy discovers a nest of the Silence, and a photograph of her and a baby amongst pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> from the space suit. The girl enters with the Silence, and Amy is abducted and taken to their time engine control room. Arriving too late, the Doctor and his allies find Amy's recording device, through which Rory still can hear Amy's voice confessing her love for one of the group. Canton is able to shoot and wound one of the creatures, and from it the Doctor discovers the creatures are the Silence, a group he was warned about by several of his foes in his recent adventures. Analysing the now-empty space suit, River realises that the girl possesses incredible strength to have forced her way out of it, and that the suit's advanced life-support technology would have called the President as the highest authority figure on Earth when the girl got scared. The Doctor realises why the Silence have been controlling humanity— by guiding their technological advances, they have influenced humanity into the Space Race for purposes of building a spacesuit, which must somehow be crucial to their intentions. Meanwhile, Canton interrogates the captured Silent in the Area 51 prison, who mocks humanity for treating him when [...] "...you should kill us all on sight". Canton records this using Amy's mobile phone.|$|E
500|$|Between 1996 and 2000, {{the lead}} monster and child went through radical changes {{as the story}} evolved. As the story {{continued}} to develop, the child varied in age and gender. Ultimately, the story team decided that a girl {{would be the best}} counterpart for a furry, [...] co-star. After a girl was settled upon, the character continued to undergo changes, at one point being from Ireland and at another time being an African-American character. Originally the character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> known as Mary, became a fearless seven-year-old who has been toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers. In stark contrast, Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters, Inc. announces a downsizing is on the way. He feels envious because another scarer, Ned (who later became Randall), is the company's top performer. Through various drafts, Johnson's occupation went back-and-forth from being a scarer and from working in another area of the company such as a janitor or a refinery worker, until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters, Inc. Throughout development Pixar worried that having a main character whose main goal was to scare children would alienate audiences and make them not empathize with him. Docter would later describe that the team [...] "bent over backwards trying to create a story that still had monsters [...] " [...] while still solving the problem, A key moment came when the team decided [...] "Okay, he’s the BEST scarer there. He’s the star quarterback" [...] with Docter noting that before that moment [...] "design after design, we really didn’t know what he was about." [...] Disney noted to Pixar early on that they did not want the character to [...] "look like a guy in a suit." [...] To this end Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet; however, this caused many problems in early animation tests. The idea was later largely rejected, as it was thought that audiences would be distracted by the tentacles. Mary's age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of 3. [...] "We found that the younger she was, the more dependent she was on Sulley", Docter said.|$|E

The jury will refuse to state its convictions -- for it has none -- until after the autopsy has been held.

2500|$|Etienne {{was born}} in George Street, Sydney on 9 April 1832 in his parents' home, on the same block of land backing onto the Tank Stream {{that his mother had}} been born 30 years earlier. He was the third and {{youngest}} son of the Frenchman Prosper de Mestre (1793–1844), a Sydney merchant, and Sydney-born Mary Ann Black (1801–1861) and grandson of John Black. His career was a series of triumphs with a long succession of champion horses passing through his hands. Many of these he bred himself, and many others such as Archer, Tim Whiffler, Chester, Yattendon, Plant and [...] "Veno" [...] he trained, and even sometimes rode. De Mestre's association with George Taylor Rowe (1822–1859) of Liverpool, England, the owner of the celebrated Veno, and the father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> who was to grow up and one day to be his wife; and with his good school-friend Thomas John [...] "Tom" [...] Roberts (1831–1899) of Jembaicumbene near Braidwood, one of the owners of many champion horses including Mariner, Sailor, Archer, and Tim Whiffler, was at the forefront of a wonderful career of thirty years. He occupied a leading place among the racing celebrities of Australia and was the first national sportsman to represent the Shoalhaven district where he lived.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the years}} 1928-1932 he painted {{a group of}} {{paintings}} he called [...] "Stylized". In his Orange Grove painting he used familiar motifs in a highly stylized rendition of orange groves found everywhere {{at the time in}} Florida. The round form of the orange tree mimicked by the round oranges themselves broken up by the lines of palm fronds, fences and crates. The lake is repeating the line of the arched trunk hanging over it. The grouping of leaves each is repeating cleverly the whole form of the lake. The ornamental form of Euphorbias was a persistent stimulus which produced three important paintings. In one, Euphorbia expressed a freer flowing style with its long undulating branches waving as a Bali dancer would, leading to the creation of The Dancers. In fact the Bali mask in the painting suggests a comparison. The very young Bali girls perform their ceremonial dances by undulating motion of the arms rather than of the feet or body. Mulford tried to show that the plant does the same thing in ten years what the Bali dancer can do in ten minutes. The motion of the plant is solidified and has the duration of many years, while the dance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> is observed in but a fleeting glimpse of each movement. It is a unity of life's expressions with each form finding its happiness in expressing its rhythm within the limits of its timing. Another painting, Polynesian took as its pivot the five points of a talkative Stapelia whose form symbolizes heaven and sun. The pattern of the plant was echoed in the Polynesian tapa cloth which was the inspiration for the painting and is seen in the background. The angular Padilanthus was used as well to compose symphony of harmonious form. The idea of the painting was to build a symphonic interpretation of these motifs from their original primitive representations, reappearing again in living form. The few simple motifs are found repeated in each object with a natural simplicity which the artist has caught and tried to reproduce. Between the years 1930 and 1935 Mulford's paintings took on a combination of stylized and decorative style. The [...] "Philosophical" [...] series was started between 1932 and 1936. In Self Defense, every living thing has its own protection. This begins with the flowering date palm and its maze of thousand spikes or thorns pointing in every direction guarding reproduction from conception to maturing of egg cells that we call seeds or fruit. After this painting was completed, Mulford made a frame to hold it but immediately the frame seemed to defeat the purpose of the expression to be illustrated. The palm was confined. This led to painting the fronds on the frame, extending them {{up and out of the}} frame. He helped develop the Nyack Country Club in New York between the years 1932-1934. He used elephants to move and plow the dirt. Being the sensitive man that he was he observed that each elephant had his own personality and it was reflected in their eyes. His elephant painting reflects this insight. In Mimicry the artist sympathetically depicts the parallel relationship between one of the lizard's mannerisms and that of the Anthurium. The little tendrils and feet of the lowest white leaved vine compared to the little feet of the lizard. The appearance is very much the same. The leaves and flower in the painting represents the Aracae family, of which the calla lily is a member. They are among the earliest and simplest forms of plants. The lizard as well is a very early and simple form of the reptiles. The painting is filled with subtle repetitions with colors suggesting a deep primeval forest with its many hidden forms. He described the motivation behind the Climbers. It had been motivated by a huge, old, gnarled vine growing outside his studio at Tropical Arts. The vine in his painting climbs up the tree trunk for light and air. A small tendril is the intelligence part of the vine. It is the guide for its motivation. Likewise the small tender tongue of the snake is the sensitive ear and nose which guide the snake to quiet resting places. The parallel means of motivation of these two forms create the similar shape of their bodies and a similar type of intelligence. The vine and snake are both elemental and early forms of life, assembled in harmonious composition in this painting. His series Impressions of Mexico was completed between 1936 and 1938.|$|E
