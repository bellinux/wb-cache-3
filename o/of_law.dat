40|$|The {{increasing}} {{frequency with which}} activities involving intellectual property (“IP”) cross national borders now warrants a clear definition of the territorial reach <b>of</b> national IP <b>laws</b> so that parties engaging in the activities can operate with sufficient notice <b>of</b> the <b>laws</b> applicable to their activities. Legislators, however, have not devoted adequate attention to the territorial delineation of IP law; in fact, legislators rarely draft IP statutes with any consideration of cross-border scenarios, and with few exceptions IP laws are designed with only single-country scenarios in mind. Delineating the reach <b>of</b> national IP <b>laws</b> is actually a complex matter because the reach depends not only on substantive IP law, but also on conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> rules. Yet until recently conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> rules had rarely been considered or drafted with IP issues in mind. In some countries, such as Switzerland, Poland, and China, legislators have reviewed conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> rules in light <b>of</b> IP <b>laws</b> and passed conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> statutes with IP-specific provisions; the European Union has IP-specific provisions in its instruments on conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> as well. In the United States, state conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> rules provide no IP-specific rules, nor does the Restatement (Second) <b>of</b> Conflict <b>of</b> <b>Laws,</b> which federal courts apply when deciding federal question cases. This article argues {{that because of the}} rising importance of cross-border IP activities and the increasing need for clear territorial delineation <b>of</b> IP <b>laws</b> it is important for legislators to give equal consideration to cross-border and single-country scenarios when drafting legislation, and to calibrate the territorial scope <b>of</b> national IP <b>laws</b> with conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> rules to achieve the desired territorial reach of national IP policies. The article analyzes the interaction <b>of</b> IP <b>laws</b> and conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> rules and reviews from both the IP law and the conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> perspectives the various tools that are available to define the territorial reach <b>of</b> national IP <b>laws.</b> The fact that legislators deal with numerous “moving pieces” (particularly the conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> rules <b>of</b> foreign countries) when they design the territorial reach <b>of</b> national <b>laws</b> should not discourage the legislators from striving to improve certainty about the territorial reach <b>of</b> national <b>laws.</b> Depending on {{the degree to which the}} “moving pieces” limit legislators’ ability to improve certainty, countries may wish to negotiate and enter into international agreements in order to set uniform conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> rules and define the limits of the territorial reach <b>of</b> national IP <b>laws...</b>|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question <b>of</b> <b>law</b> involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error <b>of</b> <b>law</b> if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> While errors <b>of</b> <b>law</b> are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E

40|$|This book {{discusses}} the fundamentals underlying the conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> {{and how the}} conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> and foreign law are treated in judicial and arbitral proceedings.

In this respect it is also discussed how international law and community law can affect the conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> and the result of its application. The next chapters discuss how the fundamentals of the conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> are applied in practice. Thereto, it is examined how the conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> is dealt with in proceedings at the District Courts, the Courts of Appeal and the Supreme Court and how Dutch procedural law affects the application of the conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> in these proceedings. Subsequently, the author {{discusses the}} position <b>of</b> foreign <b>law</b> in proceedings at the District Courts, the Courts of Appeal and the Supreme Court, how the merits <b>of</b> foreign <b>law</b> should be determined and what should be done if this is not possible within a reasonable period. The author also explores the conflict of laws’ procedural interest requirement and the facultative conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws.</b> Lastly, the author addresses how the conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> plays a role in arbitral proceedings. In that context it is amongst other things discussed how the law applicable to the arbitrability, the competence of the parties, the arbitration agreement, the rules governing the arbitral proceedings and the material dispute dividing the parties must be determined...|$|R
