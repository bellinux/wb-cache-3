40|$|A recent {{effort to}} optimally size miniature, single-gimbal variable-speed control moment {{gyroscopes}} for combined energy storage and attitude control on small satellites hatched an efficient, structured approach which enables alternative technology comparisons. The method, documented {{in a separate}} article, casts the design as a constrained nonlinear programming problem where a performance index constructed from subsystem design margins is optimized for a given set of agility and energy storage requirements. In that article, the available energy capacity is computed as the maximum available isotropic structural capacity of the rotor using the rotor's shape factor (derived from rotor material strength and density) and maximum structural and minimum wheel speeds. However, a more realistic implementation of a satellite flywheel energy storage system is limited in its maximum <b>operating</b> <b>wheel</b> speed. In turn, the usable available capacity, {{a function of the}} maximum and minimum <b>operating</b> <b>wheel</b> speeds, is a more accurate quantity to use in the optimal sizing algorithm. In the present paper, this concept is applied to the variable speed control moment gyroscope-based energy storage and attitude control system and is illustrated through parametric numerical examples of optimizing for subsystem mass keeping performance constant in relation to a baseline, conventional secondary battery plus momentum wheel design. The resulting energy capacity comparisons are conducted through the handy restriction of the optimization problem to a near closed-form solution thereby making the comparisons compact yet useful...|$|E

For instance, the Roomba is able to change direction upon encountering obstacles, to detect dirty spots on the floor, and to sense steep drops to keep it from falling down stairs. It uses two independently <b>operating</b> <b>wheels</b> that allow 360° turns in place. Additionally, it can adapt to perform other, more creative tasks, using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.|$|R

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} any highway {{project is to}} provide a {{suitable}} pavement for safe movement of vehicles. Similarly, in case of the airport/airfield project, the basic objective is to construct a pavement, generally called runway, for safe take off and landing of aircrafts. In general, pavements are used for the purpose of <b>operating</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicles safely and economically. The pavement, which is a hard layer consisting of a few sub-layers with different engineering properties, is placed on the natural/compacted soil subgrade after the completion of the earthwork. Both highway and airport pavements are generally classified into two major groups: (1) asphalt/bituminous concrete pavements, and (2) cement concrete pavements, which are conventionally known as flexible and rigid pavements, respectively. The subgrade is normally the insitu soil over which the pavement is laid. However, it can also refer to the top of an embankment/fill over which the pavement is constructed...|$|R
