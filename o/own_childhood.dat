5|$|The album {{prominently}} features flute, acoustic {{and electric}} guitars and Hammond organ, {{which had been}} used previously, but the instrumentation includes harpsichord, xylophone, timpani, violin, lute, trumpet, saxophone, and a string section—all uncommon in the band's earlier blues-inspired rock. Anderson later said that the lyrics were partly derived from experiences his <b>own</b> <b>childhood,</b> though the overall theme was showing Bostock's attempt {{to make sense of}} life from his point of view.|$|E
5|$|Balzac wrote Louis Lambert {{during the}} summer of 1832 while he was staying with friends at the Château de Saché, and {{published}} three editions with three different titles. The novel contains a minimal plot, focusing mostly on the metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius protagonist and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is not a significant example of the realist style for which Balzac became famous, the novel provides insight into the author's <b>own</b> <b>childhood.</b> Specific details and events from the author's life – including punishment from teachers and social ostracism – suggest a fictionalized autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Children's book Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce {{is partly}} set in Ely and {{includes}} a scene in Ely Cathedral and scenes inspired by the author's father's <b>own</b> <b>childhood</b> experiences of skating along the frozen river from Cambridge to Ely in the frost of 1894–95. The first series of Jim Kelly's crime novels, featuring journalist Philip Dryden, is largely set in the author's home town of Ely and in the Fens. Graham Swift's 1983 novel Waterland takes place, and recounts several historical events, {{in and around the}} town of Ely.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Together Again" [...] premiered in September 1997. The video {{features}} the band performing in a Christmas playroom, reminiscing about their <b>own</b> <b>childhoods.</b> The video shows {{pictures of the}} boys when they were younger, and changes {{the theme of the}} song to relate to the break-up between their selves and their parents. The video also shows the boys celebrating Christmas together.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the continuum of}} influences that primary caregivers (namely parents) experience and the subsequent impact of these on the feeding of their young children. These influences on caregivers may commence from their <b>own</b> <b>childhoods,</b> through their life experiences to the birth and early infancy of their children. The paper highlights caregivers’ concerns and dilemmas in feeding young children, particularly {{in the face of}} conflict between nutritional recommendations and socially acceptable behaviours and attitudes...|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully, when {{investigating}} the possible alien abduction of a teenage girl, find that the missing girl's younger brother may be capable of receiving satellite transmissions, and that her mother {{may also have been}} party to a UFO encounter over twenty years earlier. Mulder finds himself becoming emotionally attached to the case due to its similarities to his <b>own</b> <b>childhood</b> experiences, when his younger sister Samantha was abducted from their home.|$|E
5|$|Inspired {{by their}} own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle {{conceived}} Kim as a teenage girl capable of doing anything, basing the character on their <b>own</b> <b>childhood</b> hero James Bond. Upon noticing the lack of strong female leads in children's animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick {{in the form of}} best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the character's crime-fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more relatable to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kim's appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead.|$|E
5|$|Pete Gifford is Jenny's {{husband and}} has been Adam's best friend since childhood. Bullen based Pete on his <b>own</b> <b>childhood</b> friend, with whom he went through university. Pete is often {{deliberately}} insensitive towards Adam, which Thomson attributes to Pete thinking Adam is jealous of his achievements. In Series 2, Pete has an affair with co-worker Amy. It upsets his marriage to Jenny and by Series 3 they are separated. At the beginning of Series 4, they are back together and expecting a second child. After Jenny miscarries, she leaves Pete and takes little Adam with her. Pete has a rebound relationship with Jo, and marries her {{at the end of}} Series 4. They break {{up at the end of}} Series 5.|$|E

50|$|The {{brothers}} had desired to film the series around the Long Island area {{to match the}} initial Montauk concept. However, with filming scheduled {{to take place in}} November 2015, it was difficult to shoot in Long Island in the cold weather, and the production started scouting locations in and around the Atlanta, Georgia area. The brothers, who grew up in North Carolina, found many places that reminded them of their <b>own</b> <b>childhoods</b> in that area, and felt the area would work well with the narrative shift to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.|$|R
5000|$|They next {{directed}} A Serious Man, released October 2, 2009, a [...] "gentle but dark" [...] period comedy (set in 1967) {{with a low}} budget. The film {{is based}} loosely on the Coens's <b>own</b> <b>childhoods</b> in an academic family in the largely Jewish suburb of Saint Louis Park, Minnesota; it also drew comparisons to the Book of Job. Filming took place late {{in the summer of}} 2008, in the neighborhoods of Roseville and Bloomington, Minnesota, at Normandale Community College, and at St. Olaf College. The film was nominated for the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.|$|R
5|$|Research at Simla {{formally}} {{began in}} 1950. Beebe's research at Simla combined elements {{of many different}} earlier stages of his research, including observations of the life cycles of the area's birds, detailed analyses of every plant and animal in small areas of forest, and studies of insect behavior. Insects were {{the focus of the}} scientific papers he produced during this period, marking a transition from his past areas of study into the field of entomology. Local children periodically brought animal specimens to Beebe at Simla and asked him to classify them. Remembering the early studies of his <b>own</b> <b>childhood,</b> in which he had brought specimens to the American Museum of Natural History, he was happy working with them.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Messi {{has been}} {{involved}} in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his <b>own</b> <b>childhood.</b> Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children {{in the wake of the}} recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.|$|E
5|$|The new Edward IV {{visited the}} castle {{regularly}} {{and established a}} council there to govern his estates in Wales. He probably conducted only modest work on the property, although he may could {{have been responsible for}} the remodelling of the Great Tower. In 1473, possibly influenced by his <b>own</b> <b>childhood</b> experiences at Ludlow, Edward sent his eldest son, the future Edward V, and his brother Prince Richard to live at the castle, which was also made the seat of the newly created Council in the Marches of Wales. By now Ludlow had become primarily residential, rather than military, but was still rich in chivalric connotations and a valuable symbol of the Yorkist authority and their claim to the throne. Edward died in 1483, but after Henry VII took the throne in 1485 he continued to use Ludlow Castle as a regional base, granting it to his son, Prince Arthur, in 1493, and reestablishing the dormant Council in the Marches at the property.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} current child and {{childhood}} research is problematical {{in as much}} as there is a discrepancy between theory and research practice. Although in theory, children are conceptualised as active agents in the social world, the type of research that children are typically involved in implies that children are competent, knowledgeable and affective only in terms of their own lives, their own spaces, their <b>own</b> <b>childhoods.</b> The implications of this discrepancy are discussed. The paper concludes that although research that contributes to a greater understanding of childhood experiences is important, it is equally important to involve children in research that goes beyond ‘childhood’...|$|R
40|$|The authors studied 46 eldest or only {{children}} under school age {{and their parents}} to determine the relationship between parents' recollections of their <b>own</b> <b>childhoods</b> {{and the way they}} use their family physician for care of their children. The parents completed a questionnaire that measured the caring and overprotection dimensions of the parenting they themselves remember. Positive correlations were found between perceptions of maternal overprotection and the frequency of children's visits. Negative correlations were found between perceptions of parental affection and children's visits and non-routine diagnoses. Neuroticism was found to be a confounding variable that slightly weakened the relationship between maternal caring and children's visits...|$|R

40|$|This {{theoretical}} paper {{investigates the}} relationship between socialisation and mathematics education in Swedish preschools. Socialisation {{is considered to be}} the process by which children construct their <b>own</b> <b>childhoods</b> and experiences as a preparation for adulthood. Mathematics education as defined by the curriculum outlines what learning possibilities preschools and the adults working in them should provide to children. The production and reproduction of cultural knowledge as components of socialisation are connected to the global issue of early year’s education and schoolification. I suggest {{that it is important to}} discuss how learning of content and subjectivities is a key feature in an investigation of {{the relationship between}} socialisations and mathematics education in the Swedish preschool curriculum...|$|R

5000|$|She {{suggests}} {{making it}} clear that modern culture's disassociation with nature has occurred gradually over time, rather than very recently. Dickinson thinks that many people idealize their <b>own</b> <b>childhoods</b> without seeing the dysfunction that has existed for multiple generations. She warns against viewing the cure to nature deficit disorder as an outward entity: [...] "nature". Instead, Dickinson states that a path of inward self-assessment [...] "with nature" [...] (rather than [...] "in nature") and alongside meaningful time spent in nature is the key to solving the social and environmental problems of which nature deficit disorder is a symptom. In addition, she advocates allowing nature education to take on an emotional pedagogy rather than a mainly scientific one, as well as experiencing nature as it is before ascribing names to everything.|$|R
50|$|In December 2008, Paxton Gate's Curiosities for Kids, opened.

In a nod to the original store’s reputation for taxidermy, Curiosities also features taxidermy made from paper maché, a line of mounted plush animal heads and workshops and other events including insect pinning, mask-making, demonstrations and birthday parties.|$|R
5000|$|Shine Global's second feature-length documentary, The Harvest, {{directed}} by U. Roberto Romano, revisits Edward R. Murrow’s Harvest of Shame, filmed 40 years ago, and reveals that {{little has changed}} over the past 4 decades in the lives of migrant farm workers in America. Zulema, Perla and Victor labor as migrant farm workers, sacrificing their <b>own</b> <b>childhoods</b> to help their families survive. The Harvest (La Cosecha) profiles these three as they journey from the scorching heat of Texas’ onion fields to the winter snows of the Michigan apple orchards and back south to the humidity of Florida’s tomato fields to follow the harvest. In 2009, Eva Longoria signed on as an Executive Producer of the project. [...] The Harvest premiered at the IDFA festival in Amsterdam in November 2010 and had its theatrical run in NY and LA in August 2011.|$|R
