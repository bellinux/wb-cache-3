5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing <b>osmolarity</b> of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood <b>osmolarity</b> falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located at}} the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior pituitary secretes antidiuretic hormone, which regulates <b>osmolarity</b> of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions of the uterus in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.|$|E
5|$|The common {{ancestor}} of all present gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) lived in freshwater, and later migrated {{back to the}} sea. To deal with the much higher salinity in sea water, they evolved the ability to turn the nitrogen waste product ammonia into harmless urea, storing it in the body to give the blood the same <b>osmolarity</b> as the sea water without poisoning the organism. This is the system currently found in cartilaginous fishes. Ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) later returned to freshwater and lost this ability, while the fleshy-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii) retained it. Since the blood of ray-finned fishes contains more salt than freshwater, they could simply get rid of ammonia through their gills. When they finally returned to the sea again, they did not recover their old trick of turning ammonia to urea, {{and they had to}} evolve salt excreting glands instead. Lungfishes do the same when they are living in water, making ammonia and no urea, but when the water dries up and they are forced to burrow down in the mud, they switch to urea production. Like cartilaginous fishes, the coelacanth can store urea in its blood, as can the only known amphibians that can live {{for long periods of time}} in salt water (the toad Bufo marinus and the frog Rana cancrivora). These are traits they have inherited from their ancestors.|$|E

40|$|Exposure of yeast {{cells to}} high <b>osmolarities</b> leads to dehydration, {{collapse}} of ion gradients over the plasma membrane and decrease in cell viability. The response of yeast cells to high external <b>osmolarities</b> is designated osmostress response.

Part of the response aims at raising the internal osmotic potential, i. e. the production of osmolytes such as glycerol, and exclusion of toxic solutes. In addition, heat-shock proteins and trehalose are synthesized, probably to protect cellular components and to facilitate repair and recovery. Recent analyses of osmosensitive yeast mutants strongly suggest the involvement of protein kinase-mediated signal-transduction pathways in the maintenance of the osmotic integrity of the cell.

The 100 mOsm/L solution showed the highest percentage of reacted sperm (34. 8 %), but distilled water was the one with the lowest values (20. 8 %). No significant correlations were detected between the reacted sperm verified by the hypoosmotic swelling test and other semen characteristics (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Na+ {{transport}} across abdominal skins of {{the frog}} species Rana esculenta and Rana pipiens was analyzed by recording short-circuit current (Isc), transepithelial conductance (Gt), {{and the current}} noise generated by the random blockage of apical Na+ channels by the diuretic, amiloride. Specific Na+ current (INa) and conductance (GNa), as reflected by the amiloride-sensitive part of Isc and Gt, respectively, were markedly depressed after addition of some osmotically active substances, like sugars or alcohols to the mucosal Na+-Ringer solution. These hypertonicity-induced reactions were fast and fully reversible, even at mucosal <b>osmolarities</b> of 1 Osmol. With mucosal solutions of moderate hyperosmolarity a recovery of INa and GNa was observed in presence of the osmotic gradient. This "regulatory" current showed to be carried by Na+ through the Na+-specific apical channels. Contrary to the fast current drop during the initial phase of hyperosmotic shocks, the "osmoregulation" was considerably slower. The recovery of INa was only complete at smaller osmotic gradients but {{became more and more}} suppressed at higher <b>osmolarities.</b> Steady-state analysis of the kinetics of the Na+-specific current revealed that the current depression by osmotic shocks obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This current depression at high <b>osmolarities,</b> as well as during the initial phase before "osmoregulation" with small osmotic gradients, can be described in terms of a non-competitive inhibition. This was also suggested by Na+-concentration jump experiments indicating a reduction of the maximal, apical Na+ permeability as mechanism of the hypertonicity-induced drop in INa. The INa kinetics after complete "osmoregulation" were, however, indistinguishable from the isotonic control condition. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The cycling of and {{excretion}} of urea by {{the kidneys}} {{is a vital}} part of mammalian metabolism. Besides its role as carrier of waste nitrogen, urea also plays a role in the countercurrent exchange system of the nephrons, that allows for re-absorption of water and critical ions from the excreted urine. Urea is reabsorbed in the inner medullary collecting ducts of the nephrons, thus raising the <b>osmolarity</b> in the medullary interstitium surrounding the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle, which makes the water reabsorb.|$|E
25|$|Cellular and {{systemic}} control of osmotic pressure (the difference in <b>osmolarity</b> between the cytosol and the extracellular medium) {{is critical for}} homeostasis. There are three ways in which cells can detect osmotic stimuli: as changes in macromolecular crowding, ionic strength, {{and changes in the}} properties of the plasma membrane or cytoskeleton (the latter being a form of mechanotransduction). These changes are detected by proteins known as osmosensors or osmoreceptors. In humans, the best characterised osmosensors are transient receptor potential channels present in the primary cilium of human cells. In yeast, the HOG pathway has been extensively characterised.|$|E

At high and moderate <b>osmolarities</b> of the external solution the capacitance reaches a steady-state whereas at low <b>osmolarities</b> it reveals a biphasic kinetics. Examination of RBC suspensions exposed to different concentrations of HgCl 2 demonstrates that water transport through mercury-sensitive water channel controls RBC swelling. Unlike the capacitance, an increase in the conductance to a stationary level is observed after a certain delay. A comparison of G(t) curves recorded for the suspensions of the intact cells and those treated with cytochalasin B or glutaraldehyde demonstrates the significant effect of the membrane viscoelasticity on the pore formation. It is shown that the stretched membrane of completely swollen RBC retains its integrity for a certain time, termed as the membrane lifetime, tmemb.

40|$|Hyperosmotic environments create osmotic pressure, {{favoring the}} {{movement}} of {{water out of the}} animal. This, in turn, can cause cell shrinkage and disturb many essential cellular processes. Sea water is the best known hyperosmotic environment, containing high levels of sodium chloride, but other environments can also be hyperosmotic. Some lakes and ponds contain high levels of other inorganic salts. Microbes may encounter high <b>osmolarities</b> in the tissues of their host, and plant nectaries can have significantly higher <b>osmolarities</b> than the hemolymph of the insects that live in them (Nicolson, 1994, 1998). Studies of animals in saline environments have produced two models of how animals meet the osmoregulatory challenge of a hyperosmotic environment. Some animals osmoregulate, maintaining relatively constant cellular and blood (or hemolymph) concentrations, even against large osmotic gradients. Hyporegulating animals, including marine teleosts, brine shrimp Artemia salina and saline-water mosquitoes, compensate for the osmotic loss of water by drinking the external medium.

This family is subdivided into 6 subfamilies based on homology: canonical TRP (TRPC), vanilloid receptors (TRPV), melastatin (TRPM), polycystins (TRPP), mucolipins (TRPML), and ankyrin transmembrane protein 1 (TRPA).|$|E
25|$|Water {{absorption}} at {{the colon}} typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the <b>osmolarity</b> of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives {{water into the}} lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.|$|E
25|$|ANP acts on {{the kidney}} to {{increase}} sodium and water excretion {{in the following}} ways: 1) it dilates the glomerular afferent arterioles, constricts the efferent arterioles, and relaxes the mesangial cells. This increases pressure in the glomerular capillaries, increasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in an increased amount of sodium and water being filtered and excreted. 2) It increases blood flow through the vasa recta, which washes the solutes NaCl and urea out of the medullary interstitium – the lower <b>osmolarity</b> here leads to less reabsorption of tubular fluid and increased excretion. 3) It decreases sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and cortical collecting duct. 4) It inhibits renin secretion, thereby inhibiting the production of angiotensin and aldosterone. 5) It inhibits the renal sympathetic nervous system. ANP has the opposite effect of aldosterone on the kidney: aldosterone increases renal sodium retention and ANP increases renal sodium loss.|$|E

The effects of various metabolic and membrane poisons are also reported. The behavior of the saccules within the outer segments was equivocal. While there was a tendency toward more saccules with wider lumina with hypoosmolarity, most of the saccules were not swollen. Surprisingly, intrasaccular space was consistently enlarged in rat retinas exposed to hyperosmotic sucrose but not to salt.

25|$|Elasmobranchs' {{ability to}} enter fresh water is limited because their blood is {{normally}} {{at least as}} salty (in terms of osmotic strength) as seawater through the accumulation of urea and trimethylamine oxide, but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood. Despite this, the solute composition (i.e. <b>osmolarity)</b> of a bull shark in fresh water is still much {{higher than that of}} the external environment. This results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the shark's body.

Recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters result in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water, resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water. Bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living in marine waters. This may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy.|$|E
