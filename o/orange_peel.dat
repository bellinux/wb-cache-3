40|$|Renewable {{resources}} such as natural fillers {{in the field of}} particles reinforced materials with their new range of applications represent an important basis in order to fulfill the ecological objective of creating environmental friendly materials. In views of enormous advantages a study on composites using <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> particles as a reinforcing material and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as a novel matrix has been made. The composite was first compounded to produce homogeneity of the particles in the matrix, and then it was compacted into flat plates. The composites were produced by varying the <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> particles (uncarbonized and carbonized) from 5 - 25 wt%. The properties of HDPE reinforced with <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> have been studied using mechanical tests and microstructural analysis. The results shown that there was a fairly uniform distribution of the <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> particles in the microstructure of HDPE composites which is the major factor responsible for the improvement in the mechanical properties.

5|$|The black meat of a Silkie is {{generally}} considered an unusual attribute in European and American cuisines. In contrast, several Asian cuisines consider Silkie meat a gourmet food. Chinese cuisine especially values the breed, {{but it is also}} a common ingredient in some Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Korean dishes. Areas where Chinese cuisine has been a strong influence, such as Malaysia, may also cook Silkie. As early as the 7th century, traditional Chinese medicine has held that chicken soup made with Silkie meat is a curative food. The usual methods of cooking include using Silkie to make broth, braising, and in curries. Traditional Chinese soup made with Silkie also uses ingredients such as wolfberries, Dioscorea polystachya (mountain yam), <b>orange</b> <b>peel,</b> and fresh ginger. A few fusion restaurants in metropolitan areas of the West have also cooked it as a part of traditional American or French cuisine, such as in confit.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Biosorption {{of heavy}} metal ions by {{different}} pectin rich {{materials such as}} waste citrus peels is emerging as a promising technique for metallic contaminant removal. While binding rate and capacity of citrus peels were previously investigated, {{there is a lack}} of mechanistic information about Pb-citrus pectin/peels interaction mechanisms. Present research focused on evaluating this binding mechanism by corroborating macroscopic studies with spectroscopic techniques. Citrus pectins of two different methoxylation degrees and <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> were characterized using potentiometric titrations and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Binding mechanisms were evaluated using molecular scale FTIR analyses. The effects of particle size, pH, co-ion presence, and background electrolyte concentrations were also investigated for biosorption of Pb by <b>orange</b> <b>peels.</b> Both citrus pectin and <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> reached their sorption equilibrium within 45 minutes. The maximum uptake capacity for <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> was found to be 2. 32 mmol/g. Citrus peels have very similar FTIR spectra to citrus pectin, suggesting that they have similar functional groups and pectin can be used as a model for citrus peels. Furthermore, carboxylic acid groups were found to be responsible for binding of Pb by citrus pectin and <b>orange</b> <b>peels...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} procedure {{was developed to}} extract pectin methylesterase (PME) from Valencia <b>orange</b> <b>peels.</b> <b>Orange</b> <b>peels</b> contain 25 - 34 μmol of COOH min- 1 g- 1 of peel PME activity. The enzyme was ionically bound to cell walls {{and could not be}} extracted with water. This enables removal of water soluble pectic substances and oils from peels via homogenization and washing with water before enzyme extraction. Enzyme extraction can be conducted simply by addition of suitable amounts of NaCl (optimum: 10 g of NaCl 100 g- 1 of extraction mixture) to peel homogenate and stirring (optimum: 30 min at 200 rpm). The PME extracted from <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> contains almost the same amount of heat-stable and heat-labile fraction, and the enzymes cannot be activated by mild heating. A slight activation of enzyme (almost 20 %) was achieved by adding 1 mM CaCl 2 to enzyme extracts, but this agent was inhibitory at higher concentrations. The extracts stabilized by Na-benzoate and K-sorbate maintained more than 90 % of their PME activity at 4 °C for at least 5 months. The obtained PME was successfully used to prepare low-methoxyl citrus pectin used in edible film formation in the presence of CaCl 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although, in Nigeria <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> are {{considered}} as a waste, this study is intended to convert the waste into wealth by establishing the production of biodiesel with oil obtained from orange peels; using transeterification process. Oil from sun-dried / ground <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> were extractedusing n-hexane. Transesterification process was done at a temperature range of 80 - 83 °C with oil to ethanol mole ratio of 1 : 3 respectively and sodium hydroxide as catalyst. The parameters analyzed included: Viscosity, Density and the concentrations of K, Na, Ca, Mg and P. The viscosity and density of the biodiesel obtained were 2. 1 stand 825 kg/m 3 respectively. The mean concentrations of K, Na, Ca, Mg and P in the biodiesel were 4 ppm, 7 ppm, 3 ppm, 3 ppm and 8 ppm respectively. These results are {{in close agreement with}} ASTM standards requirement for biodiesel. The glycerol was recycled trice before it finally lost potent. It is thus apparent that the locally-sourced feedstock (<b>orange</b> <b>peels)</b> would be a good source for the production of biodiesel...|$|R
