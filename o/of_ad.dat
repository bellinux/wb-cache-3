5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: There {{is little}} {{evidence}} to support whether interventions that engage patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF) in preparedness planning impacts completion <b>of</b> advance directives (<b>ADs).</b> This {{study was conducted to}} assess the impact of a palliative care intervention on health perceptions, attitudes, receipt of information and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>ADs,</b> discussion <b>of</b> <b>ADs</b> with family and physicians, and completion <b>of</b> <b>ADs</b> in a cohort of patients with symptomatic HF. Methods: Thirty-six patients hospitalized for HF decompensation were recruited and referred for an outpatient consultation with a palliative care specialist in conjunction with their routine HF follow-up visit after discharge; telephone interviews to assess health status and attitudes toward ADs were conducted before and 3 months after the initial consultation using an adapted version of the Advance Directive Attitude Survey (ADAS). Information pertaining to medical history and ADs was verified through medical chart abstraction. Results and Conclusion: The current study found support for enhancing attitudes and completion <b>of</b> <b>ADs</b> following a palliative care consultation in patients with symptomatic HF. Despite a significant increase in attitudes toward completion <b>of</b> <b>ADs</b> following the intervention, only 47 % of the participants completed ADs. This finding suggests that although education and understanding <b>of</b> <b>ADs</b> is important and can result in more positive attitudes, it does not translate to completion <b>of</b> <b>ADs</b> in all patients. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc...|$|R
5|$|At present, {{there is}} no {{definitive}} evidence to support that any particular measure is effective in preventing AD. Global studies of measures to prevent or delay the onset <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> have often produced inconsistent results.|$|E
5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk <b>of</b> <b>AD.</b> There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk <b>of</b> <b>AD.</b>|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{problems}} with Software Architecture Documents (ADs) 2 is the difficulty of finding in- formation required from them. Most existing studies focus on the production <b>of</b> <b>ADs</b> or Architectural Knowledge (AK) 3, {{to allow them to}} support information finding. However, there has been little focus placed on the consumption <b>of</b> <b>ADs.</b> To address this, we postulate the existence of a concept of “usage- based chunks”of architectural information discoverable from consumers’ usage <b>of</b> <b>ADs</b> when they engage in information-seeking tasks. In a set of user studies, we have found evidence that such usage-based chunks exist and that useful chunks can be identified from one type of usage data, namely, consumer’s ratings <b>of</b> sections <b>of</b> <b>ADs.</b> This has implications for tool design to support the effective reuse of AK...|$|R

40|$|Clickthrough {{rate and}} cost-per-click {{are known to}} be among the factors that impact the rank <b>of</b> an <b>ad</b> shown on a search result page. Hence, search engines can benefit from {{estimating}} ad clickthrough {{in order to determine the}} quality <b>of</b> <b>ads</b> and maximize their revenue. In this paper, a methodology is developed to estimate ad clickthrough rate by exploring user queries and clickthrough logs. As we demonstrate, the average ad clickthrough rate depends to a substantial extent on the rank position <b>of</b> <b>ads</b> and on the total number <b>of</b> <b>ads</b> displayed on the page. This observation is utilized by a baseline model to calculate the expected clickthrough rate for various ads. We further study the impact of query intent on the clickthrough rate, where query intent is predicted using a combination of query features and the content of search engine result pages. The baseline model and the query intent model are compared for the purpose of calculating the expected ad clickthrough rate. Our findings suggest that factors such as the rank <b>of</b> an <b>ad,</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>ads</b> displayed on the result page, and query intent are effective in estimating ad clickthrough rates. 1...|$|R
