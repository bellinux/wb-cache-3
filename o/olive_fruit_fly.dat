2500|$|Various pathologies {{can affect}} olives. The most serious pest is the <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> (Dacus oleae or Bactrocera oleae) which lays its {{eggs in the}} olive most {{commonly}} just before it becomes ripe in the autumn. The region surrounding [...] the puncture rots, becomes brown, and takes a bitter taste, making the olive unfit for eating or for oil. For controlling the pest, the practice has been to spray with insecticides (organophosphates, e.g. dimethoate). [...] Classic organic methods have now been applied such as trapping, applying the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, and spraying with kaolin. [...] Such methods are obligatory for organic olives.|$|E

40|$|The {{dispersal}} of marked, irradiated <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>flies</b> originating from a hybrid laboratory strain was studied in an olive groove {{located in the}} arid regions of southern Israel. Release–recapture experiments (eight in total) were conducted throughout a period of 5 months (July–December 2008). In each experiment, ca. 5000 flies were released. Recapture of flies was conducted using a grid of 30 yellow sticky traps set in expanding semicircles from the centre of release. Service of traps was conducted 3 and 15 days after the release. Fly quality and adult food type (only sucrose and protein + sucrose) before release was also investigated. Results point at an average dispersal distance of marked, irradiated olive flies of ca. 50 m. Pre-release adult diet did not affect dispersal ability. Fly recovery averaged ca. 3. 5 % during summer and ca. 1. 5 % during autumn. Most of the recovery concentrated during the first 3 days after releases, suggesting low survival of the released flies afterwards. As inferred from circular statistics, direction of dispersal was non-random with a significant directionality to the north-west.

40|$|Background: The thaumatin-like protein (TLP) Ole e 13 in raw <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> is {{responsible}} for occupational allergy in olive oil mill workers. However,these workers do not experience allergic symptoms after ingestion of edible olive. Objectives: To analyze the presence of IgE-reactive TLP in raw and edible <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> and to assess the allergenic potency of both sources. Methods: The content of TLP in raw and edible <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> protein extracts was analyzed using immunoblotting with sera from allergic patients and with olive TLP–specific IgG. The structural and immunological stability of TLP were assayed using immunoblotting after treatment of both raw olive and purified TLP with 0. 25 M NaOH solution for 24 hours. Olive pollen extract was investigated by immunoblotting for TLP content. Results: The TLP contained in raw <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> was not present in edible olives {{as a result of}} maceration before human consumption. No TLP was detected in olive pollen using specific IgG or sera from patients allergic to <b>olive</b> <b>fruit.</b> Sera from patients allergic to olive pollen did not react with purified TLP. Conclusions: IgE-reactive TLP is not present in edible olive, thus explaining the low number of patients allergic to this highly consumed fruit. Patients allergic to olive pollen are not sensitized to TLP and, therefore, not expected to be at risk of food allergy to <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> or TLP plant source...|$|R

50|$|Until the 1990s, {{the traps}} that have offered {{the best results}} were hand-crafted, made of wood soaked in a potent and {{long-lasting}} insecticide concentrate.

40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>fruit</b> {{structure}} and composition at harvest {{are the result of}} anatomical and developmental features. The <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> is a typical drupe consisting of internal stony endocarp, fleshy mesocarp, and external exocarp. The process of <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> development is critical for final yield and oil quality and it is the result of complex interactions between genetic, metabolic, hormonal and environmental factors. Although their common origin, the pericarp, the mesocarp and endocarp have a different developmental and metabolic behaviour. The endocarp reaches its final size earlier than the mesocarp and then its cells become lignified in contrast to the basically parenchymatic oil-storing cells of the mesocarp. The overall pattern of <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> growth is described by a double sigmoid curve although, under non limiting conditions of soil water availability, growth is almost linear during {{the central part of the}} summer. Changes in size, maturation, oil accumulation and quality are related to the cultivar, crop load, temperature, soil moisture, and cultural practices. All these factors affect fruit ripening and oil quality. The mechanisms of <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> development, including processes occurring at cellular and molecular levels are here reviewed to provide insights on how the fruit responds to changes in environmental conditions and cultural practices.

40|$|Phenolic {{composition}} of {{virgin olive oil}} {{is determined by the}} enzymatic and/or chemical reactions that take place during <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> processing.

The main goal {{of the present study was}} to characterize <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> β-glucosidase genes and enzymes responsible for the phenolic {{composition of}} virgin olive oil. To achieve that, we have isolated an olive β-glucosidase gene from cultivar Picual (OepGLU), expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and purified its corresponding recombinant enzyme. Western blot analysis showed that recombinant OepGLU protein is detected by an antibody raised against the purified native olive mesocarp β-glucosidase enzyme, and exhibits a deduced molecular mass of 65. 0 kDa. The recombinant OepGLU enzyme showed activity on the major olive phenolic glycosides, with the highest levels with respect to oleuropein, followed by ligstroside and demethyloleuropein. In addition, expression analysis showed that olive GLU transcript level in <b>olive</b> <b>fruit</b> is spatially and temporally regulated in a cultivar-dependent manner.
