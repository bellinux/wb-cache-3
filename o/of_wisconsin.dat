5|$|After the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{governors}} <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> {{served for}} two-year terms, but in 1967 {{the state constitution}} was amended to change this to four. Jeremiah McLain Rusk served one three-year term in the 1880s as the constitution was amended during his first term to move elections from odd to even years, and all officers were allowed to serve an extra year, rather than have their terms cut a year short. Patrick Lucey, elected in the 1970 election, was the first governor to serve a four-year term. Governors <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> are not term limited.|$|E
