A purified protein fraction derived from RB 51 (RB 51 brucellin) has been used as antigenic stimulus for whole blood. The test was evaluated for 300 days in ten heifers vaccinated at calfhood with 10 × 109 colony-forming units of RB 51 and in five control heifers. All animals came from <b>officially</b> <b>brucellosis-free</b> herds. Vaccinated animals started to give positive results from day 17 post vaccination (pv) until day 239 pv. All vaccinated animals gave a positive reaction at least once (with a stimulation index exceeding 2. 5).

Only at days 13 and 14 [*]pv the RB 51 -CFT showed 100 % sensitivity (credibility interval (CI) 76. 2 %– 100 %).

To acquire additional information on the VP 4 and VP 7 specificities of buffalo rotaviruses, a total of 125 fecal samples were collected from buffalo calves affected with diarrhoea, in seven dairy farms in Southern Italy. Rotaviruses were detected in 21 samples (16. 8 %) by an immunochromatographic assay and by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Analysis of the VP 7 gene revealed that 57 % (12 of 21) of the isolates were G 6, 23. 8 % were G 8 (5 of 21) and 19 % (4 of 21) were G 10. Analysis of the VP 4 revealed that 71. 4 % (15 of 21) of the isolates were P[5] and that 28. 6 % (6 of 21) were P[1].

40|$|Brucella {{species are}} obligate parasites having a {{preferred}} natural host {{that serves as}} a reservoir of the infection (Quinn et al., 1994). Infections by Brucellae have been found worldwide in a great variety of terrestrial wildlife species as well as a wide variety of marine mammals. It is important to distinguish between a spillover of infection from domestic animals and a sustainable infection in wild species (Godfroid, 2002). Some countries are considered to be <b>officially</b> <b>brucellosis-free</b> thanks to eradication programmes and monitoring. Wild animals, however, can be reservoirs of brucello-sis and sources of infection for domestic animals and humans (Szulowski and Pilaszek, 2000). The European hare (Lepus europaeus) and potentially the wild boar (Sus scrofa) are reservoirs of Brucella suis biotype 2 (Garin-Bastuji and Delcueillerie, 2001; Hubalek et al., 2002), which is considered to be non-pathogenic to humans. There is, however, a report of infection of a farmer by this biotype (Teyssou et al., 1989). As a disease occurring in nat-ural foci, it has a bi-component character spread-ing from one host to another by direct or indirect contact. Regarding this fact, the European hare brucellosis can be studied with respect to the host population density, ecological factors and types of habitats in the natural foci as well as long-term persistence in a given territory.

This study aimed to determine the epidemiological status of BVDV in <b>bovine</b> <b>herds</b> in the semiarid state of Paraíba, in northeastern Brazil, by determining the frequency of anti-BVDV antibodies and risk factors associated with the infection. We tested 359 cows from 20 farms. Three {{had a history of}} clinically suspected bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) or mucosal disease (MD), whereas the other 17 locations were randomly selected. Detection of anti-BVDV antibodies was performed by indirect ELISA using a commercial kit (IDEXX BVDV p 80 Ab Test). Risk factor analysis was performed in two steps, univariate and multivariate analysis. Seven samples were considered suspicious and were excluded from the analysis of seropositive animals. Of 352 animals, 141 (40. 1 %; CI 95 % = 34. 9 % – 45. 2 %) were seropositive. Of the 20 farms analyzed, 19 (95 %) had seropositive animals and the frequency of seropositivity per farm varied between 4. 5 % and 85. 7 %. The risk factors identified were as follows: area ? 120 hectares (OR = 3. 06; CI 9 5 % = 1. 43 – 6. 53), high animal density (OR = 3. 48; CI 95 % = 1. 24 - 9. 79), weaning age ? 60 days (OR = 10. 99; CI 95 % = 1. 31 - 91. 9), exchange of animals (OR = 4. 95; CI 95 % = 2. 08 - 11. 8), calf mortality > 5 % (OR = 2. 33; CI 95 % = 1. 07 - 5. 11), and use of natural breeding and artificial insemination (OR = 3. 06; CI 95 % = 1. 22 – 7. 67).

Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) is a disease of domestic and wild animals due to Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BoHV- 1). Both infections are associated with several economic losses worldwide. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the serological situation of both diseases using a commercial ELISA test in 45 herds sampling 1, 716 animals from 4 regions of Central Italy, where voluntary eradication program for IBR was planed. In addition, the BVDV seronegative animals were tested with an antigen capture ELISA (AgELISA-IDEXX) to identify PI animals. 26. 3 % and 25. 5 % of samples were positive respectively for IBR and BVD, meanwhile both antibodies were detected in 10. 7 % sera. All the BVDV seronegative animals were negative to AgELISA. PI animals are the principal source of infection in a farm, but viral transmission can occur also in their absence, as demonstrated by the serological results obtained in this work. The results demonstrate that IBR and BVDV are highly diffused in <b>bovine</b> <b>herds</b> of Central Italy, and the application of voluntary eradication programs is needful to contain further diffusion of the infection and to reduce the economic losses...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} mastitis infection {{on the quality of}} milk composition in small-scale dairy <b>bovine</b> <b>herds.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to find a milk quality somatic cell count (SCC) standard that could be used as an integral component of a control program. In all, 396 quarter milk samples from lactating cross-bred cows (Holstein & Zebu) were analyzed; 56 % of these quarters were experiencing intramammary infection, with an overall mean SCC of 5. 46 × 105 ± 2. 30 × 104 cells/ml. Infected quarters had significantly (p < 0. 05) higher mean SCC levels (6. 19 × 105 ± 4. 40 × 104 cells/ml) compared to healthy quarters (2. 65 × 105 ± 2. 40 × 104 cells/ml). In high SCC milk and infected quarters, the concentrations of non-casein fractions, sodium, chloride, and free fatty acid were higher (p < 0. 05), while the casein content, lactose, casein-to-total protein, potassium, and calcium were lower (p < 0. 05) compared to normal quarters. These findings suggest a mean SCC threshold limit of 5. 46 × 105 cells/ml for the region. It was concluded that the results could be used to propose a milk quality SCC standard that can be used as an integral component of a control program...|$|R
40|$|Santa Catarina is {{the only}} Brazilian state that does not immunize the <b>bovine</b> <b>herd</b> against {{foot and mouth disease}}. This article {{discusses}} the policy adopted for the foot and mouth disease in Santa Catarina, especially the non-vaccination, and relates this policy with ethical, human and animal welfare issues. Nine representatives of agricultural institutions in the state were interviewed, as well as, in a case study, seven families of farmers in Jóia - Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where foot and mouth disease occurred in 2000, leading to the sacrifice of 11, 067 animals, most of them dairy animals. The majority of the agricultural institutions in Santa Catarina are contrary to vaccination, in order to keep and extend pig and poultry export markets. Concerns on social repercussions tended to concentrate on the effects on the income of the affected families. The case study in Jóia demonstrated that the life styles of the affected farmers were deeply harmed due to effects on human mental health, loss of income and changes in the local economy. The study concludes that the experience of a foot and mouth disease outbreak results in traumatic and long term consequences {{and that there is a}} need for policies that include social, ethical and environmental provisions, once animal welfare aspects and impacts on other areas of the economy are not contemplated in the public policy of animal sanitary defense...|$|R
40|$|An ecopathological {{approach}} for examining nutrition-induced health disorders in dairy herds in France is described. <b>Bovine</b> dairy <b>herds</b> were surveyed for 4 yr to detect nutritional risk factors that discriminated {{between high and}} low disease incidence rates for retained placenta, milk fever, calf perimortality, metritis, liver disorders and infertility. In the cow, preventive feeding helps avoid nitrogen overnutrition, and reduces the requirements of Ca in the late gestation period, gives a satisfactory balance in polyunsaturated fatty acids before calving. The absence of feedstuffs including toxic components and a feeding system with few feedstuffs and few diet changes are also beneficial factors...|$|R
