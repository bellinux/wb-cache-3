40|$|<b>Optoacoustic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is a {{relatively}} old technique first described by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881. However, over the intervening years, little use {{was made of the}} technique due to its low sensitivity. This was due to low source intensities of available infrared light sources which limited the optoacoustic signal strength. With the advent of laser infrared light sources in the 1960 's, there has been a resurgence of interest in optoacoustics. No longer is low source intensity a major limitation to successful <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> Although adequate infrared light sources are available, the large window background signal observed in all optoacoustic systems has been the major limitation in extending trace gas detection limits to the ppb or sub-ppb level.

This work will discuss a new windowless cell design that largely eliminates the signal background problem ubiquitous to all presently available optoacoustic cells.

The similarity in Φ 610 and in the determined value of the energy level of S 610, E 610 =(142 ± 12) kJ/mol for SRI-WT and SRI-D 76 N indicates that Asp 76 is not directly involved in the first step of the phototransformation. The increase with pH of the magnitude of the structural volume change for {{the formation of}} S 610 in SRI-WT and in SRI-D 76 N upon excitation with 580 nm indicates also that amino acids other than Asp 76, and other than those related to the Schiff base, are involved in the process. The difference in structural volume changes as well as differences in the activation parameters for the S 610 decay should be attributed to differences in the rigidity of the cavity surrounding the chromophore. Except for the decay of the first intermediate, which is faster than in the SRI-transducer complex, the rate constants of the photocycle for transducer-free SRI in detergent suspension are strongly retarded with respect to wild-type membranes (this comparison should be done with great care because the preparation of both samples is very different) ...|$|E

We applied LIOAS to biological photoreceptors, as well as to model systems, with the purpose of understanding the origin of ∆V in electron-transfer (ET) reactions in those systems. The linear correlation between the counterion-dependent volume changes and ∆H for the free-radical formation upon ET quenching of erythrosin dianion triplet, 3 Er 2 –, by Mo(CN) 8 4 – and of Ru(bpy) 3 2 + by MV 2 + is interpreted in terms of an enthalpy–entropy compensation owing to the strong influence of the counterions on the water hydrogen-bond network in which the reactants are embedded. The relatively large entropic term determined for radical formation thus originates in water rearrangements during the process. The increasing contraction in acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, and valeronitrile for the ET quenching of 3 Zn-tetraphenylporphin by 1, 4 -benzoquinone is understood by considering the increasing interaction strength between the electron-pair donor nitriles and ZnTPP +.

40|$|The {{quenching}} of zinc tetraphenylporphine by {{oxygen and}} 1, 4 - benzoquinone was studied using laser-induced <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> in a homologous series of aprotic nitrile solvents consisting of acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, and valeronitrile. An inverse correlation {{exists between the}} oxygen quenching efficiency of triplet state zinc tetraphenylporphine and the efficiency of singlet oxygen formation, against solvent polarity, {{in agreement with the}} accepted involvement of a charge transfer complex during the quenching process. No structural volume change was observed for the triplet state formation of zinc tetraphenylporphine using the nitrile variation method, whereas electron transfer between zinc tetraphenylporphine and 1, 4 -benzoquinone resulted in a volume contraction in the four nitrile solvents used. Specific solute solvent interaction, in addition to electrostriction, is needed to fully understand the relatively large and solvent dependent structural volume change observed in the longer chain nitriles. This is due to the varying interaction strength between the electron-pair donor nitriles and the ZnTPP cation as one moves across the solvent series. The free energy of the electron transfer was, however, very similar within the solvent series. The effect of a specific solute solvent interaction on the rate of electron transfer is unclear at the moment since the latter is found to be limited by the solvent relaxation time, which is much shorter than the time window of the experiments...|$|E
40|$|More than 40 {{different}} molecules {{have been}} observed in Interstellar space within the Galaxy. Many of these molecules are seen near hot OB-type stars whose far-ultraviolet emission is intense. Laboratory spectroscopy of such molecules {{will lead to a}} better understanding of their astrophysical behaviour, in particular Celestial Masers. This thesis is preoccupied with the spectroscopy of H_ 2 O, D_ 2 O, OH, CO, and C_ 2 H_ 2 in the region 1200 Å- 400 Å and absolute absorption coefficients are derived for CO and C_ 2 H_ 2 using the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn Sum Rule. A possible Rydberg series of OH was observed, converging to a first ionisation potential of 13. 36 eV and a likely inner shell two-electron resonance detected in the ionisation continuum of D_ 2 O at 415 Å. Both a synchrotron and a laser produced plasma continuum source were used for absorption measurements and the advantages of each source were compared. Experiments were undertaken to examine the radiation properties of laser produced plasmas with a view to their general use as far-ultraviolet continuum sources and a computer program was written to predict their net photon emission by Bremsstrahlung processes, with some success. <b>Optoacoustic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> was considered as a possible technique in the far-ultraviolet with a synchrotron source; its theory was extended to include ionisation and dissociation of molecules. However, optoacoustic experiments attempted were unsuccessful because of insufficient light intensity and excessive background noise near the synchrotron...|$|E
40|$|The photocycle of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) {{isolated}} from Ectothiorhodospira halophila was analyzed by flash photolysis with absorption detection at low excitation photon densities and by temperature-dependent laser-induced <b>optoacoustic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (LIOAS). The quantum yield for the bleaching recovery of PYP, {{assumed to be}} identical to that for the phototransformation of PYP (pG), to the red-shifted intermediate, pR, was phi R = 0. 35 +/- 0. 05, {{much lower than the}} value of 0. 64 reported in the literature. With this value and the LIOAS data, an energy content for pR of 120 kJ/mol was obtained, approximately 50 % lower than for excited pG. Concomitant with the photochemical process, a volume contraction of 14 ml/photoconverted mol was observed, comparable with the contraction (11 ml/mol) determined for the bacteriorhodopsin monomer. The contraction in both cases is interpreted to arise from a protein reorganization around a phototransformed chromophore with a dipole moment {{different from that of the}} initial state. The deviations from linearity of the LIOAS data at photon densities > 0. 3 photons per molecule are explained by absorption by pG and pR during the laser pulse duration (i. e., a four-level system, pG, pR, and their respective excited states). The data can be fitted either by a simple saturation process or by a photochromic equilibrium between pG and pR, similar to that established between the parent chromoprotein and the first intermediate(s) in other biological photoreceptors. This nonlinearity has important consequences for the interpretation of the data obtained from in vitro studies with powerful lasers...|$|E
