Construction work was broken into several specialized lots that were contracted separately.

A fourth group <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> was for track work.|$|E

5|$|Due to the Soviet {{principles}} of urban planning, Žirmūnai, {{according to the}} 2001 census data, was among the three Vilnius elderates (the other two being Karoliniškės and Viršuliškės) with the lowest percentage of single-family housing in the city (0.1%). Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of individual housing, 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments. The scarcity <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> means {{that the number of}} single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, {{there were only a few}} modern single-family houses in Žirmūnai.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, the Indiana General Assembly {{approved}} {{construction of}} a new statehouse. The building was to be funded by the sale <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> of land in Indianapolis. A commission was established and Commissioner James Blake offered a $150 prize to the architect who could design the best statehouse. The firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis created the winning design. Their plans were for a structure that was inspired by the ancient Greek Parthenon. The building looked very much like the Parthenon except for a large central dome. Town and Davis was awarded the contract to construct the building, and completed it ahead of schedule in 1835.|$|E

The draw resulted in Hou picking the White pieces, meaning that all players in the women's section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will be White in the first round; and Kramnik picking the Black pieces, meaning that all players in the open section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will have the Black pieces in the opening round.|$|E
