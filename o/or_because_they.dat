5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|Many {{believe that}} person {{might benefit from}} {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and not based on good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses bring {{captured}} prey {{back to the}} den {{where they}} can eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share the den with the octopus, either because they have arrived as scavengers, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have survived capture.|$|E

5|$|Others are obscure {{because of}} the damnatio memoriae {{surrounding}} the lives of antipopes, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were refused burial due to excommunication. Some of those can be presumed to have been buried unceremoniously in the monasteries to which the antipopes were confined after submitting or losing power. The exception is Hippolytus of Rome, the first antipope, who was translated to Rome by his former rival Pope Fabian following his martyrdom, and {{is regarded as a}} saint.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2007). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{are unlikely to be}} declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. When last assessed in 2007, the population trend was stable.|$|E
5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E

5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{players who}} participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl elected to delay their entry into the NFL Draft, either because they hoped to finish their {{education}} <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were not three years removed from their high school graduations and thus were not eligible to enter the draft. Examples of these players included Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to Florida State to complete his senior year, and Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who was not eligible to enter the draft in 2000, but who was taken with the first overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, the Persian fleet {{should have}} held the {{advantage}} at sea, since the Athenian {{part of the}} Greek fleet was, despite their efforts at Artemisium and Salamis, still raw in seamanship. However, whether because of their low morale, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were in fact outnumbered, the Persians sought instead the tactical advantage of joining up with the army under Tigranes, and fortifying a position. However, when the Greeks chose to fight on land, the Persians then threw away the advantage of their fortifications by emerging to fight the Greeks in the open field. Furthermore, as Marathon and Thermopylae had shown, large numbers conferred little advantage against the more heavily armoured hoplites; thus, as the battle began, it was the Greeks who had the tactical upper hand.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} {{to build the}} infrastructure necessary to support electric vehicles {{is illustrated by the}} decision of Car2Go in San Diego, California, that due to insufficient charging infrastructure decided to replace all of its all-electric car fleet with gasoline-powered cars starting on 1 May 2016. When the carsharing service started in 2011, Car2Go expected 1,000 charging stations to be deployed around the city, but only 400 were in place by early 2016. As a result, an average of 20% of the carsharing fleet is unavailable at any given time because the cars are either being charged <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> don’t have enough electricity in them to be driven. Also, many of the company’s 40,000 San Diego members say they often worry their Car2Go will run out of charge before they finish their trip.|$|E
5|$|The stave churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

5|$|In October 1939, {{conscription}} {{was introduced}} to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF. From January 1940, all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service. While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military, the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service. A side effect of this arrangement {{was the creation of}} two different armies with different conditions of service, one the part-volunteer part-conscript Militia and the other the all-volunteer AIF. This situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout the war, as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between the men of the two forces. Later, provision was made to allow Militia units to transfer to the AIF if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under AIF terms of service. This required 65 percent of a unit's war establishment—or 75 percent of its actual strength—to volunteer and allowed whole battalions {{to become part of the}} AIF.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 2014, the admin of {{the page}} {{announced}} his retirement on Facebook. He stated that he was leaving the page for personal reasons, but that Valor por Tamaulipas would continue under new management. That person, he said, had some relationship with law enforcement. The admin believes {{that this would be}} of benefit for the cyber community because it would allow for citizen reports to reach law enforcement directly. The admin also announced that the pages Responsabilidad, Fortaleza, and Valor por la Huasteca would go under new management too. The new management would be composed of people who he deemed trustworthy given their long history of support <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had suffered a loss {{as a result of the}} violence. In a closing statement, he bid farewell by thanking God for bringing happiness to his personal and professional life. In the comment section of the Facebook post, many people thanked the admin for his support. Some of them, however, expressed their concerned with the new administration given his/her relationship with the government.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October, SAO Krajina police picked up 53 civilians in Hrvatska Dubica. Most of them were Croats, but there were several Serbs and Muslims by nationality. They were told they were being taken to a meeting, but they were {{detained}} under armed guard in the town's fire station. During the day, eleven people escaped or were released, either because they were Serbs <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had Serb relatives. On 21 October, SAO Krajina forces moved 43 detainees from Hrvatska Dubica. The detainees were placed on a bus and told {{that they would be}} taken to Glina and released in a prisoner exchange. However the group, all of them Croats except for two Serbs, were taken to Krečane and killed. In the same period, an additional 24 civilians from villages around Hrvatska Dubica were killed by Serb forces at unknown locations.|$|E

5|$|Several {{accounts}} about Murrell's {{activities have}} been preserved, {{either because they}} were reported on by the regional press <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were passed down in oral tradition. One example focused around a rumour that had spread in nearby Canewdon which claimed that two prominent local women were malevolent witches. One of these individuals was Mary Ann Atkinson, {{the wife of the}} Reverend William Atkinson, the vicar of Canewdon. The other was Eliza Lodwick, a widow who took control of the 500 acre Lambourne Hall following the death of her husband in 1826; on two separate occasions labourers were convicted of stealing from her, while another died accidentally on her property. Locals concerned that these women were witches approached the vicar with their beliefs, but he dismissed them. They subsequently turned to Murrell, asking for his aid in exposing the women as witches. According to claims made in the 1950s by the-then 94-year-old local man Arthur Downes, the Canewdon villagers believed that Murrell could force all of the witches to assemble and dance about the churchyard against their will by whistling. However, the vicar intervened, with locals believing that he was doing so to protect his wife. The vicar himself died in March 1847.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{had formed}} a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They {{believed}} that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E
5|$|The diplosegments of millipedes {{have evolved}} in {{conjunction}} with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; bulldozing, wedging and boring. Members of the orders Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, lower their heads and barge {{their way into the}} substrate, the collum being the portion of their exoskeleton that leads the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order Polyzoniida. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs, the wedge-shaped body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are too large to make the effort worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively fast (for a millipede) and are active predators.|$|E
