5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> seat in a special election.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, the 1995 season started on April 25, and was shortened to 144 games instead of the normal 162. California took an early lead in the AL West standings and traded first place with Texas through May and June. They took the lead on July 2, and held <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> lead throughout the rest of July and all of August. Seattle, meanwhile, spent most of June through August in third or fourth place. They would bottom out on August 2, 13 games out of first place.|$|E
5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest {{was in the}} work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation's literature. With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.|$|E

25|$|One running gag has Sergeant Snorkel hanging helplessly from a {{small tree}} branch after having fallen off a cliff (first time August 16, 1956). While he is never shown falling off, or even walking {{close to the edge}} of a cliff, he always seems to hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> same branch, yelling for help. This gag may have spawned the segment of the children's show Between the Lions {{featuring}} a person named Cliff Hanger, who, like Sergeant Snorkel, is hanging from a cliff in each feature.|$|E
25|$|To {{start the}} series, Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury shut-out Tampa Bay 3–0 in game one, with the Lightning {{responding}} with a 5–1 win in game two. Unfortunately for the Lightning, they dropped games {{three and four}} (game four in double overtime), only to answer with a huge 8–2 victory in Pittsburgh, forcing a game six at home that ended 4–2 in favour of Tampa Bay. In game seven, Lightning forward Sean Bergenheim scored about five minutes into the second period. The Lightning managed to hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> 1–0 lead, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals.|$|E

Michael Rasmussen and Alberto Contador traded attack after attack from the group they had been in, catching most of the early break, finishing in the top ten of the stage, and gaining time over other contenders such as Cadel Evans, Levi Leipheimer, Andreas Klöden, and Carlos Sastre, who were left in the remnants of the group they had left.|$|E

500|$|Although Big Star's first era {{came to an}} end in 1974, {{the band}} {{acquired}} a cult following in the 1980s when new acts began to acknowledge the early material's significance. R.E.M.'s Peter Buck admitted, [...] "We've sort of flirted with greatness, but we've yet to make a record as good as Revolver or Highway 61 Revisited or Exile on Main Street or Big Star's Third. I don't know what it'll take to push us <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> level, but I think we've got it in us." [...] Chilton, however, told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "I'm constantly surprised that people fall for Big Star the way they do... People say Big Star made some of the best rock 'n roll albums ever. [...] And I say they're wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Pragmatic {{directions}} provide {{children with}} {{additional information about}} the speaker's intended meaning. Children's learning of new word meanings is guided by the pragmatic directions that adults offer, such as explicit links to word meanings. Adults present young children with information about how words are {{related to each other}} through connections, such as [...] "is a part of", [...] "is a kind of", [...] "belongs to", or [...] "is used for". These pragmatic directions provide children with essential information about language, allowing them to make inferences about possible meanings for unfamiliar words. This is also called inclusion. When children are provided with two words related by inclusion, they hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> information. When children hear an adult say an incorrect word, and then repair their mistake by stating the correct word, children take into account the repair when assigning meanings to the two words.|$|E
500|$|Creator Tim Schafer {{has said}} that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, [...] "The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen years ago. I was riding a bus, {{thinking}} about a game that would be the complete opposite of what we were working on, The Secret of Monkey Island [...] And Brütal Legend leapt into my head. I've been hanging <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> name ever since." [...] The title, which he describes as sounding [...] "like the hardest core fantasy thing out there", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of Psychonauts (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.|$|E

500|$|Jim Bambra of White Dwarf {{reviewed}} the adventure in the magazine's [...] "Open Box" [...] feature {{and gave it}} an overall rating of 5 out of 10, commenting that while presentation of the module was quite good (8/10), {{it seemed to be}} [...] "hastily thrown together". [...] Bambra gave the adventure playability and enjoyment ratings of 5/10, and skill and complexity ratings of 6/10. [...] He felt the adventure was [...] "very mundane" [...] and [...] "lacks any real cohesion". [...] Bambra noted that parts of the adventure were created for tournament play. [...] The tournament section deals with getting into the city, and he felt the rest of the module seemed to be tacked <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> [...] He did like the mini-campaign included in the adventure, and the ideas included on how to expand on it. [...] However, he felt that any Dungeon Master who used Dwellers of the Forbidden City would have to expend so much effort to make it more than [...] "just a series of encounters," [...] that they were better off [...] "starting from scratch". Bambra concluded that this adventure was [...] "just not worth considering" [...] with all the other better quality modules available from TSR.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "State Commission for the Free {{transfer}} of the Civilian Population" [...] or [...] "Commission for the Exchange of Population" [...] was created and headed by Vojkan Đurković, a Major in the SDG, and included Mauzer's Panthers. Its purpose was to completely expel all non-Serbs from Bijeljina. Đurković claimed that the Bosniaks had left voluntarily and said Bijeljina was [...] "sacred Serbian land". According to him [...] "after a time, the [...] People's Deputies, Milan Teslić and Vojo Kuprešanin, expanded the Commission {{in the name of}} the [...] Deputies Club, and later the Commission was approved by the Parliament of the Serbian Republic [...]" [...] He explained that [...] "travel [...] was undertaken in the following manner: the State Commission for the Free Transfer of the Civilian Population had as its duty to inform the State Security Service of the Serbian Republic [...] (Republika Srpska) of that travel. The latter, by fax, would then pass that <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> ministry in the Republic of Serbia which has jurisdiction. The transit [...] would occur in broad daylight, at noon." [...] Expulsions continued into 1994, and in July a [...] "systematic program" [...] was implemented with the goal of [...] "expelling the remaining Bosniaks and extorting property and money from them". Đurković was promoted by Arkan to Lieutenant Colonel in 1995. Mauzer's Panthers later became a special unit of the VRS. Mauzer was killed in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Also in November 2006, Billboard {{magazine}} was {{curious as to}} why the artist is credited as just his first name, [...] "Yusuf" [...] rather than [...] "Yusuf Islam". His response was [...] "Because 'Islam' doesn't have to be sloganised. The second name is like the official tag, but you call a friend by their first name. It's more intimate, and to me that's the message of this record." [...] As for why the album sleeve says [...] "the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens", he responded, [...] "That's the tag with which most people are familiar; for recognition purposes I'm not averse to that. For a lot of people, it reminds them of something they want to hold <b>on</b> <b>to.</b> <b>That</b> name is part of my history {{and a lot of the}} things I dreamt about as Cat Stevens have come true as Yusuf Islam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{recording}} of the album, The Byrds' record producer, Gary Usher, who had worked on the band's three previous albums, had been fired by Columbia Records for spending too much money on {{the recording}} of the Chad & Jeremy album, [...] Of Cabbages and Kings. [...] Faced {{with the need to}} find a replacement producer, The Byrds elected to bring in Bob Johnston, who had been Bob Dylan's producer since 1965. [...] Ultimately, the band were unhappy with Johnston's production work on Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde and as a result, it was the only Byrds' album to be produced by him. [...] However, Johnston was employed once more as the band's producer on their May 1969 non-album single, [...] "Lay Lady Lady". [...] He incurred the band's wrath, however, by overdubbing a female choir <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> recording, allegedly without The Byrds' consent. [...] When the single then stalled at number 132 on the Billboard charts the band decided that they would not work with Johnston again.|$|E
