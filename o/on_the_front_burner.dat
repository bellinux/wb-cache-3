Case closed for everybody except Joe Leaphorn, retired Legendary Lieutenant of the Navajo Tribal Police, whoâ€™s always wondered what became of Dentonâ€™s beautiful young wife Linda, who vanished the day of the killing. Now a second murder has put the case back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>burner.</b> Officer Bernadette Manuelito has discovered the body of Thomas Doherty, a Forest Service employee who had his old interest in the Golden Calf, in his truck. Trouble is, Bernie didnâ€™t realize Doherty was a murder victim and allowed the crime scene to get so trampled that the Apache County Sheriffâ€™s Department has grabbed the case away from the Tribal Police. Donâ€™t worry about Bernie, though. Before Sgt. Jim Chee, whoâ€™s awfully attached to her, can work out a way to cover her misstep, sheâ€™s already found the place where Doherty was killedâ€”and begun an investigation that will link both murders to the rumors of a spectral wailing woman at Fort Wingate the Halloween night that Denton shot McKay.Top-notch detective work by all hands, a solution fully worthy of the puzzle, and all the hard-won wisdom on cultural clashes between Navajos and whites youâ€™d expect from Hillerman (Hunting Badger, 2000, etc.).|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} metrics of airflow, sound, and {{combustion product}} capture efficiency (CE) were measured for {{a convenience sample}} of fifteen cooking exhaust devices, as installed in residences. Results were analyzed to quantify the impact of various device- and installation-dependent parameters on CE.

Above-the-cooktop devices with flat bottom surfaces (no capture hood) â€“ including exhaust fan/microwave combination appliances â€“ were found to have much lower CE at similar flow rates, compared to devices with capture hoods. For almost all exhaust devices and especially for rear-mounted downdraft exhaust and microwaves, CE was substantially higher for back compared with <b>front</b> <b>burner</b> use. Flow rate, {{and the extent to which}} the exhaust device extends over the burners that are in use, also had a large effect on CE.
