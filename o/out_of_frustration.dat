The {{launching}} of TBS {{followed in the}} wake of the 1968 historic strike at San Francisco State University, which involved thousands of students and faculty, including Chrisman and Hare, in a prolonged and sometimes violent struggle with the administration and the state. The strike, one of the longest of its kind in the US, lasted for five months and grew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> black students and instructors who wanted the university to establish an independent Black Studies department.|$|R
50|$|KAF Radio 107.9 grew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> piped-in, {{satellite}} radio aboard the facility. The only Westernized options before KAF Radio 107.9 was Armed Forces Network and Canadian Forces channels playing pop-rock {{and various other}} formats depending {{on the day of}} the week and time of the day.

The film is test screened to a horrible reception. Lisa convinces Bart to remove all of the parts the audience did not like, thus making the Angry Dad a short film.

5|$|Sunderland opened {{negotiations}} to sign Bent in July 2009. The deal seemed delayed and through social networking website Twitter he accused club chairman Daniel Levy of disrupting his move to Sunderland, although Bent later apologised, saying he acted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frustration.</b> He travelled to Sunderland to {{sign for the}} club after they agreed a fee with Tottenham, and after passing a medical, Bent signed for Sunderland on 5 August for an initial fee of £10million plus potential additional payments, which later rose to £16.5million.

He scored a brace in the 4–1 win over Hull City to give himself his third and fourth goals in five matches.|$|E
5|$|Starship Troopers had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley's 1984 novel Armor was, according to the author, born <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frustration</b> with {{the small amount of}} actual combat in Starship Troopers and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The 1988 Gainax OVA series Gunbuster has plot elements similar to Heinlein's novel, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in Ender's Game to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states that the story of Ender Wiggin takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.|$|E

5000|$|The central {{goal of the}} Sakdalistas was simple: {{they wanted}} {{complete}} and immediate independence from the United States of America, which they believed {{would be the most}} effective means towards the alleviation of crippling taxation. [...] The movement was born <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frustrations</b> with corruption and inequality. Benigno Ramos described these sentiments in a December 1930 editorial: [...] "In Manila we see our so-called leaders growing fat and rich on money amassed from taxing the poor. They have fine automobiles and fine homes for themselves, but for us they have only fine and empty words. They have learned to promise as much as the Americans and to deliver as little." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{victims are}} {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; {{one is in}} the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out, with no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable to unlock the steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he leaves <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frustration.</b> Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E

Near the end of the match, Benoit tried to pin Angle after a diving headbutt but was met with a two-count. Angle then quickly rolled-up up Benoit, using the tights for leverage to win the match.|$|E
