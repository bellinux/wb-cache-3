40|$|Ideal coating {{materials}} for implants {{should be able}} to induce excellent osseointegration, which requires several important parameters, such as good bonding strength, limited inflammatory reaction, balanced osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis, to gain well-functioning coated implants with long-term life span after implantation. Bioactive elements, like Sr, Mg and Si, have been found to play important roles in regulating the biological responses. It is of great interest to combine bioactive elements for developing bioactive coatings on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V orthopedic implants to elicit multidirectional effects on the osseointegration. In this study, Sr, Mg and Si-containing bioactive Sr 2 MgSi 2 O 7 (SMS) ceramic coatings on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were successfully prepared by plasma-spray coating method. The prepared SMS coatings have significantly higher bonding strength (~ 37 MPa) than conventional pure hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings (mostly in the range of 15 - 25 MPa). It was also found that the prepared SMS coatings switch the macrophage phenotype into M 2 extreme, inhibiting the inflammatory reaction via the inhibition of Wnt 5 A/Ca 2 + and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways of macrophages. In addition, the <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities</b> were also inhibited by SMS coatings. The expression of osteoclastogenesis related genes (RANKL and MCSF) in bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells (BMSCs) with the involvement of macrophages was decreased, while OPG expression was enhanced on SMS coatings compared to HA coatings, indicating that SMS coatings also downregulated the osteoclastogenesis. However, the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs with the involvement of macrophages was comparable between SMS and HA coatings. Therefore, the prepared SMS coatings showed multidirectional effects, such as improving bonding strength, reducing inflammatory reaction and downregulating <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities,</b> but maintaining a comparable osteogenesis, as compared with HA coatings. The combination of bioactive elements of Sr, Mg and Si into bioceramic coatings can be a promising method to develop bioactive implants with multifunctional properties for orthopaedic application...|$|R

The simulation results suggested that decreasing osteocyte density could cause spongy bone loss in healthy old adults, and reduction in osteocyte mechanosensitivity might contribute to excessive bone loss in osteoporotic bones. In the second study, we extended Huiskes et al. 's theory for overloading condition with respect to clinical findings and proposed a 3 D FE model. It was the first 3 D simulation which showed the spongy bone loss caused by overload.

Using cell-based and murine genetics approaches, we show that this activity of the {{sympathetic nervous system}} requires osteopontin (OPN), a cytokine {{and one of the}} major members of the noncollagenous extracellular matrix proteins of bone. In this work, we found that the stimulation of the sympathetic tone by isoproterenol increased the level of OPN expression in the plasma and bone and that mice lacking OPN (OPN-KO) suppressed the isoproterenol-induced bone loss by preventing reduced osteoblastic and enhanced <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities.</b> In addition, we found that OPN is necessary for changes in the expression of genes related to bone resorption and bone formation that are induced by activation of the sympathetic tone. At the cellular level, we showed that intracellular OPN modulated the capacity of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor to generate cAMP with a corresponding modulation of cAMP-response element binding (CREB) phosphorylation and associated transcriptional events inside the cell. Our results indicate that OPN plays a critical role in sympathetic tone regulation of bone mass and that this OPN regulation is taking place through modulation of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor/cAMP signaling system...|$|R

Accordingly, weightlessness conditions during space flight accelerate bone loss and experimental models in real and simulated microgravity show decreased osteoblastic and increased <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities.</b> It is well known that the endothelium and bone cells cross-talk and this intercellular communication is vital to regulate bone homeostasis. Because microgravity promotes microvascular endothelial dysfunction, we anticipated that the molecular cross-talk between endothelial cells exposed to simulated microgravity and osteoblasts might be altered. Results. We cultured human microvascular endothelial cells in simulated microgravity using the rotating wall vessel device developed by NASA. Endothelial cells in microgravity show growth inhibition and release higher amounts of matrix metalloproteases type 2 and interleukin- 6 than controls. Conditioned media collected from microvascular endothelial cells in simulated microgravity were used to culture human osteoblasts and were shown to retard osteoblast proliferation and inhibit their activity. Discussion. Microvascular endothelial cells in microgravity are growth retarded and release high amounts of matrix metalloproteases type 2 and interleukin- 6, which might play a role in retarding the growth of osteoblasts and impairing their osteogenic activity. Conclusions. We demonstrate that since simulated microgravity modulates microvascular endothelial cell function, it indirectly impairs osteoblastic function...|$|R

In this study, we investigated the modulatory effects of nanoporous anodic alumina with different sized pores on macrophage responses and their subsequent effects on the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). The nanopore structure and the pore size {{were found to be}} important adhesive cues for macrophages, which affected their spreading and cell shape, subsequently regulated the expression and activation of autophagy pathway components (LC 3 A/B, Beclin- 1, Atg 3, Atg 7, and P 62) and modulated the inflammatory response, <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities,</b> and release of osteogenic factors. Subsequently, the osteogenic pathways (Wnt and BMP) of BMSCs were found to be regulated by different nanopore-induced inflammatory environments, which affected the osteogenic differentiation outcomes.

Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} advance the applications of nanotopography with respect to its osteoimmunomodulatory properties, aiming to shed further light on this field. We found that tuning the surface chemistry (amine or acrylic acid) and scale of the nanotopography (16, 38, and 68 nm) significantly modulated the osteoimmune environment, including changes in the expression of inflammatory cytokines, <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities,</b> and osteogenic, angiogenic, and fibrogenic factors. The generated osteoimmune environment significantly affected the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells, with carboxyl acid-tailored 68 nm surface nanotopography offering the most promising outcome.

It has therefore become important to endow the implant materials with immunomodulatory properties favouring osteogenesis and osseointegration. Strontium, zinc and silicon are bioactive elements that have important roles in bone metabolism and that also elicit significant immune responses. In this study, Sr-, Zn- and Si-containing bioactive Sr 2 ZnSi 2 O 7 (SZS) ceramic coatings on Ti– 6 Al– 4 V were successfully prepared by a plasma-spray coating method. The SZS coatings exhibited slow release of the bioactive ions with significantly higher bonding strength than hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings. SZS-coated Ti– 6 Al– 4 V elicited significant effects on the immune cells, inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis-enhancing factors, while upregulating the expression of osteogenic factors of macrophages; moreover, it could also inhibit the <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities.</b> The RANKL/RANK pathway, which enhances osteoclastogenesis, was inhibited by the SZS coatings, whereas the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) was significantly enhanced by the SZS coatings/macrophages conditioned medium, probably via the activation of BMP 2 pathway.

The protective effect of BCA on bone loss in an ovariectomized (OVX) animal model has never been clarified. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the biological effects of BCA on bone loss in OVX rats in vivo and on the development of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vitro. Ovariectomy resulted in a marked increase in body weight and a decrease in femoral bone mineral density and trabecular bone volume that was prevented by BCA or 17 β-estradiol (E 2) treatment. However, an increase in uterine weight was observed in E 2 -treated OVX rats, but not in response to BCA treatment. Treatment with BCA increased the mRNA expression of osterix, collagen type I, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin and decreased the mRNA expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) /osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio in the femur of OVX rats. Treatment with BCA or E 2 prevented the OVX-induced increase in urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) and serum tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β). In vitro, BCA induced preosteoblasts to differentiate into osteoblasts and increased osteoblast mineralization. BCA inhibited preosteoclasts and osteoclast proliferation and decreased osteoclast bone resorption.

Given the relevance of cell-matrix interactions and the regulatory mechanisms of large multigenic networks implicated in metastasis, we studied the tyrosine kinase DDR 1 and miRNAs as two paradigms involved in this process. DDR 1 is a collagen receptor found in highly invasive tumor cells. Interestingly, high levels of DDR 1 were associated with a decrease survival in stage I lung cancer patients patients. Using a model of lung cancer bone metastasis we demonstrated that abrogation of DDR 1 levels led to stunted decrease in metastatic activity mediated by impaired homing and colonization. These effects were associated with a decreased tumor cell survival and decreased invasive and <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities.</b> Thus, DDR 1 represents a therapeutic target involved in bone metastasis. Using the same model, we unveiled the relevance of a novel mechanism of metastatic colonization consisting in the tumor release and transfer of miR- 192 within CD 63 + enriched exosomes to the endothelial compartment of the osseous milieu. Exosome fusion to endothelial cells was accompanied by the repression of key proangiogenic chemokines. These findings were associated with a functional impairment of the tumor-induced angiogenic program. miR- 192 governs non-cell autonomous functions that globally impair metastatic bone colonization. Interestingly, serum levels of miRNAs were asssociated with osseous colonization.

Surgical reconstruction using digital extensor tendon in bone tunnel was performed on 48 rabbits. Twelve rabbits were sacrificed at 0, 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively for radiological and histological examinations. Bone mass and microarchitecture at the anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral regions of tunnel wall at distal femur and proximal tibia were evaluated. Using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, a 26, 22, and 42 % decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) relative to baseline was present in the medial region of the femoral tunnel and the posterior and lateral regions of the tibial tunnel, respectively, at week 12 postoperatively (p < 0. 05). It was accompanied by a decrease in trabecular number and increase in trabecular spacing, the shift of platelike to rodlike trabeculae, and loss of anisotropy under micro-computed tomography evaluation. This finding was echoed by histology showing increased <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities</b> and poor T-B healing in these regions.

Total levels of PAHs in the seawater from the Alexandria and Suez Canal sites were 1364. 59 and 992. 56 ng/l, respectively. We were able to detect NPAHs in both seawater samples. Total levels of NPAHs were detected in the seawater of the Alexandria site (12. 749 ng/l) and the Suez Canal site (3. 914 ng/l). Each sample of polluted seawater was added to culture medium at dilution rates of 50, 100, and 500, and incubated with the goldfish scales for 6 hrs. Thereafter, ALP and TRAP activities were measured. ALP activity was significantly suppressed by both polluted seawater samples diluted at least 500 times, but TRAP activity did not change. In addition, mRNA expressions of osteoblastic markers (ALP, osteocalcin, and the receptor activator of the NF-κB ligand) decreased significantly, as did the ALP enzyme activity. In fact, ALP activity decreased on treatment with PAHs and NPAHs.

Synthetic fugu PTH 1 (1 - 34) (100 pg/ ml- 10 ng/ml) significantly increased ALP activity at 6 h of incubation. High-dose (10 ng/ml) fugu PTH 1 significantly increased ALP activity even after 18 h of incubation. In the case of TRAP activity, fugu PTH 1 did not change at 6 h of incubation, but fugu PTH 1 (100 pg/ml- 10 ng/ml) significantly increased TRAP activity at 18 h. Similar results were obtained for human PTH (1 - 34), {{but there was an}} even greater response with fugu PTH 1 than with human PTH. In vitro, we demonstrated that both the receptor activator of the NF-êB ligand in osteoblasts and the receptor activator NF-êB mRNA expression in osteoclasts increased significantly by fugu PTH 1 treatment. In an in vivo experiment, fugu PTH 1 induced hypercalcemia resulted from the increase of both osteoblastic and <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities</b> in the scale as well as the decrease of scale calcium contents after fugu PTH 1 injection. In addition, an in vitro experiment with intramuscular autotransplanted scale indicated that the ratio of multinucleated osteoclasts/mononucleated osteoclasts in PTH-treated scales was significantly higher than that in the control scales.

Thus, we investigated the effects of Pu-erh tea extract (PTE) on ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats and on osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Methods: Female Wistar rats were divided into six groups: the sham, model, and Xian-Ling-Gu-Bao capsule (XLGB) groups, and the low-, medium-, and high-dose PTE groups. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats were used as an animal model of osteoporosis. The animals were intragastrically administered distilled water, XLGB, or different concentrations of PTE for 13 weeks. Body weight, blood biochemical indicators, relative organ coefficients, femoral bone mineral density (BMD), bone biomechanical properties, and bone microarchitecture were examined and analyzed. Additionally, the in vitro effects of PTE on <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activities</b> were investigated using the RAW 264. 7 cell line as an osteoclast differentiation model. The effects of PTE on osteoclast differentiation and the expression of osteoclast-specific genes and proteins were determined. Results: PTE reduced OVX-induced body weight gain after 6 weeks of treatment, and the high-dose exerted a significant effect. High-dose PTE significantly ameliorated OVX-induced estradiol (E 2) deficiency. PTE treatment maintained calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and improved other blood biochemical parameters to various degrees. In addition, PTE treatment improved organ coefficients of the femur, uterus, and vagina and improved femoral BMD and bone biomechanical properties. PTE treatment strikingly ameliorated bone microarchitecture. Moreover, in the in vitro studies, osteoclast differentiation using the differentiation cell model was significantly inhibited by PTE without cytotoxic effects.

40|$|More than 80 % of {{patients}} with multiple myeloma (MM) have osteolytic bone disease, which {{increases the risk of}} skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and the need for radiotherapy or surgery. Bone disease is primarily due to increased <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activity</b> and impaired osteoblast activity. Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogues with high bone affinity that can inhibit <b>osteoclastic</b> <b>activity.</b> Pamidronate and zoledronic acid are the most commonly used bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma. Other agents include ibandronate and clodronate. Bisphosphonates are associated with several adverse events, such as renal toxicity and osteonecrosis of the jaw. The optimal duration of bisphosphonate therapy has yet to be determined. Clinical trials are investigating tailored approaches to management based on treatment-related changes in levels of bone resorption markers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn bone {{development}} and regeneration, angiogenesis and bone/cartilage resorption are essential processes and are {{closely associated with}} each other, suggesting a common mediator for these two biological events. To address this interrelationship, we examined the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the most critical growth factor for angiogenesis, on <b>osteoclastic</b> bone-resorbing <b>activity</b> in a culture of highly purified rabbit mature osteoclasts. VEGF caused a dose- and time-dependent increase {{in the area of}} bone resorption pits excavated by the isolated osteoclasts, partially by enhancing the survival of the cells. Two distinct VEGF receptors, KDR/Flk- 1 and Flt- 1, were detectable in osteoclasts at the gene and protein levels, and VEGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in osteoclasts. Thus, osteoclastic function and angiogenesis are up-regulated by a common mediator such as VEGF...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, we {{demonstrate}} {{for the first}} time that β-adrenergic agonists stimulate bone-resorbing activity in human osteoclast-like multinucleated cells (MNCs). Osteoclast-like MNCs constitutively expressed mRNA for α 1 B-, α 2 B- and β 2 -adrenergic receptor (AR) in addition to characteristic markers of mature osteoclast, such as calcitonin receptor (CT-R), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), αV-chain of integrin (Int αV), carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) and cathepsin K (Cathe K). Epinephrine (1 μM; α,β-adrenergic agonist) up-regulated expression of Int αV, CA-II and Cathe K in the osteoclast-like MNCs. <b>Osteoclastic</b> resorbing <b>activity</b> was markedly increased by isoprenaline (1 μM; β-adrenergic agonist), moderately by epinephrine, but poorly by phenylephrine (1 μM; α 1 -adrenergic agonist). The actin ring, which was suggested to be correlated with bone-resorbing activity, was clearly observed in osteoclast-like MNCs treated with isoprenaline and epinephrine, but faintly in those treated with phenylephrine. These findings suggest that β-adrenergic agonists directly stimulate bone-resorbing activity in matured osteoclasts...|$|R
40|$|Nanosized {{hydroxyapatite}} (HA) is {{a promising}} material in clinical applications targeting the bone tissue. NanoHA {{is able to}} modulate bone cellular events, which accounts for its potential utility, but also raises safety concerns regarding the maintenance of the bone homeostasis. This work analyses the effects of HA nanoparticles (HAnp) on <b>osteoclastic</b> differentiation and <b>activity,</b> an issue that has been barely addressed. Rod-like HAnp, produced by a hydrothermal precipitation method, were tested on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which contains the CD 14 + osteoclastic precursors, in unstimulated or osteoclastogenic-induced conditions. HAnp were added at three time-points during the osteoclastic differentiation pathway, and cell response was evaluated for osteoclastic related parameters. Results showed that HAnp modulated the differentiation and function of osteoclastic cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, the effects were dependent on the stage of osteoclastic differentiation. In unstimulated PBMC, HAnp significantly increased osteoclastogenesis, leading to the formation of mature osteoclasts, as evident by the significant increase of TRAP activity, number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, osteoclastic gene expression and resorbing ability. However, in a population of mature osteoclasts (formed in osteoclastogenic-induced PBMC cultures), HAnp caused a dose-dependent decrease on the osteoclastic-related parameters. These results highlight the complex effects of HAnp in <b>osteoclastic</b> differentiation and <b>activity,</b> and suggest the possibility of HAnp to modulate/disrupt osteoclastic behavior, with eventual imbalances in the bone metabolism. This should be carefully considered in bone-related and other established and prospective biomedical applications of HAnp...|$|R
