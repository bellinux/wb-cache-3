5|$|Shaw {{married the}} Reverend John Millar, the parish {{minister}} of Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, in 1719. He {{died two years}} later, after which Shaw {{went on to become}} a successful businesswoman. She was involved in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>thread,</b> at first in a small way, but as the quality of her product began to be recognised, on an increasingly large scale. Her Bargarran trademark thread became a mark of quality, and others in the area began to emulate her techniques, starting an industry in which Paisley once dominated the world, and which shaped the town's history. The last known record of Shaw is her marriage in February 1737 to William Livingstone, a prosperous Edinburgh businessman.|$|E

25|$|Throughout China, {{a simple}} method of {{producing}} quilts is employed. It involves {{setting up a}} temporary roadside site. A frame is assembled within which a lattice work of cotton thread is made. Cotton batting, either new or retrieved from discarded quilts, is prepared in a mobile carding machine. The mechanism of the carding machine {{is powered by a}} small, petrol motor. The batting is then added, layer by layer, to the area within the frame. Between each layer, a new lattice <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> is created with a wooden disk used to tamp down the layer.|$|E
25|$|Cotton lisle is a finely-spun, tightly twisted type {{of cotton}} that is noted for being strong and durable. Lisle is {{composed}} of two strands that have each been twisted an extra twist per inch than ordinary yarns and combined to create a single thread. The yarn is spun {{so that it is}} compact and solid. This cotton is used mainly for underwear, stockings, and gloves. Colors applied to this yarn are noted for being more brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{previous}} paper, we developed an algebraic theory <b>of</b> <b>threads,</b> interleaving <b>of</b> <b>threads,</b> and interaction <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> with services. In the current paper, {{we assume that}} the threads and services are dis-tributed over the nodes of a network. We extend the theory developed so far to the distributed case by introducing distributed interleaving strate-gies that support explicit thread migration and see to load balancing or capability searching by implicit thread migration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method that}} presents a number <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> in a discussion forum through graphical illustrations. This technique brings together visual components, such as dimension, color, intensity, and position to present multiple aspects <b>of</b> a <b>thread</b> including the amount of information, popularity, activities, comparative value, and tenure <b>of</b> the <b>thread.</b> This high visual abstraction <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> allows us to display a large number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> showing overall properties of the contents on a limited screen space. These proposed visualization techniques will assist the user to filtering noisy threads effectively from threads having important features. We have conducted an experimental study, which compares {{the effectiveness of the}} developed visual interface to a traditional text-based interface. The experimental study has shown that the user’s search speed and accuracy in finding noticeable threads from a huge collection <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> has improved significantly by using the visual navigation tool...|$|R
30|$|We {{can reduce}} the number <b>of</b> idle <b>threads</b> by {{reducing}} the total number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> per block and also using each thread to load multiple pixels into the shared memory. This ensures that all <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> each warp are active during the computation stage. Note that the number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> in a block must be a multiple of the warp size (32 threads on GTX 280) for optimal efficiency.|$|R
25|$|In Sanskrit, grantha is {{literally}} 'a knot'. It {{is a word}} that was used for books, and the script used to write them. This stems from the practice of binding inscribed palm leaves using a length <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> held by knots. Although Sanskrit is now mostly written with Devanagari, Grantha was widely used to write Sanskrit in the Tamil-speaking parts of South Asia until the 19th century. Scholars believe that the Grantha script was used when the Vedas were first put into writing around the 5th century CE. In the early 20th century, it began to be replaced by Devanagari in religious and scholarly texts and the Tamil script (with the use of diacritics) in popular texts.|$|E
25|$|Passing is {{the most}} basic and common thread used in goldwork; it {{consists}} of a thin strip of metal wound around a core of cotton or silk. For gold thread this is typically yellow, or in older examples orange; for silver, white or gray. This is always attached by couching, either one or two threads at a time, and pulled through to the back to secure it. When multiple threads must be laid next to each other, a technique called bricking is used: {{the position of the}} couching stitches is offset between rows, producing an appearance similar to a brick wall. This same type <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> is used in making cloth of gold.|$|E

Dillinger was paroled in May 1933, but swore to liberate his friends, and had pistols smuggled in to Makley, Pierpont, Hamilton, Clark, and several other convicts. The pistols were smuggled in a crate <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> that was delivered to the prison shirt shop. On September 26, 1933, a total of ten armed men escaped from the main gate of Indiana State Prison. The ten escapees were Harry Pierpont, Russell Clark, Charles Makley, John Hamilton, James Jenkins, Ed Shouse, Walter Dietrich, James Clark, Joseph Fox and Joseph Burns.|$|E
50|$|A thread {{block is}} a {{programming}} abstraction {{that represents a}} group <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> that can be executing serially or in parallel.

'The number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> in a thread block is also limited by the architecture to a total <b>of</b> 512 <b>threads</b> per block.' The threads in the same thread block run on the same stream processor. Threads in the same block can {{communicate with each other}} via shared memory, barrier synchronization or other synchronization primitives such as atomic operations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It {{is often}} assumed that to {{maximize}} {{the performance of a}} multithreaded application, the number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> created should equal the number of cores. While this may be true for systems with four or eight cores, this is not true for systems with larger number of cores. Our experiments with PARSEC programs on a 24 -core machine demonstrate this. Therefore, dynamically determining the appropriate number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> for a multithreaded application is an important unsolved problem. In this paper we develop a simple technique for dynamically determining appropriate number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> without recompiling the application or using complex compilation techniques or modifying Operating System policies. We first present a scalability study of eight programs from PARSEC conducted on a 24 core Dell PowerEdge R 905 server running OpenSolaris. 2009. 06 for numbers <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> ranging from a few threads to 128 threads. Our study shows that not only does the maximum speedup achieved by these programs vary widely (from 3. 6 x to 21. 9 x), the number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> that produce maximum speedups also vary widely (from 16 to 63 threads). By understanding the overall speedup behavior of these programs we identify the critical Operating System level factors that explain why the speedups vary with the number <b>of</b> <b>threads.</b> As an application of these observations, we develop a framework called “Thread Reinforcer” that dynamically monitors program’s execution to search for the number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> that are likely to yield best speedups. Thread Reinforcer identifies optimal or near optimal number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> for most <b>of</b> the PARSEC programs studied and as well as for SPEC OMP and PBZIP 2 programs. I...|$|R

He was a born mechanical genius and could repair the most complicated machine in the mill. At the age of sixteen he went to East Haddam, where a mill for the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> was being established, to start the machines. At seventeen he worked at the machine shop connected with the mill, where he stayed for three years. It was here he set up the first power loom in the country for the manufacture of diaper linen. He also constructed an ingenious loom for the weaving of damask table cloths.|$|E
25|$|The {{thread of}} Tekhelet is a blue-violet or blue thread, which, {{according}} to the traditions of Rabbinic Judaism, is to be dyed with a specific kind of dye derived from a mollusc (notably the Hexaplex trunculus sea snail). Due {{to a number of}} factors, including Rome outlawing the use of Tekhelet by commoners, the source and practice of using a Tekhelet thread in Tzitzit was lost for most Rabbinic Jews. Their Tzitziyot are usually all white. Karaite Jews believe that the importance of Tekhelet is that the color <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> is blue-violet and it may be produced from any source, including synthetic industrial dyes, except impure (a state mostly overlapping unkosher) marine creatures, rather than insist on a specific dye. Therefore, they believe that the Rabbinic tradition of relying on a dye from a mollusc is incorrect. They suggest that the source of the dye was indigo or Isatis tinctoria.|$|E
25|$|The early {{advances}} in weaving had been halted {{by the lack}} <b>of</b> <b>thread.</b> The spinning process was slow and the weavers needed more cotton and wool thread than their families could produce. In the 1760s, James Hargreaves improved thread production when he invented the Spinning Jenny. By {{the end of the}} decade, Richard Arkwright had developed the water frame. This invention had two important consequences: it improved the quality of the thread, which meant that the cotton industry was no longer dependent on wool or linen to make the warp, and it took spinning away from the artisans' homes to specific locations where fast-flowing streams could provide the water power needed to drive the larger machines. The Western Pennines of Lancashire became the centre for the cotton industry. Not long after the invention of the water frame, Samuel Crompton combined the principals of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame to produce his Spinning Mule. This provided even tougher and finer cotton thread.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the study of {{production}} process <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> by screw-taps from the very description <b>of</b> the individual <b>threads</b> through all the available methods <b>of</b> the <b>threads</b> production, thread control function, up to the actual taps, materials, coatings and their distribution. In the experimental part the thesis {{deals with the}} question whether {{it is possible to}} find an alternative to the standard production <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> using cutting by taps. This alternative seems to be the use of forming taps. The experiment took place under constant cutting conditions and consisted of two parts, one of them was the production <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> into the pre-drilled through holes and the second one was the production <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> into the pre-drilled impassable holes. The result of the experiment was finding the course of the cutting moment depending on the time and the amount of wear of the examined kinds of taps when all the measured values had to be statistically processed and conclusions were then evaluated...|$|R
50|$|The {{same year}} (1828), Clement began making fluted {{screw-cutting}} tap and dies and urged {{the adoption of}} a standard system <b>of</b> screw <b>threads</b> where every machine screw of a particular length should have a set number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> a predetermined pitch and determined the number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> for each length. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement's journeymen afterwards {{played a major role in}} such standardisation, the Whitworth thread becoming a standard for machine screws.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{multithreading}} {{can enhance}} {{the performance of a}} software system. However, its excessive use can degrade the performance. For example, a thread-per-job approach might lead to a large amount <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> with increased associated overheads. In this paper we explore the use of the Parallelism Viewpoint to support one possible strategy to reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>threads,</b> namely finding candidate threads that can be replaced by thread pooling. Thread pooling reduces the large number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> by reusing threads from an existing pool. As an example we analyze the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> a precision critical parallelism-intensive electron microscope software system. Results show that the viewpoint provides a profound insight into the <b>threading</b> structure <b>of</b> the system, which helps in reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> in a cost-effective way.
