40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} own income versus reference group income and the subjective factors considered important in a job for a sample of <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> migrants in China. We find that own income has {{a positive effect on}} job satisfaction while the effect of reference group income is gender specific. We find evidence that males experience a tunnelling effect (higher income coworkers increase their job satisfaction) while females experience a jealousy effect (higher income co-workers lower their job satisfaction). We explain this result in terms of men reacting more strongly in competitive environments and that in China males have better prospects for promotion. We find that compared with employees in western countries, <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> migrants in China place much more emphasis on income and less importance on collegiality and job stability.

Unique panel data from Ethiopia which includes experimentally generated risk preference measures combined with longitudinal rainfall data is used in the analysis. An <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> participation decision and activity choice showed that both variability and reduced availability of rainfall as well as neutral risk preferences increase the likelihood of off-farm participation.

40|$|When {{examining}} {{questions regarding}} the Lewis model, {{one of the most}} salient set of facts involves the shift of labor between agricultural and the <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> sectors. The goal {{of this paper is to}} answer several questions about the nature of this movement: How has the expansion of the economy after 2000 affected <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> labor market participation? Has <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> labor continued to rise? What is this rise being driven by-migrant wage earners or self employment opportunities? What is, in part, driving these trends? Using a national representative set of data that consists of two waves of surveys done in 2000 and 2008 in six provinces, the paper finds that <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> labor market participation has continued to rise steadily in the early 2000 s. However, there has been a structural break in the trends of occupational choice before and after 2000. Unlike before 2000, after 2000 migration's growth accelerated; during this same period the self employed subsector stagnated. The number of wage earning migrants in 2008 was greater than the number of those in the self employed subsector. The data also show that the rise in wage-earning migration is mainly being driven by the younger cohorts. Our analysis also shows that the rise of migration is happening in conjunction with a rising unskilled wage. Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R

A partial generalized ordered logit is used to test the main predictions of the model and a Brant test on threshold constancy is performed to identify the household-specific factors affecting labor market participation.

However, remittances from rural out-migrants do not significantly affect rural farm household production efficiency.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how off-farm work affects the economic performance of crop and (selected) livestock farms. It estimates {{returns to scale}} and technical efficiency following an input distance function approach and compares the relative performance of dairy and corn farm operator households with and without off-farm work. We use farm-level data from the USDA's ARMS survey for 1996 - 2005. The impact of off-farm work on scale and technical efficiency is examined from two viewpoints: first, the effect of off-farm work on the scale and technical efficiency of the farm business {{in the production of}} traditional commodities (farm-level perspective); second, the impact of off-farm work on scale and technical efficiency at the household level, considering both on-farm and off-farm activities. We find that off-farm income boosts scale efficiency on corn farms but decreases scale and dairy farms. The impact of <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> income on technical efficiency is small when using the household approach. However, dairy farmers that rely on off-farm income have lower technical efficiency than dairy farmers that do not rely on <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> income in both the farm and household models, while the reverse is true for corn farms. Finally, we find that dairy <b>farms</b> relying on <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> income have significantly lower returns on assets, while again the opposite is true for corn farms.

A follow-up of work activities was achieved {{in a sample of}} 14 family <b>farms.</b> Work <b>times</b> in each agricultural activity (livestock and crops) were quantified, distinguishing the contributions of family members and that of the off-farm workers. Results showed that the annual working time averaged 1030  days per year per farm. It increased with multiple activities within farms. Work devoted to livestock averaged 581  days a year, mainly achieved by family members, while crops necessitated 449  days of work, mostly assumed by <b>off</b> <b>farm</b> workers. Farms with limited arable land devoted significant time to livestock. The results also revealed that the gross incomes from one day of work in livestock were almost 50 -times less than those from the same duration in cash crops. Altogether, the results confirm the necessity to consider work as a crucial variable determining farming systems’ performances and the use efficiency of this input. As a consequence, in many developing countries, the assumption of plenty of family workers availability may not be valid anymore to justify agricultural policies mainly based on intense on-farm work uses...|$|R

Our empirical results support the hypothesis that participation in the CRP and decisions to work <b>off</b> the <b>farm</b> by the operator and the spouse are made jointly rather than independently. The operators' decisions to work <b>off</b> the <b>farm</b> and to participate in CRP increase the mean level of the household income, while the spouses' decisions to work <b>off</b> the <b>farm</b> help decrease the variation in household income among households in that sub-group.
