Discontinuation of antibiotics {{may result in}} resolution of symptoms within three days in about 20% of those infected. Often the antibiotics metronidazole, vancomycin or fidaxomicin will cure the infection. Retesting after treatment, {{as long as the}} symptoms have resolved, is not recommended as the person may remain colonized. Recurrences have been reported in up to 25% <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>There</b> is tentative evidence that fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics may decrease the risk of recurrence.|$|E

In an interview with The Times in 2004, he said that while he was at Inter, he realised the importance of being mentally tough in order to survive: [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>there</b> try to hurt you, not just physically but mentally as well, and coming from the easygoing culture in Holland, I had to adopt a tougher approach. There, {{it was a case of}} two strikers up against four or five hard defenders who would stop at nothing." [...] Bergkamp says his aggression often stems from frustration.|$|E

It first opened in 1949 and was owned by William E. Miller, a horse trainer and breeder. Rosecroft quickly became Prince George's County's {{political}} and social center, drawing thousands <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>there</b> each racing day. In the early 1950s, average attendance was more than 7,000 per day. After Miller died in 1954, his son John owned Rosecroft {{until his death in}} 1969. Rosecroft hosted memorial stake races annually for both William and John until 1995. Following the death of John Miller, Earle Brown controlled operations until he moved to a different position in 1980; William E. Miller II took over following Brown.|$|E

Richard Keller of TV Squad thought the finale's theme of Will and Grace's connection {{to each other}} was well-presented by director James Burrows. Keller added, [...] "While not as satisfying as, say, the Friends finale or as crushing as the Seinfeld finale, the series finale to Will & Grace did have its moments {{and came back to}} the original concept of friendship among a close group <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>There</b> were some moments where I did laugh out loud, but they were few." [...] CHUD.com's David Oliver praised the finale for not having characters [...] "go on wild tangents that betray who they were during the entirety of the show's run." [...] He also commented that Messing and McCormack are [...] "affecting in their performances" [...] and the episode [...] "nicely summarizes [...] friendship {{over the course of the}} entire show." ...|$|E

In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>there</b> inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes I do get {{a chance to talk to}} them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. Some of us are luckier than others. Some of us are more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E

2500|$|The {{old town}} of Perez-Dasmari√±as {{was made up}} of several barrios. Salitran was {{considered}} the most important and famous during the Spanish regime because it was the site of the Recollect casa hacienda (estate house). Salitran came from the Tagalog word [...] "sal-it" [...] meaning [...] "people from another town". It was also once named as Bayanan because of the large concentration <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>there.</b> Since it {{was a part of the}} Recollect Hacienda de Imus, there were many people from different provinces who lived there working as farmhands. Layong Iloko, a place in Salitran, strengthens the belief that there were Ilocanos who settled there. Pasong Santol in Salitran got its name because of the abundance of santol trees.|$|E

Yorkshire pudding is the base for toad in the hole, a dish containing sausage.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{escalating}} debate, the Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) organized an additional talk between Wilson and the Indianapolis community on October 19, 2010 at the Madame Walker Theatre. After Wilson presented a slideshow {{of his previous}} work, the meeting became heated when a small, organized group began to voice {{their opposition to the}} artwork. Opponents rejected Wilson's image of a semi-nude sculpture as reflective of 21st-century African Americans, and the discussion quickly transitioned into deeper issues of institutional racism in the city of Indianapolis rather than focus on Wilson's work. Indianapolis Cultural Trail curator Mindy Taylor Ross stated, [...] "It {{was just one of those}} situations where there are hundreds <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>there</b> and the loudest voices get heard and everyone else gets drowned out." ...|$|E

Black cars {{cannot be}} hailed on the street, instead being dispatched by a parent business.

There were around 500 base stations for black cars, comprising a total fleet of 25,000 vehicles, as of the 2014 TLC Factbook. Livery cars are similar to black cars, but are used by a greater range <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>There</b> were 80 livery bases and 10,000 livery vehicles in 2014. Commuter vans carry more people, usually between 9 and 20 passengers per trip. Commuter van licenses were held by 50 entities, which collectively owned 500 vehicles, in 2014.
