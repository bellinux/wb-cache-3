5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white lettering <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> background.|$|E
5|$|Godbout {{also sold}} {{components}} to Processor Technology for their 4K Static RAM board and serial / parallel interface board. Lee Felsenstein designed an Altair compatible video board that provided 16 lines of 64 {{upper and lower}} case characters <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> and white television. This $160 board became very popular {{and led to the}} Processor Technology Sol-20 Computer in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Low {{used the}} same flag as Edward Teach ("Blackbeard"). Later, he used his own flag, a red {{skeletal}} figure <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> background, which became notorious. He first flew his own flag in late July 1723. Low also used a green silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet; this Green Trumpeter was hoisted on the mizzen peak to call his fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship.|$|E

Castling with a reborn rook is permitted. A reborn pawn regains its initial two-step move option. A captured promoted piece {{is treated as}} a piece (not a pawn).|$|R
5|$|Several special {{editions of}} The Black Parade were released. One bears white text <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> background, {{and the second}} has black text on a white background. A third version has the normal booklet reversed, showing {{the picture of the}} parade drawn and painted by comic artist James Jean. Inside the booklet there are also lyrics, a photo of the band, and {{characters}} from the album.|$|E
5|$|Strawberry's villain, the Peculiar Purple Pieman, lives {{atop the}} Pie Tin Palace <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hill called Porcupine Peak. While {{she is doing}} chores, the Pieman sends his crows"berry birds"to {{retrieve}} some berries for his pies. Strawberry tries shooing the flock away with her broom, but a moving tree helps out as a scarecrow, and she thanks him for helping. In desperation, the Pieman heads down to Strawberryland himself to get his supply, dressed as a kind old peddler.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft, christened L'Oiseau Blanc, {{was painted}} white, {{and had the}} French tricolor markings, with Nungesser's {{personal}} World War I flying ace logo: a skull and crossbones, candles and a coffin, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> heart, painted on the fuselage. The biplane carried no radio and relied only on celestial navigation, a specialty of Coli from his previous flights around the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|In home matches, the team's outfield players {{traditionally}} {{wear the}} colours of the Belgian flag: black, yellow and red. Red dominates the strip {{and is often}} the sole jersey colour. The away colours are usually white, black or both; in 2014, the squad introduced a third, yellow kit. Their shirts are often trimmed with tricolores at the margins. Since 1981, the RBFA emblem has been the national team's badge; the previous badge was a yellow lion <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> shield, similar to the escutcheon of the national coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{subsequently}} oversaw a new reissue of {{the original}} album in 1998 on CD, that was also remastered by Mew. This version contained an extra CD with three tracks {{that had been left}} off the 1993 set. The colour scheme of the cover was reversed to show gold text <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> background. The remastered Made in Japan has further edits to make a contiguous performance, making it shorter than the original release. At the same time, a limited edition of 4,000 double LPs was released on purple vinyl, while in Spain, EMI added the studio versions of the tracks making up the original album to the second CD.|$|E
5|$|The programme's logo, the Big Brother Eye, {{is based}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black,</b> purple and blue {{thumbprint}} {{and was released}} on 11 May. It was designed by Daniel Eatock. From 19 May, Channel 4 began uploading teaser clips to the official Big Brother UK YouTube channel; these were also aired during commercial breaks on Channel 4 and its related channels. The series was sponsored by Lucozade Energy and the promotional break bumpers were created by M Saatchi and are based upon a 'little brother versus big brother' scenario. The programme began on 4 June, with a 95-minute special programme which introduced the initial 16 participants, and was broadcast on Channel 4 and E4 {{over a period of}} 93 days, concluding with the final on 4 September.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E
5|$|Pattillo Higgins {{was born}} to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He {{attended}} school {{until he reached the}} fourth grade, after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father’s direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans. When he was seventeen, he pulled a prank <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> Baptist church that got the attention of a sheriff deputy. The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later {{turn out to be a}} fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by a jury that perceived his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a logger along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm. It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.|$|E
5|$|Space Travel is a spaceflight {{simulation}} video game, {{presented in}} a two-dimensional top-down view, with monochrome graphics consisting of white lines <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> background. In it, the player controls a spaceship as it flies through {{a representation of the}} solar system. The game has no specific objectives, other than to attempt to land on the various planets and moons of the system. The planets and most of the moons in the solar system are represented to scale both in size and distance from each other, though the orbits are simplified to be circles. To land on a body, the player's ship must cross the line representing the surface while moving at a low enough speed. The player is able to control the ship to go forwards and backwards and turn. The ship moves at a constant level of acceleration relative to the scale of the screen, which the player can control; scaling the screen up high enough allows the player to travel across the solar system in seconds, though they risk overshooting their target and becoming unable to find the solar system again, and scaling down allows the player to be moving slowly enough to land. The ship is always {{in the center of the}} screen, facing the top; turning the ship right or left therefore rotates the solar system around the ship instead.|$|E

5|$|The Fountain Court lies to {{the west}} of the Pitched Stone Court, and is named after a marble {{fountain}} that once stood in the centre of it, featuring a white horse <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> marble base, complete with a flow of running water. The fountain was probably installed somewhat after the initial construction of the court in the 1460s, dating instead to Edward Somerset in the late 16th century; the horse symbolised Edward's prestigious role as Master of the Horse. The Fountain Court was built to provide luxurious accommodation for the family and guests – by the 15th century, it was important to be able to provide private chambers for visitors, and this court could hold up to four distinct groups of visitors in comfort. The Fountain Court as a whole is marked by what Augustus Pugin described as extremely fine, elegant and delicate stonework.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, the club's logo was changed; a small skull {{replaced}} a winged motorcycle, and Old English-style {{letters were}} adopted.

This design was embroidered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> western-style shirt with white piping. The movie The Wild One with Marlon Brando influenced this backpatch. The Skull and Crossed Pistons were redesigned in 1959, making them much larger with more detail. The A.O.A. logo was adopted as an answer to the A.M.A. logo.|$|E
