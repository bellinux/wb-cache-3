40|$|Global {{environment}} is presenting new {{opportunities and challenges}} for international cooperation. The depletion {{of the ozone layer}} is one of the successful cases where the world community has demonstrated a rare consensus to address a global problem. This study: (1) examines the role of international law and institutions in shaping a regime for ozone layer depletion as formalized in the 1987 Montreal Protocol; (2) evaluates contributions of the <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> to the development of international environmental law, and (3) analyzes its implications for future international cooperation. Using regime theories as a methodological framework, the study integrates science, policy, law and institutions to show how they interact to create understandings, practices, and procedures in international relations. Traditionally, regime theorists have focused on power and interest to explain international cooperation. The existing theories were found to be inadequate for the analysis of <b>ozone</b> <b>regime.</b> I have offered an alternate explanation by incorporating the element of "law" into regime studies and linking regimes with "institutions" [...] the raison d'etre of the regimes. This modified explanation helps to provide {{a better understanding of the}} formation of the <b>ozone</b> <b>regime.</b> The study suggests that the <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> has produced a new generation of environmental norms. These norms, both procedural and substantive, put "flesh on the bone" of environmental law and keep <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> as a political process in motion, thus, adapting to the changing technological and scientific environment. Moreover, the <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> marks a turning point in the shift of emphasis from single-issue pollution laws to an encompassing law of the atmosphere. A new form of international cooperation also emerged from ozone negotiations. This cooperation was promoted by joint efforts of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the world scientific community. UNEP used scientific findings to persuade the parties to the ozone negotiations to re-evaluate their political stance in light of evolving scientific knowledge. At a time when traditional bases of power seem to be eroding, international institutions are viable structures to initiate efforts to address human concerns and facilitate decisions by the international community. Similarly, the world scientific community may prove influential in future global policymaking, in particular on the issues with high degrees of scientific uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} ozone {{exposure}} on species of an upland grassland were assessed. Thirty-three species from Snowdonia, North Wales, UK, were exposed for 10 weeks to a weekly episodic <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> in solardomes representing predicted future concentrations. Two solardomes {{were used as}} controls, with ozone added to charcoal-filtered air to give a continuous ozone concentration of 30 ppb (O 3 (30)). A weekly episodic <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> was applied to two other solardomes, with concentrations rising for 8 h per day to 80 ppb on day 1, 100 ppb on days 2 and 3, and 80 ppb on day 4; ozone concentrations remained at 30 ppb at all other times (O 3 (30 +peaks)). The control and background ozone concentrations of 30 ppb were maintained throughout the night as well as during the daytime. During exposure to the episodic <b>ozone</b> <b>regime,</b> some species were sensitive to ozone and showed ozone-specific leaf injury symptoms (e. g. Carex echinata) and/or premature senescence (e. g. Festuca rubra) and/or changes in above-ground biomass (e. g. Armeria maritima), whereas other species (e. g Holcus lanatus and Carex demissa) showed no effects. Some species, although showing no effects during the 10 -week ozone exposure, showed carry-over effects on biomass the following spring, after a winter period of ambient ozone exposure (e. g. Galium saxatile, Nardus stricta and Saxifraga stellaris). The carry-over effects shown in this study indicate the potential ecological impact of ozone on semi-natural vegetation species and indicate the importance of longer-term studies {{on the effects of}} ozone on plant...|$|E

40|$|Ozone and {{atmospheric}} nitrogen are co-occurring pollutants with {{adverse effects on}} natural grassland vegetation. Plants of the rhizomatous sedge Carex arenaria were exposed to four <b>ozone</b> <b>regimes</b> representing increasing background concentrations (background-peak) : 10 – 30, 35 – 55, 60 – 80 and 85 – 105 ppb ozone at two nitrogen levels: 12 and 100 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1. Ozone increased the number and proportion of senesced leaves, but not overall leaf number. There was a clear nitrogen × ozone interaction with high nitrogen reducing proportional senescence in each treatment and increasing the ozone dose (AOT 40) at which enhanced senescence occurred. Ozone reduced total biomass due to significant effects on root biomass. There were no interactive effects on shoot:root ratio. Rhizome tissue N content was increased by both nitrogen and ozone. Results suggest that nitrogen mediates above-ground impacts of ozone but not impacts on below-ground resource translocation. This may lead to complex interactive effects between the two pollutants on natural vegetation. ...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{importance}} of the discourse on climate change raises some interesting questions regarding the creation and evaluation of international regimes. When is a regime effective? Through analyzing two competing approaches to evaluating regimes, the instrumentalists and critical theorists, this project shows the deficiencies in the current discourse. Instrumentalists focus on observable means-ends standards of efficiency, while critical theorists ask fundamental questions regarding intersubjectivity. Influenced by both of these schools of thought, this project develops an analytical framework for evaluating regimes that differentiates between different sources/levels of change (regulative, normative, and cognitive) and types of change (adaptation and innovation). When this framework {{is applied to the}} cases of the <b>Ozone</b> <b>regime</b> and the Climate Change regime, interesting counter-intuitive findings emerge that offer alternative evaluative criteria for considering the effectiveness of global environmental regimes...|$|E
30|$|The most valid {{comparison}} between H 12 and our replication {{should be with}} the TOMS data sets, because they were used by H 12 along with the no longer available TOVS_NEURAL to fill in data gaps in the 1990 s between the Nimbus- 7 and Earthprobe records. Our implementation with TOMS generally reproduces the absolute value and seasonality of H 12, particularly during winter, but with significant differences during the summer months. Overall, the H 12 values are much farther equatorward during summer than ours. The {{reason for this is}} that <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> boundaries in the Hudson methodology are extremely sensitive to the polar vortex identification. The size of the polar vortex area masked out impacts not only the ozone boundary values for the polar-midlatitude boundary but also the midlatitude-tropical boundary which is used to identify the latitude of the subtropical front.|$|E
40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} both ozone and UV-B {{radiation}} are typical for high-altitude sites. Few studies have investigated their possible interaction on plants. This study reports interactive effects of O 3 and UV-B radiation in four-year-old Norway spruce and Scots pine trees. The trees were cultivated in controlled environmental facilities under simulated climatic conditions recorded on Mt Wank, an Alpine mountain in Bavaria, and were exposed for one growing season to simulated ambient or twice-ambient <b>ozone</b> <b>regimes</b> at either near ambient or near zero UV-B radiation levels. Chlorotic mottling and yellowing of current year needles became obvious under twice-ambient O 3 in both species {{at the onset}} of a high ozone episode in July. Development of chlorotic mottling in relation to accumulated ozone concentrations over a threshold of 40 nL L(exp - 1) was more pronounced with near zero rather than ambient UV-B radiation levels. In Norway spruce, photosynthetic parameters at ambient CO 2 concentration, measured {{at the end of the}} experiment, were reduced in trees cultivated under twice-ambient O 3, irrespective of the UV-B treatment. Effects on photosynthetic capacity and carboxylation efficiency were restricted to trees exposed to near zero levels of UV-B radiation, and twice-ambient O 3. The data indicate that UV-B radiation, applied together with O 3, ameliorates the detrimental effects of O 3. The data also demonstrate that foliar symptoms develop more rapidly in Scots pine than in Norway spruce at higher accumulated ozone concentrations...|$|R

This study was initiated to analyze whether ozone-stressed plants also transfer signals below ground and thereby alter the bacterial community composition in their rhizospheres. Herbaceous plants, native to Germany, with tolerance (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Achillea millefolium, Poa pratensis, Rumex acetosa, and Veronica chamaedrys) and sensitivity (Matricaria chamomilla, Sonchus asper, and Tanacetum vulgare) to ozone, raised in the greenhouse, were exposed in open-top chambers to two different <b>ozone</b> <b>regimes,</b> i. e., “summer stress” and a normal ozone background. DNA of bacterial cells from the rhizospheres was directly extracted, and partial sequences of the 16 S rRNA genes were PCR amplified with primers targeting the following phylogenetic groups: Bacteria, α-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Pseudomonas, respectively. The diversity of the amplified products was analyzed by genetic profiling based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Neither the tolerant nor the sensitive plants, the latter with visible above-ground damage, showed ozone-induced differences {{in any of the}} SSCP profiles, with the single exception of Actinobacteria-targeted profiles from S. asper. To increase the stress, S. asper was germinated and raised in the continuous presence of an elevated level of ozone. SSCP profiles with Bacteria-specific primers combined with gene probe hybridizations indicated an ozone-related increase in a Xanthomonas-related 16 S rRNA gene and a decrease in the respective gene from the plant plastids. The fact that only this latter unrealistic scenario caused a detectable effect demonstrated that ozone stress has a surprisingly small effect on the structural diversity of the bacterial community in rhizospheres...|$|R

40|$|Considering {{the need}} of {{increasing}} ""participation incentives"" for global environmental regimes, this paper aims to analyze the existing incentive instruments, focusing on the cases of global atmospheric environmental regimes. In order to achieve this purpose, the paper first categorizes three types of national incentives in participating environmental regimes, i. e. environmental, political and economic incentives. Then the paper examines four global atmospheric regimes, namely the long-ranged transboundary air pollution regime, the US-Canada air quality management regime, the <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> and the climate regime. It further clarifies the existence of international environmental monitoring programs, introduction of emission standard targets (rather than emission ceiling approach), introduction of economic mechanisms (such as Sulfur emission trading and Kyoto mechanism) and establishing funds (to developing countries) as ""Partiuipation incentive instruments"", and analyzed how they have played significant roles in increasing environmental and/or economic incentives for countries to participate in global atmospheric regimes. ...|$|E
40|$|Trifolium repens and Lolium perenne {{were exposed}} as both monocultures and two-species {{mixtures}} to an episodic rural <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> in large, well-watered containers within solardomes for 12 weeks. There were reductions in biomass for T. repens, but not L. perenne, {{and the proportion}} of T. repens decreased in ozone-exposed mixtures compared to the control. In addition, leaf biomass of T. repens was maintained at the expense of biomass partitioning to the stolons. The decreased growth corresponded with decreased photosynthetic capacity for T. repens, however, {{by the end of the}} exposure there was also decreased photosynthetic capacity of L. perenne, a species previously considered insensitive to ozone. The observed decreases in photosynthetic efficiency and capacity in elevated ozone indicate that the ability of such ubiquitous vegetation to act as a sink for atmospheric carbon may be reduced in future climates. Ozone causes changes in biomass partitioning, and photosynthetic efficiency and capacity that could decrease the ability of plants to act as a carbon sink. ...|$|E
30|$|The H 03 {{method is}} an {{iterative}} approach that uses daily gridded TCO data and daily isentropic potential vorticity (PV) from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (Kalnay et al. 1996) {{to compute the}} four <b>ozone</b> <b>regimes</b> (i.e., tropical, midlatitude, polar, and Arctic) and their boundaries. These regimes are intended to characterize regions of quasi-constant TCO that are separated by regions of relatively rapid changes in TCO, and the boundaries between these TCO regimes are supposed to correspond to meteorological phenomena such as the jets. For example, the tropical–midlatitude boundary occurs at the subtropical jet/tropopause break, where the abrupt change in tropopause height causes an abrupt change in TCO values. Similarly, the midlatitude–polar boundary is intended to correspond with {{the location of the}} polar front jet, and the polar-Arctic boundary occurs {{at the edge of the}} stratospheric polar vortex. By construction, the Arctic regime is the region within the polar vortex, when the vortex is present during winter. The Arctic regime is excluded from subsequent analysis in order to focus on dynamically induced changes to the TCO field and remove air masses that have been potentially affected by heterogeneous ozone chemistry. In H 03, the Arctic regime was identified by using the position of the 31.5 PVU (1 PVU[*]=[*] 10 − 6  K m 2  kg− 1  s− 1) boundary on the 450  K isentropic surface. TCO data poleward of this boundary are excluded from further analysis because of their potential to be impacted by ozone loss chemistry. In subsequent studies (H 06 and H 12), the polar vortex boundary was defined based on the PV value associated with the position of the maximum gradient in PV on the 550  K surface, again using NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data. This procedure was applied using daily data, and a 5 -day running mean of the PV threshold was used to reduce noise (Follette 2007).|$|R
40|$|Contrary to most {{regions in}} the US, ozone in the {{northern}} Front Range metropolitan area (NFRMA) of Colorado was either stagnant or increasing between 2000 and 2015, despite substantial reductions in NO x emissions. We used available long-term ozone and NO x data in the NFRMA to investigate these trends. Ozone increased from weekdays to weekends {{for a number of}} sites in the NFRMA with weekend reductions in NO 2 at two sites in downtown Denver, indicating that the region was in a NO x -saturated <b>ozone</b> production <b>regime.</b> The stagnation and increases in ozone in the NFRMA are likely due to a combination of decreasing NO x emissions in a NO x -saturated environment and increased anthropogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the NFRMA. Further investigation of the weekend–weekday effect showed that the region outside of the most heavily trafficked Denver area was transitioning to peak ozone production towards NO x -limited chemistry. This transition implies that continued NO x decreases will result in ozone being less sensitive to changes in either anthropogenic or biogenic VOC reactivity in the NFRMA. In contrast to anthropogenic VOCs, biogenic VOCs are unlikely to have increased in the NFRMA between 2000 and 2015, but are temperature dependent and likely vary by drought year. Ozone in the NFRMA has a temperature dependence, albeit smaller than many other US locations, consistent with biogenic VOC contributions to ozone production in the region. We show that while ozone increased with temperature in the NFRMA, which is consistent with a NO x -saturated regime coupled to temperature-dependent VOCs, this relationship is suppressed in drought years. We attribute this drought year suppression to decreased biogenic isoprene emissions due to long-term drought stress. Thus, while anthropogenic NO x and VOCs likely dominate <b>ozone</b> production <b>regimes</b> in the NFRMA, biogenic VOCs may also impact regional ozone and its temperature dependence...|$|R
40|$|Sesquiterpenes (C 15 H 24) are semi-volatile organic {{compounds}} emitted by vegetation and {{are of interest}} in atmospheric research because they influence the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere {{and contribute to the}} formation of secondary organic aerosols. However, little is known about their emission pattern and no established parameterisation is available for global emission models. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate a Central European spruce forest and its emission response to meteorological and environmental parameters, looking for a parameterisation that incorporates heat and oxidative stress as the main driving forces of the induced emissions. Therefore, a healthy ca. 80 yr old Norway spruce (Picea abies) tree was selected and a dynamical vegetation enclosure technique was applied from April to November 2011. The emissions clearly responded to temperature changes with small variations in the β-factor along the year (βspring = 0. 09 ± 0. 01, βsummer = 0. 12 ± 0. 02, βautumn = 0. 11 ± 0. 02). However, daily calculated values revealed a vast amount of variability in temperature dependencies ((0. 02 ± 0. 002) < β < (0. 27 ± 0. 04)) with no distinct seasonality. By separating the complete dataset in 10 different <b>ozone</b> <b>regimes,</b> we found that in moderately or less polluted atmospheric conditions the main driving force of sesquiterpene emissions is the temperature, but when ambient ozone mixing ratios exceed a critical threshold of (36. 6 ± 3. 9) ppbv, the emissions become primarily correlated with ozone. Considering the complete dataset, cross correlation analysis resulted in highest correlation with ambient ozone mixing ratios (CCO 3 = 0. 63 ± 0. 01; CCT = 0. 47 ± 0. 02 at t = 0 h for temperature) with a time shift 2 – 4 h prior to the emissions.

Discussions of this case frequently attribute the failure to a prioritization of sovereignty above all other interests on the part of Malaysia and other developing countries. I offer an alternative explanation, based on interview data and documents and reports from the era. Although the US was the first state to propose a global forest convention in 1990 and remained the lead state in negotiations, the benefits of a global forest treaty at the domestic level did not outweigh the potential costs to the US of manipulating the preferences of the anti-convention coalition towards favoring agreement. Use of counter-factual scenarios demonstrates that it was this rather than sovereignty issues that precluded a forest treaty. Copyright (c) 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies in}} the Northern Hemisphere {{have shown that the}} total ozone field can be {{classified}} by meteorological regimes, whose boundaries are the tropospheric upper-level jets. A similar approach has been followed to classify the Southern Hemisphere. Total ozone data from the TOMS instruments have been used to locate the upper-level jets and therefore, the regimes' boundaries. Here however, I use vertically integrated potential vorticity from the reanalysis data from NCEP/NCAR and ECMWF to estimate the first guess in an iterative procedure that calculates the <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> boundary values. The classification of the total ozone field using these boundary values was validated using daily rawinsonde temperature profiles, SAGE II ozone profiles, and TOMS total ozone data. Rawinsondes showed that, on any given day, the tropopause heights within a regime were relatively constant despite the large latitudinal extent of the regime itself. Data from SAGE II also showed that the classification produces distinct ozone profiles for each regime, which is consistent with the fact that total ozone is nearly constant within each regime, as shown by TOMS data. The temporal behavior of total ozone within each regime between 1979 and 2004 was analyzed for the 25 º- 60 ºS latitude band. Total ozone trend analysis showed that statistically significant decadal trends within each regime were smaller than the overall trend in this band with no classification. In addition, the areas of the meteorological regimes within the 25 º- 60 ºS latitude band also showed statistically significant trends. During the period of study, the area of the tropical regime has increased {{at the expense of the}} areas of the midlatitude and polar regimes. Both processes, changes in total ozone within each regime as well as changes in their contribution to the 25 º- 60 ºS band, are responsible for the overall trend in that region. The analysis also showed that the QBO and the solar flux have an important influence on the temporal behavior of both the total ozone within each regime and their corresponding areas. The results indicate, as is the case of the Northern Hemisphere, that the total <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> boundaries have migrated poleward between 1979 and 2004...|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{changes of}} the ozone weekend effect are found over broad areas of Japan. These changes are {{characterized}} by (1) spatial reversals from a weekend increase {{in the vicinity of}} huge precursor source areas to a weekend decrease in the surrounding rural areas, and (2) temporal reversals from a weekend increase under relatively unsuitable meteorological conditions for ozone formation to a weekend decrease under relatively suitable conditions. We developed a simple numerical advection–reaction model to explain the relationship between the duration of advection and the supplied solar energy, which causes the daily maximum ozone concentration to be lower near the precursor source. Ozone isopleth diagrams for individual advection durations (equivalent to the distance from the source) {{for a wide range of}} initial precursor conditions show that both VOC-limited and NO x -limited regimes exist for each advection duration, but the area of NO x -limited regime becomes dominant as the advection duration increases because of the increased exposure of the air mass to solar energy. For given initial VOC and NO x concentrations, the area remote from the source becomes a NO x -limited regime even if the precursor source area is in the VOC-limited regime. The rate of reduction of weekend emissions of NO x is larger than that of VOC, causing a weekend increase in ozone inside an area of VOC-limited regime near the source, but a weekend decrease in remote areas with a NO x -limited regime. The boundary between these two <b>ozone</b> formation <b>regimes</b> depends on meteorological conditions: when sunlight intensity and temperature are relatively low, the change from a VOC-limited to a NO x -limited regime occurs at a point more remote from the source than when they are relatively high, which causes a prevailing ozone weekend increase over a wide geographical area on days with lower ozone potential. Therefore, observations of ozone weekend changes can be interpreted in light of the theoretical implications of our model; they can be used for determination of <b>ozone</b> formation <b>regimes,</b> which change in different locations and under different meteorological conditions...|$|R
40|$|Ozone affects adult trees significantly, but {{effects on}} stem growth {{are hard to}} prove and {{difficult}} to correlate with the primary sites of ozone damage at the leaf level. To simulate ozone effects in a mechanistic way, at a level relevant to forest stand growth, we developed a simple ozone damage and repair model (CASIROZ model) that can be implemented into mechanistic photosynthesis and growth models. The model needs to be parameterized with cuvette measurements on net photosynthesis and dark respiration. As the CASIROZ ozone sub-model calculates effects of the ozone flux, a reliable representation of stomatal conductance and therefore ozone uptake is necessary to allow implementation of the ozone sub-model. In this case study the ozone sub-model {{was used in the}} ANAFORE forest model to simulate gas exchange, growth, and allocation. A preliminary run for adult beech (Fagus sylvatica) under different <b>ozone</b> <b>regimes</b> at the Kranzberg forest site (Germany) was performed. The results indicate that the model is able to represent the measured effects of ozone adequately, and to distinguish between immediate and cumulative ozone effects. The results further help to understand ozone effects by distinguishing defence from damage and repair. Finally, the model can be used to extrapolate from the short-term results of the field study to long-term effects on tree growth. The preliminary simulations for the Kranzberg beech site show that, although ozone effects on yearly growth are variable and therefore insignificant when measured in the field, they could become significant at longer timescales (above 5 years, 5 % reduction in growth). The model offers a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the significant effects on photosynthesis (10 to 30 % reductions simulated), and the minor effects on growth. This appears {{to be the result of}} the strong competition and slow growth of the Kranzberg forest, and the importance of stored carbon for the adult beeches (by buffering effects on carbon gain). We finally conclude that inclusion of ozone effects into current forest growth and yield models can be an important improvement into their overall performance, especially when simulating younger and less dense forests...|$|R

By using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, the 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) content of a DNA enzymatic digest can be sensitively quantitated. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and peas (Pisum sativum L.) were treated with an <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> that caused acute injury. Chloroplast DNA was obtained from plants harvested either immediately after ozone treatment or 24 hours later. Ozone-exposed plants in general had nearly two-fold higher levels of 8 -OHdG as compared to control plants. In vitro treatment of DNA in buffer solution with ozone did not cause formation of 8 -OHdG in DNA, even though ozone did react directly with the macromolecule per se. Exposure of isolated, illuminated chloroplasts to ozone caused nearly a seven-fold increase in the amount of 8 -OHdG in the chloroplast DNA as compared to none-ozone-exposed chloroplasts. These results suggest that ozone exposure to plants causes formation of enhanced levels of oxygen free radicals, thus mediating formation of 8 -OHdG in chloroplast DNA. The reaction of ozone with DNA per se did not cause formation of 8 -OHdG. Therefore, it is the interaction of ozone with plant cells and isolated chloroplasts which mediates oxygen free radical formation...|$|E
40|$|Mass spectrometric {{analysis}} of small negative ions (e/m < 100) produced by DC negative corona discharge in ozonised wet air both in flow and flow-stopped regimes {{was conducted at}} pressure of 30 kPa. The point-to-plain electrode system has been used. The yield of individual ions is strongly affected by trace concentrations of <b>ozone</b> in both <b>regimes.</b> <b>Ozone</b> concentration greater than 25 ppm is sufficient to completely suppress the appearance of O 2 - and a NO 2 - ion as well as theirs clusters in the mass spectra. The temporal increase in concentration of NO 3 - ions and NO 3 -. (H 2 O) n (n = 1, 2) hydrated clusters was observed in flow-stopped regime accompanied by reduction in yield of CO 3 - ion and its water clusters CO 3 -. (H 2 O) n (n = 1, 2), which otherwise are the dominant ions in flowing wet air free of ozone. In contrast the addition of ozone into the flow of wet air resulted in evident increase in abundance of the clusters CO 3 -. (H 2 O) n (n = 1, 2). This is an evidence of an active role of nitrous oxide produced in flow-stopped regime in sufficient amount. The measured electrical conductivity of drift region confirmed the role of additional dissociative attachment of electrons by ozone molecules {{as well as a}} formation of clusters of lower mobility with increasing ozone concentration in the discharge gap...|$|R

Several different electrical parameters of the discharge have been measured.

The gas flow rate is shown to influence the CV characteristics within a negative corona but, in contrast, only a marginal effect of flow rate was observed in positive corona. The mobility of both negative and positive charge carriers in the drift region of the discharges have been derived from CV characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{subtropical}} and polar {{upper troposphere}} fronts and the polar vortex {{serve as the}} boundaries to divide the Northern Hemisphere into four meteorological regimes. These regimes are defined as (1) the arctic regime – within the polar vortex, (2) the polar regime – between the polar front and the polar vortex, or when the latter is not present, the pole, (3) the midlatitude regime – between the subtrop-ical and polar fronts, and (4) the tropical regime – between the equator and the subtropical front. Data from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) were used to show that within each meteorological <b>regime,</b> <b>ozone</b> and water profiles are characterized by unique ozonepause and hygropause heights.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the question: Is {{the theory of}} environmental justice, as has been used at the national US level, a useful theoretical tool to analyze and inform the North-South schism in global environmental politics? I hypothesize that the case for environmental justice can be replicated {{at the international level}} where countries of the South have to bear disproportionate environmental burdens. I use three international environmental case studies, namely the export of hazardous waste, the <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> and climate change to investigate this hypothesis. This study highlights that although issues of justice and fairness arise in all international negotiations, they are usually not the most crucial considerations. At the international level, individual countries with different power potentials and national interests characterize the playing field where each country seeks to maximize its power and benefits from negotiation while simultaneously minimizing costs and {{the question of how to}} divide costs and benefits. This then becomes the heart of treaty-negotiation and acceptance, and the foundation for how to define justice. Justice, defined in terms of the distribution of costs and benefits is also the greatest cause of discord, disagreement and failure of an international treaty. From discussions that ensued from the three case studies, I found an interesting relationship between three factors: responsibility, vulnerability and capacity. I also found that vulnerability of the North plays a crucial role in determining how readily the North would agree to the needs of the South in order to foster international cooperation. This in turn gets framed as justice. ...|$|E
40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an {{important}} greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance {{as well as a}} key component of the nitrogen cascade. While emissions scenarios indicating the range of N 2 O's potential future contributions to radiative forcing are widely available, the impact of these emissions scenarios on future stratospheric ozone depletion is less clear. This is because N 2 O's ozone destructiveness is partially dependent on tropospheric warming, which affects ozone depletion rates in the stratosphere. Consequently, {{in order to understand the}} possible range of stratospheric ozone depletion that N 2 O could cause over the 21 st century, it is important to decouple the greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and compare different emissions trajectories for individual substances (e. g. business-as-usual carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions versus low emissions of N 2 O). This study is the first to follow such an approach, running a series of experiments using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Sciences ModelE 2 atmospheric sub-model. We anticipate our results to show that stratospheric ozone depletion will be highest in a scenario where CO 2 emissions reductions are prioritized over N 2 O reductions, as this would constrain ozone recovery while doing little to limit stratospheric NOx levels (the breakdown product of N 2 O that destroys stratospheric ozone). This could not only delay the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer, but might also prevent a return to pre- 1980 global average ozone concentrations, a key goal of the international <b>ozone</b> <b>regime.</b> Accordingly, we think this will highlight the importance of reducing emissions of all major greenhouse gas emissions, including N 2 O, and not just a singular policy focus on CO 2...|$|E
40|$|In the Mediterranean basin, ambient ozone {{concentrations}} {{have been}} reported to cause visible injury on several crops and wild plants. Studies under controlled conditions showed a range of physiological responses, including reductions in above- and below-ground biomass, seed production, photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, altered patterns of assimilate allocation, accelerated senescence, and modification of antioxidant levels. Quantitative dose/response relationships have been detected on major crops, but few studies have dealt with the effects of ozone on the quality of plant products. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the response of a piperitenone oxide chemotype in Mentha spicata subsp. glabrata exposed to a realistic <b>ozone</b> <b>regime</b> (100 ppb for 21 days, 5 h d- 1) in fumigation chambers. Analyses were carried out at the end of the treatment, which corresponded to an AOT 40 (i. e. accumulated exposure over a threshold of 40 ppb) of 6300 ppbh. Significant inhibition of photosynthetic activity, mainly due to stomatal closure was observed in ozonated individuals in comparison to filtered-air grown controls. Leaf cell membrane permeability, chlorophyll content and electron transport were unaffected. No visible injury symptoms were detected. From this point of view, this species should be regarded as ozone-resistant. A 4 % decrease in piperitenone oxide and a doubling of germacrene-D content was observed in the leaves of ozonated plants, which also showed traces of essential oil components not detected in untreated plants. The main impact of ozone on volatile compounds was a 2. 5 -fold increase in piperitenone oxide; several organic compounds, detectable in percentage lower than 0. 1 % in control plants, were released by the ozonated ones. Ecological implications of these findings, as well as the impact of ozone on the quality of mint yield deserve attention...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} Mexico City (MCMA) {{emissions}} is examined by studying {{its effects on}} air quality, photochemistry, and on <b>ozone</b> production <b>regimes</b> by combining model products and aircraft observations from the MILAGRO experiment during March 2006. The modeled influence of MCMA emissions to enhancements in surface level NOx, CO, and O 3 concentrations (10 – 30 % increase) are confined to distances y, and MTBE mixing ratios over the Gulf of Mexico are linked to MCMA by source tagged tracers and sensitivity runs. This study shows that the "footprint" of MCMA on average is fairly local, with exception to reactive nitrogen, which can be transported long range {{in the form of}} PAN, acting as a reservoir and source of NOx with important regional ozone formation implications. The simulated effect of MCMA emissions of anthropogenic aerosol on photochemistry showed a maximum regional decrease of 40 % in J[NO 2 →NO+O], and resulting in the reduction of ozone production by 5 – 10 %. Observed ozone production efficiencies are evaluated as a function of distance from MCMA, and by modeled influence from MCMA. These tend to be much lower closer to MCMA, or in those points where modeled contribution from MCMA is large. This research shows that MCMA emissions do effect on regional air quality and photochemistry, both contributing large amounts of ozone and its precursors, but with caveat that aerosol concentrations hinder formation of ozone to its potential due to its reduction in photolysis rates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Previous {{studies have}} {{presented}} {{clear evidence that}} the Northern Hemisphere total ozone field can be separated into distinct regimes (tropical, midlatitude, polar, and arctic) the boundaries of which {{are associated with the}} subtropical and polar upper troposphere fronts, and in the winter, the polar vortex. This paper presents a study of total ozone variability within these regimes, from 1979 – 2003, using data from the TOMS instruments. The change in <b>ozone</b> within each <b>regime</b> for the period January 1979 –May 1991, a period of rapid total ozone change, was studied in detail. Previous studies had observed a zonal linear trend of − 3. 15 % per decade for the latitude band 25 ◦ – 60 ◦ N. When the ozone field is separated by regime, linear trends of − 1. 4 %, 2. 3 %, and 3. 0 %, per decade for the tropical, midlatitude, and polar regimes, respectively, are observed.

40|$|The {{presence}} of stratospheric ozone {{is essential for}} the survival of life on the Earth's surface. The decrease in the column content of ozone over mid-latitudes from 1979 - 1991 has previously been attributed to destruction by anthropogenic halogens, and changes in the general circulation. The research presented here shows that a poleward movement of the subtropical and polar upper troposphere fronts is responsible for 35 % of this observed decrease. In Hudson et al. (2003) we showed that the Northern Hemisphere total ozone field could be separated into meteorological regimes, bounded by the subtropical and polar upper troposphere fronts. These regimes were characterized by relatively constant total ozone, tropopause height, and ozonepause height. Negative trends in total <b>ozone</b> within each <b>regime</b> were found for the time period January 1979 -May 1991. These trends corresponded to a statistically significant increase in the relative area of the tropical regime, and decrease in the relative area of the polar regime, indicating a net poleward movement of the subtropical and polar fronts over this time period. This poleward frontal movement was responsible for ~ 35 % of the negative zonal trend in total ozone over this time period and latitude range, the remaining 65 % being the result of total ozone changes within the meteorological <b>regimes.</b> <b>Ozone</b> and water vapor profiles from 1997 - 2004, from the HALOE and SAGE II satellite-based instruments, were classified by regime. Each regime was characterized by a distinct ozonepause and hygropause height, and profile shape below ~ 25 km, over a wide latitude range (25 °- 60 °N). Therefore, previously reported zonal trends in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere are a combination of both tropospheric and stratospheric air. Trends within each regime were calculated for both ozone and water vapor from 1997 - 2004 and from October 1984 -May 1991. The relationship between the observed zonal vertical trends and the trends within each regime were consistent with the idea of meteorological regimes and reinforce the major conclusion of this work. A true understanding of zonal trends in either the column or in the lower stratosphere involves understanding both changes within each regime and changes in the relative weighting of each regime over time...|$|R
