40|$|Abstract. Interest in {{hydrogen}} as a fuel {{has grown}} dramati-cally since 1990, and many advances in hydrogen production and utilization technologies have been made. However, hy-drogen storage technologies must be significantly advanced if a hydrogen based energy system, {{particularly in the}} trans-portation sector, is to be established. Hydrogen can be made available <b>on-board</b> <b>vehicles</b> in containers of compressed or liquefied H 2, in metal hydrides, via chemical storage or by gas-on-solid adsorption. Although each method possesses de-sirable characteristics, no approach satisfies all of the effi-ciency, size, weight, cost and safety requirements for trans-portation or utility use. Gas-on-solid adsorption is an inher-ently safe and potentially high energy density hydrogen stor-age method that could be extremely energy efficient.

The data collection infrastructure is connected to a traffic estimation server running the EnKF algorithm online, and the estimation results are broadcast in real time back to mobile phones and to the internet.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} diagnostic needs and methodologies in the automotive field. The field of automotive engineering has seen {{an explosion in the}} presence of electronic components and systems <b>on-board</b> <b>vehicles</b> since the 1970 s. This growth was initially motivated by the introduction of emissions regulations that led to the widespread application of electronic engine controls. A secondary but important consequence of these developments was the adoption of on-board diagnostics regulations aimed at insiring that emission control systems remained functional for a prescribed period of time (or vehicle mileage). In addition, the presence of micro-controllers on-board the vehicle led to a proliferation of functions implemented through electronic systems and related software, related to safety and customer convenience, creating the need for more sophisticated on-board diagnostics. Today, a significant percentage of the software code in an automobile is devoted to diagnostic functions.
