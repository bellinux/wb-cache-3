40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to compare a success rate of a chosen {{numerical}} weather prediction (NWP) models with a forecasting system <b>of</b> convective <b>precipitation</b> based on an analysis of ten historical weather events over the territory of the Zlin Region for the year 2015. This paper is based on a previous article “Evaluation of the accuracy of numerical weather prediction models”. The first chapter is a theoretical framework describing the current forecasting systems <b>of</b> convective <b>precipitation,</b> which are selected NWP models and forecasting system <b>of</b> convective <b>precipitation.</b> This chapter describes the principle of creating predictions and selection of individual NWP models. Furthermore, they are provided with basic information about the prediction <b>of</b> convective <b>precipitation.</b> The second chapter outlines the principles of the methods used for evaluating the success rate <b>of</b> forecast <b>precipitation.</b> In the discussion, results of these methods on selected historical weather situations are published.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{different}} studies referring to evolution <b>of</b> <b>precipitations</b> show that, on a worldwide scale, the climatic change appears as an intensification <b>of</b> <b>precipitations</b> and {{a recurrence of}} extreme events (more noticeable during the last decennia). These studies also show an increase <b>of</b> <b>precipitations</b> in equatorial areas and at Poles, {{at the expense of}} Mediterranean and of dry and temperate tropical areas. Nowadays, Mediterranean area is considered as a hot spot area of climate change. The impact of this change and the high human pressure on the environment would result in a shortage of water for about 290 million people. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze rainfall variability in a wide area of North Africa (from the Morocco in the west up to Tunisia in the east). This study is undertaken for a period of nearly half a century. The rainfall data were collected from 35 meteorological stations.

40|$|During {{the period}} of {{scientific}} campaign "Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosols, Clouds and Radiation 2004 " (ASTAR 2004), precipitation samples were collected in late spring at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard and their ionic components were analyzed in parallel with the measurement of properties of atmospheric aerosol particles at the same place. Backward trajectory analyses indicated that the air mass above the observatory initially dominated by air masses from the Arctic Ocean, then those from western Siberia and later those from Greenland and the Arctic Ocean. In the measurement period, six precipitation samples were obtained and five of them were analyzed their ionic components by ionchromatography. The concentrations <b>of</b> nss-sulphate in <b>precipitations</b> were between 1. 8 and 24. 6 ppm from which the scavenging ratio and scavenging coefficients were calculated using the data such as the concentrations of nss-sulphate in aerosol particles, amounts <b>of</b> <b>precipitations,</b> and the heights <b>of</b> <b>precipitations</b> obtained from radar echo data. The scavenging ratio ranged from 1. 0 × 10 6 to 17 × 10 6 which are comparable values reported in other areas. A detailed comparison between precipitation events and the number concentration of aerosol particles obtained from optical particle counters suggests that the type <b>of</b> <b>precipitations,</b> i. e. rain or snow, significantly affects the number concentrations of aerosol particles...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{is complex}} {{ecological}} factor described by different climate elements and phenomena that effect development of vegetation and its natural distribution. Climate elements {{the most important}} for vegetation are air temperatures, amount <b>of</b> <b>precipitations,</b> air humidity and wind. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine trends and changes of climate elements in the region of Mediterranean Croatia. Meteorological stations with the longest monitoring period in the region of the Mediterranean Croatia were chosen in order to determine trends of the climate elements. Decreasing or increasing trends of individual climate elements and indices were analysed using linear trend of regression analysis. Climate elements and indices of the referent line were compared with period between 1991 and 2010. At all meteorological stations was found negative trend of annual amount <b>of</b> <b>precipitations</b> and Lang ´s rain factor. Exception was meteorological station Rijeka with increase of annual amount <b>of</b> <b>precipitations</b> and Lang ´s rain factor. Trends of air temperatures at all meteorological stations were positive. Values of Lang ´s rain factor in the researched region are decreasing resulting higher aridity of the region. Trends of potential evapotranspiration are significant and positive at all meteorological stations. Changes of air temperatures are more noticeable than those <b>of</b> <b>precipitations,</b> while changes <b>of</b> potential evapotranspiration are more noticeable than those of Lang ´s rain factor.
