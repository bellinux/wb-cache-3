5|$|A {{number of}} ad hoc {{meetings}} of Heads of State <b>or</b> <b>Government</b> of the Euro area countries {{were held in}} 2010 and 2011 to discuss the Sovereign Debt crisis. It was agreed in October 2011 that they should meet regularly twice a year (with extra meetings if needed). This will normally be {{at the end of}} a European Council meeting and according to the same format (chaired by the President of the European Council and including the President of the Commission), but usually restricted to the (currently 19) Heads of State <b>or</b> <b>Government</b> of countries whose currency is the euro.|$|E
5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, <b>or</b> <b>government</b> administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted {{in a manner consistent with}} their constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E
5|$|As {{second in}} command of the SS and then Reichsführer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was not {{involved}} with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies <b>or</b> <b>government</b> departments, and he reported only to Hitler.|$|E

5|$|The European Council is {{the group}} of heads of state <b>or</b> <b>government</b> of the EU member states. It meets {{four times a year}} to define the Union's policy agenda and give impetus to integration.

5|$|At {{the request}} of the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, a panel of former justices and {{selected}} MPs was tasked with sorting through the documents, and determining the need to release or withhold them. To date, only about 4,000 out of the estimated 40,000 documents have been released, A final report released in June 2012 found no wrongdoing by Canadian Forces members, but did issue recommendations related to improving military policing and MPCC access to information and witnesses. The Canadian public generally held views that there was knowledge of detainee abuse by military <b>or</b> <b>government</b> officials. The issue has also led to scrutiny on detainee treatment by other Canadian departments and the armed forces of other nations.|$|E
5|$|Chinese society {{during the}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{was marked by}} {{political}} and legal reforms, a philosophical revival of Confucianism, {{and the development of}} cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade, industry, and maritime commerce. The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, <b>or</b> <b>government</b> employees working in mines or the salt marshes. Conversely, shopkeepers, artisans, city guards, entertainers, laborers, and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the Chinese gentry—a small, elite community of educated scholars and scholar-officials.|$|E

5|$|Cultivated plant {{taxonomy}} is {{one part of}} the study of horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, <b>or</b> <b>government</b> departments. Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about cultivated plants.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha, {{chief of}} the Western Naval Command, said the Ministry of Defence would scrap the ship as she had become very {{difficult}} to maintain and no private bidders had offered to fund the museum's operations. On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided to auction the ship. The Bombay High Court dismissed a public-interest lawsuit filed by Kiran Paigankar to stop the auction, stating the vessel's dilapidated condition did not warrant her preservation, nor were the necessary funds <b>or</b> <b>government</b> support available.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{government}} censorship was commonplace. Magazines {{were routinely}} confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; {{and virtually all}} anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, <b>or</b> <b>government</b> reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the First Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of the King <b>or</b> <b>government</b> in {{occupied}} Belgium, Mercier became the predominant figure in the country and a symbol of resilience. Because of his status, he could not be arrested without an outcry and, although lured back to the Vatican in 1915 to remove him from the country, he soon returned. His writings were banned, however, and copies of their work confiscated. In 1916, Mercier was officially prohibited from publishing pamphlets but continued to campaign against the deportation of workers and various other German policies. Initially opposed by Pope Benedict XV, who was anxious to remain neutral, the Pope was supportive of the Belgian church but encouraged it to moderate its stance to avoid confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Six of the {{cartoons}} were first reprinted by the Egyptian newspaper El Fagr on 17 October 2005, {{along with an}} article strongly denouncing them, but this did not provoke any condemnations or other reactions from religious <b>or</b> <b>government</b> authorities. Between October 2005 and early January 2006, examples of {{the cartoons}} were reprinted in major European newspapers from the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia, Romania, and Switzerland. After the beginning of major international protests, they were re-published around the globe, but primarily in continental Europe. The cartoons were not reprinted in any major newspapers in Canada, the United Kingdom, or many in the United States where articles covered the story without including them.|$|E
5|$|The European Council {{consists}} of the heads of state <b>or</b> <b>government</b> of the member states, alongside its own President and the Commission President (both non-voting). The meetings used to be regularly attended by the national foreign minister as well, and the Commission President likewise accompanied by {{another member of the}} Commission. However, since the Treaty of Lisbon, this has been discontinued, as the size of the body had become somewhat large following successive accessions of new Member States to the Union.|$|E

The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy also takes part in its meetings. Established as an informal summit in 1975, the European Council was formalised as an institution in 2009 upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its current President is Donald Tusk.|$|E
5|$|The Nationality Act of 1940 {{provided}} for {{loss of citizenship}} based on foreign military <b>or</b> <b>government</b> service, when coupled with citizenship in that foreign country. This statute also mandated loss of citizenship for desertion from the U.S. armed forces, remaining outside the United States in order to evade military service during wartime, or voting in a foreign election. The provision calling for loss of citizenship for foreign military service was held by the Supreme Court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary, in a 1958 case (Nishikawa v. Dulles), and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case (Trop v. Dulles).|$|E
5|$|The average SPAR {{officer was}} 29 years old, single, a college graduate, and had worked {{seven years in}} a {{professional}} or managerial position (in education <b>or</b> <b>government)</b> before entering the service. The average enlisted SPAR was 24 years old, single, a high school graduate, and had worked for over {{three years in a}} clerical or sales job before joining the service. The likelihood was that she came from the state of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, or California. The reasons for becoming a SPAR differed, but most likely it was patriotism, self-advancement, desire for travel and adventure, or the loss of a loved one in the war.|$|E

As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, a person born in a respectable family – kshatriya (warrior-caste), royal family <b>or</b> <b>government</b> official – who neglects his duty is thrown into this river of hell. The Vishnu Purana assigns it to the destroyer of a bee-hive or a town.|$|E
5|$|Waller taught Sunday school {{while in}} his early teens. When he was 15, he {{attended}} Williams College, from which he graduated in 1834. At Williams College, he came near to being expelled after arguing with a teacher. After Williams College, he considered being a lawyer, businessman <b>or</b> <b>government</b> worker. His brother William advised against his becoming a government worker or businessman, {{so he decided to}} become a minister. He attended the Princeton Theological Seminary starting in October 1834 and continuing for three years. Here he also came near to being expelled after a dispute with the teacher John Breckenridge. He graduated from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1837 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree. Waller moved to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1838.|$|E
5|$|In 1807 the Duchy of Warsaw was {{established}} in the recaptured territories, essentially as a satellite of Bonaparte's France. Dąbrowski became disappointed with Napoleon, who offered him monetary rewards, but no serious military <b>or</b> <b>government</b> position. He was also awarded the Virtuti Militari medal that year. Soon, however he set out to defend Poland against an Austrian invasion under the command of Prince Józef Poniatowski in 1809. Joining the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw shortly after the Battle of Raszyn, he took part in the first stages of the offensive on Galicia, and then organized the defense of Greater Poland. In June 1812 Dąbrowski commanded the 17th (Polish) Infantry Division in the V Corps of the Grande Armée, during Napoleon's invasion of Russia. However, by October the Franco-Russian war was over and the French forces, decimated by a severe winter, had to retreat. At the disastrous Battle of Berezina in late November that year, Dąbrowski was wounded, and his leadership and tactics in it were criticized. After the March reorganization of the Grande Armée, he commanded the 27th (Polish) Infantry Division in the VIII Corps. He commanded it at the Battle of Leipzig (1813), and subsequently on 28 October he became the {{commander in chief of the}} all remaining Polish forces in Napoleon's service, succeeding Antoni Paweł Sułkowski.|$|E
