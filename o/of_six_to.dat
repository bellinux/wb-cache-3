5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> seven years, while males become sexually mature at about 10 years old. The {{gestation}} period is around 15–16 months. The calf, which typically weighs , is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother {{for the first two}} to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.|$|E

5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led {{to rapid}} {{depopulation}} {{in many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E

5|$|At the 34th Session of the UN General Assembly, {{represent}}atives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and Democratic Kampuchea both claimed the right to represent their country. The former also notified the member nations of the UN Security Council {{that it was the}} sole legitimate representative of Kampuchea and its people. In response, the UN Credentials Committee decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> three, despite the Khmer Rouge's blood-stained record while in power. Accordingly, {{representatives of}} Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly, with strong support from China. By January 1980, 29 countries had established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, yet nearly 80 countries still recognised the legitimacy of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea. At the same time, the Western powers and the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) also voiced strong condemnation of Vietnam’s use of force to remove the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Météo-France issued their {{seasonal}} {{forecast of}} cyclone activity for the basin on November 12. MFR predicted a slightly below average to average season, citing {{the effects of}} a very strong El Niño event. Compared to an average of ten moderate tropical storms that usually form in the South-West Indian Ocean, a 70% chance was given to the probability <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> ten named storms forming. A 20% chance was given to the formation of only five cyclones or less, and a 10% was given to an above average level of activity. MRF expected that an above average number of named storms would develop in the central region of the basin (from 60°E to 77°E), and that there would be lower than average activity to the east of 77°E. Activity near normal was expected west of 60°E. MFR also predicted that the motion of cyclones during the season would have a stronger meridional component than normal, having a tendency to track south quickly.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of the ten}} {{tropical}} storms, seven reached hurricane intensity, {{of which}} four made landfall on the United States. The strongest hurricane was a Category3 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale which struck New England at that intensity, one of four storms to do so. It left heavy damage, killing at least twelve people. The most notable hurricane of the season was the Saxby Gale, which was predicted nearly a year in advance. The hurricane was one <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> produce hurricane-force winds in Maine, where it left heavy damage and flooding. The Saxby Gale left 37deaths along its path, with its destruction greatest along the Bay of Fundy; there, the hurricane produced a 70.9ft (21.6m) high tide near {{the head of the}} bay.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E

5|$|Sledd {{and members}} of the faculty were {{actively}} involved in urging Florida's state government to combine the state's several small institutions of higher education. The university consolidation movement gained the political backing of newly elected Florida Governor Napoleon B. Broward, and in 1905 the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which abolished the hodge-podge of state-supported colleges and consolidated their assets and programs into a new comprehensive university and land-grant college for white men, and a liberal arts college and normal school for white women. The Act mandated the merger of four separate institutions, including the existing University of Florida at Lake City, into the consolidated men's university—the new University of the State of Florida. By a vote <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> four, the new Board of Control charged with the governance of the consolidated institutions selected Gainesville as the location for the new men's state university.|$|E
5|$|The academy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} in Europe, operating at a cost of £5million a year. The main cost is the dormitory, La Masia itself. The minimum age for the youth program is six years; each year, more than 1,000boys from the ages <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> eight try out for admittance. The best 200 are selected. The club also actively seeks for prospective students; it employs a system in which 15scouts are deployed in Catalonia, 15 in the rest of Spain and 10 scattered throughout the world. To alleviate the expenses of this scouting, the club has an agreement with 15 local clubs for them to train players who are not ready for entry into the youth academy. In return, FC Barcelona gives money, coaching and technical advice to these clubs for their services. While expanding its operations abroad, the club established five schools in Mexico and one in Egypt; successful applicants to these schools become full-time students, receiving academic education and football training.|$|E
5|$|The court {{controversy}} {{dominated the}} legislative session. Crittenden joined the Old Court {{majority in the}} House in passing a measure to abolish the New Court. The bill {{was killed in the}} Senate, however, by the tie-breaking vote of Lieutenant Governor Robert B. McAfee. Crittenden later served on a committee <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> resolve the conflict, but to no avail. He was unwilling to accept a solution whereby all the justices resigned from both courts, and the governor would appoint a reorganized court made up equally of Old Court and New Court supporters. This position cost him the support of some New Court partisans that had voted for him in the previous election, and he was not returned to the House in 1826. Ultimately, Old Court partisans gained control of both houses of the legislature, and the New Court was abolished permanently in December 1826.|$|E

If weather conditions are favorable and food is readily available, growth is rapid and females may reproduce at {{less than three years}} of age and a total length of as little as 60cm. The young are born in August or September, while mating may occur during any of the warmer months of the year, at least in certain parts of its range.|$|E

5|$|Young velvet bellies feed {{mainly on}} krill and small bony fish, {{transitioning}} to squid and shrimp {{as they grow}} larger. There is evidence that individuals also move into deeper water as they age. This species exhibits a number of adaptations to living in the deep sea, such as specialized T-cells and liver proteins {{for dealing with the}} higher concentrations of heavy metals found there. Velvet bellies often carry a heavy parasite load. It is ovoviviparous, giving birth to litters <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>to</b> 20 young every two to three years. This species has virtually no commercial value, but large numbers are caught as bycatch in deepwater commercial fisheries. Although it has been assessed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the heavy fishing pressure throughout its range and its slow reproductive rate are raising conservation concerns.|$|E
