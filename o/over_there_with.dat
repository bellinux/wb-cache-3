500|$|Of the {{multiple}} music critics who {{commented on the}} song, the majority praised [...] "Skins musical structure and Rihanna's vocal performance. Apart from writing about the song's composition, Daw called the ballad [...] "smoldering" [...] and compared the last minute of the song to Sades [...] "No Ordinary Love" [...] for the song's sensual content, but noted that Adu's song is not as lyrically graphic as [...] "Skin". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that Rihanna's sensuality in the song is evoked though her use of sexually suggestive moaning and heavy breathing, adding to the [...] "slow, torrid buildup". Colin Gentry of 4Music noted that Rihanna appears to be transitioning from singing songs about partying and dancing in clubs to singing about her sexual fantasies and desires, writing [...] "Rihanna swaggers through the album as {{a woman on the}} prowl, taking her conquests from the clubs to the bedroom. Demanding to know 'why are you standing <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> your clothes on?' on sultry track Skin, the Barbadian clearly means business." [...] Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media concurred with Stern with regard to [...] "Skin" [...] being the singer's most mature song to date, writing [...] "Skin' is her sexiest song yet, a haunted, near-dubstep stunner that wouldn't sound totally out of place on Massive Attack's Mezzanine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schembechler {{thought so}} much of Revelli’s {{performance}} that he invited him back every year to teach the freshmen what Michigan tradition was about. [...] Schembechler recalled, “He was absolutely great, and the freshmen absolutely loved it. [...] And let me tell you, {{every one of those}} freshmen came out of that session with Revelli knowing ‘The Victors.’ [...] They knew the words, they knew how to sing it, and they knew how to emphasize the right spots. [...] They flat out knew how to do it. [...] And it was only because he came <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the idea that those guys were {{going to come out of}} that meeting room knowing how to sing this fight song the right way or else! [...] And they did. [...] That was Bill Revelli.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister Justin Trudeau {{discussed}} the situation during {{a telephone call}} to State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and the Canadian government pledged [...] for relief support of Rohingya refugees. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the violence against the Rohingya [...] "looks a lot like ethnic cleansing". According to the parliamentary secretary of the Canadian foreign ministry, [...] "The violence is still ongoing so obviously there's a failure on part of the military, {{on the part of}} the government. I don't think we heard the end of this yet about what our role is going to be. As I said, we are still assessing the situation and we're looking for ways for Canada to be constructive. We are in discussion as well with our embassy <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> <b>with</b> our officials on the ground". The Canadian government has faced internal pressure to act, and pro-Rohingya protests in Toronto included Buddhist members of the Toronto city council.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is true enough, and I {{expect you}} will find fast-sailing craft--privateers, and such like--will dodge in and out; but a {{merchantman}} won't like to venture over {{this side of the}} Straits, but will keep along the Moorish coasts. You see, they can't keep along the Spanish side without the risk of being picked up, by the gunboats and galleys with the blockading fleet. There are a dozen small craft lying <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> now, <b>with</b> the men-of-war.|$|R
6000|$|... "Left <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the old women. Couldn't be fetched over. But {{there are}} some pretty young babies in that bunch--need their mothers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly what I want to know," [...] said George. He {{indicated}} the collar-stud merchant. [...] "The gentleman <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the portable Woolworth-bargain-counter {{seems to me}} to have the best theory." ...|$|E
60|$|They fell in <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the Dutch from Rotterdam, Amsterdam, {{and a lot}} {{of other}} places with profane names, and it is from that gang that Mr. Depew is descended.|$|E

[...] "I want {{to shout}} and {{to sing and}} to cry 'Vive l'Empereur' till those {{frowning}} mountains <b>over</b> <b>there</b> echo <b>with</b> my shouts--and I'll have none of your English stiffness and reserve and curbing of enthusiasm to-day. I am a lunatic if you will--an escaped lunatic--if to be mad with joy be a proof of insanity. Clyffurde, my dear friend," [...] he added more soberly, [...] "I am honestly sorry for you to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sam {{gave his}} pony a squeeze with {{his knees and}} [...] "shoved" [...] down the wagon trail that {{connected}} his ranch with the old, open Government road. It was eight o'clock, and already beginning to be very warm. He should have started three hours earlier. Chapman ranch was only eighteen miles away, {{but there was a}} road for only three miles of the distance. He had ridden <b>over</b> <b>there</b> once <b>with</b> one of the Half-Moon cowpunchers, and he had the direction well-defined in his mind.|$|R
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Alexandria, Shahrbaraz and his forces {{extended}} Sasanian rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands, and a certain Sahralanyozan was appointed as its governor. In 622, Heraclius counter-attacked against the Sasanian Empire in Anatolia. Shahrbaraz was sent <b>over</b> <b>there</b> to deal <b>with</b> him, but was eventually defeated by him.|$|R

60|$|The funny part {{used to be}} {{that people}} always pitied us when the time came for us to return. They said we must be so lonesome <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> <b>with</b> no other {{children}} near us, and not even a woman to look after us.|$|E
60|$|Rock Lake! When I {{had driven}} <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> my friends, {{we had taken}} luncheon at the inn and {{returned}} in the afternoon. And what did they know of Rock Lake? Who had told them of it? That officious Barker, of course.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{more than}} he ought to, if he expects to trust you with all HIS affairs," [...] said the girl shortly; [...] "but you had better tell him you have changed your mind at once, before he makes any further {{calculations}} on your staying.

60|$|She had but one jealousy--he {{admired and}} trusted Mrs. Baker and {{occasionally}} rode <b>over</b> <b>there</b> to talk <b>with</b> her, and Fan {{could not understand}} that he sought intellectual refuge from the mental squalor of the Blondells, but she perceived a difference in his glance on his return. Mrs. Baker, being a keen-sighted, practical little woman, soon fell upon the plainest kind of speech with the young Englishman.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right, sir. I was <b>over</b> <b>there</b> {{last year}} <b>with</b> Sir Henry--in New York, sir, and I saw {{something}} of the men-servants and their ways. They were paid for service, sir, {{and they did not}} give what they were paid for. You talk about self-respect, sir, in this article. Well now, my self-respect wouldn't let me treat a master as I've seen them do over there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very sad," [...] {{said the}} earl, remembering, however, {{that he had}} ridden <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> his heart full of joy,--of joy occasioned by that very {{catastrophe}} which now, following his friend's words like a parrot, he declared to be so very sad.|$|E

6000|$|... "Partly," [...] said Matlack. [...] "I {{understand}} the fellow is still <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> those two young men. I don't suppose they'll send him {{off in the}} rain, and as he isn't in my camp, I can't interfere. But it may rain {{for two or three}} days." ...|$|E
50|$|After Smith's forces {{arrived in}} Alexandria on April 26, they were {{temporarily}} deployed to prevent attacks during Joseph Bailey's {{attempts to get}} Porter's squadron <b>over</b> the rapids <b>there,</b> <b>with</b> the aid of Bailey's Dam and two small wing dams upstream. After this task was completed, Banks resumed his retreat on May 13, leaving Alexandria in flames.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just left}} uncle making {{a call on}} a parishioner next door, and was going home with Jocasta (a peon servant of her uncle's), when I heard the music, and dropped in. I don't know what has become of her," [...] she added, glancing round the room again; [...] "she seemed {{perfectly}} wild when she saw that creature <b>over</b> <b>there</b> bounding about <b>with</b> his handkerchiefs. You were speaking to him just now. Do tell me--is he real?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is evident}} that the land <b>over</b> <b>there</b> is peopled <b>with</b> savages who, probably, never saw white men before. If we treat these young fellows kindly, and send them away with gifts in their hands, we shall, no doubt, make friends of the savages. If we treat them ill, or kill them, their {{relations}} will come over, mayhap in swarms, and drive us into the sea. I drop the Swinton law of might being right, and ask you who are now the law-makers--which is it to be--kindness or cruelty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{eleven years}} old. I haven't any father or mother, they're dead. I live <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Stephen Kane. Stephen is splendid.

6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with {{comparing}} it with Riverside Drive?" [...] questioned Andy, with a grin. [...] "Don't you see the Hudson River <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the stately warships?" [...] and as he spoke {{he pointed to a}} pond of water, the surface of which was black with oil and on which floated several logs.|$|E
6000|$|... "There couldn't be a nicer place, {{and it is}} {{very kind}} of you to get it ready. Spread the shawls and settle Jill, then you needn't think of us any more, but go and {{scramble}} with Frank.

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} {{as the lead}} single from The Original Soundtrack {{on the grounds that}} the band had reservations regarding the 6:00+ ballad [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] as the lead single. In most territories, the song was backed with [...] "Lazy Ways". In America, 10cc were unheard of until after the release of I'm Not in Love, so they re-released the record <b>over</b> <b>there</b> in 1976 <b>with</b> [...] "Channel Swimmer". Channel Swimmer appears as a bonus track on the Japanese version of The Original Soundtrack.|$|R
60|$|Blindly ranging to and fro, they next {{saw a man}} ploughing. Advancing slowly, the {{wanderer}} met him by {{a little}} heap of ruinous burnt masonry, like a tumbled chimney, what seemed the jams of the fire-place, now aridly stuck <b>over</b> here and <b>there,</b> <b>with</b> thin, clinging, round, prohibitory mosses, like executors' wafers. Just as the oxen were bid stand, the stranger's plough was hitched over sideways, by sudden contact with some sunken stone at the ruin's base.|$|R
6000|$|This mad {{excitement}} <b>over,</b> <b>there</b> returned, <b>with</b> ten-fold force, {{the dreadful}} consciousness of his crime. He looked suspiciously about him, {{for the men}} were conversing in groups, and he feared {{to be the subject}} of their talk. The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together. He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment. He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the murder. 'He has gone to Birmingham, they say,' said one: 'but they'll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there'll be a cry all through the country.' ...|$|R
6000|$|One day, {{toward the}} end of his second week in the village, the Supervisor said: [...] "Well, now, if you're ready to {{experiment}} I'll send you over to Settle, the ranger, on the Horseshoe. He's a little lame on his pen-hand side, and you may be able to help him out. Maybe I'll ride <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> you. I want to line out some timber sales on the west side of Ptarmigan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There he is!" [...] Eve exclaimed suddenly. [...] "Coming toward us, too! Do {{please take}} this opportunity, Paul, {{and see if}} you can find out anything.

I will go and talk to your sister. I think she is <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Captain Green." ...|$|E

[...] "This aint a time for strangers; besides, a young fellow like {{you ought to be}} ashamed to show {{yourself}} when you ought to be <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Lee.

Go along! you will get no shelter here. I would scorn to have such as you inside the door." ...|$|E
5000|$|Al-Qaeda {{intended}} {{this first}} {{attack against the}} United States {{as part of a}} larger campaign. At the time, the United States had been intervening in Somalia in an effort to stabilize the country and get aid to those who were in need during a military campaign known as Operation Restore Hope. Earlier in 1992, al-Qaeda allegedly was training Somali militants to fight against US forces. Links have been made between this training and the devastation of the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993, which resulted in 18 deaths and 80 wounded US troops. In March 1997, bin Laden said, [...] "With Allah’s grace, Muslims <b>over</b> <b>there</b> cooperated <b>with</b> some Arab mujaheddin who were in Afghanistan… against the American occupation troops and killed large numbers of them," [...] in an interview on CNN.|$|R
