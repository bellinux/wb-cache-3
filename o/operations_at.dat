40|$|An {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass {{spectrometer}} system is described in which the quadrupole mass filter is operated in the third stability region with Mathieu parameters (a, q) ≈ (3, 3). <b>Operation</b> <b>at</b> the upper tip of this region is found to give generally better sensitivity and resolution than <b>operation</b> <b>at</b> the lower tip. A limiting resolution at half height of 4000 at m/z 59 is possible with <b>operation</b> <b>at</b> the upper tip. This resolution is insufficient to separate atomic ions from molecular ions of the same nominal mass except in favorable cases. However, <b>operation</b> <b>at</b> moderate resolution (R 1 / 2 = 500 to 1000) is found to give very high abundance sensitivity (> 107).
