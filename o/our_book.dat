It contains many interesting memories, especially those relating to the aborigines. After a friendship of nearly 30 years Justin McCarthy died in April 1912. Towards the end of that year Praed published <b>Our</b> <b>Book</b> of Memories: Letters of Justin McCarthy to Mrs Campbell Praed, with connecting explanations.|$|E
500|$|For {{months on}} end Jeannette hardly moved at all; De Long {{recorded}} on March 2 that their position was almost precisely {{what it had}} been three months earlier. On May 5, the ship passed {{to the west of the}} 180° meridian, but two months later had retreated back to the other side of the line. [...] The summer brought no relief; although it briefly seemed possible in August that Jeannette might break free and find open water, this proved a false hope. The condition of Danenhower was a further source of anxiety. His syphilis began to take toll of his body, particularly his left eye which, despite Ambler's repeated operations—stoically endured, given the lack of anesthetic—left the navigator largely incapacitated and unable to perform his duties. On the last day of 1880 De Long wrote in his journal: [...] "I begin the new year by turning over a new leaf, and I hope to God we are turning over a new leaf in <b>our</b> <b>book</b> of luck".|$|E
500|$|Upon AJ's arrival, Ally Ross of The Sun said: [...] "New arrivals have {{included}} [...] Masood's supposedly funny and long-lost brother AJ, {{who made the}} fatal mistake of arriving with the line: 'Do I look like a comedian?' No. You look like David Baddiel. Now kindly piss off". Kay Ribeiro from Heat said, [...] "We like new boy AJ. Not only is he a laugh [...] but he's providing light relief during [...] and 's split, which is making us sad." [...] Laura Morgan from All About Soap hoped that AJ would become a permanent character after his initial appearances. In October 2012, Allison Jones from Inside Soap said, [...] "AJ has proved the perfect tonic for a family almost constantly dogged with crisis [...] his tenacious ability to wind up Zainab never fails to entertain! AJ may have only been in Walford for a few months, but it already feels as if we've known him for ages." [...] She also called Sharma and Ganatra, [...] "a killer on-screen pairing". Nathan Bevan from Welsh newspaper Western Mail praised Sharma's role in EastEnders, naming {{him as one of}} [...] "50 things you should look forward to in Wales" [...] in 2013, saying, [...] "Anyone who injects a little sunshine into the 'Chekhov with a covered market' drudgery of EastEnders should be automatically given an Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting Award in <b>our</b> <b>book.</b> So well done Newport's very own Phaldut Sharma who, since arriving in Walford as Masood Ahmed's gregarious but aggro-magnet brother AJ, has helped break up the unrelenting, bicker-filled misery of Albert Square." [...] Bevan later said that Sharma has [...] "shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise-cracking, wheeler-dealing AJ Ahmed", adding, [...] "He's the gregarious, trouble-magnet who's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre, squabble-filled soapiness of Albert Square." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said AJ was a [...] "find" [...] but thought the writers might not be sure {{what to do with the}} character. Vicky Prior from the Metro said AJ [...] "has lit up the square with his gently laddish behaviour." ...|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the first}} {{visitors}} was a Hindoo gentleman, who told him, [...] "Sir William Jones was a great man and understood <b>our</b> <b>books,</b> but he attended only to our law.

2500|$|Thomas's agency, Nine Speakers, Inc., {{immediately}} {{dropped her}} as a client because of her remarks. Craig Crawford, who co-authored Listen up, Mr. President, said [...] "I ... {{will no longer be}} working with Helen on <b>our</b> <b>book</b> projects." [...] Her scheduled delivery of a commencement speech at Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland, was canceled by the school. The White House Correspondents' Association, over which she once presided, issued a statement calling her remarks [...] "indefensible." [...] In January 2011, the Society of Professional Journalists voted to retire the Helen Thomas Award for Lifetime Achievement.|$|E
2500|$|In Fall 2006, the Coggin College of Business {{was added}} to the Princeton Review's Best 282 Business Schools list. Robert Franek, Vice President of publishing, stated: [...] "e chose schools for this book based on our high regard for their {{academic}} programs and offerings, institutional data we collect from the schools, and the candid opinions of students attending them who rate and report on their campus experiences at the schools. We are pleased to recommend the University of North Florida's Coggin College of Business to readers of <b>our</b> <b>book</b> and users of our website {{as one of the best}} institutions they could attend to earn an MBA." ...|$|E

60|$|I had {{my private}} doubts {{in regard to}} this matter of price. I am afraid that Euphemia {{generally}} set down the lowest price and the best things. She {{did not mean to}} mislead, and her plan certainly made <b>our</b> <b>book</b> attractive. But it did not work very well in practice. We have a friend who undertook to furnish her house by <b>our</b> <b>book,</b> and she never could get the things as cheaply as we had them quoted.|$|E
6000|$|Clarke went on: [...] "We must {{continue}} to let him think his advice and aid invaluable till <b>our</b> <b>book</b> is out, then we can cut loose from him. Our policy--" ...|$|E
60|$|We were obliged {{indeed to}} give up the idea of {{following}} the plan detailed in <b>our</b> <b>book,</b> because we hadn't the sum upon which the furnishing of a small house was therein based.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposition}} {{was made}} by me that since <b>our</b> <b>books</b> were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient {{for us to have}} them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing <b>our</b> <b>books</b> to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Sir Gervaise," [...] exclaimed Greenly, [...] "I {{know better}} than that. Red above, and blue beneath, with the {{distinguishing}} pennant beneath, make fourteen, in <b>our</b> <b>books,</b> now!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Won't it be glorious!" [...] said Euphemia to me. [...] "We can first make a kitchen, {{and then}} a dining-room, and a bedroom, {{and then a}} parlor--just in {{the order in which}} <b>our</b> <b>book</b> says they ought to be furnished." ...|$|E

60|$|We give a {{pleasant}} letter to Mrs. Storrar, for whom, {{and for her}} husband, Dr. Storrar, Charles Dickens had affectionate regard, because we are glad to have their names in <b>our</b> <b>book.</b> The letter speaks for itself and needs no explanation.|$|E
6000|$|At {{least in}} {{pleasant}} company We bookish ghosts, perchance, may flit; A man may turn a page, and sigh, Seeing one's name, {{to think of}} it.

6000|$|Note 3. We had {{intended}} to devote much larger space to this most interesting line, but the nature of <b>our</b> <b>book</b> forbids it.

60|$|Here's <b>our</b> <b>book</b> in form at last, and {{it seems}} to me just a nice size, and on the whole very taking.

60|$|Charles Dickens's {{correspondence}} with his solicitor and excellent friend, Mr. Frederic Ouvry (now a vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries), was {{almost entirely of}} a business character; but we are glad to give one or two notes to that gentleman, although of little public interest, {{in order to have}} the name in <b>our</b> <b>book</b> of one of the kindest of our own friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "A world full {{of unknown}} dangers," [...] resumed the clergyman. [...] "Your proper place was surely the natural {{surroundings}} {{that are part of}} you.

5000|$|Lets get {{one thing}} out of the way: Mexican {{immigration}} is an oxymoron. Mexicans are indigenous. So, in a strange way, Im pleased that the racist folks of Arizona have officially declared, in banning me alongside Urrea, Baca, and Castillo, that their anti-immigration laws are also anti-Indian. Im also strangely pleased that the folks of Arizona have officially announced their fear of an educated underclass. You give those brown kids some books about brown folks and what happens? Those brown kids change the world. In the effort to vanish <b>our</b> <b>books,</b> Arizona has actually given them enormous power. Arizona has made <b>our</b> <b>books</b> sacred documents now.|$|R
