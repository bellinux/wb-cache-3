50|$|A {{hot plate}} is a {{portable}} self-contained tabletop small appliance that features one, {{two or more}} electric heating elements or gas burners. A hot plate {{can be used as}} a stand-alone appliance, but is often used as a substitute for one of the burners from an <b>oven</b> <b>range</b> or a kitchen stove. Hot plates are often used for food preparation, generally in locations where a full kitchen stove would not be convenient or practical. A hot plate can have a flat surface, or round surface. Hot plates can be used for traveling or in areas without electricity.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, Billings and {{his team}} built the “Hydrogen Homestead” prototype, a home which {{included}} hydrogen-run heat pump, water heater, <b>oven,</b> <b>range,</b> fireplace log, outdoor grill, a car and tractor. The Homestead project resulted {{in the development of}} some innovative hydrogen applications and demonstrated that hydrogen was compatible with existing home appliances. Originally part of the Hydrogen Homestead Project, the hydrogen-fueled Cadillac Seville featured a dual-fuel system, hydrogen and gasoline, which could be switched back and forth. This made the vehicle practical for everyday use at a time when hydrogen availability was not abundant. Its improved metal hydride storage system operated at a lower temperature than previous units, allowing a cost saving on construction material. The Cadillac was featured in the 1977 inaugural parade for President Jimmy Carter.|$|E

Change of EPA and DHA contents by cooking was investigated by gas chromatography. The contents of EPA and DHA of pacific saury were reduced by cooking. The most profound decreases in EPA and DHA contents occurred when pacific saury was fried. It has been demonstrated that standard EPA and DHA were decomposed about 50 % by heating for 10 min. at 80 ℃.

40|$|We wish {{to report}} on the effect of cooking on the {{properties}} and amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in fish, Pasific Saury. Change of EPA and DHA contents by cooking was investigated by gas chromatography. The contents of EPA and DHA of pacific saury were reduced by cooking. The most profound decreases in EPA and DHA contents occurred when pacific saury was broiled and boiled. The EPA and DHA were decreased to about 36 % and 37 % of the initial values by cooking of broil for 2 min., respectively. The EPA and DHA were decreased to about 30 % and 36 % by cooking of boil for 2 min., respectively. The EPA and DHA were decreased to about 52 % and 49 % by cooking of steam for 2 min., respectively. The EPA and DHA were decreased to about 81 % and 77 % by cooking of fry for a min., respectively. The EPA and DHA were decreased to about 72 % and 67 % by cooking of <b>oven</b> <b>range</b> for a min., respectivily. It has been demonstrated the stability of the EPA and DHA to cooking methods. 　本研究では，魚（サンマ）を調理加熱した際のE　PA及びDHAの含有量の変化について，調理方法と加熱時間及び加熱温度との関係から調べて次のような結論を得た。 1) EPA及びDHA含有量は，焼く・煮る・蒸す・揚げるの調理方法において，最短加熱　時間の 2 分で著しく減少した。加熱温度がそれぞれ異なる調理法にもかかわらず，EPA及びDHA残存率は，最長の加熱時間の時点では，約 10 ～ 20 ％と大差はなかった。またレンジ・揚げるの調理法では，それぞれ 2 分， 1 分の加熱時間で急激な減少が見られた。 2) 脂質中に占めるEPA及びDHAの割合（％）は，生，調理法及び加熱時間による違いでは，煮る調理法によるEPAを例外として，ほとんど差が認められなかった。 3) EPA及びDHAの体内摂取量を高める最適条件は脂質が溶け出ないような調理法で，しかも短時間の加熱が必要である...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an eight}} tier (including a tier for end users) supply chain whose end product is an <b>oven</b> <b>range.</b> Categories of quality attributes were determined and seven entities (representing seven different levels in this supply chain) were interviewed on topics that included definitions of quality for each {{organization in the}} chain along with the inter-organizational effects of quality within the supply chain. Ross (1998) stated that end customer satisfaction could only occur when the entire supply channel {{is focused on the}} same quality and value added activities. Our study found a successful supply chain whose entities were not focused on the same quality goals. Our findings indicated that quality goals were not standardized in this supply chain. Quality goals varied for each organization and most did not focus on end customer satisfaction. Suppliers were not effectively managed in this supply chain, most likely due to their lack of definition and communication of standardized quality goals. Standardized quality goals did not contribute to the success of this supply chain. This supply chain is very successful without standardized quality goals as well as no common focus on the end user. To conclude that this chain is dysfunctional and/or incapable would be incorrect. Market share is increasing for Whirlpool, as are supplier sales. Quality of the ranges is increasing while cost of the ranges continues to decrease. Perhaps the chain has the minimum level of inter-organizational exchange of quality attributes that it needs to be successful for a mature, stable product line. It is evident that this type of quality information and management would not have the same level of success if there were a market shake up due to a new, innovative competitor with a dramatically different range...|$|E

Minimum self-heating temperatures (SHT's) in the <b>oven</b> <b>ranged</b> from 350 C for a lignite and high-volatile C bituminous (hvCb) coal, to 1350 C for two low-volatile bituminous (lvb) coals. An empirical expression was determined predicting a bituminous coal's minimum SHT in the adiabatic oven based on the coal's dry ash-free oxygen content. Several factors that can affect the self-heating process were also evaluated. The self-~eating tendency of a coal increased when the coal was dried and exposed to humidified air, and was dependent on the particle size and oxygen concentration of the air. A new moderate-scale apparatus is described, in which the self-heating tendencies of larger coal samples, 3 kg, can be evaluated. The minimum SHT's of two coals were determined {{and the results were}} in good agreement with those found in the adiabatic oven.
