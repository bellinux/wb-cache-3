5|$|The Adventure of Link {{plays out}} in a two-mode dynamic. The overworld, {{the area where the}} {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> occurs in other The Legend of Zelda games, is still from a top-down perspective, but it now serves as a hub to the other areas. Whenever Link enters a new area such as a town, the game switches to a side-scrolling view. This mode is where most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> takes place, and, with the exception of traveling across lava and water, it is the only mode in which Link can take damage and be killed.|$|E

Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891, Berkman {{learned that}} Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, whom he admired, had {{canceled}} an American speaking tour {{on the basis that}} it was too expensive for the struggling anarchist movement.

5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get to see more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action,</b> as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers {{thought that the}} game had too many redundancies in the cases and left too little control to the player, leading to the game being boring at times.

40|$|People can {{communicate}} by using hand actions, e. g., signs. Understanding communicative <b>actions</b> requires that <b>the</b> observer {{knows that the}} actor has an intention to communicate and <b>the</b> meanings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions.</b> Here, we investigated how this prior knowledge affects processing of observed actions. We used functional MRI to determine changes in action processing when non-signers were told that <b>the</b> observed <b>actions</b> are communicative (i. e., signs) and learned <b>the</b> meanings <b>of</b> half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions.</b> Processing <b>of</b> hand <b>actions</b> activated <b>the</b> left and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, BA 44 and 45) when <b>the</b> communicative intention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actor was known, even when <b>the</b> meanings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> remained unknown. These regions were not active when the observers {{did not know about}} <b>the</b> communicative nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand <b>actions.</b> These findings suggest that the left and right IFG play a role in understanding <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actor, but do not process visuospatial features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communicative <b>actions.</b> Knowing <b>the</b> meanings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand <b>actions</b> further enhanced activity in <b>the</b> anterior part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IFG (BA 45), the inferior parietal lobule and posterior inferior and middle temporal gyri in the left hemisphere. These left-hemisphere language regions could provide a link between meanings and observed <b>actions.</b> In sum, <b>the</b> findings provide evidence for <b>the</b> segregation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> networks involved in <b>the</b> neural processing <b>of</b> visuospatial features of communicative hand actions and those involved in understanding the actor’s intention and <b>the</b> meanings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R
