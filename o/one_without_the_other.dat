25|$|The Heavenly Doctrine {{rejects the}} concept of {{salvation}} through faith-alone (sola-fide in Latin), since he considered both faith and charity necessary for salvation, not <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although {{it must be a}} faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to The Heavenly Doctrine, is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} relative state formulation, Everett proposed {{that there is}} one universal wavefunction that describes the objective reality of the whole universe. He stated that when multiple subsystems interact, the total system becomes a superposition of these subsystems. This includes observers and measurement systems, which become part of one universal state (the wavefunction) that is always described via the Schrödinger Equation (or its relativistic alternative). That is, they become entangled such that one cannot define <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Thus, each subsystems state can only be described relative to each subsystem with which it interacts (hence the name relative state).|$|E

2500|$|What we {{have here}} {{is an example of a}} [...] "fluctuation-dissipation elation".

The fluctuations and the dissipation go hand in hand we cannot have <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> In the current example the coupling of a dipole oscillator to the electromagnetic field has a dissipative component, in the form of the zero-point (vacuum) field; given the existence of radiation reaction, the vacuum field must also exist in order to preserve the canonical commutation rule and all it entails.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{argue that}} the work of Pierre Bourdieu (1903 - 2002) can be {{understood}} as composing of three pillars: (1) „epistemologization“ of social science, (2) attempt to overcome classical philosophical dualisms of Western thought, and (3) integration of scientific rigour into political engagement. This paper focuses on the second pillar by introducing to the reader the most fundamental concepts of Pierre Bourdieu´s sociology: concepts of social field, forms of capital, and habitus. Emphasis is given on how are these concepts intertwined and how {{it is not possible to}} understand <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>others...</b>|$|R

2500|$|... "Temptation" [...] and [...] "The Hawaiian War Chant" [...] are {{percussion}} {{features that}} have been played by the MMB for over 45 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. [...] "Temptation" [...] is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. [...] "Temptation" [...] is played first. Followed by [...] "The Hawaiian War Chant," [...] which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, [...] "Because you can't have <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> 'The Hawaiian War Chant.'" [...] Until 1980, Temptation and the Hawaiian War Chant were generally not played together in a season until the Homecoming game, when the Alumni Band ("the Blast from the Past") would join in. Before Homecoming, in those years prior to 1980, the band would play Temptation, then the PA announcer would usually say that fans {{would have to wait}} for the other. Both percussion features have long been fan favorites. During the post-game band show, when it comes time for Temptation, the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{different}} pathways in the brain that control different functions {{of what is known}} inclusively as the visuo-spatial sketchpad. [...] The sketchpad consists of the spatial short-term memory and the object memory. [...] The spatial short-term memory is how one is able to learn and thus remember [...] "where" [...] they are in comparative representation to other objects. [...] The object memory of the visuo-spatial sketchpad is essential in learning and remembering [...] "what" [...] an object is. [...] It {{should be noted that the}} differences between these two differing visual abilities is due in large part because of different pathways of each of the abilities in the brain. The visual pathway in the brain that detects spatial representation of a person to and within their environment is the dorsal stream. The visual pathway that determines objects shapes, sizes, colors and other definitive characteristics is called the ventral stream. Each of these two streams runs independent of one another so that the visual system may process <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> (like in brain damage for instance) or both simultaneously. [...] The two streams do not depend on one another, so if one is functioning manipulatively, the other can still send its information through.|$|E

Such a theory has met with resistance: Macdonald (1962) and Harris (1971) claimed that extracting power from the zero-point energy to be impossible, so FDT could not be true. Grau and Kleen (1982) and Kleen (1986), argued that the Johnson noise of a resistor connected to an antenna must satisfy Planck's thermal radiation formula, thus the noise must be zero at zero temperature and FDT must be invalid. Kiss (1988) pointed out that the existence of the zero-point term may indicate that there is a renormalization problem—i.e., a mathematical artifact—producing an unphysical term that is not actually present in measurements (in analogy with renormalization problems of ground states in quantum electrodynamics). Later, Abbott et al. (1996) arrived at a different but unclear conclusion that [...] "zero-point energy is infinite thus it should be renormalized but not the ‘zero-point fluctuations’". Despite such criticism, FDT {{has been shown to be}} true experimentally under certain quantum, non-classical conditions. Zero-point fluctuations can, and do, contribute towards systems which dissipate energy. A paper by Armen Allahverdyan and Theo Nieuwenhuizen in 2000 showed the feasibility of extracting zero-point energy for useful work from a single bath, without contradicting the laws of thermodynamics, by exploiting certain quantum mechanical properties.|$|E

They that receive light without thunder are subject to turn the grace of God into wantonness; but they that know the terror of God will persuade men (Rom 3:8; Jude 4; 2 Cor 5:11).
