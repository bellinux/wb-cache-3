5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, it was {{impossible}} for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills.

The road curved around the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{concerns}} <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland. <b>The</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland haven’t been archaeologically {{examined and}} they haven’t been studied {{as well as}} hill forts in other parts <b>of</b> Sweden. <b>The</b> focus <b>of</b> this essay is to determine <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland.   Comparative studies will be made between Halland’s <b>hill</b> forts and <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>of</b> Bohuslän and <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern part <b>of</b> Sweden. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research have yielded that <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland strongly reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Bohuslän {{when it comes to}} the positioning in the landscape, as well as <b>the</b> general appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts. There are remains of houses in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Bohuslän. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> similarities with <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Bohuslän, there is a possibility that there have been houses on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland. It is not possible to say whether <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland have been places of “safe haven” and/or permanent residents. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland have great view over seas or the ocean, as well as over the inland. They tend to be located close to old roads and would have had a great overview of them. It’s possible that <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts were connected to trading posts. Signaling between <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in <b>the</b> northern part <b>of</b> Halland is possible because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closeness <b>of</b> them. Drawings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts have been made successfully; they show roughly where <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> fort are situated and where the precipices and inclinations are situated. The drawings make it easier to compare <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland to hill forts in other parts of Sweden...|$|R

5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.|$|E
