5|$|The Volksdeutsche <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories were an {{important}} part of the economies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories, and by 1941, they were entirely in the thrall of the Nazi Party. Relations between the occupation authorities and the Volksdeutsche were strained by the killing of ethnic Germans during the invasion, to the extent that Adolf Hitler became aware of the issue. The Volksdeutsche were not active in the Hungarian military or civil administration, but were represented in the Hungarian Parliament, and from 1942 were permitted to conscript their members into the Wehrmacht. The official organisation of the Volksdeutsche in Hungary, the Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn (National League of Germans in Hungary), was essentially autonomous during the war, including within the occupied territories.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, most of Western Armenia was {{occupied}} by the Russian Empire {{as part of the}} Caucasian Campaign of World War I. In parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> areas, especially around Van, an Armenian autonomy was briefly set up. The Russian army left the region due to the Revolution of 1917. The Ottoman Empire quickly regained the territories from the small number of irregular Armenian units. In the Caucasus, the Special Transcaucasian Committee was set up after the February Revolution.|$|E

5|$|The Jews <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories were {{subjected}} to forced labour by the Hungarian authorities, with about 4,000 Bačka and Baranja Jews being sent to hard labour camps within Hungary, 1,500 Bačka Jews being among the 10,000 Hungarian Jews sent to perform labour tasks for the Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front in September 1942, and about 600 Bačka Jews sent {{to work in the}} Bor copper mine in the German-occupied territory of Serbia in July 1943. Only 2 per cent of those sent to the Eastern Front survived the war.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} {{operations}} in Kursk, the Soviets {{began a series of}} offensives on various fronts to push the Germans out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> Soviet republics. In October 1943, Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army was transferred to the Second Baltic Front which was concentrated on the retaking of Belarus and namely, the Baltic republics. In November, Stalin offered Bagramyan the position of head commander of the First Baltic Front which had the similar objectives of the Second but was making little headway in its attempts to advance northwards.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Messolonghi, Western Europe decided to {{intervene}} in favour of revolutionary Greece. Their attitude toward the Ottoman Empire's Egyptian ally, Ibrahim Pasha, was especially critical; their primary objective was to elicit the evacuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> regions, the Peloponnese in particular. The intervention began when a Franco-Russo-British fleet {{was sent to the}} region, winning the Battle of Navarino in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps disembarked at Koroni in the southern Peloponnese. The soldiers were stationed on the peninsula until the evacuation of Egyptian troops in October, then taking control of the principal strongholds still held by Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France from the end of 1828, there was a French presence in the area until 1833.|$|E

5|$|Back in the 1980s, the {{ideology}} of Hezbollah was described as radical. It {{is presented in the}} 1985 manifesto. The first objective was fighting against American and Israeli imperialism, freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> Southern Lebanon and all other occupied territories. The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of ummah; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The Ideology has been changed, and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.|$|E
5|$|From 25–30 July, the Croatian Army and Croatian Defence Council (HVO) troops {{attacked}} Serb-held territory {{north of}} Mount Dinara, capturing Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč during Operation Summer '95. That offensive {{paved the way}} for the military recapture of occupied territory around Knin, as it severed the last efficient resupply route between Banja Luka and Knin. On 4 August, Croatia started Operation Storm, with the aim of recapturing almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory in Croatia, except for a comparatively small strip of land, located along the Danube, at a considerable distance from the bulk of the contested land. The offensive, involving 100,000 Croatian soldiers, was the largest single land battle fought in Europe since World War II. Operation Storm achieved its goals and was declared completed on 8 August.|$|E
5|$|On 1September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, {{initiating}} World War II in Europe, and on 17September, {{pursuant to}} the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Poland was invaded by the Soviet Union. Subsequently, Poland was partitioned again – between these two powers – and remained under occupation {{for most of the}} war. By 1October, Germany and the Soviet Union had completely overrun Poland, although the Polish government never formally surrendered, and the Polish Underground State, subordinate to the Polish government-in-exile, was soon formed. On 8 October, Nazi Germany annexed the western areas of pre-war Poland and, in the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> area, established the General Government. The Soviet Union had to temporarily give up the territorial gains it made in 1939 due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, but permanently re-annexed much of this territory after winning it back in mid-1944. Over the course of the war, Poland lost over 20% of its pre-war population amid an occupation that marked the end of the Second Polish Republic.|$|E

5|$|The Committee {{also played}} an {{important}} political role. By providing an alternative supply of food, the CNSA prevented the German administration of Belgium {{from being able to}} use food as a bargaining tool to force Belgians to work in war industries and contributed to the passive resistance movement within occupied Belgium. However, the CNSA and CRB's activities meant that the Germans benefitted from having seven million Belgians and two million Frenchmen in their territory fed and consequently did not face major food riots or other disruption that might have arisen if the Germans had had to feed the population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories. The Germans also exploited their deal agreeing to give impunity to CNSA food shipments by seizing food produced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis {{seized from}} the French {{thousands}} of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles {{of weapons and}} raw materials such as copper, tin, oil and nickel. Financial demands were levied on the governments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> countries as well and payments for occupation costs were received from France, Belgium and Norway. Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most areas of Europe, {{but not as much}} as during World War I. Greece experienced famine in the first year of occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war.|$|E
5|$|The list {{includes}} four Israeli {{settlements in the}} West Bank, an area outside of sovereign Israeli territory.

The area and population of Jerusalem includes that of East Jerusalem which has been de facto annexed by Israel and incorporated within Jerusalem's municipal borders under the Jerusalem Law.

5|$|While {{guarding}} facilities, {{members of}} the Corps were largely assigned to manning brick bunkers, protecting the railway in the Ibar River valley, the Bor, Trepča, Majdanpek, and Krupanj mines, {{as well as the}} borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory along the Danube and Drina rivers. They were often deployed alongside various Serbian collaborationist forces such as the Serbian State Guard (SDS) and the Serbian Volunteer Corps (SDK), with whom they were most closely allied. The Corps also closely cooperated with the Croatian fascist Ustaše when operating in the neighbouring NDH. Members of the Corps also plundered peasants in the areas within which they operated.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Castle, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Occupied</b> Royal Palaces Estate, {{is owned}} by Queen ElizabethII in right of the Crown, and day-to-day {{management}} is by the Royal Household. In terms of population, Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle {{in the world and}} the longest-occupied palace in Europe, but it also remains a functioning royal home. As of 2006, around 500 people were living and working in the castle. The Queen has increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home and it is now as often used for state banquets and official entertaining as Buckingham Palace. In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted visits from President Mbeki of South Africa, King Abdullah II of Jordan and President Obama of the United States. The castle remains an important ceremonial location. The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel. While the Queen is in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurs on a daily basis. The Royal Ascot procession leaves the castle each year during the annual meeting.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November, the 4th Regiment was disbanded, its 1st Battalion {{assigned}} to the 1st Regiment {{and the rest of}} its manpower {{assigned to}} the 2nd Regiment. On 1 December 1942, the Corps was incorporated into the Wehrmacht and all its members were required to swear an oath to German leader Adolf Hitler. The Corps grew in numbers throughout 1942, following an influx of volunteers from Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Greece. By late 1942, the Corps totalled about 7,500 men, all of whom were Russian. During the re-organization, an attempt was made to expand the Corps further by recruiting Soviet POWs, but the first experiment with 300 POWs proved unsuccessful and was not repeated. On 9 December 1942, the 1st Regiment started to be transformed with the arrival of Kuban Cossacks led by Major General Naumenko. By January 1943, it consisted entirely of Cossacks. On 17 March 1943, Major General Gontarev replaced Shapilov as commander of the 3rd Regiment. The 1st Regiment fought in Loznica in April and participated in a large operation in Zapolje just south of Krupanj over the border with the NDH on 11–15 May, where it engaged in heavy combat with Partisan forces. From 1–8 July, the regiment was again stationed in Loznica and Ljubovija, participating in the defence of the Drina Bridge at Zvornik against the Partisans. During this time the regiment allowed the passage of 379 wounded Croatian soldiers and civilians, 1,000 healthy soldiers and as many refugees, sustaining casualties of two killed and seventeen wounded. It clashed with the Partisans over the village of Nedelica on 19 July. Meanwhile, the 2nd Regiment clashed with the Partisans around the town of Negotin. The 4th Regiment was re-established on 15 December, and was based in Jagodina, Paraćin and Ćuprija in the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory.|$|E
