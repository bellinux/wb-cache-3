Similarly, Harry Thompson expressed the view that Hergé would never have completed the story, and that while [...] "many critics like to think... Tintin and Alph-Art was set to be Hergé's last great masterpiece", he disagreed, describing this as [...] "surely just wishful thinking".

500|$|Edge {{compared}} the game favorably to System Shock {{due to its}} balanced combination of action and strategy, stating that {{in just two years}} Looking Glass [...] "has metamorphosed from one of the industry's secret technology powerhouses to a hugely respected developer in its own right." [...] John Payne of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Depending <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> of view, Terra Nova is either a stripped-down Mechwarrior or a souped-up Doom." [...] However, he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken. While he described the game's animation as [...] "fluid", he found its graphics in general to be [...] "fairly blocky, even at a distance". He finished his review by stating that the game [...] "requires more practice than action fans are used to" [...] but provides [...] "a nice payoff". Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay, and it has done it again with Terra Nova". The magazine considered the game to be [...] "an all around stunning effort".|$|E

50|$|The general {{mechanism}} by which the morphogen model works, can explain the subdivision of tissues into patterns of distinct cell types, assuming {{it is possible to}} create and maintain a gradient. However, the morphogen model is often invoked for additional activities such as controlling the growth of the tissue or orienting the polarity of cells within it (for example, the hairs <b>on</b> <b>your</b> forearm <b>point</b> in one direction) which cannot be explained by model.|$|R
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, depending <b>on</b> <b>your</b> political <b>point</b> of view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.|$|R

6000|$|It must {{be allowed}} that {{the light of the}} moon, {{sufficient}} though it is for the pensive walker, and not disproportionate to the inner light we have, is very inferior in quality and intensity to that of the sun. But the moon is not to be judged alone by the quantity of light she sends to us, but also by her influence on the earth and its inhabitants. [...] "The moon gravitates toward the earth, and the earth reciprocally toward the moon." [...] The poet who walks by moonlight is conscious of a tide in his thought which is to be referred to lunar influence. I will endeavor to separate the tide in my thoughts from the current distractions of the day. I would warn my hearers that they must not try my thoughts by a daylight standard, but endeavor to realize that I speak out of the night. All depends <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> of view. In Drake's [...] "Collection of Voyages," [...] Wafer says of some Albinoes among the Indians of Darien, [...] "They are quite white, but their whiteness is like that of a horse, quite different from the fair or pale European, as they have not the least tincture of a blush or sanguine complexion. * * * Their eyebrows are milk-white, as is likewise the hair of their heads, which is very fine. * * * They seldom go abroad in the daytime, the sun being disagreeable to them, and causing their eyes, which are weak and poring, to water, especially if it shines towards them, yet they see very well by moonlight, from which we call them moon-eyed." ...|$|E
50|$|Z is {{the point}} on the observer's meridian, where {{a line from the}} centre of the earth (treated in this case as a 'sphere') {{projected}} outwards through the observer and onto the Celestial Sphere points to his Zenith. A simple way of thinking about it is to imagine that when you are standing <b>on</b> Z, <b>your</b> feet <b>point</b> directly towards the centre of the earth, and <b>your</b> head <b>points</b> to <b>your</b> Zenith. (A line in the opposite direction, through your feet and the centre of the earth, would <b>point</b> to <b>your</b> 'Nadir') Thus 'Z', the observer's position on the earth, can be described in terms of 'Latitude' (degrees north or south of the Equator) and Longitude (degrees east or west of the Greenwich Meridian).|$|R
30|$|For the {{instructor}} Paula, the students’ voices were {{central to the}} research paper, which she described as an “academic conversation,” noting that {{what they were doing}} is “reading what's been said and you're entering the conversation and putting <b>your</b> stamp <b>on</b> it. <b>Your</b> <b>point</b> of view…your opinion is a reasoned one, an educated one…” (Observation, 1 / 31 / 13). While {{it is not clear what}} {{the instructor}} thought of Wes’ revised draft, I argue that the integration of the external voice helped create a “conversation” and Wes’ inclusion of his suggestions at the end of the paragraph was congruent with “putting <b>your</b> stamp <b>on</b> it.” Despite being a paraphrase, his rough draft lacked dialogic voicing and stance with the lack of integration of external voice and bare assertions, which also created contractive voicing. Even though the external voice and Wes had the same argument, which may contract the dialogue, the use of another’s voice and modality (should) opened up the conversation for the reader to consider the propositions rather being forced to concur with them.|$|R

The diners who chose their wine in the latter fashion always gave their orders in a penetrating voice, with a plentiful garnishing of stage directions. By insisting <b>on</b> having <b>your</b> bottle <b>pointing</b> to the north when the cork is being drawn, and calling the waiter Max, you may induce an impression <b>on</b> <b>your</b> guests which hours of laboured boasting might be powerless to achieve.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{experiences of}} women seeking {{information about their}} risk of hereditary breast cancer who fail to meet strict eligibility criteria for genetic counseling and testing. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. SETTING: Hereditary cancer program in western Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Women who had received notification of their ineligibility for referral for hereditary breast cancer risk assessment (n = 20) {{and some of their}} referring physicians (n = 10). Of 28 attempted contacts, five women had moved, one declined the invitation to participate, and two could not be interviewed because of scheduling conflicts. Ten of 20 physicians declined the invitation to participate. METHOD: In-depth, open-ended telephone interviews were conducted. Transcribed interviews were systematically analyzed to identify salient themes. MAIN FINDINGS: Three themes emerged. The first theme, "It's always <b>on</b> <b>your</b> mind," <b>points</b> to the profound concern about breast cancer that underlies women's experiences in seeking genetic testing. The second theme, "A test is a test," reflects women's beliefs that the test was relatively simple and similar to other medical tests in that it would provide a definitive answer. The third theme, "Falling through the cracks," captures the experience of ineligibility. Women reacted with a range of emotional responses and were left frustrated in their search for more specific information about their personal risk for breast cancer. Although women were encouraged to contact their physicians, few did. CONCLUSION: These findings point to the psychological consequences in women who seek genetic testing for risk of breast cancer when they are told they are ineligible and they are not given adequate information and support...|$|R
