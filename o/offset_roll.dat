Although multiple advances in developing printing inks and pastes with novel properties are being made, the potential those can bring to electronics is hindered by their stability and performance during the printing process. In this study a UV-LED curable acrylic material was used to test the optimization of inks and pastes for three of the most common direct writing systems: Piezo-type Inkjet, Reverse <b>Offset</b> <b>Roll</b> to Plate, and Micro Deposition. The viscosity of the photosensitive acrylic matrix was controlled by either the addition of diluents or electronically functional reinforcement material. The contact angle of the optimized solutions on 16 different Polyester, Polyimide, and Paper films was observed. Solutions with larger contact angles showed better line definition for the Inkjet and the Micro Dispense systems. In addition to the contact angle differential, the rheological properties showed to be a determinant factor for the feasibility of a solution to undergo the reverse offset printing process. The UV curable acrylic demonstrated electrical conductivity when 2 % (wt.) MWCNT were ultrasonically mixed in the matrix and then cured with a 385 nm wavelength for 3 seconds. Only the micro deposition system was capable of printing the acrylic-MWCNT paste and the relationship between the contact angle, pattern accuracy, substrate selection, and electrical conductivity, was determined. ...|$|E

50|$|Tension {{adjustment}} is necessary due to several mechanical factors: oscillations caused by mechanical misalignments, differing inertial response (lag) of mechanical elements during web acceleration, out-of-round unwind and tension rolls, slipping through nip rolls, and over-aggressive web-guide correction. Several technical process and control issues also affect tension: tension setpoint changes, phase <b>offset</b> on driven <b>rolls,</b> tension bleed from one zone to another, and thermal effect (contraction/expansion) as the substrate passes through various processes. It {{is impossible to}} eliminate all factors requiring tension adjustment. Variance in any one factor in a zone necessitates changes in tension control and web speed. Consequently, with coupled tension zone control, jitter is inevitable in a continuous web where the controllers cause a feedback loop.|$|R

40|$|A {{self-propelled}} agricultural sprayer {{was equipped}} with four RTK DGPS receivers and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to measure vehicle attitude and field elevation as the vehicle was driven across a field. Data were collected in a stop-and-go fashion at 3. 05 m (10 ft) intervals, {{as well as in}} a continuous fashion at three different speed levels on a 2. 3 ha field area with varying topography. Pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>offset</b> angles were estimated to within 95 % confidence intervals that ranged from 0. 01 ° to 0. 10 °. Using ordinary kriging, digital elevation models (DEMs) were interpolated using only elevation measurements, as well as a combination of elevation and vehicle attitude measurements. The resulting DEMs were compared with each other to evaluate the effect of including attitude measurement on DEM accuracy. At the widest measurement swath width, the DEMs generated with attitude measurements had RMSE values of 10 to 11 cm, which was significantly lower than the RMSE of 15 cm associated with the DEMs generated without attitude measurements. Vehicle speed affected DEM error, but no discernable trends were detected. These results provide evidence supporting the feasibility of using vehicle-based measurements collected during typical field operation for accurate DEM development...|$|R

"Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 57 - 59) Rollovers {{tend to be}} {{very severe}} crashes because of the energy required to roll a vehicle over unlike front and side crashes. This study is an effort towards reducing the severity of a rollover crash by strengthening the roof of a passenger car. The main focus of this thesis is to study the effect of reinforcing the roof of a car, {{in the event of a}} rollover. An Eglass/polypropylene isogrid composite panel, which is known for high specific energy absorption under impact, is used in reinforcing the roof of a ford Taurus car and the force-displacement response of the roof structure is observed in contrast to the same while without the roof reinforcement. The non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation of this rollover event is performed in LS DYNA computer code. The simulation setup is done in accordance with Federal Motor Vehicle Standard (FMVSS) No. 216, which is a static study of roof strength in the case of rollover accidents. A study of roof strength characteristics under dynamic loading, involving rollover forces and velocities, is also carried out. The simulation in the latter case involves dropping the car, inverted at a certain pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>offset</b> against gravity from a certain predetermined height onto a concrete surface. The results of the above simulations show that Isogrid composite panels are excellent reinforcements for a car roof, stiffening the roof and increasing its resistance to crush in a rollover accident. This study will help in recommending the use of isogrid panels in the design of car roofs with better roof crush characteristics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMafic {{continental}} flood basalts form a globally important, but under-characterized CO 2 sequestration target. The Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) in {{the northwestern}} U. S. is up to 5  km thick and covers over 168, 000  km 2. In India, flood basalts are 3  km thick and cover greater than 500, 000  km 2. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that the CRBG and other basalts react with formation water and super critical (sc) CO 2 to precipitate carbonates, thus adding a potential mineral trapping mechanism to the standard trapping mechanisms of most other types of CO 2 sequestration reservoirs. Brecciated tops of individual basalt flows in the CRBG form regional aquifers that locally have greater than 30 % porosity and three Darcies of permeability. Porous flow tops are potential sites for sequestration of gigatons of sc CO 2 {{in areas where the}} basalts contain unpotable water and are at depths greater than 800  m. In this paper we report on the U. S. DOE Big Sky Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership surface seismic and borehole geophysical characterization that supports a field test of capacity, integrity, and geochemical reactivity of CRBG reservoirs in eastern Washington, U. S. A. Traditional surface seismic methods have had little success in imaging basalt features in on-shore areas where the basalt is thinly covered by sediment. Processing of the experimental 6. 5  km, 5 line 3 C seismic swath included constructing an elastic wavefield model, identifying and separating seismic wave modes, and processing the swath as a single 2 D line. Important findings include: (1) a wide variety of shear wave energy modes swamp the P-wave seismic records; (2) except at very short geophone <b>offsets,</b> ground <b>roll</b> overprints P-wave signal; and (3) because of extreme velocity contrasts, P-wave events are refracted at incidence angles greater than 7 – 15  degrees. Subsequent removal of S-wave and other noise during processing resulted in tremendous improvement in image quality. The application of wireline logging to onshore basalts is underexploited. Full waveform sonic logs and resistivity-based image logs acquired in the 1250  m basalt pilot borehole provide powerful tools for evaluating geomechanics and lithofacies. The azimuth of the fast shear wave is parallel to SH and records the changes through geologic time in basalt flow and tectonic stress tensors. Combined with image log data, azimuthal S-wave data provide a borehole technique for assessing basalt emplacement and cooling history that is related to the development of reservoirs and seals, as well as the orientation of tectonic stresses and fracture systems that could affect CO 2 transport or containment. Reservoir and seal properties are controlled by basalt lithofacies, and rescaled P- and S-wave slowness curves, integrated with image logs, provide a tool for improved recognition of subsurface lithofacies...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the commissioning and in-orbit performance {{results of the}} attitude and orbit determination and control system to support the multi-spectral earth observation imager payload of the SumbandilaSAT microsatellite. The satellite has been designed as a single string mission with little redundancy due to mass and volume restrictions and early in the mission the Z-axis reaction wheel was permanently lost due to a power switch failure. The paper will demonstrate how full 3 -axis stability is achieved without the use this wheel. The pushbroom imager is still able to scan target areas accurately using a forward motion compensation method (FMC 4), simultaneously doing a <b>roll</b> <b>offset</b> manoeuvre for cross track scanning. Target tracking by pointing the high data rate S-band antenna is also successfully demonstrated, while allowing the satellite to freely rotate around the antenna boresight during these periods. The satellite has a Y-body mounted main solar panel and the attitude control system must ensure a sufficient level of solar energy collected during the sunlit part of each orbit. The control actuators employed are 3 -axis magnetic torquer rods and X/Y reaction wheels. During initial detumbling and safe mode operations, a magnetic control law is used to bring the satellite to a sun pointed Y-Thompson spinning attitude for maximum power collection. From this sun-pointed, spinning attitude an intermediate control mode is entered where the Y-reaction wheel is utilised as a momentum wheel, to absorb the body spin rate and to inertially stabilise the momentum vector initially towards the sun direction and finally aligned with the orbit normal. During this mode the magnetic rods are used to maintain the momentum vector in size and steer the pressesion direction while doing nutation damping. The pitch angle is controlled using the Y-wheel, to keep the main imager payload {{as close as possible}} to an earth pointed attitude and thermally stabilise the telescope. Finally, the nominal attitude control mode is enabled when a low Y-momentum biased X/Y reaction wheel and magnetic controller is enabled, to: 1) ensure a nominal nadir pointing attitude to collect a sufficient level of solar energy, 2) do target tracking during view finder use or during imaging download communication with ground stations and 3) implement pushbroom imager FMC 4 scanning. During the nominal mode magnetic rods are used to maintain the Y-wheel angular momentum, dump the X-wheel momentum and zero any yaw angle offsets. The in-orbit performance will be presented of newly developed 2 -axis sun and earth sensors, an autonomous star tracker and SGPS receiver. A Butane resistojet propulsion system's performance will be discussed, showing the results of circularising and raising an eccentric 490 by 505 km initial orbit.
