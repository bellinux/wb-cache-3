5|$|Bruni {{was issued}} with a one-minute, stop-and-go penalty because his {{mechanics}} did not check {{one of his}} tyres at his final scheduled pit stop. Rees took over the class lead which he maintained to clinch victory in LMGTE Pro. Turner held third, but made a pit stop, allowing Lietz and Muller to finish in second and third places in the category. This was Rees's, Stanaway's and MacDowall's first class victories in the World Endurance Championship. Aston Martin finished as the winners in LMGTE Am, ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 83 AF Corse of François Perrodo, Emmanuel Collard, and Agias with SMP Racing's No. 72 entry of Viktor Shaitar.

The No. 7 Audi rejoined the race after repairs to its floor which was damaged {{when the car}} drove over a kerb and its ducts {{required}} cleaning after rubber picked up from the circuit caused the vehicle to overheat. The entry rejoined in 15th place overall. The race restarted 12 minutes later with Davidson leading the field, ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 8 Audi. Kobayashi immediately got ahead of Dumas to move into third position. Manor's No. 31 entry driven by Richard Bradley overtook the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports car of Chris Cumming at Eau Rouge for fourth place in LMP2. Nathanaël Berthon's No. 26 vehicle had its left-rear tyre punctured following contact with Abu Dhabi Proton's No. 88 Porsche at La Source, while Andy Priaulx in the No. 67 Ford passed Dempsey-Proton's No. 77 car for fifth place in LMGTE Pro.

5|$|In March 1948 {{he set a}} world flight {{altitude}} record of 59,430 feet (18,114 metres) in a Ghost-powered Vampire. The flight lasted for 45 minutes, reaching 50,000 feet in 13.5 minutes. The following year {{he went on to}} test the de Havilland Comet, the world's first jet airliner which first flew in 1949. On 23 May 1952 he flew the Comet—now a highly successful export—carrying the recently widowed Queen Mother and Princess Margaret on a four-hour tour around the Alps. At one point he supervised the Queen Mother as she took the controls. She was to dine with members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 600 Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron later that night and was anxious to say she had piloted an aircraft. Cunningham continued to test-fly prototypes such as the re-built Comet 3 and 4 in the late 1950s. On 23 October 1956 he travelled to the United States and received the Harmon Trophy from President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was the most prestigious American trophy for services of civil aviation.|$|E

The following night, Matthews lost to Mark Briscoe. Matthews was mainly utilized in a tag team {{role as a}} member of the AotF, teaming with fellow faction members Tyler Black and Necro Butcher. During this time, he continued to work for other promotions, and on March 12, at an OVW television taping, he defeated Jamin Olivencia to win the OVW Television Championship. After successful defenses against Olivencia, he dropped the title to Tommy McNailer a month later on April 16. He continued to wrestle for ROH until Battle For Supremacy in June, when he and Jimmy Jacobs lost to Kevin Steen and El Generico, in what was his last ROH wrestling match.|$|E

In 1958, Oliver purchased the Byron Typewriter Company, previously the Barlock Typewriter Company, of Nottingham. The licensing ventures were ultimately unsuccessful, and the company's machine tools were transferred to a factory in Germany. Production of all Oliver typewriters ended in May 1959.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's late {{afternoon}} qualification session {{was divided into}} two groups lasting 25 minutes each. Cars in LMGTE Pro and AM were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All cars were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each and the starting order was determined by the competitor's fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. The session started on a wet track but dried out as it progressed. André Lotterer and Marcel Fässler in the No. 7 Audi clinched the vehicle's first pole position of the season, and the team's first since the 2013 6 Hours of Fuji, with an average lap time of one minute and 53.204 seconds. Manor's No. 44 car made contact with Fässler {{at the end of the}} session but both vehicles sustained no apparent damage. It also ended Porsche's streak of 11 consecutive pole positions, extending back to the 2014 6 Hours of Shanghai. They were joined on the grid's front row by the team's No. 8 sister entry. Di Grassi recorded the fastest qualifying timed lap late in the session but went off the track heading into Vale corner while attempting to go faster. He went into the turn's gravel trap, preventing him from achieving the pole position. The two Porsche cars were third and fourth (the No. 1 vehicle in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 2 entry). Hartley was delayed by slower traffic on his final timed lap and believed he could have improved on his time. Toyota's entrants had unsuitable car control settings and a different vehicle set-up, restricting to them to qualifying on the grid's third row (their No. 5 car ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 6 entry). Oliver Webb and Rossiter in the ByKolles Racing CLM P1/01 and the two Rebellion Racing cars rounded out the LMP1 field; Rebellion elected not to record any lap times.|$|E

5|$|Six {{drivers were}} reprimanded by the {{stewards}} for being slow {{to react to}} the red flag, while the fastest times from the No. 50 Larbre Compétition Chevrolet, the No. 78 KCMG Porsche, and No. 88 Abu-Dhabi Proton Racing entry were disallowed because the drivers were adjudged to have exceeded track limits. The ruling meant the Gulf Racing's No. 86 car moved from sixth to fourth in LMGTE Am. The No. 51 AF Corse entry, and Ford Chip Ganassi Team's No. 66 car, failed their post-qualifying checks when it was discovered that the vehicles were able to start their engines with and without their fuel couplings engaged; they were allowed to start the race. Michael Christensen, one of two drivers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 77 Dempsey Proton Porsche, failed to reach the 107% mark of the fastest qualifying time in LMGTE Pro and was prohibited from starting the event but allowed to participate {{in the rest of the}} race.

5|$|The Lancasters' {{flight to}} Yagodnik {{initially}} went well. After departing their bases, the 39 aircraft flew {{north to the}} Shetlands before turning east.

The remaining aircraft passed over neutral Sweden where the aircrew, most of whom had only conducted night flying over countries observing blackouts, were pleased to see towns lit up. After crossing the Gulf of Bothnia the Lancasters continued over Finland towards the USSR. Several aircraft were fired on by Swedish, Finnish and Soviet anti-aircraft defences, but only one suffered any damage.|$|E
5|$|The Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) {{category}} was {{won by the}} Signatech Alpine driven by Nicolas Lapierre, Gustavo Menezes and Stéphane Richelmi.

Sam Bird and Davide Rigon in the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari took the victory in the Le Mans Grand Tourer Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) class with a one-lap advantage over second-placed No. 67 Ford Chip Ganassi Team drivers Andy Priaulx, Marino Franchitti and Harry Tincknell.

40|$|Control regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{nopaline}} synthase (<b>nos)</b> gene {{have been widely}} used to express foreign genes in plants since the promoter is active {{in a wide variety of}} plant tissues. We report here <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nos</b> promoter activity in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants at various developmental stages. The promoter was highly active in <b>the</b> lower parts <b>of</b> a plant and gradually decreased in the upper parts. This vertical gradient was maintained throughout plant growth until the flowering stage when the overall promoter strength decreased significantly in the vegetative organs. However, in various flower organs, <b>the</b> <b>nos</b> promoter activities increased dramatically. Higher activity was observed in calyx, corolla, and stamens although the maximum promoter activity in each organ was found at different stages <b>of</b> flower development. <b>The</b> promoter activity in pistils was low and gradually increased in the ovaries after anthesis. In developing fruits, <b>the</b> <b>nos</b> promoter activity was strongly induced during <b>the</b> mid-stage <b>of</b> embryogenesis. These results indicate that <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nos</b> promoter is developmentally regulated and organ specific in transgenic tobacco plants...|$|R

Duval and di Grassi took fifth place with the latter stating that the team was not happy with the No. 8 car's setup, and that overnight work had to be undertaken. Davidson and Buemi held fifth place until di Grassi and Duval's lap times demoted them to sixth.
