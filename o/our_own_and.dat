As a result, most objects that are cooler than stars are better studied in the infrared.

500|$|Following his {{departure}} from the Grand Fleet, the king had a message sent to the officers and men of the ships he had just left. It began with a warm reference to the American squadron: [...] "I am happy to have found myself once more with the Grand Fleet, and this pleasure has been increased by the opportunity I have had of seeing the splendid ships of the United States in line with <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> of meeting Admiral Rodman together with the officers and men under him.

The two universes began to clash in 1985, after Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) stole the parallel universe version of his son, Peter, following his own son's death. The finale's narrative recounts what happens when Peter (Joshua Jackson) is taken back to the Other Side by his real father, dubbed [...] "Walternate" [...] (Noble). FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and Walter lead a team of former Cortexiphan test subjects to retrieve him, after discovering that Peter is an unwitting part of Walternate's plans to bring about the destruction of our universe using an ancient doomsday device.|$|E

500|$|In {{a meeting}} at Arrowsic, Maine in 1717 Shute and representatives {{of some of the}} Wabanakis {{attempted}} to reach some agreement concerning colonial encroachment on Native lands and the establishment of provincially operated trading posts. [...] The Kennebec sachem (chief) Wiwurna objected not only to the establishment of settlements on their lands, but also the construction of forts, and claimed sovereign control of those lands. [...] Shute, who often rudely interrupted Wiwurna, bluntly reasserted British claims to the territory. [...] The Wabanakis were willing to accede to existing illegal settlements if a proper boundary was delineated beyond which settlement would not be allowed; Shute responded [...] "We desire only what is <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> that we will have." [...] This ambiguous response, and the treaty that was ultimately agreed, did not satisfy the Wabanakis.|$|E
500|$|Buchanan {{described}} the song {{during an interview}} that was published on the group's official website, saying: [...] "Easy is a very naughty and cheeky song – it’s the most sexy song we’ve ever done. It came about when Orson had {{an idea for a}} song. [...] They played it to us – it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love." [...] She elaborated in a separate interview: [...] "When we started working with the guys from Orson the sound just blew us away – it's completely fresh sounding {{but at the same time}} has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!" ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{continued}} its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but {{was surprised that}} virtually no other bands joined in. Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States {{for the next three}} years. Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> it pretty much killed us, killed our career." [...] In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes. Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: [...] "I Got Id" [...] and [...] "Long Road". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam {{in the form of the}} 1995 EP, Merkin Ball.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the first episode was not favourable; in The Independent, Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are we supposed to care about these people? The theory, I think, {{is that we should}} relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic as <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This is another way of saying the writer hasn't bothered with research or imagination." [...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him [...] "especially awful" [...] and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on {{at the beginning of the}} episode. General reaction improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the [...] "forgotten" [...] twentysomethings. Paul Hoggart for The Times wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing and looked forward to how Rachel's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E

The diverse religious movements covered by the term [...] "gnosticism" [...] share the basic doctrines that the surrounding world is fundamentally evil or inhospitable, that we are trapped in the world through no fault of <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> that we can be saved from the world only through secret knowledge (gnosis). Ellwood claimed that the three mythologists were [...] "modern gnostics through and through", remarking, ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{summarizing}} some of Eiseley's contributions, {{the editor}} of The Bloomsbury Review wrote, [...] "There can be no question that Loren Eiseley maintains a place of eminence among nature writers. His extended explorations of human life and mind, set {{against the backdrop of}} <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> other universes are like those to be found in every book of nature writing currently available... We now routinely expect our nature writers to leap across the chasm between science, natural history, and poetry with grace and ease. Eiseley made the leap at a time when science was science, and literature was, well, literature... His writing delivered science to nonscientists in the lyrical language of earthly metaphor, irony, simile, and narrative, all paced like a good mystery." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Oriental Orthodox Churches, having {{rejected}} the Chalcedonian Creed, {{were known as}} Monophysites because they would only accept a definition that characterized the incarnate Son as having one nature. [...] The Chalcedonian [...] "in two natures" [...] formula was seen as derived from and akin to a Nestorian Christology. [...] Contrariwise, the Chalcedonians saw the Oriental Orthodox as tending towards Eutychian Monophysitism. [...] However, the Oriental Orthodox have in modern ecumenical dialogue specified that they have never believed in the doctrines of Eutyches, that they have always affirmed that Christ's humanity is consubstantial with <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> they thus prefer the term [...] "Miaphysite" [...] to refer to themselves (a reference to Cyrillian Christology, which used the phrase [...] "mia physis tou theou logou sesarkomene").|$|E
