For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a flashback), acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon.|$|E

50|$|Adams was Chairman of the Board of the Air Reduction Company.

25|$|For a basic <b>oxy-acetylene</b> rig, the <b>cutting</b> {{speed in}} light steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The {{advantages}} when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 June 2010 {{the bridge}} and crew's {{quarters}} exploded and burnt, set on fire by the <b>oxy-acetylene</b> <b>cutting</b> torches {{of a team of}} 22 salvors from the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) working on the ship, and who had to be rescued by the launch Spirit of Vodacom. Officials of SAMSA said they would take no action as the situation [...] "could be dangerous", {{and that it would be}} left to burn. The City of Cape Town's fire chief officer confirmed that the National Ports Authority had been notified, and had declined to comment since it was outside normal office hours.|$|E

40|$|The steel {{substrate}} {{formed as}} the result of <b>oxy-acetylene</b> <b>cutting</b> (OAB) was treated differently - using: softening annealing, grinding and electro-polishing. Investigations were focused on the influence of additional processing on the structure and corrosion resistance of the deposited zinc coating. The hot - dip Zn galvanizing process was conducted in industrial conditions. Parameters were fixed: temperature 457 °C, dipping time 150 s. The coating thickness diversification dependent on the sub-surface steel structure was analysed and compared to the previous results. The correlation between conducted treatment and coatings morphology was determined...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an environmental {{analysis of a}} number of cutting and joining processes taking place during the ship hull repair. These processes include <b>Oxy-acetylene</b> <b>cutting,</b> Plasma arc cutting, Shielded metal arc welding, Flux core arc welding and Submerged arc welding. The processes are modelled in terms of their environmental impact. The environmental-related inputs and outputs of each process are elaborated with a Life Cycle Assessment tool. The impact on various aspects, such as human health, resource depletion etc., is assessed by the “Environmental Priority Strategy (EPS) ” and the “Eco-Indicator 99 ” impact assessment methods. Based on the results, a benchmarking of the cutting and welding processes is performed, in terms of their environmental impact...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{deactivation}} and decommissioning (D and D) Implementation Plan of the US Department of Energy`s (DOE) Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP), non-recyclable process {{components and}} debris that {{are removed from}} buildings undergoing D and D are disposed of in an on-site disposal facility (OSDF). Critical to the design and operation of the FEMP`s OSDF are provisions to protect against subsidence of the OSDF`s cap. Subsidence of the cap could occur if void spaces within the OSDF were to collapse under the overburden of debris and the OSDF cap. Subsidence may create significant depressions in the OSDF`s cap in which rainwater could collect and eventually seep into the OSDF. To minimize voids in the FEMP`s OSDF, large metallic components are cut into smaller segments that can be arranged more compactly when placed in the OSDF. Component segmentation using an <b>oxy-acetylene</b> <b>cutting</b> torch was the baseline approach used by the FEMP`s D and D contractor on Plant 1, Babcock and Wilcox (B and W) Services, Inc., for the dismantlement and size-reduction of large metal components. Although this technology has performed satisfactorily, improvements are sought {{in the areas of}} productivity, airborne contamination, safety, and cost. This demonstration investigated the feasibility of using an oxy-gasoline torch {{as an alternative to the}} baseline oxy-acetylene torch for segmenting D and D components. This report provides a comparative analysis of the cost and performance of the baseline oxy-acetylene torch currently used by B and W Services, Inc., and the innovative oxy-gasoline torch...|$|E
