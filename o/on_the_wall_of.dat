5|$|Femmes au perroquet ("Women with parrot"; 1952) is {{a bronze}} relief {{situated}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the restaurant building. Created by the Cubist artist Fernand Léger, this work features {{a group of}} women with a parakeet.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} cairn {{was erected}} near {{the crash site}} by the regiment in 1987. A special remembrance was held in Valemount for the 60th anniversary of the disaster in 2010. The CNR has also raised a monument {{near the site of}} the disaster. The names of the military dead are inscribed in the Korea Book of Remembrance and are also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>of</b> Remembrance in Brampton, Ontario; they may also be found on the Korea Cairn at Winnipeg Brookside Cemetery. Manitoba has named a lake for Gunner William D. Wright, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|A {{tapestry}} copy of Picasso's Guernica {{depicting a}} massacre of innocent {{women and children}} during the Spanish civil war is displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the United Nations building in New York City, {{at the entrance to}} the Security Council room, demonstrably as a spur to the conscience of representatives from the nation states. Albert Tucker painted Man's Head to capture the moral disintegration, and lack of conscience, of a man convicted of kicking a dog to death.|$|E
25|$|In {{at least}} two instances, the images of {{deceased}} Anglican clergymen allegedly appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> their church. In 1902, {{the image of a}} Dean Vaughan allegedly appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Llandaff cathedral, while the image of Dean Henry Liddell allegedly appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Christ Church, Oxford in 1923.|$|R

5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the Tromsø techno scene before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified {{their place in the}} electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, Melody A.M., released <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>of</b> Sound record label.|$|E
5|$|In about 1797 a {{schoolmaster}} {{living in}} the village cultivated the Williams pear. The schoolmaster (either Mr Wheeler or his successor, John Stair) was the original cultivator, but the pear (a cultivar of the European Pear) was named after Richard Williams of Turnham Green, who grew several grafts of the original tree. On 5 December 1956, a plaque commemorating the tree was unveiled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the village school.|$|E

5|$|John Jones, who was Dean of Bangor Cathedral from 1689 to 1727, {{was also}} rector of St Ffinan's during that time, {{as it was}} one of the benefices {{attached}} to the deanery. Jones is commememorated by a stone tablet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> St Mary's Church, Pentraeth, also in Anglesey. The antiquarian Nicholas Owen was perpetual curate here from 1790 until his death in 1811; he is buried at St Tyfrydog's Church, Llandyfrydog, Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|Though many {{prominent}} national {{newspapers have}} {{moved away from}} Fleet Street, the name is still synonymous with the printing and publishing industry. In the adjacent St. Brides Lane is the St Bride Library, holding a specialist collection relating to the type and print industry and providing courses in printing technology and methods. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Magpie Alley, off Bouverie Street, is a mural depicting the history of newspapers in the area.|$|E
5|$|Two {{others were}} also charged and {{found guilty of}} Brett's murder, Thomas Maguire and Edward O'Meagher Condon, but their death {{sentences}} were overturned: O'Meagher Condon through the intercession of the United States government– he was an American citizen– and Maguire because the evidence given against him was considered unsatisfactory. Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien were publicly hanged on a temporary structure built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Salford Gaol, on 23 November 1867, {{in front of a}} crowd of 8,000–10,000.|$|E

5000|$|Decrees from Djedkare Isesi to Senedjemib Inti {{were found}} inscribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> his tomb. In the decrees, Isesi praises {{the actions of}} his official, which {{was a source of}} pride for Senedjemib Inti's family. Unsurprisingly thus, Senedjemib Inti or his son Senedjemib Mehi {{commissioned}} their inscriptions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb.|$|R

5|$|A notable feature <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> {{the front}} porch {{on the ground floor}} is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery {{for a long time and}} on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Harvey died in 1830 at {{his family}} estate of Rolls Park and {{was buried in}} the Harvey family crypt at St Andrews Church at Hempstead in Essex, which {{contains}} the remains of over 50 family members, including his ancestor's brother, Dr. William Harvey. His coffin is still in the crypt, and can be viewed on request. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> church is a hatchment in his honour originally placed shortly after his death and restored in 1958 after it was destroyed in the partial collapse of the church in 1884. A large wall memorial to him is also visible in the church, which also commemorates his youngest son William, who died in 1823 aged 22.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Maggie spells EMCSQU with her blocks, a {{reference}} to Albert Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation. A picture of Einstein also appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Dr. Pryor's office. At one point Homer erroneously refers to Einstein as {{the inventor of the}} light bulb. Dr. Pryor compares Bart's proposed work among ordinary children to Jane Goodall's study of chimpanzees. Goodall was pleased to be mentioned in the episode, sending the program a letter, and Vitti an autographed copy of her book. The conductor of the opera the family attends is named Boris Csupowski, {{a reference to}} animator Gabor Csupo. The opera attended by the family is Carmen, by French composer Georges Bizet; the song that Bart mocks is a famous aria called the Toreador Song. Students at the gifted school have lunchboxes that feature images of the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited and chess grandmaster Anatoly Karpov.|$|E

5|$|Other {{prominent}} artworks on {{the grounds}} include a Marc Chagall stained glass window memorializing the death of Dag Hammarskjöld, the Japanese Peace Bell which is rung on the vernal equinox {{and the opening of}} each General Assembly session, a Chinese ivory carving made in 1974 (before the ivory trade was largely banned in 1989), and a Venetian mosaic depicting Norman Rockwell's painting The Golden Rule. A full-size tapestry copy of Pablo Picasso's Guernica, by , <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the United Nations building {{at the entrance to the}} Security Council room. In 1952, two Léger murals were installed in the General Assembly Hall. The works are meant to merely be decorative with no symbolism. One is said to resemble cartoon character Bugs Bunny and U.S. President Harry S. Truman dubbed the other work Scrambled Eggs.|$|E
5|$|Rabi {{suggested}} to Edoardo Amaldi that Brookhaven {{might be a}} model that Europeans could emulate. Rabi saw science {{as a way of}} inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed and hung it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> his home office.|$|E
5|$|The Vicars' Hall was {{completed}} in 1348 and included a communal dining room, administrative offices and treasury of the Vicars Choral. The houses {{on either side of}} the close were built in the 14th and early 15th centuries. Since then alterations have been made including a unified roof, front gardens and raised chimneys. The final part of the construction of the close was during the 1420s when the Vicars' Chapel and Library was constructed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the Liberty of St Andrew. The south face includes shields commemorating the bishops of the time. The interior is decorated with 19th century gesso work by Heywood Sumner and the building now used by Wells Cathedral School.|$|E

5|$|The circle symbolizes {{unity and}} {{diversity}} in nature, and many Islamic patterns are drawn {{starting with a}} circle. For example, the decoration of the 15th-century mosque in Yazd, Iran {{is based on a}} circle, divided into six by six circles drawn around it, all touching at its centre and each touching its two neighbours' centres to form a regular hexagon. On this basis is constructed a six-pointed star surrounded by six smaller irregular hexagons to form a tessellating star pattern. This forms the basic design which is outlined in white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the mosque. That design, however, is overlaid with an intersecting tracery in blue around tiles of other colours, forming an elaborate pattern that partially conceals the original and underlying design. A similar design forms the logo of the Mohammed Ali Research Center.|$|E
5|$|The monuments {{include those}} to George Ogden {{who died in}} 1781, by Hayward, to Anne Matthews who died in 1793, by Thomas Banks, to John Philips Buchanan who died at Waterloo in 1815, to the first Duke of Westminster, {{designed}} by C.J.Blomfield, and two memorial plaques {{to members of the}} Egerton family. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the southwest crossing pier are monuments which include a cenotaph to the casualties in HMSChester in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 who included the 16-year-old John Cornwell VC. The west wall of the south transept has many memorials, including cenotaphs to the Cheshire Regiment, the Royal Air Force and the Free Czech Forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the college were built using rubble from Oxfordshire dressed with local stone. The {{remaining}} parts of the 17th-century walls are dressed with Headington stone, which was a common building material in Oxford at that time: the geologist W. J. Arkell wrote that it was used for every building in Oxford constructed during this century for which records exist. Areas of Headington stone {{can be seen in}} the first quadrangle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the hall. It was only discovered towards the end of the 18th century that it did not weather well: the surface of the stone develops a hard crust, which blisters, bursts and comes off. Much of it has subsequently been replaced with other materials as a result.|$|E
