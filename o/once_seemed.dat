500|$|It was {{not until}} 2004, fifteen years {{after the fall of}} the regime, that the {{theological}} writings started being reprinted. These events also signified that the full corpus of his literature could see print: work on his complete writings was taken up by Mariana and Victor Iova. Prăbușirea and other manuscripts only saw print in and after 1997. The project ended in 2002 and, Voncu notes, Agârbiceanu returned to a [...] "discouraging anonymity" [...] until 2014, when Ilie Rad began work on a revised critical edition. This also included material never published in the Pienescu edition—adding as much as 75% new content. As suggested by Manolescu in 2013, Agârbiceanu <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> [...] "the most promising Transylvanian writer of the dawn of a new century, after Coșbuc and before Rebreanu." [...] However, and despite Fefeleaga being a constant feature of literature textbooks, Agârbiceanu became [...] "two-thirds forgotten". According to Ornea, and to various others, Agârbiceanu mostly endures in cultural memory as a [...] "second-shelf writer".|$|E
500|$|In The New York Times {{review of}} the 1986 Broadway cast {{recording}} of Song and Dance (titled Bernadette Peters in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Song & Dance), Stephen Holden wrote that the recording was [...] "a personal triumph for a singer and actress who is rapidly establishing herself as {{the first lady of}} the Broadway musical. Performing material whose music borders on kitsch and whose lyrics and story suggest a verbose soap opera, Miss Peters nevertheless projects an astounding emotional generosity and conviction. Almost singlehandedly she turns the inconsequential erotic misadventures of Emma ... into a touching romantic fable about love and its defenses and the loss of innocence. ... Miss Peters has always oozed a cuddlesome Shirley Temple-like sweetness and vulnerability. This quality, which used to seem more like an adorable child-star affectation than a deep-seated trait, has proved to be an essential ingredient of Miss Peters's personality. [...] A delivery that <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> coy and cutesy has deepened and ripened into an honesty and compassion that pour out in singing that is childlike but also resilient." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{various aspects}} of Super Mario RPG have {{received}} mixed reviews, the game garnered praise {{for the quality of}} the graphics and for the humor in particular. Nintendo Powers review commented that the [...] "excellent" [...] 3D graphics helped the game appeal to a much wider audience than most traditional RPGs. In March 1997, Nintendo Power nominated the game for several awards, including [...] "Best Graphics", in a player's choice contest, though Super Mario 64 won [...] "Best Graphics". Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the graphics, stating that they are [...] "the best seen on the Super NES". Scary Larry of GamePro gave the game a perfect 5/5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), and highly praised the rendered enemies, cinematics, and spell animations. 1UP.com stated that the graphic element is [...] "strong enough to resemble a Mario title but still retains the role-playing theme at the same time", and Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the graphics are [...] "typical of Nintendo, using clean and colorful graphics along with nice animation". RPGamer editor Derek Cavin called the backgrounds [...] "beautiful" [...] and stated that they [...] "perfectly bring the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas into 3D". Skyler Miller from Allgame stated that the graphics are [...] "absolutely outstanding, with colorful, 3D rendered visuals that <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> impossible on the Super NES. This is definitely the high watermark for 3D graphics on any 16-bit system". The editor also called the music [...] "quite extraordinary" [...] and that the songs [...] "match the mood of the surrounding environment". In the Virtual Console re-release, IGN's Lucas Thomas's review of Super Mario RPG stated that the game's experience [...] "completes itself with a compelling story, a humorous attitude and a variety of interspersed mini-games that break up the adventuring action". The publication also stated that the soundtrack is [...] "spectacular and a joy to listen to" [...] and the graphics [...] "took full advantage of the system's 16-bit technology and looks great".|$|E

500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote [...] "this {{convoluted}} {{hybrid of}} fairy tale and fantasy/action/comedy/horror aims for campy fun, but comes off tedious and blood-spattered." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety called the film [...] "inconsistently acted, and somehow both underwritten and overplotted," [...] {{and while the}} action is [...] "frequent and competently staged," [...] it might feel too repetitive [...] "as yet another witch is ripped apart limb from limb, sending yet another wave of viscera sluicing toward the camera." [...] Similarly, Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "after a while it’s easy to become numb to the repulsive sights and bored by action that <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> intense and exciting" [...] in this [...] "rarely funny spoof that’s heavy on bone-crushing and blood-gushing," [...] giving it one-and-half star out of four. Steven Farber of The Hollywood Reporter also wrote a scathing review, saying that while [...] "Wirkola makes {{the most of the}} 3D technology", [...] "the film is too fanciful to be truly revolting" [...] for its gore effects and [...] "despite its few wry jokes, the script is awfully thin." [...] Roger Moore of The Charlotte Observer gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, writing that Wirkola [...] "focuses on the fights and flings all manner of viscera at the 3-D camera as limbs are whacked off and heads and torsos explode. Less attention was paid to the story, and the dialogue is a tad over-reliant on the random f-word to land a laugh." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film zero out of four stars, writing that [...] "nothing makes a whole lot of sense in this incoherent movie, whose director’s philosophy seems to be: When in doubt, cut somebody’s head off." [...] Kat Murphy of MSN gave it one star out of four, comparing this [...] "big-budget faux fairy tale about skanky witches" [...] to a [...] "downscale video game for dull-eyed teens happy to lap up lame wisecracks and lots of gore." [...] According to Vulture's Bilge Ebiri, [...] "if the similarly situated Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter took itself too seriously, the problem with Hansel & Gretel is that it doesn’t quite take itself seriously enough." [...] Keith Staskiewicz of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C-, calling it [...] "an intermittently fun, but overexcited and predictable mish-mash." [...] Alicia Malone of IGN rated it a 4.5/10, stating [...] "there are a few funny moments, but overall Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is too similar to many films we’ve seen before." [...] Calum Marsh of Slant Magazine lambasted the film's [...] "sub-Tim Burton aesthetic" [...] and wrote that [...] "the result suggests A Knight's Tale as penned by Seth MacFarlane," [...] giving it zero out of four stars. Scott A. Gray of Exclaim! praised some elements of the film, such as [...] "lush and colourful art design that recalls a Guillermo Del Toro production, sound creature makeup and special effects, decently choreographed action scenes and a pair of leads who do their damnedest to sell the limp script", giving it a score of 4/10. Chris Knight of The Vancouver Sun called it a [...] "mess of a fairy tale", expecting [...] "a wiccan outcry at the film’s depiction — nay, endorsement — of the torture of witch-folk." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave it one star out of four, concerned how it [...] "has an alarming number of females being strung up, burned, shot, decapitated and eviscerated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further work in {{this area}} {{discusses}} a new conceptualization of conservation as a shift from preservation and [...] "wildlife management" [...] to multi-species culture and animal self-determination. [...] The concepts of trans-species psychology discourage practices such as culls (systematic killing), sustainable harvesting, captive breeding, etc., as processes that disrupt familial bonds, cause emotional trauma and the breakdown of culture, [...] "what <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> unpleasant but necessary becomes disturbingly abhorrent" [...] (Bradshaw, 2009, p.161).|$|E
2500|$|After 1914, avant-garde artists {{began to}} {{consider}} and investigate {{many things that}} had <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> unimaginable. As Marc Chagall later remarked, [...] "The war was another plastic work that totally absorbed us, which reformed our forms, destroyed the lines, and gave a new look to the universe." [...] In this same period, academic and realist artists continued to produce new work. [...] Traditional artists and their artwork developed {{side by side with}} the shock of the new as culture reinvented itself in relationships with new technologies.|$|E

50|$|While {{the exact}} limits of her {{abilities}} {{have yet to}} be established, how much power Frost can channel at <b>once</b> <b>seems</b> to depend on how much heat she has absorbed and stored in her body.

2500|$|While James J. Montague <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> tireless, {{his health}} began to fail in the 1930s. His last daily poem {{appeared}} in the New York Herald Tribune on May 16, 1936. [...] "When he retired, the newspaper used free-lance verse rather than attempt to find a permanent successor," [...] wrote the New York Times. His wife, Helen, died in January 1937 after nearly 40 years of marriage. As his health worsened, Montague went to the McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. He died there on December 16, 1941, survived by his two sons and daughter as well as seven grandchildren.|$|E
2500|$|More importantly, {{however, the}} Frankfurt School {{attempted}} {{to define the}} fate of reason in the new historical period. While Marcuse did so through analysis of structural changes in the labor process under capitalism and inherent features of the methodology of science, Horkheimer and Adorno concentrated on a re-examination of the foundation of critical theory. This effort appears in systematized form in Adorno's Negative Dialectics, which tries to redefine dialectics for {{an era in which}} [...] "philosophy, which <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> obsolete, lives on because the moment to realize it was missed". Negative dialectics expresses the idea of critical thought so conceived that the apparatus of domination cannot co-opt it.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{introduction}} to The Reader's Companion to Military History Robert Cowley and Geoffrey Parker summarise {{this side of}} the modern view of the Battle of Tours by saying [...] "The study of military history has undergone drastic changes in recent years. The old drums-and-bugles approach will no longer do. Factors such as economics, logistics, intelligence, and technology receive the attention once accorded solely to battles and campaigns and casualty counts. Words like [...] "strategy" [...] and [...] "operations" [...] have acquired meanings that might not have been recognizable a generation ago. Changing attitudes and new research have altered our views of what <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> to matter most. For example, several of the battles that Edward Shepherd Creasy listed in his famous 1851 book The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World rate hardly a mention here, and the confrontation between Muslims and Christians at Poitiers-Tours in 732, once considered a watershed event, has been downgraded to a raid in force." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Tyler Genji (2001) — Tyler's Genji {{contains}} more extensive explanatory footnotes and commentary {{than the previous}} translations, describing the numerous poetical allusions and cultural aspects of the tale. Tyler consciously attempted to mimic the original style in ways that the previous translations did not. [...] For example, this version does not use names for most characters, identifying them instead by their titles in a manner which was conventional {{in the context of}} the 11th century original text. Tyler's version [...] "makes a special virtue of attending to a certain ceremonial indirectness in the way the characters address one another. The great temptation for a translator is to say the unsaid things, and Tyler never gives in to it." [...] This has been praised by critics as [...] "preserving more of what <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> unfamiliar or strange to English readers", as understanding the culture of Lady Murasaki's time is arguably a chief reason for reading Genji.|$|E
2500|$|L'Avventura {{influenced}} the visual language of cinema, changing how subsequent films looked, {{and has been}} named by some critics {{as one of the}} best ever made. However, it has been criticized by others for its seemingly uneventful plot and slow pacing, along with the existentialist themes. Youngblood has stated that [...] "very few films in the history of cinema have broken the standard rules of cinematic grammar so elegantly, so subtly, as this film." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum has called it a masterpiece. Roger Ebert said that he came to like the film later in life when he began to admire the [...] "clarity and passion Antonioni brought to the film's silent cry of despair." [...] Geoff Andrew of Time Out criticized the film, writing that [...] "If it <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> the ultimate in arty, intellectually chic movie-making, the film now looks all too studied and remote a portrait of emotional sterility." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune defended the film against Andrew's criticism, saying that [...] "It's easy to bash Antonioni as passe. It's harder, I think, to explain the cinematic power of the way his camera watches, and waits, while the people on screen stave off a dreadful loneliness." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 16, 2008, Petraeus {{formally}} gave {{over his}} command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno {{in a government}} ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus [...] "played a historic role" [...] and created the [...] "translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances". Gates also told Petraeus he believed [...] "history will regard you {{as one of our}} nation's greatest battle captains." [...] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal. At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls. Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that [...] "the gains [...] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure." [...] Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, [...] "violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, Iraqi leaders are asserting themselves, and streets that <b>once</b> <b>seemed</b> dead are flourishing with life." [...] This is also illustrated by the Iraq Trends charts that the MNF-I produces weekly. The January 3, 2009, Iraq Trends chart clearly depicts over time, the increases in incidents followed by the sharp decline as described by Dexter Filkens and others.|$|E
