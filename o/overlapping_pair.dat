40|$|BACKGROUND: Overlapping {{transcripts}} in antisense orientation {{have the}} potential to form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a substrate for a number of different RNA-modification pathways. One prominent route for dsRNA is its breakdown by Dicer enzyme complexes into small RNAs, a pathway that is widely exploited by RNA interference technology to inactivate defined genes in transgenic lines. The significance of this pathway for endogenous gene regulation remains unclear. RESULTS: We have examined transcription data for <b>overlapping</b> gene <b>pairs</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana. On the basis of an analysis of transcripts with coding regions, we find the majority of <b>overlapping</b> gene <b>pairs</b> to be convergently <b>overlapping</b> <b>pairs</b> (COPs), with the potential for dsRNA formation. In all tissues, COP transcripts are present at a higher frequency compared to the overall gene pool. The probability that both the sense and antisense copy of a COP are co-transcribed matches the theoretical value for coexpression under the assumption that the expression of one partner does not affect the expression of the other. Among COPs, we observe an over-representation of spliced (intron-containing) genes (90...|$|R

Recently, {{it has been reported that}} overlapping genes, which are ubiquitous in all domains of life, seem to exhibit inordinate degrees of positive selection. Here, we present a new method for the simultaneous estimation of selection intensities in overlapping genes. We show that the appearance of positive selection is caused by assuming that selection operates independently on each gene in an <b>overlapping</b> <b>pair,</b> thereby ignoring the unique evolutionary constraints on overlapping coding regions. Our method uses an exact evolutionary model, thereby voiding the need for approximation or intensive computation. We test the method by simulating the evolution of overlapping genes of different types as well as under diverse evolutionary scenarios. Our results indicate that the independent estimation approach leads to the false appearance of positive selection even though the gene is in reality subject to negative selection. Finally, we use our method to estimate selection in two influenza A genes for which positive selection was previously inferred. We find no evidence for positive selection in both cases...|$|E

During cell division a spindle structure of overlapping antiparallel microtubules (MT) form whose stability and dynamics {{under the influence of}} MPs has been studied extensively. Although passive cross linkers (PCL) were known to provide structural stability to filamentous network, consequences of the interplay between ATP dependent active forces of MPs and passive entropic forces of PCLs on MT overlap remains largely unexplored. Here, we formulate and characterize a model to study this, using linear stability analysis and numerical integration. In presence of PCLs, we find dynamic phase transitions with changing activity exhibiting regimes of stable partial overlap with or without oscillations, instability towards complete overlap, and stable limit cycle oscillations that emerge via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation characterized by an oscillation frequency determined by the MP and PCL parameters. We show that the overlap dynamics and stability depend crucially on whether both the MTs of <b>overlapping</b> <b>pair</b> are movable or one is immobilized, having potential implications for in vivo and in vitro studies.

Using a paradigm where participants first learn {{a series of}} four <b>overlapping</b> <b>pairs</b> that constitute the ordered sequence A>B>C>D>E and are then tested on the novel TI pair BD and non-TI pair AE, animal experiments demonstrated that intact function of the hippocampus is necessary for TI but not for non-TI. We performed three {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) experiments to identify neural correlates of TI in healthy humans. First, we show hippocampal activation in learning <b>overlapping</b> <b>pairs</b> that constitute an ordered sequence but not non-overlapping individual pairs. Second, we demonstrate hippocampal recruitment in inferences on the ordered sequence of <b>overlapping</b> <b>pairs</b> (TI) but not on non-overlapping pairs (non-TI, e. g., if a>b and c>d then a>d). We then demonstrate the specificity of hippocampal activation to TI on pairs that are devoid of sequence end-items (e. g., B>D vs. A>C). The results support the relational flexibility account of hippocampal function. (cont.) Under this account, the hippocampus plays a special role in declarative memory in that it acts to rapidly bind common features into a unified representation that supports flexible inferential memory expression. Other brain areas that were activated in TI included prefrontal cortex, pre-supplementary and supplementary motor areas, insula, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, lateral temporal cortex, precuneus, posterior parietal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, ventral striatum and midbrain (the TI network). In schizophrenia, TI performance is impaired. Could this deficit be linked to hippocampal abnormalities in SZ? We used the findings from studies of TI in healthy participants to interpret an fMRI study of TI in SZ. In SZ, we confirmed the deficit in TI on pairs devoid of end-items (e. g., B>D) but not on pairs including an end-item (e. g., A>C) and linked it to reduced hippocampal activation.

Participants subsequently infer that BC predicts the rare disease, a non-rational decision made {{in opposition to the}} underlying base rates of the two diseases. Error-driven attention theories of learning state that the IBRE occurs because C attracts more attention than B. On the basis of this account we predicted and observed the occurrence of brain potentials associated with visual attention: a posterior Selection Negativity, and a concurrent anterior Selection Positivity, for C vs. B in a post-training test phase. Error-driven attention theories further predict no Selection Negativity, Selection Positivity or IBRE, for control symptoms matched on frequency to B and C, but for which there was no shared symptom (A) during training. These predictions were also confirmed, and this confirmation discounts alternative explanations of the IBRE based on the relative novelty of B and C.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that the herpes simplex virus (HSV) U S 3 encodes two {{transcriptional}} units directing the synthesis of the U S 3 (residues 1 to 481) and U S 3. 5 (residues 77 to 481) protein kinases. Both kinases phosphorylate histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC 1) and HDAC 2 and enable the expression of genes cotransduced into U 2 OS cells by recombinant baculoviruses, an activity designated the “helper function. ” The two kinases differ with respect to antiapoptotic activity. In the studies reported here, we made a series of FLAG-tagged amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncations of U S 3 and these were tested for antiapoptotic activity, phosphorylation of HDAC 1, and the helper function. We report the following. (i) HDAC 1 phosphorylation and the helper function were expressed in cells transduced by the truncation encoding residues 182 to 481 but not in cells transduced by the truncation encoding residues 189 to 481 or the amino-terminal polypeptides encompassing the first 188 amino acids.

40|$|Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) {{has allowed}} in-vivo viewing of details of retinal layers like never before. With the {{development}} of spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) details of nearly 2 µm axial resolution and higher imaging speed have been reported. Nevertheless, a single volume scan of the retina is typically restricted to 6 mm x 6 mm in size. Having a larger field {{of view of the}} retina will definitely enhance the clinical utility of the OCT. A tool was developed for creating wide-field thickness maps of the retina by combining the use of already available tools like i 2 k Retina (DualAlign, LLC, Clifton Park, NY) and the thickness maps from Cirrus HD-OCT research browser (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA). Normal subjects (n= 20) were imaged on Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT using 512 x 128 Macular Cube scanning protocol. Sixteen overlapping volumetric images were obtained by moving the internal fixation target around such that the final stitched maps were 12 mm x 14 mm in size. The thickness maps were corrected for inter-individual differences in axial lengths measured using Zeiss IOL Master and averaged to obtain a normative map. An algorithm was also developed for montaging 3 -D volume scans. Using this algorithm two OCT volume scans can be registered and stitched together to obtain a larger volume scan. The algorithm can be described as a two step process involving 3 -D phase-correlation and 2 -D Pseudo-polar Fourier transform (PPFT). In the first step, 3 -D phase-correlation provides translation values in the x, y and z axis. The second step involves applying PPFT on each <b>overlapping</b> <b>pair</b> of B-scans to find rotation in the x-y plane. Subsequent volumes can be stitched to obtain a large field of view. We developed a simple and robust method for creating wide-field views of the retina using existing SD-OCT hardware. As segmentation algorithms improve, this method could be expanded to produce wide-field maps of retinal sub-layers, such as the outer nuclear layer or retinal nerve fiber layer. These wide-field views of the retina may prove useful in evaluating retinal diseases involving the peripheral retina (e. g., retinitis pigmentosa and glaucoma) ...|$|E
40|$|Context: Software {{development}} is a complex socio-technical endeavor that involves coordinating different disciplines and skill sets. Practitioners experiment with and adopt processes and practices with a goal of making their work more effective. Objective: To observe, describe, and analyze software development processes and practices in an industrial setting. Our goal is to generate a descriptive theory of software engineering development, which is rooted in empirical data. Method: Following Constructivist Grounded Theory, we conducted a 2. 5 year participant-observation of eight software projects at Pivotal, a software development company. We interviewed 33 software engineers, interaction designers, and product managers, and analyzed one year of retrospection topics. We iterated between data collection, data analysis and theoretical sampling until achieving theoretical saturation and generating a descriptive theory. Results: 1) This research introduces a descriptive theory of Sustainable Software Development. The theory encompasses principles, policies, and practices aiming at removing knowledge silos and improving code quality, hence leading to development sustainability. 2) At the heart of Sustainable Software Development is team code ownership. This research widens our understanding of team code ownership. Developers achieve higher team code ownership when they understand the system context, {{have contributed to the}} code in question, perceive code quality as high, believe the product will satisfy the user needs, and perceive high team cohesion. 3) This research introduces the first evidence-based waste taxonomy, identifying eight wastes along with causes and tensions, and compares it with Lean Software Development’s waste taxonomy. Conclusion: The Sustainable Software Development theory refines and extends our understanding of Extreme Programming by adding principles, policies, and practices (including <b>Overlapping</b> <b>Pair</b> Rotation) and aligning them with the business goal of sustainability.

40|$|Video is {{becoming}} a popular image source {{for a wide range}} of remote sensing applications, particularly when timely acquisition and low cost are the objectives. Specific photogrammetric applications include close range machine vision, rapid orthomosaic construction, and georegistration of tactical video sequences acquired using UAV 2 ̆ 7 s (unmanned aircraft vehicles). Accurate position determination requires rigorous mathematical modeling of uncalibrated video cameras, which contain relatively large systematic errors due to lens distortions and the unknown principal point location relative to the image coordinate system. A photogrammetric bundle adjustment algorithm with 10 Interior Orientation (IO) camera parameters is implemented using unified least squares. Due to high correlations among the IO parameters and between the IO and Exterior Orientation (EO) camera parameters, and sometimes also due to weak geometry, it is practical to recover only a subset of the 10 IO camera parameters in a self-calibration solution. Experiments with real video data are used to determine which IO parameters to recover, and to analyze the triangulation results using blocks and sequences of video with varying geometry. Both cases with fixed and varying zoom are considered. Tests with simulated data are run to study the use of GPS observations of the camera perspective center as the only source of control, provided that the aircraft trajectory does not approximate a straight line. Since the rigorous photogrammetric condition equations are nonlinear with respect to the unknown parameters, they require close initial approximations and iterations. Linear image invariance techniques are presented in this thesis that compute estimates for the camera parameters, of a single frame or an <b>overlapping</b> <b>pair</b> of frames, as a function of image coordinates and ground coordinates only. Optional constrained nonlinear refinements to these techniques that improve accuracy and reduce control requirements are discussed. In another application of photogrammetric invariance, four techniques to solve the image transfer problem are applied to triplets of images, and analyzed. A sequential Kalman filtering technique, which implements the First Order Gauss-Markov stochastic constraints, is developed and analyzed as an efficient alternative to the simultaneous bundle adjustment. The Kalman filter is designed to use the optimum combination of the platform trajectory and camera parameter values at the previous frame, and the observations on the current frame, to compute the updated elements of the current state vector. Experiments with simulated and real data show its near equivalence to the bundle, adjustment, with potential significant benefit for video sequences with zoom. ...|$|E
