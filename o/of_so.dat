40|$|SummaryThe Ras-specific {{nucleotide}} exchange factor Son <b>of</b> sevenless (<b>Sos)</b> is inactive without Ras {{bound to}} a distal allosteric site. In contrast, the catalytic domain of Ras guanine nucleotide releasing factor 1 (RasGRF 1) is active intrinsically. By substituting residues from RasGRF 1 into Sos, we have generated mutants <b>of</b> <b>Sos</b> with basal activity, partially relieved of {{their dependence on}} allosteric activation. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations showing how Ras binding to the allosteric site leads to a bias toward the active conformation <b>of</b> <b>Sos.</b> The trajectories show that Sos fluctuates between active and inactive conformations {{in the absence of}} Ras and that the activating mutations favor conformations <b>of</b> <b>Sos</b> that are more permissive to Ras binding at the catalytic site. In contrast, unliganded RasGRF 1 fluctuates primarily among active conformations. Our results support the premise that the catalytic domain <b>of</b> <b>Sos</b> has evolved an allosteric activation mechanism that extends beyond the simple process of membrane recruitment...|$|R

5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence <b>of</b> <b>so</b> much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I {{appointed}} Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at Pipewell, with the consecration on 22 October 1189 at Westminster. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were Godfrey de Lucy to the see of Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to the see of London, and William Longchamp to the see of Ely. The elevation <b>of</b> <b>so</b> many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king's break with his father's habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the sees. At {{about the same time}} Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his power because of political manoeuvring over the elevation of King Richard's illegitimate half-brother Geoffrey to the see of York, which Walter had at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter's withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey's election.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of Ras {{is controlled by}} the inter-conversion between GTP- and GDP-bound forms, partly regulated by the binding of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son <b>of</b> Sevenless (<b>Sos).</b> The details <b>of</b> <b>Sos</b> binding, leading to nucleotide exchange and subsequent dissociation of the complex, are not completely understood. Here, we used uniformly [15 N]-labeled Ras, as well as [13 C-methyl-M,I]-labeled Sos, for observing site-specific details of Ras:Sos interactions in solution. Binding of various forms of Ras (loaded with GDP and mimics of GTP, or nucleotide-free) at the allosteric and catalytic sites <b>of</b> <b>Sos</b> was comprehensively characterized, by monitoring signal perturbations in the NMR spectra. The overall affinity of binding between these protein variants, as well as their selected functional mutants, was also investigated using intrinsic fluorescence. The data supports a positive feedback activation <b>of</b> <b>Sos</b> by Ras•GTP, with Ras•GTP binding as a substrate for the catalytic site <b>of</b> activated <b>Sos</b> more weakly than Ras•GDP, suggesting that Sos should actively promote unidirectional GDP→GTP exchange on Ras, in preference of passive homonucleotide exchange. Ras•GDP weakly binds to the catalytic, but not to the allosteric site <b>of</b> <b>Sos.</b> This confirms that Ras•GDP cannot properly activate Sos at the allosteric site. The novel site-specific assay described may be useful for design of drugs aimed at perturbing Ras:Sos interactions...|$|R
