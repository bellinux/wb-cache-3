5|$|Each republican {{magistrate}} held certain constitutional powers. Only the People of Rome (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer these powers on any individual magistrate. The most powerful constitutional power was imperium. Imperium was held by both consuls and praetors. Imperium gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. All magistrates also had the power <b>of</b> <b>coercion.</b> This was used by magistrates to maintain public order. While in Rome, all citizens could seek judgment against coercion. This protection was called provocatio (see below). Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power would often be used to obstruct political opponents.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics.

Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E

While they had a curule chair, they did not have lictors, and thus they had no power <b>of</b> <b>coercion.</b> The Plebeian Council (principal popular assembly), under the presidency of a plebeian tribune, elected the two plebeian aediles. Aediles had wide-ranging powers over day-to-day affairs inside the city of Rome, and over the maintenance of public order. They had the power over public games and shows, and over the markets. They also had the power to repair and preserve temples, sewers and aqueducts, to maintain public records, and to issue edicts. Any expenditure of public funds, by either a curule aedile or a plebeian aedile, had to be authorized by the senate.|$|E

Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations <b>of</b> <b>coercion,</b> and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{historians have}} also re-examined {{the role of}} the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the {{accession}} process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element <b>of</b> <b>coercion.</b> Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a moral obligation to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, {{one of the reasons why}} the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option. Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century—unite all of India under one rule.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} supports the con-tention that {{both women and men}} employ various seductive, manipulative, intoxication, and even forceful tactics <b>of</b> sex-ual <b>coercion</b> to obtain sexual contact from unwilling partners. Although the self-reported coercive behavior of men and women may appear similar in many respects, predictors of such behavior seem to vary in important ways across gender. In addition to examining the prevalence of coercive behav-iors reported across gender, the present study examined the extent to which four variables found in models <b>of</b> male sexual <b>coercion</b> predicted self-reported use <b>of</b> sexual <b>coercion</b> in a sample (n = 186) of college men and women: prior sexual abuse, sexual dominance, sociosexuality, and sexual com-pulsivity. Although prior sexual abuse seemed {{to be part of a}} cycle <b>of</b> sexual <b>coercion</b> among both men and women, key predictors <b>of</b> sexual <b>coercion</b> among men were sexual dom-inance and sociosexuality, whereas the key predictor <b>of</b> sexual <b>coercion</b> among women was sexual compulsivity. These findings support the notion that whereas men may behave coercively to obtain or maintain an impersonal sense of power and control, women may behave coercively to achieve some level of interpersonal connection when feeling out of control...|$|R

During the initiation phase, traffickers use foot-in-the-door techniques of persuasion to lead their victims into various trafficking industries.

Background: It is {{important}} to have current reliable estimates of the prevalence, correlates and consequences <b>of</b> sexual <b>coercion</b> among a representative sample of Australian adults and to identify changes over time in prevalence and consequences. Methods: Computer-assisted telephone interviews were completed by a representative sample of 20 094 Austral ian men and women aged 16 - 69 years. The participation rate among eligible people was 66. 2 %. Results: Sexual coercion (i. e. being forced or frightened into sexual activity) was reported by 4. 2 % of men and 22. 4 % <b>of</b> women. Sexual <b>coercion</b> when aged ≤ 16 years was reported by 2. 0 % of men and 11. 5 % of women. Correlates <b>of</b> sexual <b>coercion</b> were similar for men and women. Those who had been coerced reported greater psychosocial distress, were more likely to smoke, were more anxious about sex and more likely to have acquired a sexually transmissible infection. Few people had talked to others about their experiences <b>of</b> sexual <b>coercion</b> and fewer had talked to a professional. There {{were no significant differences between}} the First and Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships in whether men or women had experienced coercion, talked to anyone about this or talked to a counsellor or psychologist. Conclusion: Sexual coercion has detrimental effects on various aspects of people's lives. It usually occurs at the ages at which people become sexually active.
