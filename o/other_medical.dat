A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced.

It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and help those who needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E
