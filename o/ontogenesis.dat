25|$|The {{putative}} {{function of}} SCO-spondin in neuronal differentiation is discussed regarding these features and homologies with other developmental molecules {{of the central}} nervous system exhibiting TSR domains, and involved in axonal guidance. Peptides corresponding to SCO-spondin TSR domains strongly increased adhesivity and neuritic outgrouth of cortical neurons and induced disaggregation of spinal cord neurons. Therefore, it is a candidate to interfere with neuronal development and/or axonal guidance during <b>ontogenesis</b> of {{the central nervous system}} in the modulation of side-to-side and side-to-substratum interactions, and also in promoting neurite outgrowth.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{promotes}} endometrial cell {{growth and}} in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, estrogen monotherapy results in continued endometrial development without the physiological secretory changes normally {{brought on by}} progesterone. This action is {{associated with an increased}} incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Additional protection with progestogens is therefore important in patients with an intact uterus who receive estrogen replacement therapy. Dydrogesterone counters the proliferative effect of estrogens on the endometrium and ensures the transition to a secretory pattern and cyclical shedding of the endometrium in serial HRT regimes. Dydrogesterone effectively protects against the <b>ontogenesis</b> of endometrial hyperplasia. Unlike androgenic progestogens, dydrogesterone does not reverse the benefits brought on by 17β-oestradiol on lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism. In a continuous, combined HRT regimen, dydrogesterone retards the proliferation of the endometrium so that it remains atrophic or inactive.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is made up}} of the two [...] "geniculate bodies" [...] (knee-form bodies) {{that are}} located ventrally at the surface of the thalamus, below the pulvinar. They are [...] "relays" [...] of highly {{specific}} functions: audition for the first and vision for the second. They differentiate early in <b>ontogenesis</b> and totally, for the lateral or partially for the medial separate from the thalamic mass. They are however specialized but authentical isothalamic elements.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} or absence of a cribellum is used to classify araneomorph spiders into the cribellate and ecribellate (not cribellate) type. The distinction can be used to study evolutionary relationships. However, in 1967 it was discovered that there are many families with both cribellate and ecribellate members (Lehtinen, 1967). Today, it is believed that the precursor of all Araneomorphae was cribellate (symplesiomorphy), and that this function was lost in some araneomorph spiders secondarily (Coddington & Levy, 1991). Many of these still retain a colulus, which is thought to be a reduced cribellum, and is of unknown function. However, some [...] "ecribellate" [...] spiders seem to have evolved independently, without cribellate precursors (Foelix, 1979). In Austrochilidae, the cribellum is developed only in the second nymphal stage, so the ecribellate and cribellate conditions change during the spider <b>ontogenesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Francisc Iosif Rainer (December 28, 1874 – August 4, 1944) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian pathologist, {{physiologist}} and anthropologist. From {{an immigrant}} family, he earned early recognition for his experimental work in anatomy, and helped reform Romanian medical science. He {{spent much of}} his youth training himself in anatomical pathology and the various areas of natural science, gaining direct experience as a microbiologist, surgeon, and military physician. With teaching positions at the University of Iași and the University of Bucharest, where he established specialized sections, Rainer became a noted promoter of science and an innovator in his field. He notably favored and introduced the anatomical study of [...] "functional structures", and was in particular preoccupied with issues pertaining to <b>ontogenesis</b> and kinesiology. An intellectual influence on several generations of doctors, his wife was Marta Trancu-Rainer, Romania's first female surgeon.|$|E
2500|$|Scipionyx is {{considered}} one of the most important fossil vertebrates ever discovered, after a long and painstaking [...] "autopsy" [...] revealed the unique fossilisation of portions of its internal organs. It is believed Scipionyx lived in a region filled with shallow lagoons. These bodies of water were oxygen deficient, leading to the well-preserved Scipionyx specimen, much like the fine fossil preservation seen in Germany's Archaeopteryx. Parts of the windpipe, intestines, liver, blood vessels, cartilage, horn sheaths, tendons and muscles were fossilised in the fine limestone. The specimen's liver was preserved in the form of a red heamatite halo retaining the shape it had when the animal was alive. The find has great importance because the relative positions of internal organs of dinosaurs could only be guessed at before this discovery. The holotype specimen thus provides unique direct information about the physiology of non-avian dinosaurs, especially regarding the digestion, the respiration and the <b>ontogenesis.</b>|$|E

[...] He {{observed that the}} book, [...] "records the first revision of my historical identity, from Marx to Marx and Freud", a process which occurred because his first [...] "historical identity", Marxism, had been [...] "wrecked in the frozen landscapes of the Cold War, {{the defeat of the}} simplistic hopes for a better world that inspired the Henry Wallace campaign for the Presidency in 1948." [...] Brown, who saw Louis Zukofsky's poetry as anticipating the ideas of both Life Against Death and Love's Body (1966), has called Life Against Death [...] "my first exuberant surge of premature post-Marxist energy", writing that in it he had wagered his [...] "intellectual life on the idea of finding in Freud what was missing in Marx." [...] Brown [...] "found in Freud's analysis of the pathological dimension of human desires the basis for a post-Marxist critique of capitalism." [...] Commenting on his intellectual development, Brown noted that, [...] "My Marxist background had given me a healthy prejudice against moneymaking.

2500|$|David Abram {{explains}} Merleau-Ponty's {{concept of}} [...] "flesh" [...] (chair) as [...] "the mysterious tissue or matrix that underlies and {{gives rise to}} both the perceiver and the perceived as interdependent aspects of its spontaneous activity," [...] and he identifies this elemental matrix with the interdependent web of earthly life. This concept unites subject and object dialectically as determinations within a more primordial reality, which Merleau-Ponty calls [...] "the flesh," [...] and which Abram refers to variously as [...] "the animate earth," [...] "the breathing biosphere," [...] or [...] "the more-than-human natural world." [...] Yet this is not nature or the biosphere conceived as {{a complex set of}} objects and objective processes, but rather [...] "the biosphere as it is experienced and lived from within by the intelligent body — by the attentive human animal who is entirely {{a part of the world}} that he, or she, experiences. Merleau-Ponty's ecophenemonology with its emphasis on holistic dialog within the larger-than-human world also has implications for the <b>ontogenesis</b> and phylogenesis of language, indeed he states that [...] "language is the very voice of the trees, the waves and the forest." [...] Merleau-Ponty himself refers to [...] "that primordial being which is not yet the subject-being nor the object-being and which in every respect baffles reflection. From this primordial being to us, there is no derivation, nor any break..." [...] Among the many working notes found on his desk at the time of his death, and published with the half-complete manuscript of The Visible and the Invisible, several make evident that Merleau-Ponty himself recognized a deep affinity between his notion of a primordial [...] "flesh" [...] and a radically transformed understanding of [...] "nature." [...] Hence in November 1960 he writes: [...] "Do a psychoanalysis of Nature: it is the flesh, the mother." [...] And in the last published working note, written in March 1961, he writes: [...] "Nature as the other side of humanity (as flesh, nowise as 'matter')." ...|$|E

5000|$|One {{example of}} this, the most well {{described}} {{of the developmental}} METs, is kidney <b>ontogenesis.</b> The mammalian kidney is primarily formed by two early structures: the ureteric bud and the nephrogenic mesenchyme, which form the collecting duct and nephrons respectively (see kidney development for more details). During kidney <b>ontogenesis,</b> a reciprocal induction of the ureteric bud epithelium and nephrogenic mesenchyme occurs. As the ureteric bud grows out of the Wolffian duct, the nephrogenic mesenchyme induces the ureteric bud to branch. Concurrently, the ureteric bud induces the nephrogenic mesenchyme to condense around the bud and undergo MET to form the renal epithelium, which ultimately forms the nephron. [...] Growth factors, integrins, cell adhesion molecules, and protooncogenes, such as c-ret, c-ros, and c-met, mediate the reciprocal induction in metanephrons and consequent MET.|$|E
