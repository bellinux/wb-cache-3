40|$|Geocast is {{a scheme}} which allows packets {{to be sent}} to a {{destination}} area instead of an address. This allows the addressing of any device in a specific region without further knowledge. In this paper we present an addressing mechanism that allows efficient referral to areas of arbitrary size.
