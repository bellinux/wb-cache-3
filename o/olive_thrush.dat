500|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1766 by Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae as Turdus migratorius. The binomial name derives from two Latin words: turdus, [...] "thrush", and migratorius from migrare [...] "to go". The term robin for this species has been recorded since at least 1703. There are about 65 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus Turdus, characterized by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. A study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates that the American robin {{is not part of}} the Central/South American clade of Turdus thrushes; instead it shows genetic similarities to the Kurrichane thrush, T. libonyanus, and the <b>olive</b> <b>thrush,</b> T. olivaceus, both African species. This conflicts with a 2007 DNA study of 60 of 65 Turdus species which places the American robin's closest relative as the rufous-collared robin (T. rufitorques) of Central America. Though having distinct plumage, the two species are similar in vocalization and behavior. Beyond this, it lies in a small group of four species of otherwise Central American distribution, suggesting it recently spread northwards into North America.|$|E
50|$|The Abyssinian thrush, African {{mountain}} thrush or Northern <b>olive</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus abyssinicus) is a passerine bird in {{the family}} Turdidae. In 2010, the species was confirmed as separate from the <b>olive</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus olivaceus) due to genetic differences. Their ranges do not overlap. The southern and northern populations may be distinct species. The Abyssinian thrush is found in Eritrea {{and other parts of}} the Horn of Africa, as well as an area to the southeast extending from the African Great Lakes region to north eastern Zambia and Malawi.|$|E

Phaeornis obscurus is a medium-sized (7 - 8 inch long brownish thrush with light to dark gray underparts. It was first described in 1789. Exhaustive search uncovered some 517 observations, collection records, reports and related statements on relative abundance and geographical distribution from ca. 1778 to 1978. All data are arranged in order and systematically analyzed. Distributional records are shown by U. S. Geological Survey quadrangle. References and names of observers are cited. Completeness of data, bias, erroneous and doubtful records are addressed. Findings are summarized. It is concluded that all five subspecies have suffered catastrophic depopulations with only one subspecies (P. o. obscurus on the island of Hawai'i) given much chance of long-term survival. Phaeornis palmeri is a medium-sized (6 - 7 inch long) <b>olive</b> to ashy-brown <b>thrush</b> with whitish abdomen endemic to Kaua'i. It was first described in 1893. Exhaustive search uncovered some 36 observations, collection records, reports and related statements on relative abundance and geographical distribution from 1891 to 1978. All data are arranged in order and systematically analyzed. Distributional records are shown by U. S. Geological Survey quadrangle. References and names of observers are cited. Completeness of data, bias, erroneous and doubtful records are addressed. Findings are summarized. Until such time as results of U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys are published it is concluded that the Puaiohi {{is on the verge of}} final disappearance if not actually extinct.

50|$|The Taita thrush (Turdus helleri), {{also known}} as Taita <b>olive</b> <b>thrush</b> or Heller's ground thrush, is a {{critically}} endangered bird from the family of thrushes (Turdidae), endemic to the Taita Hills in Kenya.|$|E
50|$|In {{southern}} Africa alone, {{there are}} five subspecies which differ mainly in the relative amounts of white, orange and brown on the underparts: T. o. swynnertoni, T. o. transvaalensis, T. o. olivaceus, T. o. pondonensis, and T. o. culminans. The Karoo thrush (Turdus smithi), the Somali thrush (Turdus ludoviciae) and the Taita thrush (Turdus helleri) are variously included as subspecies of the <b>olive</b> <b>thrush</b> or considered separate species, of which the last is critically endangered. Additionally, the taxa from {{the northern part of}} its range are sometimes regarded as one (Northern <b>olive</b> <b>thrush</b> or mountain thrush, T. abyssinicus) or several separate species (Abyssinian thrush, T. abyssinicus, and Usambara thrush, T. roehli).|$|E
50|$|The African thrush {{may be part}} of a {{superspecies}} {{with the}} kurrichane thrush and the bare-eyed thrush and some subspecies of African thrush (T.p. poensis, T.p.nigrilorum, T.p. centralis and T.p. chinguanicoides) have been considered subspecies of <b>olive</b> <b>thrush.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Abyssinian thrush was {{considered}} {{to be part of the}} <b>olive</b> <b>thrush</b> but that species has now been split and is regarded as a superspecies, members of which include the Taita thrush, Karoo thrush, Usumbara thrush and Somali thrush.|$|E

50|$|The Taita thrush was {{previously}} classified as subspecies of the <b>olive</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus olivaceus), {{but it is}} regarded as distinct species since 1985. It reaches a length between 20 and 22 centimetres. Head, breast and upperparts are coloured darkly. The underparts are white and the flanks have a rufous hue. The eyes and the bill exhibit a pale orange coloration. It was named after zoologist Edmund Heller (1875-1939) a workmate of the American ornithologist Edgar Alexander Mearns (1856-1916) who described this species scientifically in 1913.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the biology of the <b>Olive</b> <b>Thrush</b> Turdus olivaceus olivaceus in Grahamstown, South Africa from 1998 to 2003. Behavioural differences between males and females, parent-young interactions, development of fledglings, {{and the role of}} song and moult in territorial behaviour were investigated. Comparisons of biometrics, moult and survival were made using <b>Olive</b> <b>Thrush</b> ringing data from other regions. There {{were no significant differences in}} mass, wing length or survival rate between the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, but primary wing moult started earlier in the Western Cape and coincided with the end of the main breeding periods in both provinces. Both males and females of breeding pairs remained in and defended their territories throughout the year, but there was some evidence that territorial defence was strongest during the breeding periods. Roughly, every 100 eggs laid produce 50 fledglings. Out of these 20 to 30 reach the age of independence at approximately 50 days, and only five of these juvenile birds reach maturity. Adult survival was estimated at 80 %, with a mean life expectancy of 4. 5 years and a conservative estimate of maximum lifespan of 11 years. Using ringing data and museum specimens, the <b>Olive</b> <b>Thrush</b> was compared with the Karoo Thrush Turdus smithi, a former race of the <b>Olive</b> <b>Thrush.</b> Olive Thrushes had shorter bills and wings, but were heavier than Karoo Thrushes from the Cradock district. There were also differences in bill and eye-ring colouration between these populations. No morphological differences were found between the sexes in either species...|$|E
