5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough of this kind <b>of</b> <b>shit.</b> It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it {{was just kind of}} like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> talking, and they did a lot <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

This percussion dude, he was coming in with bottles, banging on bottles, just sprinkles <b>of</b> <b>shit.</b> We went all out. We brought in musicians to bring it out. Jay probably just heard a sample and some drums. Once we got the vocals back, we brought in all the extra candy".|$|E
500|$|Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, {{his debut}} album Infinite, which was {{recorded}} at the Bassmint, {{a recording studio}} owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. [...] Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. [...] The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: [...] "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A {{lot of it was}} because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> started pissing me off." [...] After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.|$|E
500|$|God Hates Us All {{was to be}} {{recorded}} in a Hollywood studio; however, the band relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia due to the availability of cheaper studio time. Hyde recommended a studio to the band—The Warehouse Studio (owned by Bryan Adams) as he had previously worked there. The studio was altered to make it [...] "feel like home" [...] for Slayer; {{as opposed to the}} setting for, in King's words, the [...] "lightweight Canadian pop singer". This consisted of adding incense burners, candles, dimmed lights and pornography on the walls. Two banner flags of two middle fingers were also hung up. Vocalist Tom Araya says [...] "that was basically the attitude of Slayer in the studio. We had a red devil head on one of the speakers. We had a skull on another. That's the kind <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> we put up. Spooky stuff that makes you feel at home." ...|$|E

500|$|Escape was {{recorded}} in 16 days at Battery Studios in London, with Hutchins often writing lyrics in the studio. He {{found it difficult to}} write a complete song at home, and finished the lyrics later. Hutchins worked well with Smith, and said that the producer became involved in the music-making and [...] "would start talking a lot <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> to us to let us feel like he felt". Smith's presence is evident on [...] "Friends", whose beat was (according to Hutchins) [...] "nothing like the way it sounded after he got to it". Whodini often argued with the studio personnel; Hutchins said that he [...] "never seen studio sessions like ours. Criticism would be flying around that studio like skyrockets and bullets ... But we knew we got something right when Larry started grabbing his dick, and that was the craziest thing in the world." [...] Smith encouraged Whodini to use a variety of instruments on each track, from Linn LM-1 and Roland TR-707 drum machines to a Fender Jazz Bass.|$|E
500|$|On December 24, 2008, Judge Gary A. Feess granted 20th Century Fox's {{claim to}} a {{copyright}} interest in the film. An attorney for 20th Century Fox said that the studio would seek an order to delay the release of Watchmen. Producer Lloyd Levin revealed in an open letter that in 2005 both Fox and Warner Bros. were offered {{the chance to make}} Watchmen. Fox passed on the project while Warner Bros. made a deal to acquire the movie rights and move forward with development. An internal Fox email documented that executives at Fox felt the script was [...] "one of the most unintelligible pieces <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> they had read in years". On January 15, 2009, the trade press reported that Fox and Warner Bros. had reached a settlement. Fox would receive a share of the box office, but no future ownership of the film. The settlement awarded Fox up to $10 million in development costs and legal fees, plus worldwide gross participation scaling from 5 to 8.5 percent.|$|E
500|$|In February 1993, Nirvana {{traveled}} to Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, {{to record the}} album. [...] Albini {{did not meet the}} band members until the first day of recording, though he had spoken to them beforehand about the type of album they wanted to make. [...] Albini observed that [...] "they wanted to make precisely the sort of record that I'm comfortable doing". [...] The group stayed in a house located on the studio grounds during the recording sessions. [...] Novoselic compared the isolated conditions to a gulag; he added, [...] "There was snow outside, we couldn't go anywhere. [...] We just worked." [...] For most of the sessions, the only people present were the band members, Albini, and technician Bob Weston. [...] The band made it clear to DGC and Gold Mountain that it did not want any intrusion during the album production, going as far as not playing any of the work in progress for its record label A representative. [...] To prevent the group's managers and label from interfering, Albini instituted a strict policy of ignoring everyone except for the band members; the producer explained that everyone associated with the group aside from the musicians themselves were [...] "the biggest pieces <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> I ever met".|$|E

500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Bowie in mid– to late–1986 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. He produced the recording alongside David Richards. Lyrically, the song addresses the pollution {{and destruction of}} the planet by industry. Bowie has cited hearing of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 as {{the genesis of the}} lyrics, and was in Switzerland {{at the time of the}} accident. He said, [...] "I was taking a break from recording [...] it was a beautiful day and we were outside on a small piece of lawn facing the Alps and the lake. Our engineer, who had been listening to the radio, shot out of the studio and shouted: 'There's a whole lot <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> going down in Russia.' The Swiss news had picked up a Norwegian radio station that was screaming – to anyone who would listen – that huge billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren't rain clouds." [...] In another contemporary interview, Bowie said that the song [...] "deals with the idea that someone in one's own community could be the one responsible for blowing up the world." [...] At the time, he also stated that it was his favorite song from the album.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Love began {{composing}} {{an album}} with songwriter Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever {{wanted to have a}} glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was my one true piece <b>of</b> <b>shit.</b> It has no cohesive thread. I just hate it", she said in a 2014 interview. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: [...] "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." ...|$|E
500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full <b>of</b> <b>shit.</b> And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2014, Rihanna {{released}} a snippet {{of a song}} via her official Instagram account, the song featured lyrics such as [...] "Ain't none <b>of</b> this <b>shit</b> promised, ain't none of this promised" [...] and [...] "Ain't none <b>of</b> this <b>shit</b> certain, ain't none of it certain", whilst {{the rest of the}} snippet featured [...] "plinky synths and booming bass providing the only instrumentation."

In July 2015, Mike Will Made It posted a 15-second video clip featuring a snippet of Rihanna singing; in June of the following year he released their collaboration as the lead single from his album.|$|R

Sure, there’s more than a hint of the Cobain in the ragged guitars and slightly self-centred lyrical conceits, but rather than just aping Nirvana they instead share similar influences - particularly Pixies and Melvins - as well as update the mid-’90s college rock sound that Archers Of Loaf, Guided By Voices and Built To Spill made their own." ...|$|R
