2500|$|As well as {{the close}} {{tolerances}} between parts, the engine's lack of gaskets {{was made possible by}} a unique crankcase ventilation system. On any 2-cylinder boxer engine such as the 2CV's, the volume of the crankcase reduces by the cubic capacity of the engine when the pistons move together. This, combined with the inevitable small amount of [...] "leakage" [...] of combustion gases past the pistons leads to a positive pressure in the crankcase which must be removed in the interests of engine efficiency and to prevent oil and gas leaks. The 2CV's engine has a combined engine [...] "breather" [...] and <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> assembly which contains a series of rubber reed valves. These allow positive pressure to escape the crankcase (to the engine air intake to be recirculated) but close when the pressure in the crankcase drops as the pistons move apart. Because gases are expelled but not admitted this creates a slight vacuum in the crankcase so that any weak joint or failed seal causes air to be sucked in rather than allowing oil to leak out.|$|E

Within 24 hours of the explosion, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, who conducted the investigation, had determined from eyewitness interviews that the explosion originated in an area known as the [...] "Automated Compounding System". This was a synthetic rubber-processing system. It was the site for mixing, rolling, coating, and drying of a type of rubber called polyisoprene. The process adds <b>oils</b> and <b>fillers</b> to the material, as well as creating significant quantities of dust. Therefore, the working theory from an early point was the rubber dust explosion theory.|$|R

The inclusion of buffers in the HPMC matrix tablets enhanced naproxen release. For HCO tablets, only sodium bicarbonate enhanced naproxen release. The presence of lactose on HPMC matrix tablets did not show a significantly different result from that obtained with the formulation containing dibasic calcium phosphate as a filler. However, for the tablets containing HCO, the presence of lactose significantly enhanced the naproxen release rate.

40|$|Bituminous crack {{sealants}} {{were analyzed}} by viscometry, fluorescence microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, modulated differential scanning calorimetry and low temperature tensile testing. The results indicate that sealants are blends of bitumen, <b>oil,</b> copolymer and <b>filler.</b> Upon blending, these components produce a three phase system that consists of a polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) matrix, a filler, and a filler-PMB interface. Spectroscopy and microscopy indicate that the PMB phase is rich in styrene-butadiene type copolymer, that the filler is recycled rubber, sometimes mixed with calcium carbonate, and that the interface depends on the <b>filler</b> and the <b>oil</b> content in the sealant. The physico-chemical methods were used to predict the short- and medium-term performance of sealant mixtures. The short-term performance predicted from viscometry and microscopy correlated well with the 1 -year field performance of the sealants. Sealants showed two glass transition temperatures (Tg's), and a reasonable correlation was also found between the low temperature Tg and medium-term performance in a wetfreeze climate. However, because Tg measurements do not account for stress relaxation and aging effects, correlation was not perfect...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the material plasticine from a conservation perspective. The idea came from an existing problem with numerous sculpture models made of plasticine. These are Per Hasselberg's pieces at Gothenburg Museum of Art and Julius Kronberg's collection in his studio at Skansen, Stockholm. A literature survey and a case study which includes {{an examination of the}} two collections were carried out. Climate and storage conditions for the objects were different. Some are placed in a museum with controlled relative humidity and temperature, while others are still in their original location in a late 1800 ’s building. Common damages are cracking, crazing, loss of material and changes in shape and dimensions. Plasticine was developed in the 1890 ’s as an oil-based modelling clay. Since then, there have been a wide variety of plasticine-like products on the market, with different material compositions. Common for all of them are the three components wax, <b>oil</b> and <b>fillers.</b> No scientific research has been undertaken on the ageing characteristics of plasticine and few articles have been published on preventive and interventive conservation. Some, usually early, brands of plasticine contained sulphur. The emission of volatile sulphur compounds can cause corrosion of nearby metal objects; but despite this, it has been recommended for the mounting of objects. To investigate the sulphur content of Per Hasselberg's model Salve, a SEM-EDX analysis and an Oddy test were performed. The thesis ends with a discussion where recommendations for preventive conservation are given. The most important guideline is to store the objects in a climate where temperature and RH are stable.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that modern artists use many types of paint in their work, and they {{frequently}} experiment with products outside of those sold by art supply retailers. As a result, museums acquire paintings that are highly variable in composition. It is useful to understand trends in the mechanical properties of both artist-grade and household paints to properly care for objects containing such materials. For this study, a selection of white paints commonly used in the United Kingdom was prepared for chemical and mechanical analysis. The aim was to identify their compositions and relate this information to their respective mechanical properties. Several materials were included in the analysis: an artists' emulsion, household (matte, eggshell, silk) emulsions, an artists' alkyd, household alkyds, a traditional oil, and a water-mixable <b>oil.</b> Pigment and <b>filler</b> ingredients were identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and in some cases inorganic components were verified by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Binder resins were identified for the solvent and waterborne paints using pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PyGC/MS). Mechanical properties were determined through measurements of stress-strain curves under controlled environmental conditions. Results showed a wide range of properties due to different levels of pigment and filler in the paint systems. This was especially true for the household emulsions, which are manufactured with many different pigment volume concentrations (PVC) to modify optical properties. Tensile tests were also performed on specific materials to illustrate the plasticizing effect of water. These data were complemented by measurements of hygral expansion strains caused by attraction of water to hydrophilic formulation ingredients...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIBackground While the {{incidence}} of cosmetic filler injections is rising world-wide, neither exact {{details of the procedure}} nor the agent used are always reported or remembered by the patients. Thus, although complications are reportedly rare, availability of a precise diagnostic tool to detect cutaneous filler deposits could help clarify the association between the procedure and the underlying pathology. Objectives The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate cutaneous sonography in the detection and identification of cosmetic fillers deposits and, describe dermatological abnormalities found associated with the presence of those agents. Methods We used ultrasound in a porcine skin model to determine the sonographic characteristics of commonly available filler agents, and subsequently applied the analysis to detect and identify cosmetic fillers among patients referred for skin disorders. Results Fillers are recognizable on ultrasound and generate different patterns of echogenicity and posterior acoustic artefacts. Cosmetic fillers were identified in 118 dermatological patients; most commonly hyaluronic acid among degradable agents and silicone <b>oil</b> among non-degradable. <b>Fillers</b> deposits were loosely scattered throughout the subcutaneous tissue, with occasional infiltration of local muscles and loco-regional lymph nodes. Accompanying dermatopathies were represented by highly localized inflammatory processes unresponsive to conventional treatment, morphea-like reactions, necrosis of fatty tissue and epidermal cysts; in the case of non-degradable agents, the associated dermatopathies were transient, resolving upon disappearance of the filler. Conclusions Cosmetic filler agents may be detected and identified during routine ultrasound of dermatological lesions; the latter appear to be pathologically related to the cosmetic procedure...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The article {{describes}} validation {{and development of}} technology of vitamin, mineral and complex premixes {{with the introduction of}} vegetable oil and a set of equipment for its implementation. The two-component mixture was used for research. Crushed wheat was used as the main component, and the metal admixture with magnetic properties, vitamin B 2 and salt of micronutrients MnSO 4 as key components. Quality of the final mixture was determined by the homogeneity test. Trace components dosing accuracy was determined by dosing vitamins B 5, E, A, and trace-element salts MnSO 4, FeSO 4, CuSO 4. Also introduction of vegetable <b>oil</b> in the <b>filler</b> was researched. When the oil was entering the mixer in an amount of 2 % homogeneity of the <b>filler</b> and <b>oil</b> mixture was 94 %. The oil fine spray was provided by special nozzles design. A pilot mixer consisting of a body having a lower portion of the shape of the double trough and lid is developed for conducting research in mixing vitamins, salts of trace elements with the filler.
