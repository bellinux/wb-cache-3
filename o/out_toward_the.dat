5|$|In 1951, in a {{paper in}} Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium, Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution, {{but he did not}} think that such a belt still existed today. Kuiper was {{operating}} on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto was the size of Earth and had therefore scattered these bodies <b>out</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud or out of the Solar System. Were Kuiper's hypothesis correct, there would not be a Kuiper belt today.|$|E

On September 12 of that same year a fire broke out at the household of the Soldanieri, killing six people in a house of carpenters and a blacksmith that was located near the church of Santa Trinità.|$|E
5|$|Braham flew in {{the first}} wave. As Braham's wave reached Leeuwarden in the Netherlands and while {{four of the five}} RAF fighters made no contact, Braham {{attracted}} two enemy night fighters. The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1). Five had taken off under the command of Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories. Schnaufer led his flight <b>out</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> echo but turned back himself after engine trouble. Using his Serrate radar detector, Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters' Lichtenstein radar. He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft, an Experten with 15 air victories from 4./NJG 1. Kraft was killed. Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also. Its pilot, Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive. Braham considered shooting at one crew member, likely Vinke, who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft, but Bill Gregory persuaded him not to. Braham's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim. Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter. One reason for firing at close-range was Braham's high state of fatigue. In such a state Braham could barely keep his eyes open. Whenever he peered ahead they smarted and misted.|$|E

On one hand, it deals with the only deportation of Jews carried <b>out</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west of Germany by the Nazi regime.

25|$|After hiding all day {{above the}} camp, in holes dug beneath {{the bank of}} Sand Creek, the {{survivors}} there, {{many of whom were}} wounded, moved up the stream and spent the night on the prairie.

After a cold night without shelter, the survivors set <b>out</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Cheyenne camp on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill River. They soon met up with other survivors who had escaped with part of the horse herd, some returning from the Smoky Hill camp where they had fled during the attack.

25|$|The {{transport}} {{emerges from}} the passage and teeters {{on the edge of}} a vast pit of lava. Another transport is seen attempting to cross a rickety rope bridge which spans the pit under a crumbling ceiling. On the far side of the cavern, there is a 45-foot-tall stone face of Mara, that periodically shoots green rays at both transports, causing flames to erupt from where the beam hits. Formerly, there was an effect in place within this scene where the light beams would hit the ceiling, causing dyed ice cubes to rain down, simulating the rubble of the caving temple, but it was removed. The light beams have now been redirected away from the former effect, however, the sound effect for the rubble still plays upon entering the room. The transport turns left and enters catacombs of false pathways lined with skeletons, some of which pop <b>out</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> guests.|$|E
500|$|At the bridge, Frost {{was finally}} able to make radio contact with his divisional {{commander}} and given the difficult news that reinforcement was doubtful. [...] Shortly afterwards at about 13:30, Frost was injured in the legs by a mortar bomb. Command passed to Major Gough but by late afternoon the position was becoming untenable. As fire took hold of many of the buildings in which the wounded were being treated, a two-hour truce was organised in the late afternoon. The wounded (including Frost) were taken into captivity. Overnight, a few units managed to hold out for a little longer and several groups tried to break <b>out</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Oosterbeek perimeter. While Major Hibbert was leading a group toward Oosterbeek, he was captured.|$|E

500|$|As {{the armies}} {{advanced}} on one another, Hannibal gradually extended {{the center of}} his line, as Polybius described: [...] "After thus drawing up his whole army in a straight line, he took the central companies of Hispanics and Celts and advanced with them, keeping the rest of them in contact with these companies, but gradually falling off, so as to produce a crescent-shaped formation, the line of the flanking companies growing thinner as it was prolonged, his object being to employ the Africans as a reserve force and to begin the action with the Hispanics and Celts." [...] Polybius described the weak Carthaginian center as deployed in a crescent, curving <b>out</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Romans in the middle with the African troops on their flanks in echelon formation. It is believed that the purpose of this formation was to break the forward momentum of the Roman infantry, and delay its advance before other developments allowed Hannibal to deploy his African infantry most effectively. While the majority of historians feel that Hannibal's action was deliberate, some have called this account fanciful, and claim that the actions of the day represent either the natural curvature that occurs when a broad front of infantry marches forward, or the bending back of the Carthaginian center from the shock action of meeting the heavily massed Roman center.|$|E
500|$|At 02:00 on 19 May 1941, Bismarck and Prinz Eugen left Gotenhafen and {{proceeded}} through the Baltic Sea and <b>out</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic. Unknown to Lütjens, the British had intercepted enough signals to infer that a German naval operation might {{occur in the}} area. The German task force was first encountered by the Swedish seaplane-cruiser [...] on 20 May heading north-west past Gothenburg. The British Admiralty was informed through a Norwegian officer in Stockholm who had learned of the sighting from a Swedish military intelligence source. Alerted by this report, British Admiralty requested air reconnaissance of the Norwegian coast. A Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft found and photographed the German task force in the Grimstad fjord (...) , near Bergen, at 13:15 on 21 May. On the evening of 23 May at 19:22, the German force was detected by the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] that had been patrolling the Denmark Strait in the expectation of a German breakout. The alarm was sounded and Lindemann announced at 20:30 over the intercom: [...] "". (Enemy sighted to port. Engage!) Bismarck fired five salvos without scoring a direct hit. The heavily outgunned British cruisers retired to a safe distance and shadowed the enemy until their own heavy units could draw closer. However, Bismarcks forward radar had failed {{as a result of}} vibration from the heavy guns firing during this skirmish, and Lütjens was obliged to order Prinz Eugen to move ahead of Bismarck in order to provide the squadron with forward radar coverage.|$|E

The dog will only bark while the moose is stationary, {{but it can also}} slowly drive the moose towards shooters lying in wait. The Norwegian Elkhound is also used on a leash.

On 30 May 2009, the Sounders drew their fifth match in a row, this time against the Columbus Crew, after Ljungberg missed a penalty kick in the 31st minute. Ljungberg scored his second goal for the season against the San Jose Earthquakes on 13 June 2009 {{as a result of}} beating Joe Cannon to the ball, lofting it over him and {{into the center of the}} net. In the 59th minute, Ljungberg's corner kick set up Fredy Montero's goal which led the Sounders to a 2–0 victory. After playing DC United, Ljungberg suffered from some hamstring tightness. Ljungberg did suit up for the New York Red Bull game on 20 June 2009, but he did not play as a result of the injury.
