This work aims to highlight the wear resistance of the harrows discs manufactured, consolidated and sharpened differently. The tests were conducted in the laboratory and the field of the Faculty of Exploitation and Repair of Agricultural Machinery of the State Technical University of Kirovograd (Ukraine) in 2015. The technical equipment consists of devices for consolidation by electric discharge and for measurement the linear wear of discs, a harrow, a sand test bed, a tractor and discs made of different materials and technologies.

The Laboratory tests have shown that after twenty (20) ha of operation, the wear resistance of the experimental discs made of steel 65 G and consolidated by electric discharge with simultaneous grinding (sharpening angle of 30 °) is 2. 95 times higher than the discs in series made of steel 28 MnB 5.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is {{important}} that a surgical list is planned to utilise {{as much of the}} scheduled time as possible while not over-running, because this can lead to cancellation of operations. We wished to assess whether, theoretically, the known duration of individual operations could be used quantitatively to predict the likely <b>duration</b> of the <b>operating</b> list. METHODS: In a university hospital setting, we first assessed {{the extent to which the}} current ad-hoc method of operating list planning was able to match the scheduled operating list times for 153 consecutive historical lists. Using receiver operating curve analysis, we assessed the ability of an alternative method to predict <b>operating</b> list <b>duration</b> for the same operating lists. This method uses a simple formula: the sum of individual operation times and a pooled standard deviation of these times. We used the <b>operating</b> list <b>duration</b> estimated from this formula to generate a probability that the operating list would finish within its scheduled time. Finally, we applied the simple formula prospectively to 150 operating lists, 'shadowing' the current ad-hoc method, to confirm the predictive ability of the formula. RESULTS: The ad-hoc method was very poor at planning: 50 % of historical operating lists were under-booked and 37 % over-booked. In contrast, the simple formula predicted the correct outcome (under-run or over-run) for 76 % of these operating lists. The calculated probability that a planned series of operations will over-run or under-run was found useful in developing an algorithm to adjust the planned cases optimally. In the prospective series, 65 % of operating lists were over-booked and 10 % were under-booked. The formula predicted the correct outcome for 84 % of operating lists. CONCLUSION: A simple quantitative method of estimating <b>operating</b> list <b>duration</b> for a series of operations leads to an algorithm (readily created on an Excel spreadsheet, [URL] that can potentially improve operating list planning...|$|R

Carbon savings (relative to a base-case energy system) and prime mover lifetime drivers (thermal cycling and <b>operating</b> <b>duration)</b> were quantified. Novel performance metrics were defined, including Potential Thermal Supply Demand Ratio, and Effective Carbon Intensity of μCHP-Generated Electricity. Significant relative carbon savings were found for design variants with a PTSDR between 0. 1 - 1. 5, suggesting that it is a design selection parameter for thermal supply/demand matching. Alternative μCHP operating regimes, restricted seasonal operation, changing thermal demand, fuel and electricity grid carbon intensities, and energy storage (using batteries and hydrogen) were studied. It was found that annual relative carbon savings in excess of 23 % were achievable for appropriately-sized design variants, with relatively high electrical efficiency, once a complex control strategy is applied. The control strategy also reduces thermal cycling for the μCHP design variant (versus the Thermal Load Following operating regime), hence increasing prime mover lifetime.

In the processing system mentioned, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, initially the acid catalyst for the exhaustive hydrolysis of β-nonylphenolpolyethyleneoxy (n[*]=[*] 3 - 20) propionitriles, becomes together with the nonionic soap formed the second surface-active component of the binary system. Results In the reaction scheme adopted {{the influence of the}} main <b>operating</b> (<b>duration,</b> temperature, molar ratio of reagents) and structural parameters (degree of oligomerization of the polyoxyethylene chain) on the processing yields for the synthetic steps was followed. The favorable role of the polyoxyethylene chain size is remarked, through its specific conformation and its alkaline cations sequestration competences on the yields of cyanoethylation, but also the beneficial influence of phase-transfer catalysts in the total acid hydrolysis step. The chemical stability of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSH) at the temperature and strongly acidic pH of the reaction environment is confirmed.

Four tests were conducted during the 2011 harvest season using rice with initial moisture contents ranging from 19. 0 % to 21. 7 % wet basis and three tests were conducted during the 2012 harvest using rice with initial moisture contents from 15. 4 % to 18. 3 %. To obtain thermal energy requirements in terms of energy per unit mass water removed, the energy consumed by the burner was divided by the total amount of water removed. In addition, electrical energy requirements were determined by multiplying the average power draw of the fan motor by the fan <b>operating</b> <b>duration.</b> Thermal energy efficiency was calculated by dividing theoretical energy requirements by the measured thermal energy requirements.

Batch experiments were applied to investigate the metabolic characteristics of Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP 3 - 5 under various conditions during photobioreactor operation. The results indicate that a higher temperature (35 degrees C) improved poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) content and hydrogen accumulation. Maximal hydrogen accumulation and reduced PHB synthesis occurred at lower temperature (25 degrees C) at an initial pH of 6. 8 [...] Glutamate and peptone were more suitable nitrogen sources for hydrogen production than glutamine and NH(4) Cl. Photohydrogen production results, using various anaerobic fermentation effluents with a dilution ratio of 0. 4 X, illustrated that an increased photohydrogen production rate (HPR) could be obtained using an anaerobic fermentation influent with an initial C/N ratio of 4. The result obtained when an anaerobic hydrogen fermentation reactor was connected to the serial photobioreactor showed that when the anaerobic hydrogen fermentation reactor outlet dilution increased from 2. 5 - to 5 -fold, HPR increased.
