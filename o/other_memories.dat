5|$|In 2092, {{humanity}} has conquered mortality {{through the}} endless renewal of cells. The world watches in fascination as the 118-year-old Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth, edges towards death. Curious {{to know of}} life before quasi-immortality, they interview Nemo. Dr. Feldheim, a psychiatrist, uses hypnosis to help Nemo recall some of his memories, while Nemo relates <b>other</b> <b>memories</b> to a journalist. As he is prodded, Nemo makes contradictory statements. He recounts his life at three primary points: at age 9, when his parents divorced, at age 15 when he fell in love, and at age 34 as an adult. All three unfold into their many possible outcomes.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Nichols {{published}} her autobiography Beyond Uhura: Star Trek and <b>Other</b> <b>Memories.</b> In it, {{she claimed}} {{that the role of}} Peggy Fair in the television show Mannix was offered to her during the final season of Star Trek, but producer Gene Roddenberry refused to release her from her contract. Between the end of the original series and the Star Trek animated series and feature films, Nichols appeared in small television and film roles. She briefly appeared as a secretary in Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding! (1967), and portrayed a foul-mouthed madam in Truck Turner (1974) opposite Isaac Hayes, her only appearance in a blaxploitation film.|$|E
25|$|In the 2016 {{video game}} , the {{character}} Sorin Sprocket is eventually revealed to have anterograde amnesia, which he developed after unintentionally causing {{a car accident}} which killed his sister. This causes his memories to completely reset every time he wakes up from sleeping, {{to the day after}} this accident. This depiction is notable for demonstrating the relationship issues that arise between Sorin and his fiancee, Ellen Wyatt, {{as a result of this}} disorder, most noticeably with how Sorin's feelings towards her to coming across as distant and cold. As the storyline continues, however, the player comes to uncover that Sorin in fact deeply loves his fiancee, and is able to maintain this love despite his disorder, but in fact feels a sense of guilt over the fact that he has to constantly remind himself of the fact that this love exists inside of him every day, due to his disorder. It is also noticeable in that it depicts how Sorin deals with his disorder, by keeping a journal where he writes down every minuet detail of every day after his sister's death. He carries this journal around everywhere he goes as a substitution to his memories, and uses what is written in the notebook to become aware each time he wakes up of the fact that he he his condition, what the current date apparently is, and everything important that have apparently occurred on every day since he first developed the condition. The episode also deals with legal issues concerning the disorder, when it is debated during Ellen Wyatt's trial as to whether Sorin's journal can be considered a proper substitution to his memories for the sake of viable witness testimony. Danger's imposed by this also come into play when it is revealed that a page in Sorin's journal had been altered by someone, which causes him to go into mental collapse that any of his <b>other</b> <b>memories</b> and thoughts could also have arisen from someone else's manipulation.|$|E
40|$|According to some current theories, {{the focus}} of {{attention}} (FOA), part of working memory, represents items in a privileged state that is more accessible than items stored in <b>other</b> <b>memory</b> systems. One line of evidence supporting the distinction between the FOA and <b>other</b> <b>memory</b> systems is the finding that items in the FOA are immune to proactive interference (when something learned earlier impairs the ability to remember something learned more recently). The FOA, then, is held to be unique: it is the only memory system that is not susceptible to proactive interference. We review the literature used to support this claim, and although there are many studies in which proactive interference was not observed, we found more studies in which it was observed. We conclude that the FOA is not immune to proactive interference: items in the FOA are susceptible to proactive interference just like items in every <b>other</b> <b>memory</b> system. And, just as in all <b>other</b> <b>memory</b> systems, it is how the items are represented and processed that plays a critical role in determining whether proactive interference will be observed...|$|R

However, semantic associations have the reverse effect in picture memories appear to be reversed to those in <b>other</b> <b>memories.</b> When logical details are stressed, rather than physical details, an image's recall value becomes lower. [...] When comparing orthographic (capitalization, letter and word shape), phonological (word sound) and semantic (word meaning) encoding cues, the highest levels of recall were found with the meanings of the words, followed by their sounds and finally the written and shape-based cues were found to generate the least ability to stimulate recall.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her role}} as Lieutenant Uhura, Nichols famously kissed white actor William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk in the November 22, 1968, Star Trek episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren". The episode is popularly cited as the first example of an interracial kiss on U.S. television. [...] The Shatner/Nichols kiss was seen as groundbreaking, {{even though it was}} portrayed as having been forced by alien telekinesis. There was some praise and some protest. On page 197 of her 1994 {{autobiography}} Beyond Uhura, Star Trek and <b>Other</b> <b>Memories,</b> Nichols cites a letter from a white Southerner who wrote, [...] "I am totally opposed to the mixing of the races. However, any time a red-blooded American boy like Captain Kirk gets a beautiful dame in his arms that looks like Uhura, he ain't gonna fight it." [...] During the Comedy Central Roast of Shatner on August 20, 2006, Nichols jokingly referred to the kiss and said, [...] "Let's make TV history again—and you can kiss my black ass!" ...|$|E
