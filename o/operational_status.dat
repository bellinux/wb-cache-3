5|$|Courbet and Paris {{formed a}} Fifth Squadron at the {{beginning}} of the war. They were transferred to the Atlantic to continue their training duties without interference. Both ships were ordered restored to <b>operational</b> <b>status</b> on 21 May 1940 by Amiral Mord and their light anti-aircraft outfits were augmented at Cherbourg. Courbet was ordered to provide gunfire support to the defenders of Cherbourg against the advancing 7th Panzer Division and covered the evacuation of the town by the Allies while Paris supported the defenders of Le Havre. Lack of spotting aircraft meant that neither ship was particularly effective in that role.|$|E
5|$|Disappointed by {{the failure}} to sink {{merchant}} ships in that battle, Adolf Hitler ordered {{the majority of the}} surface warships scrapped, though Admiral Karl Dönitz was able to convince Hitler to retain the surface fleet. As a result, Admiral Hipper was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs. The ship was never restored to <b>operational</b> <b>status,</b> however, and on 3 May 1945, Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged her while she was in Kiel. Her crew scuttled the ship at her moorings, and in July 1945, she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay.

30|$|The local CMS {{consists}} of three parts: the local controllers, the I/O stations, and the local monitoring system of supplier. The local controllers are used to receive commands from the coordination controller and, thus, to achieve regional-level (380  V voltage level) coordination control; the I/O stations convert the protocol of the converter interface, collects data and sends control commands. The local controllers monitors the BESS in real-time by using the VxWorks embedded operating system. Additionally, at the local CMS layer, the PCS, battery and distribution-system <b>operational</b> <b>statuses</b> are monitored in real-time, and the upper-layer control instructions are promptly send to each control PCS unit. Overall, this hierarchical control system effectively guarantees the control precision and stability of the storage system.|$|R

5|$|Temporary repairs began immediately, {{but due to}} {{the limited}} drydock space in the port, repairs to the hull were not {{effected}} until 11 September. Dunkerque was refloated on 27 September and her propulsion system was returned to <b>operational</b> <b>status.</b> A major fire broke out on 5 December, however, which slowed down the repair effort. Repair work lasted for the entirety of 1941, and on 25 January 1942 another fire broke out. The temporary repairs were completed by 19 February, which permitted the ship to depart Mers-el-Kébir, under heavy escort, bound for Toulon. She arrived the following day, and entered the large Vauban drydock for comprehensive repairs.|$|E

With 1 Squadron and 2 Squadron of the Canadian Air Force established at Upper Heyford in Britain during August 1918 and the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service, established for home defence in September 1918, Canadian units had only reached <b>operational</b> <b>status</b> by the end of hostilities and never saw combat.|$|E
40|$|Achieving space domain {{awareness}} {{requires the}} identification, characterization, and tracking of space objects. Storing and leveraging associated space object data for purposes such as hostile threat assessment, object identification, and collision prediction and avoidance present further challenges. Space objects are characterized {{according to a}} variety of parameters including their identifiers, design specifications, components, subsystems, capabilities, vulnerabilities, origins, missions, orbital elements, patterns of life, processes, <b>operational</b> <b>statuses,</b> and associated persons, organizations, or nations. The Space Object Ontology provides a consensus-based realist framework for formulating such characterizations in a computable fashion. Space object data are aligned with classes and relations in the Space Object Ontology and stored in a dynamically updated Resource Description Framework triple store, which can be queried to support space domain awareness and the needs of spacecraft operators. This paper presents the core of the Space Object Ontology, discusses its advantages over other approaches to space object classification, and demonstrates its ability to combine diverse sets of data from multiple sources within an expandable framework. Finally, we show how the ontology provides benefits for enhancing and maintaining longterm space domain awareness...|$|R

5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she could be used in the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach <b>operational</b> <b>status.</b> As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} of the {{roundabout}}s to reach <b>operational</b> <b>status</b> were those at Point Pleasant Road and Durand Boulevard. The Point Pleasant Road roundabout opened to traffic on September8, 2009, by which time the Durand Boulevard roundabout was also ready for use. The Titus Avenue roundabout was completed in late 2009, while work on the Seneca Road junction was delayed until October 2009 due to {{the proximity of the}} intersection {{to the side of the}} hill overlooking Irondequoit Bay. Although the original plans for the project had already accounted for the issue, the plans had to be revised to comply with new federal standards regarding the use of steel pilings for supporting the hillside. Work on the roundabout finally began on October12. The Seneca Road roundabout and the new alignment of Sea Breeze Drive north of Durand Boulevard were completed in the first half of 2010.|$|E
5|$|No.86 Squadron {{departed}} Merauke on 25April 1944; {{the squadron}} was subsequently {{reduced to a}} cadre and its Kittyhawks transferred to Nos.78 and 81 Wings of No.10 Operational Group on Noemfoor Island. It {{was replaced by the}} Dutch-Australian No.120 Squadron, which arrived from Canberra in early May and became operational on the 9th of the month. The same month, Walters handed over command of the wing to Group Captain Bill Hely. In July, No.12 Squadron was withdrawn to Strathpine, Queensland, where it was reduced to cadre status ahead of converting to B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and eventually serving with another new formation, No.85 Wing. Hely departed in September 1944 to establish an army cooperation formation, No.84 Wing, at Cairns. Most of the RAAF units at Merauke were redeployed in late 1944 but No.120 Squadron remained there until February 1945, when it was declared non-operational. The squadron returned to <b>operational</b> <b>status</b> and departed for eventual service at Biak in April that year. No.72 Wing headquarters returned to Townsville in May 1945, disbanding on 20June.|$|E

5|$|She {{arrived at}} Sydney on 24 August, {{and had her}} hangars {{refitted}} to accommodate Allied PoWs and soldiers for repatriation. Having left her air group behind to maximize the numbers of passengers she could carry, the ship arrived at Manila on 25 September, where she loaded over 2,000 American and Canadian PoWs. She dropped off the Americans at Pearl Harbor on 5 October and continued on to deliver her Canadian passengers at Vancouver six days later. Opened for public tours, Implacable remained for a week before sailing to Hong Kong to pick up several hundred PoWs and continued onwards to Manila to load 2,114 more passengers. She delivered them to Balikpapan, Borneo for transhipment to Britain. In their place the carrier embarked 2,126 men of the 7th Australian Division, and their equipment, to return to Australia. She arrived at Sydney on 17 November and sailed on 8 December to load more returning troops from Papua New Guinea.

5|$|Though {{several new}} fixed wing {{aircraft}} and helicopters were inducted into the navy in the early 2000s, they {{were assigned to the}} existing squadrons with no new squadrons being commissioned until 2006. In January of that year, INAS 342, the first squadron to be equipped with UAVs, was commissioned. Later that year, the Sea Harrier training assigned to INAS 551 were detached and commissioned separately as INAS 552. However, the Sea Harriers were phased out in May 2016, and presently the <b>operational</b> <b>status</b> of the squadron is unknown. On 24 March 2009, for the first time, two squadrons—INAS 311 and INAS 350—were commissioned on the same day. INAS 311 is intended for maritime patrol and operates Do-228s, whereas INAS 350, a multirole helicopter squadron, operates Sikorsky SH-3s. In 2011–2012, another two UAV squadrons—INAS 343 and INAS 344—were commissioned. In 2013, a fighter plane and a multirole helicopter squadron—INAS 303 and INAS 322—were commissioned with MiG-29Ks and HAL Dhruvs. INAS 322 commissioned on 12 November 2013, equipped with the indigenously developed Dhruv helicopters, and is youngest Indian naval air squadron.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the two bridge raids took place on 10 August 1941. For this mission, the I-16s were fitted with {{additional}} 95-liter (25 US gal) underwing fuel tanks for an additional 35 minutes of flight time. Of the three Zveno-SPBs, one had to turn back due to mechanical problems. The other two launched their fighters 15km (8 NM, 9mi) from the Romanian coastline. The fighters successfully dive-bombed from the altitude of 1800 m (5,900ft) and returned home with no losses despite heavy anti-aircraft fire. The second raid took place on 13 August 1941. This time, all three Zveno-SPBs reached the target. The six fighters scored five direct hits on the bridge and completely destroyed one of the spans. On the way back, the fighters strafed Romanian infantry near Sulina and returned to Eupatoria with no losses. Following the successful sorties, two additional Zveno-SPB were brought to <b>operational</b> <b>status,</b> bringing the total to five. The main limiting factor {{was the lack of}} high-output Mikulin AM-34FRN engines, as the other versions were not powerful enough to get the aircraft airborne. On 16 August 1941, Admiral Kuznetsov asked Joseph Stalin for additional AM-34FRN-engined TB-3s from the Air Force so they could be converted to Zveno-SPB carriers, but the request was denied as the Air Force had suffered heavy losses in the opening days of the war. In the meantime, the five aircraft continued flying operational sorties, destroying a dry dock in Constanţa on 17 August and a bridge across the Dnieper River on 28 August, losing one I-16 in the process. During the repeat attack the next day, four Zveno-launched I-16s engaged several Messerschmitt Bf 109s, shooting down two. Despite the high success rate, Zveno missions ended by 1942 due to high vulnerability of the obsolete TB-3s and I-16s in the face of enemy air superiority. It is estimated that Zveno-SPB flew at least 30 combat missions.|$|E
