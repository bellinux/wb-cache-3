25|$|It is {{in those}} two {{functions}} that the real life of the ego is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are {{the sense of being}} one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.|$|E
2500|$|For process {{oriented}} psychology, {{the concept}} of 'deep democracy' refers to a 'belief in the inherent importance of all parts <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> all viewpoints {{in the world around}} us'. It aims to broaden the idea of democracy to include not only cognitive, rational viewpoints but also emotional experiences and intuition: 'Deep democracy awareness welcomes inner voices and makes use of diversity and existing tensions to access subjective experience, deeper vision and tangible results of the participants.' Similarly, the author John Bradshaw explains: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} {{part of the}} [...] "Ethics", his concern with the meaning of [...] "true blessedness", and his {{explanation}} of how emotions must be detached from external causes in order to master them, foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s. His concept of three types of knowledge—opinion, reason, intuition—and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal.|$|E

2500|$|The goal of Integral yoga is {{to become}} aware of the Divine, to {{integrate}} the physical, mental and spiritual aspects <b>of</b> <b>ourselves,</b> <b>and</b> to manifest the Divine at earth. According to Sri Aurobindo, all life is Yoga, while Yoga as a sadhana is a methodised effort towards self-perfection, which brings to expression the latent, hidden potentialities of being. Success in this effort unifies the human individual with the universal and transcendental Existence. Integral yoga reunites [...] "the infinite in the finite, the timeless in the temporal and the transcendent with the immanent.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Being-with" [...] {{refers to}} an ontological {{characteristic}} of the human being, that it is always already with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, {{that he or she}} is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. [...] Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) [...] "ultrasocial" [...] and [...] "obligatorily gregarious." [...] Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life [...] "Being-with" [...] (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human. We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and in what ways how we think <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.|$|E
