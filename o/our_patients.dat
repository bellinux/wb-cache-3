25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} in another study that a maximal CIMT value of 0.956mm had 85.7% sensitivity and 85.1% specificity to predict angiographic CAD. The study group consisted of patients admitted to the cardiology outpatient clinic with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. The study showed CIMT was higher in patients with significant CAD than in patients with non-critical coronary lesions. Regression analysis revealed that thickening of the mean intima-media complex more than 1.0 was predictive of significant CAD <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> There was incremental significant increase in CIMT with the number coronary vessel involved. In accordance with the literature, it was found that CIMT was significantly higher in the presence of CAD. Furthermore, CIMT was increased as the number of involved vessels increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement. However, human clinical trials have been slow to provide clinical & medical evidence, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using carotid intima-media thickness scanning (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography), B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, homocysteine and that reduce neck carotid artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} report we {{describe}} {{a patient with}} multiple myeloma and long-standing paraproteinemia who developed xanthoma {{in the absence of}} an elevation in plasma cholesterol or triglyceride concentrations. Studies demonstrated that <b>our</b> <b>patient's</b> monoclonal IgG antibody interacted with apoprotein B- 100. The LDL-antibody complex isolated from <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> did not affect the degradation of LDL by human fibroblasts, indicating that while IgG derived from <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> interacted with LDL it did not alter the metabolism of this lipoprotein by the LDL receptor pathway. Since the LDL receptor pathway is the major route of LDL metabolism, this probably explains why <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> was not hyperlipidemic. In contrast to an absence of effect on the LDL receptor, <b>our</b> <b>patient's</b> LDL-antibody complex stimulated cholesterol esterification within macrophages indicating the uptake and degradation of the LDL-antibody complex. The LDL-antibody complex inhibited the degradation of acetyl LDL by macrophages (scavenger pathway), demonstrating that <b>our</b> <b>patient's</b> LDL-antibody complex was recognized as a modified LDL. Moreover, mixing Ig from <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> with normal LDL also resulted in the normal LDL increasing the esterification of cholesterol by macrophages. One can hypothesize that <b>our</b> <b>patient's</b> monoclonal IgG-LDL complex interacted with the macrophage scavenger receptor, thereby resulting in the occurrence of xanthoma in the absence of hyperlipidemia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction An 82 -year-old Caucasian {{woman had}} {{remained}} in a {{persistent vegetative state}} after a coma of seven months duration, which occurred after a stroke with hemiplegia, nine years previously. The persistent vegetative state could be reversed in part by weekly injections with activated immune cells. After therapy, <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> responded to commands in addition to regaining spontaneous movements of both arms {{and the ability to}} swallow. This is the first report on the treatment with activated immune cells of a patient in a persistent vegetative state after a coma. Case presentation An 82 -year-old Caucasian woman presented with a persistent vegetative state subsequent to a coma. She retained respiratory and autonomic functions. As contact was not possible, physiotherapy was passive. Her skin was yellowish, and <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> did not move by herself. Vomiting repeatedly resulted from tube feeding. After a once-weekly treatment with activated immune cells sampled from <b>our</b> <b>patient's</b> blood and activated in vitro, several of her functions gradually returned. <b>Our</b> <b>patient</b> opened her eyes in the requested direction and turned her head toward people entering the room. She 'supported' nursing efforts, as the nurse noted a loss of spastic motions. The strength in both her arms returned, and she spontaneously moved her arm on the side experiencing hemiplegia. After three months, <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> could stick out her tongue upon demand. Finally, the swallow reflexes of <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> started to return. However, tube feeding was continued, and <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> died after aspiration of vomit following a feeding. Conclusion The success of treatment with autologous activated immune cells in this patient may have resulted from the production of neuroactive substances, such as neurotrophin- 3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, by activated immune cells. The deterioration of <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> could be reversed, as demonstrated by the restoration of motor strength in her hemiplegic side. In addition, <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> was able to induce motor responses upon request. It seems reasonable to conclude that activated immune cells may improve the chronic vegetative state in some patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 15 -year-old woman with signs of hyperandrogenism {{affected}} by a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SLCT). In <b>our</b> <b>patient,</b> blood analysis showed a high testosterone (T) level (T: 8. 53 nmol/L; nv< 1. 87 nmol/L) while the GnRH-Analogue test demonstrated an exaggerated secretion of 17 -hydroxyprogesterone (OHP), T, and androstenedione (A) by the ovary after stimulation. We compared the GnRH-Analogue test of <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> with that obtained in a group of normal and healthy women (no. 8 subjects, 16 - 26 years old), men (no. 4 subjects, 18 - 28 years old), and in a group of PCOS patients with age and body weight compared.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Endometriosis is a {{clinical}} entity which presents with functioning endometrial tissue at sites outside the uterus. Bowel endometriosis is usually asymptomatic, {{but it may}} show non-specific symptoms. The presence and/or association of appendiceal endometriosis, concomitant with rectal endometriosis, is possible. Case presentation A 36 -year-old Greek woman {{was admitted to the}} emergency room of our hospital with signs of acute abdomen. On physical examination, <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> had a painful distended abdomen. Digital examination revealed an empty rectum and bowel obstruction was diagnosed. <b>Our</b> <b>patient</b> underwent exploratory laparotomy and rectum stenosis (almost complete obstruction) was observed. The bowel stenosis was resected, and temporary colostomy and appendectomy were performed. The pathology report showed endometriosis of the colon and the appendix, and <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> received medical treatment for endometriosis. Six months after this operation <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> had another surgery for restoration of large bowel continuity. No endometriosis was found. <b>Our</b> <b>patient</b> was doing well at the one-year follow up. Conclusion Endometriosis of the bowel is a disease that may cause large bowel obstruction. In women of reproductive age, the surgeon should consider endometriosis as a differential diagnosis in case of various gastrointestinal symptoms. </p...|$|R
