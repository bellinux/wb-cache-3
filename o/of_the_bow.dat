5|$|Bow Street has {{a strong}} {{connection}} with the law; the Bow Street Runners, an early voluntary police force, was established here by Henry Fielding in 1750, and the Metropolitan Police Service operated a station house from 1832, {{which led to the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> Street Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|By Day 20 {{the forward}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> was in {{position}} and the hull plating was well underway. By Day 55 all of the upper deck beams were in place and by Day 83 the upper deck plates were in position. By Day 125 (4 February) the hull was finished.|$|E
50|$|Blount's {{disease may}} {{come back after}} surgery, {{especially}} in younger children. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowing,</b> a leg-length discrepancy may result. This may result in disability if the discrepancy is significant (greater than 1 inch) and is not treated.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{augmented}} violin developed at IRCAM. This instrument is an acoustic violin with added sensing capabilities to measure <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> acceleration in realtime. We explain first the approach we developed to characterize bowing styles. Second, we describe <b>the</b> realtime implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowing</b> style recognition system.

5|$|Later {{developments}} in the composite bow included siyahs made of separate pieces of wood, attached with a V-splice to the wooden core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> rather than strengthened by external reinforcement. Mediaeval and modern bows generally have integral wooden siyahs and lack stiffening laths.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> Street Runners were {{destroyed}} in the Gordon Riots of 1780, when the magistrates' court became a target. Records of arrest history and convictions were burned to expunge the rioters' criminal records.|$|E
40|$|Chemical bonding and {{electronic}} properties of III-nitrides solid solutions are studied using a model empirical pseudopotential method in modified virtual crystal approximation {{taking into account}} positional and compositional disorder. The changes in chemical bonding are analyzed in different ionicity models. <b>The</b> <b>bowing</b> is mainly caused by compositional disorder, volume deformation effects and valence charge redistribution in the alloys. The connection between <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowing</b> and basic parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials is found...|$|R
25|$|Greater {{changes in}} {{attitude}} toward the river were manifest in <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> River Water Quality Council's reports over time.

50|$|Ever {{since the}} {{publication}} in 1905 of Albert Schweitzer's book about J. S. Bach, <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curved <b>bow</b> {{has been widely}} debated. For Schweitzer, however, use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curved <b>bow</b> was essential in performing Bach’s string works. Asked to write something for the Bach year in 1950 (Bach-Gedenkschrift), forty-five years after his original study, Schweitzer still focused on his ideas about <b>the</b> curved <b>bow.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{thin layer}} of horn is glued onto {{what will be the}} belly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> the side facing the archer. Water buffalo horn is very suitable, as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle. Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are not suitable, as they soon {{delaminate}} with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} {{manufacture}} {{varied between the}} various cultures that used them. Initially {{the tips of the}} limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as siyahs, which are made {{as an integral part of}} the wooden core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first steel {{cut for the}} project, in July 2009, signalled {{the start}} of {{construction}} of Lower Block 3 at BAE Systems Clyde, where production of Lower Block 4 started in January 2010.

5|$|The sinew, {{soaked in}} animal glue, is then laid in layers {{on the back}} of the bow; the strands of sinew are {{oriented}} along the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E
5|$|There is {{insufficient}} historical {{evidence to support}} the claim he knew any skills beyond archery. Contemporary records never once mention Zhou teaching Yue boxing. Despite this, various wuxia novels and folk legends have attributed many different military and supernatural skills to Zhou. These range from mastery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> double swords and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard qigong, Chuojiao boxing and even X-ray vision. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing.|$|E
40|$|We present {{theoretical}} and experimental results for <b>the</b> band gap <b>of</b> In xGa 1 −xN alloys, showing significantly larger bowing {{than has been}} commonly assumed. We highlight <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> properly including strain in the experimental analysis. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry the layers in our study were determined to be pseudomorphically strained. The In content determined by XRD depends strongly on the assumptions made about the strain in the InGaN layers. Strain also affects the band structure and hence the transition energies measured by optical-transmission spectroscopy. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental results produces a bowing parameter b� 3. 8 eV at x= 0. 1. First-principles calculations, based on pseudopotential–density–functional theory, produce values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowing</b> parameter {{in agreement with the}} experimental determination, and also indicate a strong dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowing</b> parameter on composition. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.

50|$|A string {{orchestra}} is {{an orchestra}} consisting solely {{of a string}} section made up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowed</b> strings used in Western Classical music. <b>The</b> instruments <b>of</b> such an orchestra are most often the following: the violin, which is divided into first and second violin players (each playing different parts), the viola, the cello, and the double bass.|$|R
2500|$|A {{reviewer}} of {{her music}} noted that [...] "no modern tin whistler can escape comparison to Mary Bergin, and Carmel's playing does indeed remind some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dublin-born star.

Her ornamentation is also more diverse, featuring many tongued triplets in imitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowed</b> embellishments popular among Sligo fiddlers".|$|R
5|$|While these {{guns were}} {{considered}} an improvement by the Navy over {{that of the}} South Carolinas, their placement remained problematic as even in calm water, they were extremely wet and thus difficult to man. The forward guns were moved into the superstructure after sea trials. The casemate-mounted secondary armament was one deck below the main deck and provided {{the majority of the}} complaints from shipping water from the forward positions and breaking the flow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> wave imparting extra drag on the design.|$|E
5|$|A new bow type, {{in which}} bone {{reinforcements}} cover the handle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> {{as well as}} the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal. Fittings from this type of bow appear right across Asia from Korea to the Crimea. Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, {{at the mouth of the}} Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{underneath}} the State Apartments is {{a suite of}} slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the 1844 Room, decorated in that year for the State visit of Tsar NicholasI of Russia, and, {{on the other side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> Room, the 1855 Room, in honour of the visit of Emperor NapoleonIII of France. At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's Garden Parties in the Gardens. The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing.|$|E
2500|$|Park advocates defined <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> River within Calgary as the city's nature: it was {{something}} to be protected for and enjoyed by the public. However, as progress was made in the parks' creation, this [...] "environmental" [...] view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bow's</b> nature proved selective. For example, trees were not to be cut down, but landscaping to accommodate cyclists was endorsed. In short, the river was valued above all when it suited human goals. Calgary eventually developed an extensive plan for <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> River's park system, and it is considered an important element of Calgary's self-image today.|$|R

5|$|During {{the night}} of 29 March 1945, Kommandøren was docked at the remains of Søndre Nykirkekai in Bergen. At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat {{anchored}} {{on the opposite side}} of Vågen bay. The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandøren over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only the mast and a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> remained above water. The midship and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on board at the time, Able Seaman Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to {{systematic}} predator control hunting {{which began in}} 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve {{the balance of the}} ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project – the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60–70 animals.|$|E
5|$|Many {{artefacts}} {{are displayed}} at the Mutsu Memorial Museum in Tōwa-chō. This is a successor to a local museum funded by the town of Suō-Ōshima which opened in July 1970.
