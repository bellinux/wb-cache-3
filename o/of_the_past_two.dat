5|$|The Tour de France was {{the main}} {{focal point of the}} season for BMC's leader Evans, and perhaps the team itself. He had ridden two Grand Tours each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> seasons, and in three of the past four, but in 2011 he focused solely on the Tour. He rode a {{different}} race program in preparation for the Tour than he had in previous years, riding fewer races. Among them were the early-season stage races Tirreno–Adriatico and Tour de Romandie, both of which Evans won, and the Critérium du Dauphiné, where he finished on the podium in second overall. The squad named to the race was chosen with the sole goal of helping Evans win the race overall. It consisted of classics specialists Hincapie and Burghardt with the aim of keeping Evans out of trouble in the flatter stages, climbers Moinard and Morabito to help in the mountains, and strong time trialists Bookwalter and Schär (and Hincapie) for the stage 2 team time trial. Hincapie made his 16th consecutive Tour start, to tie the record held by Joop Zoetemelk, having finished each except the very first.|$|E

Hundley returned from an arm injury the prior week to complete 18 of 23 passes for 355 yards and four touchdowns, and Adams scored two touchdowns with a 95-yard interception return and a 100-yard kickoff return. The game was a matchup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> Pac-12 South champions.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> centuries. Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships. Since there was limited response to this tactic of the British, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.|$|E
25|$|HTC-Highroad's squad for the Tour de France was {{centered}} around Cavendish, {{back again to}} try to win the points classification green jersey after finishing second in those standings each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> years. Eisel, Renshaw, Bak, and Pate were named as leadout men, with Goss also present to perhaps try for the sprints that may be too difficult for Cavendish. Peter Velits and Tony Martin were named as possible general classification hopefuls, though Martin's true strength was the individual time trial, to be raced on the identical course to the one he won on earlier in the season at the Critérium du Dauphiné. Tour de France debutant van Garderen rounded out the squad.|$|E

25|$|Gino Bartali, {{the winner}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> editions, was {{ordered by the}} Italian {{government}} to race the Tour de France instead of the Giro in 1938. Giovanni Valetti took {{the lead of the}} 1938 Giro d'Italia after the mountainous ninth stage. Valetti had a lead of {{a minute and a half}} after that stage and built upon that as the Giro went on, finishing almost nine minutes ahead of the second place rider Ezio Cecchi. The 1939 Giro d'Italia was a battle between Gino Bartali and Giovanni Valetti. Valetti took the lead after the stage 9b individual time trial. Bartali became the leader after he had attacked on the Passo Rolle during the fifteenth stage. Bartali lost the lead to Valetti because he crashed and had several flat tires throughout the sixteenth stage. Valetti won his second consecutive Giro d'Italia, while Bartali left the Giro with his fourth mountains classification title.|$|E

The novel won three major science fiction awards (the Nebula Award, the Philip K.
