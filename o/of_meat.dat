5|$|The success <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> ants {{depends on}} what {{resource}} they are dealing with. In one study, the removal <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> ants allowed the successful foraging of Iridomyrmex ants at carbohydrate sources, but not for protein baits. The success of the ants also did not increase with mealworm baits, suggesting that competition does not always occur between meat ants and other species, and factors, such as food preference, may be involved. In contrast with camponotines and some myrmicines, both of their success was affected at numerous food sources with meat ants present. Camponotines exhibit no aggression and cannot defend themselves.|$|E

5|$|Some mammals are omnivores {{and display}} {{varying degrees of}} carnivory and herbivory, {{generally}} leaning in favor of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50-70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater <b>of</b> <b>meat),</b> and hypocarnivory (50% or less <b>of</b> <b>meat).</b> The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, {{and in some cases}} strong jaws for bone-crushing, {{as in the case of}} hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.|$|E

5|$|The {{marriage}} {{tradition of}} the vodiondry, still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, {{is said to have}} originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondrymeat from the hindquarters of a sheepwhich he believed to be the tastiest portion. The value placed on this cut <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due. From the time of Andriamanelo forward, it became a marriage tradition for the groom to offer vodiondry to the bride's family. Over time the customary offerings <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic piastre, sums of money and other gifts.|$|E
