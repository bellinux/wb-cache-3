5|$|Nighthawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. Each train has six cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 24 riders. Riders are restrained by an <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> restraint and a lap bar. Riders can put on the <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> restraint but a ride operator will push down the lap bar. While in the station, the trains will recline back to the laying down position.|$|E
5|$|Raptor {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders in Ski lift like trains. Riders are secured by an <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> restraint with a locking belt. The trains were manufactured in Switzerland at Bolliger & Mabillard's headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Dæmonen {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> restraint. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,200 riders per hour. The structure of the trains are colored orange; the seats and restraints are black. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Dæmonen has no floor on its trains.|$|E

5|$|Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin {{falls in}} folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck {{folds of the}} Javan {{rhinoceros}} are smaller {{than those of the}} Indian rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.|$|E
5|$|Lappland {{itself was}} never {{considered}} a duchy, but was granted {{the right to}} use a ducal coronet, together with all the provinces, in 1884. The wildman first appears on a few coins minted at the time of Karl IX's coronation in 1607, and then at his funeral in 1612.

50|$|The team kit for the 2008-09 {{season was}} {{produced}} by Reebok who were also the shirt sponsor. Unlike previous seasons, the new kit did not debut in the final home game of the 07-08 season. The new home kit is predominantly white with a blue upper third going <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders.</b> <b>The</b> new away kit is predominantly yellow with <b>the</b> same style <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders,</b> this time green. Due to no other club playing in a kit similar to the away design, no third choice kit was needed.|$|R

5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{considered}} arboreal quadrupeds, {{with the most}} common type of movement being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical clinging, and suspensory behavior, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving from tree to tree, ruffed lemurs will look <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> while clinging, launch themselves into the air, and twist mid-air so that their ventral surface lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior is more common in ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, running with bounding hops and the tail held high.|$|E
5|$|Before marriage, women {{used to wear}} a Kirgi (sari) and Baju (blouse). The Kirgi is a {{piece of}} cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was wrapped around the body from the waist down. A jacket with long sleeves called a Baju, was used to cover {{the upper part of the}} body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the Ros ceremony. The Kirgi was wrapped around the waist, but the end of the sari is not thrown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> To wear the sari with its end thrown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> known as Worl, is the {{exclusive}} right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The Salwar kameez is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari is known as a Sado. It is usually a red-coloured Banarasi sari which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings. In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the bride went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the bride wears (in place of the Kirgi) a red sari, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder; it is wrapped around the waist. The bride wears a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the Dantoni (golden combs). Other ornaments worn by the bride in the olden days included Kanti, Chakrasar, Kap, Karap, Mugud, Kanto, and Dantoni.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Mass Effect 2 is squad-based and {{a maximum}} of two squad members may {{accompany}} the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The game uses an <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and places strong emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue commands to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E
25|$|Pelerines, tippets, or lace {{coverings}} draped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders,</b> {{were popular}} (one of several devices, along with full upper-arm sleeves and wide necklines, to emphasize <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and their width).|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip {{does not appear to}} have treated this as a {{declaration}} of war, but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem, blocking the main route into Greece. However, a second route into central Greece was available, leading <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> of Mount Callidromos and descending into Phocis. However, the Athenians and Thebans had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered. Philip's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians at the end of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and during the next few months the whole Phocian Confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the Battle of Chaeronea did not occur until August 338 BC. During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi. He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|This {{system is}} unusual in that it used a single stage single hose demand valve in a {{full-face}} mask. The high pressure supply hose routes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> but from an inverted cylinder, which allows the user to easily reach the valve.|$|E
25|$|Saris are woven {{with one}} plain end (the end that is {{concealed}} inside the wrap), two long decorative borders running {{the length of}} the sari, and a one to three-foot section at the other end which continues and elaborates the length-wise decoration. This end is called the pallu; it is the part thrown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> in the nivi style of draping.|$|E
25|$|Paths - Pathways {{should never}} be straight. They should meander like a stream. This helps deepen the {{landscape}} by adding layers. The path can be the river, or a path along it, or the tracing of the sun through the sky <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> of the mountain. The concept is to never create inorganic patterns, but instead to mimic the patterns that nature creates.|$|E

25|$|However, this {{academic}} {{dress is}} only {{used for the}} opening of the academic year and for PhD graduations or for doctorates honoris causa. It is worn only by doctors, deans and the University Rector. For other graduates, the academic dress is often composed by a mortarboard and a mozzetta (muceta) or a sash <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> (beca) with the shield of the University and/or Faculty. The colour of the mozzetta or the sash depends on the academic field.|$|E
25|$|The second {{semifinal}} {{was between}} the team of Victor Zangiev and Salman Hashimikov and the team of Mr. Saito and The Great Muta. Hashimikov applied the Boston crab on Saito. Zangiev tagged in, and Saito applied the sharpshooter. Hashimikov and The Great Muta tagged in, and Hashimikov performed a belly to belly suplex and an <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> back-to-belly piledriver. Saito and Zangiev tagged in, and Saito performed a clothesline. Saito then pinned Zangiev after a Saito suplex to win the match.|$|E

50|$|Another {{technique}} {{is to put}} a rope around the torso just above the breasts, and another one just below them, then push the ropes together to squeeze the breasts from the top and bottom. This can be done instead of, or as well as, the other method. A rope can also be passed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and between <b>the</b> breasts, drawing the rope {{above and below the}} breasts together, then pass back <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> to <b>the</b> knots at the back. The primary rope can be used to place cinches between the arms and the body.|$|R
