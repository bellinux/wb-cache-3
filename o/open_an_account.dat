25|$|After {{purchasing}} the card, the cardholder loads the account with {{any amount of}} money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases {{the same way as}} a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to <b>open</b> <b>an</b> <b>account.</b> With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.|$|E

In Switzerland, such private banks are called private bankers (a protected term) to distinguish them from the other private banks which are typically shared corporations.

Lalit Modi could have received his first 'reprimand' from Manohar way back in March 2010, but former India captain Sunil Gavaskar, then {{a member of the}} Governing Council, requested that the 'reprimand' not be recorded.
