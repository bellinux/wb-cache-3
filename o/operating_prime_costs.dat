40|$|<b>Prime</b> <b>cost</b> {{determinations}} {{can increase}} managerial effectiveness in budget allocation and strategic planning. This {{study was designed}} to calculate the <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> of clinical laboratory services in Tehran Valiasr Hospital using the activity-based costing (ABC) model. The highest costs were for human recourses (44 %) and the lowest for energy (5 %). The largest proportion of activities (97 %) was by specialists, reflecting the importance of human recourses in <b>prime</b> <b>costs.</b> The highest <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> was for urinalysis (11 % of tests) and the lowest for sodium determination (21 % of tests), which demonstrates that <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> decreases as service frequency increases. The average estimated <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> was 63 % higher than the fees established by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. The results show that the Tehran Valiasr Hospital laboratory faces a budgetary deficit. The <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> of services can be reduced by improving human recourse management and standardization of resource consumption. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} the variability levels of <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> sums in building projects {{in order to}} establish the reliability of such estimates in bills of quantities. It involved a purposive sampling of forty-six executed projects in South-western Nigeria from which data on estimated and final <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> sums as well as estimated and final contract sums were procured.

However, a negative relationship between the <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> sums and the final contract sums was established. Based on observed variations, models were developed to predict any of the ratios in general, and specifically, the practical <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> range in order to effectively control overall project costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of beef cattle breeding {{is limited by}} the productive performance of animals, by the systems of fattening and purchasing and by the <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> of the produce. In order to establish the relationship among these, 87 bullocks have been studied. The animals belong to two productive types – beef and dairy breeds. They have been fattened under two systems – in barns and combined (including pasture period and subsequent fattening in a barn). The effect of the studied factors was shown using various linear models. Fattening system and age have had a reliable influence on the <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> per kg of yield and kg of live weight with all breeds. The combined fattening and the younger age are prerequisites for lower <b>prime</b> <b>cost.</b> Various breed groups, and not the fattening systems, have influenced the slaughter yield. The lower <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> per kg of yield does not guarantee the lower <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> per kg of live weight. A reliable influence has been recorded with regard to the <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> per kg of live weight on the profit per kg of live weight. Purchasing by live weight is not an incentive for the production of well fattened bullocks with high slaughter yield. Key words: Bullocks, breed, systems of fattening and purchasing, profi...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTarget costing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} methods in cost management. As a useful and efficient management tool, it has a comprehensive approach for managing <b>costs,</b> reducing <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> of products in the initial stage of product planning and design, and achieving long-term profit. The present study attempts to investigate the use of target costing and its implementation method in Iran. For this purpose, the study has been conducted through the methods of field and library studies. The results suggest that identifying competitive price and customers’ needs, entering the global competition, reducing <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> of products, motivation and teamwork of the staff, using value engineering and activity-based costing are necessary for the successful implementation of target costing...|$|R
40|$|University {{students}} made lexical decisions to targets preceded by masked primes. In Experiment 1, transposed-letter primes were used {{also in the}} sandwich priming paradigm, in which the target is briefly pre-presented prior to the prime. The priming effects in the masked paradigm, {{but not in the}} sandwich paradigm, were moderated by the density of the letter-order-free neighbourhood of the target. In Experiment 2, letter-order-free neighbour prime words produced a <b>priming</b> <b>cost</b> in masked <b>priming.</b> These results are consistent with the idea that sandwich priming attenuates letter-order-free neighbour competition in target identification. Unexpectedly, no <b>priming</b> <b>cost</b> was produced by conventional (letter-position-preserving) word neighbour primes. Order-free neighbours may produce facilitation of target processing less, and more variably, than conventional neighbours...|$|R

50|$|The {{preferred}} {{treatment of}} overhead costs {{was to bring}} them into contact with <b>prime</b> <b>costs</b> {{only at the end}} of an accounting period. Lewis proposed, that accounts containing overhead items be closed to profit and loss like ordinary expenses. At the same time, work in process and finished goods would be debited with their respective shares of overhead cost, and a suspense account in the general ledger would be credited. At the start of the next period a reversing entry was to be made, debiting suspense and crediting profit and loss. Then suspense was again debited and finished goods and work in process were credited, bringing the inventory accounts back to a <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> basis and leaving total overhead cost as a balance in suspense.|$|R
