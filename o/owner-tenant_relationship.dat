50|$|To {{summarize}} the example, conflict theorists view {{the relationship between}} the owner and tenant as being built primarily on conflict rather than harmony. Even though the <b>owner-tenant</b> <b>relationship</b> may often appear harmonious, any visible harmony is only a product of the law and other elements of the superstructure which constrain the relationship and which are themselves a product of an even deeper conflict, class conflict. A conflict theorist would say that conflict theory holds more explanatory power than consensus theory in this situation since consensus theory cannot explain lawsuits between owners and tenants nor the legal foundations of the asymmetrical power relationship between the two.|$|E
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The {{objective}} of the report is to analyse simulation results coming {{from the use of}} a policy evaluation method that encompasses a wider set of determinants for technology choice. To that end, we use the EEB_Sweden model v 1. 0. Still in an early stage of development, the model offers an opportunity to capture or integrate critical modelling aspects that justify our research project. In particular, we address several aspects to capture a more decentralised micro-economic decision framework for efficient technologies, including: (i) equal level of importance between financial/technology choice decision criteria and non-financial aspects, (ii) use and inclusion of non-financial criteria (e. g. reliability, predictability and appearance); and (iii) development and introduction of <b>owner-tenant</b> <b>relationship</b> in order to capture the ‘principal-agent’ problem. We scrutinise the method by evaluating different policy instruments: (i) zero-net energy buildings combined with existing policy instruments (e. g. grants), (ii) increased in energy price combined with existing policy instruments, (iii) an integrated policy mix encompassing several policy instruments; including existing ones. Two alternative baselines for comparative analysis are developed. One baseline depicts business-as-usual scenario in which market-driven or autonomous energy efficiency improvements take place. The second baseline attempts to capture the long term implication of existing policy instruments targeting the Swedish residential sector. Simulation results suggest that: • The single- and two-dwelling building stock uses energy less intensively compared to baselines. The order of magnitude of efficiency improvements is related to the applied policy instruments. For instance, in the presence of financial and non-financial decision criteria, current policies combined with a zero-net energy building regulation drive a much less energy intensity pattern after 2020 compared to the baselines. Due to the enlargement of the building stock as such, primary energy consumption as a whole increases. In all scenarios, efficiency improvements reduce the growth rate of primary energy consumption. • The impacts of current policies, even if energy prices grow dramatically, are modest. When energy prices increase (by a factor of 10), our results are more modest than estimated by other modelling groups. In turn, this suggests that the impacts of current policies are likely to be overestimated. Our results seem to be consistent with ex-post assessments. The main reason for this {{is likely to be the}} behavioural components included in the technology choice decision framework we use for the policy assessment. • Small plugs (e. g. appliances) and large plugs (e. g. dish washing machines) deliver marginal improvements. This may suggest that even if efficient technologies in these segments are attractive from the financial point of view in the long-run (e. g. A+ refrigerator), non-financial aspects drive decision makers to adopt technologies that are more attractive in other criteria (e. g. appearance, reliability) which are not necessarily energy efficient. This pattern is consistent with empirical behavioural studies. • Space-heating represents the major supply of efficiency improvements on a per building basis under analysed scenarios. This result is also consistent with several studies addressing the Swedish residential sector. • Consistent with empirical (and not modelling) studies, our results show that decision-makers are less motivated to adopt efficient technologies based solely on (high) energy costs. • Results suggest that when non-financial aspects of technology choice are included, decision makers tend to adopt technologies more “rationally” when confronted with a more integrated policy scenario, one that does not focus on a single-technology but on buildings as a system. In our case, we simulated a first-cost subsidy which is given once the energy intensity of the building is reduced below a certain threshold (e. g. 50 ~ 75 kWh/m 2 /yr). This policy scenario triggers a radical transformation of the building stock. We conclude and stress that the entire modelling exercise must be taken as a departure point to further develop a more comprehensive and realistic micro-economic decision framework. Within this learning and experimental research context, modelling results were used for policy insights rather than the forecasting of specific of numbers – like most modelling studies. With due limitations, our modelling results show that that a larger representation of determinants in energy modelling tools is necessary to better evaluate and enhance our understanding of policy choices and their impacts. Whereas many aspects deserve much more analysis, results suggest that the modelling approach included in the EEB_Sweden model should be further developed and used for policy assessment. A critical first research step involves the development of a database that represents the current technology configurations and corresponding energy and carbon values of the Swedish residential sector...|$|E
40|$|The article {{demonstrates}} some {{unintended consequences}} of land reform, showing how {{the restoration of}} land has become a local political resource. Sectors of South African society beyond the classic ‘black spot’/restitution constituency have latched on to the discourse linking restored land with restored citizenship: many farm workers and tenants, although their land rights are officially designated for protection under other legislation, have lodged land claims and are distressed at the state's failure to settle these. The article demonstrates contested relationships between such people – now evicted from their former homes on white farms and seeking refuge on restored African-owned farms – and their mostly unwilling landlords, set against a broader geographical and historical backdrop of <b>owner–tenant</b> <b>relationships.</b> Members of the two constituencies, configured in ethnic as well as class terms, variously draw on repertoires advocating, or contesting, forms of moral ‘good’. These include two contrasting views of citizenship: one highlights the rights of all citizens to be equal, while another {{is grounded in the}} restored ownership of private property. State officials have responded to owner–tenant ethnic conflicts by trying to appease the latter, facilitating their visions of citizenship by pandering to ethnically-defined regional majorities of the landless. The African National Congress (ANC), having promised equal rights at the election, has been ‘reshaped’ as the party of the poor and landless by tenants holding the Party to its promises, while the ANC-supporting title-holders whose land rights were restored to them, and who thus embody the inequalities inherent in private property ownership, have been redefined in the popular imagination as supporters of the opposition. Local perceptions of party and state, constructed in the course of owner–tenant conflicts on African-owned land, amount to a reshaping of citizenship by the landless...|$|R
