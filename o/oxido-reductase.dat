There has been a consistent struggle by researchers to estimate the electron transfer rate constants in physiologically relevant processes.

The determination of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters relevant to protein’s physiological properties is achieved via methodologies established from theoretical considerations of various mechanisms in PFV. So far, the majority of the mathematical models in PFV have been developed for redox proteins undergoing a single-step electron transfer reactions. However, there are many <b>oxido-reductases</b> containing quinone moieties or polyvalent ions of transition metals like Mo, Mn, W, Fe or Co as redox centers, whose redox chemistry can be described only via mathematical models considering successive two-step electron transformation.

The stem cell walls are different from other organs and can modify their rigidity or viscoelastic properties for the integrity and the robustness required to withstand mechanical impacts and environmental stresses. Plant cell wall is composed of complex polysaccharide networks also containing cell wall proteins (CWPs) crucial to perceive and limit the environmental effects. The CWPs are fundamental players in cell wall remodeling processes, and today, only 86 have been identified from the mature stems of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

In addition to this seminal study on hydrogenosomes, they also demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of pyruvate:ferredoxin <b>oxido-reductase</b> and hydrogenase in eukaryotes. Further studies were subsequently conducted on the biochemical cytology and subcellular organization of anaerobic protozoan parasites (Trichomonas vaginalis, Tritrichomonas foetus, Monocercomonas sp., Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba sp., and Hexamita inflata). Using information obtained from hydrogenosomal and biochemical cytology studies these researchers determined the mode of action of metronidazole (Flagyl) in 1976. Metronidazole is today recognized as the gold standard chemotherapeutic agent {{for the treatment of}} anaerobic infections caused by prokaryotes (Clostridium, Bacteroides, Helicobacter) and eukaryotes (Trichomonas, Tritrichomonas, Giardia, Entamoeba). Metronidazole is taken up by diffusion. Once taken up by anaerobes, it is non-enzymatically reduced by reduced ferredoxin which is produced by the action of pyruvate:ferredoxin <b>oxido-reductase.</b> This reduction creates products toxic to the anaerobic cell, and allows for selective accumulation of the drug in anaerobes.|$|E

50|$|This pathway is {{also called}} the “Xylose Reductase-Xylitol Dehydrogenase” or XR-XDH pathway.

Xylitol is then oxidized to D-xylulose by XDH, using the cofactor NAD. In the last step D-xylulose is phosphorylated by an ATP utilising kinase, XK, to result in D-xylulose-5-phosphate which is an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway.Because of the varying cofactors needed in this pathway {{and the degree to}} which they are available for usage, a cofactor imbalance can result in an accumulation of the intermediate xylitol when there is insufficient regeneration of NAD.

A compensatory mutation that partially restores dimerization to the mutant ERp 29 (G 37 D/D 42 A) rescues ERp 29 activity.

Direct electron transfer between these proteins is not coupled to ATP synthesis and should be avoided in most physiological conditions. However, under low energy-requiring conditions an uncoupled high rate of oxygen consumption would be beneficial, as it would prevent overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In mitochondria from high energy-requiring, logarithmic-growth phase cells, most NDH 2 e was associated to cytochrome c oxidase and electrons from NADH were channeled to the cytochromic pathway. In contrast, in the low energy requiring, late stationary-growth phase, complex IV concentration decreased, the cells overexpressed NDH 2 e and thus a large fraction of this enzyme {{was found in a}} non-associated form. Also, the NDH 2 e–AOX uncoupled pathway was activated and the state IV external NADH-dependent production of ROS decreased.
