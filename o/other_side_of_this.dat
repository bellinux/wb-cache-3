Even though network executives and series creator Shonda Rhimes did not confirm plans for Private Practice, Wyatt called it a [...] "well-known secret" [...] as information about the casting and production was becoming increasingly more available. The spin-off was officially confirmed through subsequent media commentators, who stated that the two-part episode [...] "The <b>Other</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> Life" [...] would serve as the backdoor pilot for the new series. Grey's Anatomy cast members Ellen Pompeo and Katherine Heigl had mixed reactions to the decision to create a spin-off for Kate Walsh's character Addison Montgomery. Today's Jeannette Walls {{reported that}} Pompeo was angry at not being consulted prior the show's creation. Heigl praised the concept for Private Practice but wished her character had been chosen for the spin-off instead.|$|E

500|$|On February 21, 2007, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that ABC was pursuing a spin-off medical drama television series for Grey's Anatomy featuring Walsh's character, Montgomery. Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of Grey's Anatomy {{would serve as}} a backdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off. The cast of Grey's Anatomy was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, she should have been consulted, and Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Stevens. The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007 sees Montgomery take a leave of absence from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best friend from Los Angeles, Naomi Bennett (Merrin Dungey, later Audra McDonald), a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist. While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center.

[...] Theobald and Cibber are marked by vanity and pride, by having no care for morality.
