5|$|On 17 April 1986—the day {{the bodies}} of the {{teachers}} were found and McCarthy was kidnapped—Ann Marie Murphy, a pregnant Irish chambermaid, was discovered in Heathrow airport with a Semtex bomb in the false bottom <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bags. She had been about to board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London. The bag had been packed by her Jordanian fiancé Nizar Hindawi, who had said he would join her in Israel where they were to be married.|$|E

5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use {{frustrating}} and impractical since it took away use <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E
5|$|Sources do {{not reveal}} El Occidentes {{movements}} {{over the next}} eight months. But in April 1918, the Chicago Daily Tribune reported on an encounter El Occidente had with two German submarines that had occurred on 2 February. In a 20-minute running gun battle, Naval Armed Guardsmen aboard El Occidente exchanged fire with two U-boats, one on the port {{and one on the}} starboard. The news item reported that El Occidentes gunners had demolished the periscope <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> attackers.|$|E
5|$|Susie Bootja Bootja {{was born}} circa 1935 near Kurtal, or Helena Spring, {{south-west}} of Balgo, Western Australia; {{the country is}} called Kaningarra in her own language, a name that appears as the title <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> art works. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. While sources vary as to Susie's skin name (some indicating Napangarti, others Napaltjarri), the similar birth dates, locations, and work history indicate that all are referring to the one individual.|$|E

In a 2011 public interview with Shambala Sun, Turner indicated that she no longer follows the morning and evening Gongyo practice in a regimented schedule and hosts various types of Buddhist statues in her home altar located in the upper attic <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> guesthouses in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 until 1966 she dwelt {{in a flat}} at 8 Holly Hill, Hampstead, {{which was}} owned by the husband <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> OMS students, the Latvian exile and poet Velta Snikere. After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles {{district}} of Holborn. Here, she was {{in close proximity to}} the two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis Bookshop and Watkins Bookshop, {{as well as to the}} British Museum. She offered one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and in the last few months of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for Prediction. After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in Prediction and Prediction Annual until summer 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Khanna {{campaigned for}} her father's {{election}} in New Delhi (Lok Sabha constituency). In 2000, {{she was part}} of the judges panel at Femina Miss India. She made her theater debut as the female lead in Feroz Khan's All The Best in February 2001. In 2002, Khanna opened her own interior design store in Crawford Market, Mumbai, called The White Window, in partnership with her longtime friend Gurlein Manchanda. Since then, the store has received the Elle Decor International Design Award. She has opened up another branch of the store elsewhere in Mumbai. She does not hold a professional degree and worked with an architect for two years to learn the procedures. During her pregnancy, she practised maps and designs using CAD. Khanna did the interiors for Rani Mukerji's, Reemma Sen's and Tabu's houses, Kareena Kapoor Khan's Bandra flat in 2008 and Poonam Bajaj's design studio. On the request <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> clients, she ordered a company to make a golden toilet seat.|$|E

5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E
5|$|Stripped of {{the ability}} to {{construct}} new capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy instead opted to significantly upgrade and reconfigure their existing battleships and battlecruisers. Kirishima was placed in Third Reserve in December 1926, before beginning her first reconstruction in early 1927. Horizontal armor over the ammunition magazines was strengthened, and she was also fitted with anti-torpedo bulges, as permitted by the Washington Treaty. To upgrade Kirishimas speed, the 36 coal-fired Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with ten new mixed-firing Kampon boilers. To allow for more equipment to be installed on board, her forward superstructure was reconstructed in the Pagoda mast style, facilitating the removal <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> three funnels. The reconstruction of the Kongō-class battlecruisers added an additional 4,000 tons of armor to the ships, directly violating the terms of the Washington Treaty. On 16 April 1930, the reconstruction was declared complete.|$|E
5|$|The British {{garrison}} at Diego Garcia {{had not yet}} {{learned of}} the state of war between Britain and Germany, and so treated Emden to a warm reception. She remained there until 10 October, during which time her bottom was cleaned of fouling. She then resumed searching for merchant ships in the area west of Colombo. While operating there, Emden picked up Hampshires wireless signals again, and so departed for the Chagos Archipelago on 13 October. Meanwhile, the British had captured Markomannia on 12 October, depriving Emden <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> colliers. On 15 October, Emden captured a British steamer off Minikoi and sank her the next day. Over the next five days, she captured five more vessels; one was used as a collier, three were sunk, and the fifth was sent to port with the crews of the other vessels. On 20 October, Müller {{decided it was time to}} move to a new area of operations.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{probably}} gave York to Geoffrey in {{the hope}} of forcing him to become a full priest, and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected {{to be out of the}} country on crusade. The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath, the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard's efforts to keep Geoffrey's possible ambitions towards the English throne in check. But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey's appointment, claiming that because the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, and some others of the chapter had not been present, the election was invalid. Walter's election to York was supported by Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey as the product <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's affairs. Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric, and did not confirm the election until a council held at Pipewell on 16September. At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the diocese of York: he made Henry Marshal the dean; Burchard du Puiset, a relative of Hugh du Puiset, became treasurer; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Geoffrey objected to these appointments, and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest. The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard's strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese, and thus unable to challenge for the English throne. The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey, in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives.|$|E
