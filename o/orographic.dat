5|$|<b>Orographic</b> or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by <b>orographic</b> lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Orographic</b> {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by <b>orographic</b> lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} the Patagonian region is {{influenced}} both by the close distance to Antarctica and by the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies. Polar cold air outbreaks, cool ocean upwelling, <b>orographic</b> precipitation and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current further affect the regional climate.|$|E
5|$|Due to New Mexico's {{position}} in the southwestern United States, there are three primary causes for flooding within {{the state in the}} autumn months: the effects of tropical cyclones, the North American Monsoon, or an approaching cold front. Tropical cyclones and they're from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans affect the state, usually in southern New Mexico. Storms that originate from the Atlantic Ocean usually move through the Gulf of Mexico on a northwest trajectory, typically during the month of September. Tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific usually maintain a fast north-northeast track, occasionally through the Gulf of California, and generally affect the state from the middle of September to the middle of October. The accompanying moisture of the Pacific storms encounter the mountains of the state, and through <b>orographic</b> lift, produce heavy rainfall. Due to the storms' fast movement, the rainfall events accompanying Pacific storms are generally shorter lasting and more concentrated than other such storms in the state.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ghats {{extend from}} the Satpura Range in the north, {{stretching}} from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu. It traverses south past {{the states of}} Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala. Major gaps in the range are the Goa Gap, between the Maharashtra and Karnataka sections, and the Palghat Gap on the Tamil Nadu and Kerala border between the Nilgiri Hills and the Anaimalai Hills. The mountains intercept the rain-bearing westerly monsoon winds, and are consequently an area of high rainfall, particularly on their western side. The dense forests {{also contribute to the}} precipitation of the area by acting as a substrate for condensation of moist rising <b>orographic</b> winds from the sea, and releasing much of the moisture back into the air via transpiration, allowing it to later condense and fall again as rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{westerlies}} {{explain why}} coastal North America {{tends to be}} wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich air from the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until <b>orographic</b> lift caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a rain shadow effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal North America in the middle latitudes experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (<b>orographic</b> lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
5|$|The first area {{affected}} by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little {{wind and rain}} damage. After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained an area of moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the Blue Ridge Mountains, {{a process known as}} <b>orographic</b> lift. Flooding affected roads and low-lying areas along the Potomac River. The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the Poconos and along the Delaware River. Rushing waters demolished about 150road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30dams. The swollen Brodhead Creek virtually submerged a summer camp, killing 37people. Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101people and caused an estimated $70million in damage (1955USD). Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York.|$|E
5|$|Turbulent {{forces in}} {{air and water}} affect the {{environment}} and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running {{over the surface of}} a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, {{and other parts of the}} aquatic ecosystem are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called <b>orographic</b> lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic Oscillation, {{also known}} as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode is the main factor in tropospheric {{circulation}} variability south of 20oS and is characterized by pressure anomalies with one situated in the Antarctic and one situated in a band at around 40–50oS around the globe. It mainly affects middle and high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by the north–south displacement of the westerly wind belt that circle around Antarctica. Such variation in the position of the westerly wind belt affects the intensity and position of cold fronts and mid latitude storm systems and is partly responsible for variation in precipitation in the southern parts of Argentina. The Antarctic Oscillation is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. A positive phase is when the westerly wind belt is displaced to the south. The positive phase occurs when there is increased surface pressure over the southern parts of the South American continent and decreased pressure in Antarctica. This results in stronger westerly winds in the southern parts of the country while preventing cold fronts from penetrating inland, producing more stable conditions. Furthermore, the positive phase leads to warmer conditions south of 40oS, particularly during the summer in areas between 40–60oS. Precipitation is lower due to less frontal and <b>orographic</b> precipitation resulting from reduced westerly wind flow between 40–60OS. Opposite conditions occur in the negative phase when the westerly wind belt is shifted equatorward. Cold fronts moving northwards from the south penetrate more frequently, leading to more precipitation and cooler temperatures during the negative phase. The major effect of negative phase of the Antarctic Oscillation occurs in spring when it increases precipitation over southeastern South America.|$|E
25|$|A third {{source of}} lift is wind {{circulation}} forcing air over a physical barrier {{such as a}} mountain (<b>orographic</b> lift). If the air is generally stable, nothing more than lenticular cap clouds will form. However, if the air becomes sufficiently moist and unstable, <b>orographic</b> showers or thunderstorms may appear.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, one of {{the causes}} of rain must happen. In the case of the monsoon, the cause is {{primarily}} <b>orographic,</b> due to the presence of highlands {{in the path of the}} winds. <b>Orographic</b> barriers force wind to rise. Precipitation then occurs on the windward side of the highlands because of adiabatic cooling and condensation of the moist rising air.|$|E
25|$|Scientists had {{initially}} dismissed the meteorological {{explanation of the}} clouds because the plumes only seemed to be unique to Bennett Island and not the other, similar islands, {{and because it was}} thought that the 1,000 foot high island was too low to generate <b>orographic</b> clouds. <b>Orographic</b> clouds normally form when air is forced to rise as it passes over a mountain and cools.|$|E
25|$|For the {{northeast}} monsoon, the highlands of the Eastern Ghats {{play the role}} of <b>orographic</b> barrier.|$|E
25|$|The average {{altitude}} {{of the park}} is 1750m and the highest summit is Rilets at 2713m. The valley of the river Rilska from the Fish lakes to the Kirilova meadow divides {{the territory of the}} park into two principal <b>orographic</b> crests, Skakavishko and Riletsko. They are connected with the main <b>orographic</b> and hydrographic junction of the mountain, Kanarata peak (2691m), through which passes the watershed between the Black Sea and Aegean Sea catchment areas.|$|E
25|$|The two wettest {{months of}} the year are May and June. <b>Orographic</b> lift causes brief but strong {{afternoon}} thunderstorms during the summer.|$|E
25|$|Aoraki / Mount Cook {{receives}} substantial <b>orographic</b> precipitation {{throughout the}} year, as breezy, moisture-laden westerly winds dominate all year-round, bringing rainclouds from the Tasman Sea with them.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of abundant highlands like the Western Ghats and the Himalayas {{right across the}} path of the southwest monsoon winds. These are the main cause of the substantial <b>orographic</b> precipitation throughout the subcontinent.|$|E
25|$|The Western Ghats are {{the first}} {{highlands}} of India that the southwest monsoon winds encounter. The Western Ghats rise abruptly from the Western Coastal Plains of the subcontinent, making effective <b>orographic</b> barriers for the monsoon winds.|$|E
25|$|A {{documented}} {{accident in}} 1999 involving wind shear from the scarp {{is at the}} Perth Airport article. In addition, <b>orographic</b> uplift is produced when rain clouds move over the hills, giving higher rainfalls in settlements in the ranges compared with their coastal neighbours.|$|E
25|$|Although the Sierra Madre flanks {{boundaries}} of Quezon, {{the predominance of}} relatively flat to moderately sloped area {{and the absence of}} imposing peaks prevent <b>orographic</b> precipitation. Quezon, however, is exposed to the monsoonal wind systems and periodic typhoons is a permanent feature.|$|E
25|$|Surface air {{circulation}} is largely influenced by <b>orographic</b> lift. In warmer {{part of the}} year, winds from northwest and west prevail. In Vojvodina and Sumadija, east-southeast wind, Košava, dominates over autumn and winter. Southwestern winds prevail in mountainous part of southwestern Serbia.|$|E
25|$|The Himalayas {{play more}} than the role of <b>orographic</b> {{barriers}} for the monsoon. They also help confine it to the subcontinent. Without them, the southwest monsoon winds would blow right over the Indian subcontinent into Tibet, Afghanistan, and Russia without causing any rain.|$|E
25|$|Up-slope fog or {{hill fog}} forms when winds blow air up a slope (called <b>orographic</b> lift), adiabatically cooling {{it as it}} rises, and causing the {{moisture}} in it to condense. This often causes freezing fog on mountaintops, where the cloud ceiling would not otherwise be low enough.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Menzel {{proposed}} that Arnold had seen <b>orographic</b> clouds or wave clouds; Maccabee {{says that this}} conflicted with testimony from Arnold and others that the sky was clear, and again can't account for the objects' reported brightness and rapid motion over a very large angular region.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamic theory}} {{explains}} the monsoon {{as a global}} weather phenomenon rather than just a local one. And when coupled with the traditional theory (based on the heating of sea and land), it enhances the explanation of the varying intensity of monsoon precipitation along the coastal regions with <b>orographic</b> barriers.|$|E
25|$|The {{region has}} a very high {{rainfall}} due to the prevailing northwesterly wind pattern {{and the location of}} the Southern Alps, which give rise to heavy <b>orographic</b> precipitation. The rain shadow effect is responsible for the relatively arid climate of the Canterbury Plains {{on the other side of}} the Southern Alps.|$|E
25|$|The flora of the peninsula, {{because of}} bio-historical, geographical, geological, and <b>orographic</b> conditions, is among {{of the richest}} and most varied of all European floras, rivaled only by such {{countries}} as Greece and Italy; {{it is estimated that}} the Iberian Peninsula has more than 8,000 distinct species of plants, many of them endemic.|$|E
25|$|The Chinook is a föhn wind, a rain shadow wind {{which results}} from the {{subsequent}} adiabatic warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes (<b>orographic</b> lift). As {{a consequence of the}} different adiabatic rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than equivalent elevations on the windward slopes.|$|E
25|$|Temperatures {{are warm}} to hot {{all year round}} owing to the warm {{currents}} from the North Pacific gyre that surround the island. Rainfall is less heavy than {{in most parts of}} mainland Japan since the island is too far south to be influenced by the Aleutian Low and too far from Asia to receive monsoonal rainfall or <b>orographic</b> precipitation on the equatorward side of the Siberian High.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{comprises}} {{two separate}} islands {{located in the}} Southern Hemisphere, {{commonly referred to as}} the North Island and the South Island. The Westland rainforests are located along the central west coast portion of the South Island. South of these forests lay the Fiordland temperate forests. Many glaciers are located in the Westland area. The Southern Alps run along the coast causing <b>orographic</b> lifting and high precipitation.|$|E
25|$|Even so, high-altitude <b>orographic</b> clouds {{frequently}} drift {{over the}} Olympus Mons summit, and airborne Martian dust is still present. Although the average Martian surface atmospheric pressure {{is less than}} one percent of Earth's, the much lower gravity on Mars increases the atmosphere's scale height; in other words, Mars's atmosphere is expansive and does not drop off in density with height as sharply as Earth's.|$|E
25|$|The Bale Mountains play a {{vital role}} in climate control of the region by {{attracting}} large amounts of <b>orographic</b> rainfall, which has obvious implications for livestock and agricultural production. Some 600 - 1,000mm fall annually in the lower altitude areas, while 1,000 - 1,400mm fall in areas of higher altitude, and over 12 million people from Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia are dependent on water from the Bale massif.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{location}} between the Pacific Ocean {{and the high}} San Gabriel Mountains, the Los Angeles Basin is subject to flash floods caused by heavy <b>orographic</b> precipitation from Pacific storms hitting the mountains. Due to the arid climate, soils are too hard to absorb water quickly during storm events, resulting in large amounts of surface runoff. The steep, rocky terrain of the San Gabriel Mountains further contributes to the rapid runoff and resultant flooding hazard.|$|E
25|$|The main <b>orographic</b> ridge {{extends from}} the north-west to the south-east. Pirin spans an area of 2,585km2 with an average height of 1,033m. The maximum length between the Paril and Predel saddles is 80km; the maximum width is 40km. Reaching an {{altitude}} of 2,914m Pirin is the second highest mountain range in Bulgaria after Rila (2,925m) and the eighth highest in Europe after the Caucasus, the Alps, Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees, Mount Etna, the aforementioned Rila, and Mount Olympus.|$|E
25|$|Rainfall {{is fairly}} evenly {{distributed}} throughout the seasons, with a bias to {{the first half of}} the year. It is often associated with <b>orographic</b> lift caused by the escarpment. A significant flood event occurred on 18 August 1998 when Wollongong recorded 316mm of rainfall (the nearby suburb of Mt Ousley recorded in excess of 445mm), mostly falling in a 3-hour period. Wollongong also experiences thunderstorms during the warmer months bringing lightning, heavy rain and occasionally hail.|$|E
