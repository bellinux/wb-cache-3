5|$|In 1911–12, Lehman {{played for}} the New Westminster Royals of the newly founded Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He played three seasons for New Westminster, winning the league {{championship}} in his first season. In 1914–15, Lehman joined the Vancouver Millionaires of the PCHA. In his first season with the Millionaires, Lehman posted a 14–3 record, with a 4.08goals-against average, which {{was a very good}} average in an era when goaltenders were not allowed to drop <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> to make a save. In the Stanley Cup playoffs, Lehman helped the Millionaires become the first PCHA team to win the Stanley Cup, with a 3–0 record and 2.67goals against average. This would be the only Stanley Cup victory of Lehman's career, as he was on the losing side in seven other attempts. The Millionaires squad consisted of seven future members of the Hockey Hall of Fame when they won the Cup: Lehman, Frank Nighbor, Cyclone Taylor, Si Griffis, Barney Stanley, Frank Patrick, and Mickey MacKay.|$|E

25|$|The Gelflings were {{designed}} and sculpted by Wendy Midener. They {{were difficult to}} perform, as {{they were meant to}} be the most human creatures in the film, and thus their movements, particularly their gait, had to be as realistic as possible. During scenes when the Gelflings' legs were off-camera, the performers walked <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> {{in order to make the}} character's movements more lifelike. According to Odell, the character Jen was Henson's way of projecting himself into the film. Jen was originally meant to be blue, in homage to the Hindu deity Rama, but this idea was scrapped early on.|$|E
50|$|The use of knee sleeves in unequipped powerlifting {{has brought}} about much debate as to whether certain {{neoprene}} knee sleeves can actually assist a lifter during the squat.

25|$|The {{design of}} the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus, with its Baroque nature {{emphasised}} by the zigzag form of its stairways, influenced many other sites in Portugal (like Lamego) and colonial Brazil, like the Sanctuary of Congonhas. As the pilgrims climbed the stairs, (by tradition encouraged to do so <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees)</b> they encountered a theological programme that contrasted the senses of the material world with {{the virtues of the}} spirit, {{at the same time as}} they experienced the scenes of the Passion of Christ. The culmination of the effort was the temple of God, the church on the top of the hill. The presence of several fountains along the stairways give the idea of purification of the faithful.|$|E
25|$|Catchers {{also are}} prone to knee ailments {{stemming}} from the awkward crouching stance they assume. Because of this, catchers have a reputation of being slow baserunners; {{even if they have}} speed {{at the beginning of their}} careers, the eventual toll taken <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> slows them down, although there are some exceptions, such as Manny Sanguillén and Alex Avila. Some players who begin their career as catchers are moved to other positions in order to preserve their running speed, increase their availability for games, and take advantage of their prowess with the bat. Prominent examples of catchers switching position in mid-career include Mike Napoli, Craig Biggio, B. J. Surhoff, Joe Mauer, Brandon Inge, and Dale Murphy (although Murphy was also known as a poor thrower to the pitcher and to second base, nearly hitting pitchers in the process).|$|E
25|$|The Blackhand Edition uses {{both the}} Wii Remote and the Nunchuk; if an enemy is <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees,</b> the player can pull the {{controllers}} upwards to lift {{them off the}} ground. Similarly, swinging the controllers {{from side to side}} swings an enemy around. Melee combat is similar to Wii Sports Boxing - the player literally throws the type of punch they want Aldo to throw in the game. Slamming enemies against walls is accomplished by shoving the controllers towards the screen, and head-butts, by quickly raising them upwards. The remote can also be used for executions, which require specific gestures, for opening doors, and for reloading weapons. For example, to reload a shotgun, the player must move the Nunchuk upwards and then quickly downwards to mimic the pump action of the weapon, and to reload a revolver, the player must flick the Nunchuk as if emptying the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|This basic backbreaker {{submission}} {{involves the}} wrestler to lay his opponent's back across {{one of his}} knees, then while placing one hand on his opponent's chin and the other <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> the wrestler would push down to bend the opponent around his/her knee. This move is usually performed {{at the end of}} a pendulum backbreaker, a move which sees a wrestler drop an opponent down on the wrestler's knee, thus weakening the back before the hold is applied, as well as setting the opponent in a proper position.|$|R
50|$|When {{a player}} is tapped out they {{drop to the}} ground with one knee {{touching}} the ground. If they have been hit by a staff or other pompfe, they stay down for five stones. If they have been hit by a chain, they are down for eight stones. The count begins when the knee hits the ground and while the player may move to retrieve a weapon they must return to where they were hit before they start playing. A kneeling player may also pivot around <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> provided they don't lift it.|$|R

25|$|The Cathedral is to {{the north}} of the main plaza and it is the most emblematic symbol of the city. However, the main facade does not face the Zócalo, rather it faces its own atrium which is called the Cathedral Plaza. The Cathedral began as a modest church {{dedicated}} to the Virgin of the Assumption built in 1528. When Chiapas became a diocese in the 17th century, with San Cristóbal as its seat, this church was torn down to build the current structure, dedicated to Saint Christopher, the patron of the city. The overall structure contains European Baroque, Moorish and indigenous influences. The main facade was finished in 1721 and some final touches were added in the 20th century. The main feature of the church is its main facade, which was finished in 1721. It is Baroque painted yellow with ornamental columns and niches in which are various saints. It is divided into three horizontal and three vertical levels marked off by pairs of Solomonic columns and meant to resemble an altarpiece. It is further decorated with intricate raised stucco work mostly in white which show Oaxacan and Guatemalan influences. The layout of the interior shows Moorish influence. The main altar is dedicated to both the Virgin of the Assumption and Saint Christopher. The wood pulpit is from the 16th century and gilded. The side walls have two Baroque altarpieces, one to the Virgin of the Assumption and the other to John of Nepomuk. There is also a small chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe on the north side. The sacristy has a large colonial era paintings of Jesus in Gesethame by Juan Correa as well as paintings by Miguel Cabrera and Eusebio de Aguilar. It is common to see older indigenous women in the Cathedral, with some even traversing the entire nave <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> to approach the large image of Jesus handing above the Baroque altar.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} later Kunal and Sam meet in court, where they are picking up {{residency}} permits. Recognising {{the value of their}} friendship with Neha and each other, they reconcile. They find Neha at a fashion show and try to apologise, but she refuses to see them. Unaware of [...] Neha and Abhi's break-up, they ask about the wedding and Neha tells them about Veer's fears. Kunal and Sam admit that they manipulated the boy, angering Neha and Abhi. Kunal and Sam climb onto the stage and beg Neha's forgiveness. The crowd encourages them to beg <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees,</b> say that they love her and blow her kisses, but nothing softens her. When the crowd tells them to kiss each other, they refuse. Neha and Abhi turn to leave, and Kunal kisses a reluctant Sam. Abhi and Neha are both amazed by the lengths to which they will go to regain her trust; Neha forgives them. Kunal and Sam then get down <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> and propose to Abhi on her behalf. Amused, Abhi agrees. Two months later, Neha playfully asks Kunal and Sam if they felt anything for each other when they pretended to be gay; they say [...] "no", remembering their kiss.|$|E
500|$|On March 29, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt {{went to the}} Little White House at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest {{before his}} {{anticipated}} appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations. On the afternoon of April 12, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain {{in the back of}} my head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage (stroke). At 3:35pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining consciousness. As Allen Drury later said, “so ended an era, and so began another.” After Roosevelt's death, an editorial by The New York Times declared, [...] "Men will thank God <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> a hundred years from now that Franklin D.

After retiring, Brimsek returned to Minnesota and worked as a railroad engineer. Even after his retirement, Brimsek regularly received fan mail. In 1966, Brimsek was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, the first American-born goalie to be inducted, and in 1973 he was an inaugural inductee of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. Brimsek died on November 11, 1998 in Virginia, Minnesota, leaving behind his wife, Peggy, his two daughters, Chris and Karen, and his five grandchildren.|$|E

[...] Consisting of three seniors and two juniors, historically all male, the Yell Leaders are elected to their positions annually by the student body. [...] These students do not perform gymnastic feats, but instead use hand signals, known as [...] "pass backs", to direct and intensify crowds.

500|$|In 1616, {{two years}} after Peacham's Case, the case of commendams arose. The in commendam writ was a method of {{transferring}} ecclesiastical property, which James used in this case to allow Richard Neile to hold his bishopric and associated revenues without actually performing the duties. On 25 April 1616 the courts, at Coke's bidding, held that this action was illegal, writing to the king that [...] "in case any letters come unto us contrary to law, we do nothing by such letters, but certify your Majesty thereof, and go forth to do the law notwithstanding the same". James called the judges before him and, furious, ripped up the letter, patronisingly telling them that [...] "I well know the true and ancient common law {{to be the most}} favourable to Kings of any law in the world, to which law I do advise you my Judges to apply your studies". While all the other judges [...] "succumbed to royal pressure and, throwing themselves <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees,</b> prayed for pardon", Coke defended the letter and stated that [...] "When the case happens I shall do that which shall be fit for a judge to do".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Mosley {{represented}} FOCA in the [...] "FISA-FOCA War", {{a conflict between}} FOCA, representing the mainly UK-based independent teams, and FISA, which {{was supported by the}} [...] "grandee" [...] constructors owned by road car manufacturers (primarily Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Renault). In 1981, FOCA announced its own World Federation of Motor Sport and ran the non-championship 1981 South African Grand Prix. The staging of this event, with worldwide television coverage, helped persuade Jean-Marie Balestre, the FISA president, that FISA would have to negotiate a settlement with FOCA. As Mosley has since commented: [...] "We were absolutely [...] If Balestre could have held the manufacturer's support for a little bit longer, the constructors would have been <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees.</b> The outcome would then have been very different." [...] Mosley helped draw up the Concorde Agreement, a document which resolved the dispute by essentially giving FISA control of the rules and FOCA control of commercial and television rights. The most recent version of the Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 2007, and a new one was being discussed, as of 2008. In 1982, the year after the first Concorde Agreement was signed, Mosley left his role at FOCA, and Formula One, to work for the Conservative Party.|$|E
500|$|In the summer, the privations of the captivity, {{including}} their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. According to some accounts, {{at one point}} Anastasia became so upset about the locked, painted windows that she opened one to look outside and get fresh air. A sentry reportedly saw her and fired, narrowly missing her. She did not try again. On July 14, 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, [...] "Something has happened to them in there." [...] But the next day, on July 15, 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards weren't watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, {{the head of the}} detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.|$|E
500|$|For {{their second}} single, the Nice created an {{arrangement}} of Leonard Bernstein's [...] "America" [...] which Emerson described as the first ever instrumental protest song. The track used the main theme of the Bernstein piece (from West Side Story) but also included fragments of Dvořák's New World Symphony. The single concludes with Arnold's three-year-old son speaking the lines [...] "America is pregnant with promise and anticipation, but is murdered by {{the hand of the}} inevitable." [...] The new arrangement was released under the title [...] "America (Second Amendment)" [...] as a pointed reference to the US Bill of Rights provision for the right to bear arms. In July 1968, Immediate Records publicised the single with a controversial poster picturing the group members with small boys <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>knees,</b> with superimposed images of the faces of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. on the children's heads. A spokesman for the band said [...] "Several record stores have refused to stock our current single .... the Nice feel if the posters are issued in United States they will do considerable harm". During the tour that followed the release of their second album in July, the group spawned controversy when Emerson burned an American flag onstage during a performance of [...] "America" [...] at a charity event, Come Back Africa in London's Royal Albert Hall. The group were subsequently banned from ever playing the venue again.|$|E
