40|$|Benthic oxygen {{profiles}} {{were acquired}} using microsensors over two seasonal cycles (December 2001, April and August 2002, January and May 2003) at two stations differently affected by shellfish farming {{activity in the}} Thau lagoon (French Mediterranean coast). This study {{was part of the}} Microbent-PNEC Program on the study of biogeochemical processes at the sedimentewater interface in an eutrophicated environment. We explored seasonal and spatial heterogeneity as well as the biogeochemical drivers of oxygen uptake, such as in situ temperature, bottom water oxygenation and organic matter deposition. O 2 consumption rates were determined by using a transport-reaction model. Maximum rates were reached in August and May and minimum rates in December, April or January. The effect of oyster farming on oxygen fluxes was clearly identified with higher diffusive oxygen uptake in the station inside the <b>oyster</b> <b>parks</b> (C 5; 36. 8 18. 5 e 87. 7 40. 8 mmol m 2 d 1), compared with the station lying outside the <b>oyster</b> <b>parks</b> (C 4; 8. 6 2. 1 e 30. 7 8. 3 mmol m 2 d 1). At C 5, the large spatial heterogeneity was statistically concealing temporal variation, whereas a clear statistical difference between cold and warm periods appeared at C 4. In these lagoon sediments, the seasonal dynamics of diffusive oxygen demand and consumption rates were mainly driven by seasonal temperature variation at both stations, as well as by seasonal organic matter delivery to the sediment at the station located outside the <b>oyster</b> <b>parks.</b> In the station located below the <b>oyster</b> <b>parks,</b> seasonal variation of organic matter deposition was dampened by oyster filtering activity. Seasonal temperature variation thus appeared as the major driver of oxygen dynamics in this station. Measurements of total O 2 uptake rates indicated a significant fraction of microbial recycling and diffusive transport in oxygen uptake at the station located close to the <b>oyster</b> <b>parks.</b> In the open water site, fauna-mediated O 2 transport prevailed in April 2002 (cold conditions), whereas the microbial recycling seemed to dominate in May 2003 (warm conditions). 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Based on {{experience}} acquired in Belgium and The Netherlands, a concept for industrial <b>oyster</b> nursery <b>parks</b> {{has been developed}} by the multi-disciplinary project-group "MARIOS" (Mariculture Costerschelde = Eastern Scheldt). The <b>oyster</b> nursery <b>parks</b> are set up module-wise with a total production capacity of 25 or 50 million 35 mm oysters (Ostrea edulis) per year. Depending {{on the site of}} implantation this means 5 or 10 culture units. Each unit spans two modules. The modules are designed for a production of 2. 5 million 35 mm oysters per year. The modules are fitted with twelve raceways for the placing of up-flow cylinders, containing the small oyster spat. Four large raceways can be used both for culturing the extra algal food in the first nursery phase and for ongrowth of the large oyster spat in the second nursery phase, using only natural seawater. The nursery culturing is divided in two phases of approximately 3 months each. Phase I (3 to 15 mm) starts in May when the water temperature arrives above 10 °C. Since the natural phytoplankton production may be too low during that period, feeding has to be made good by precultured phytoplankton. Phase II (15 to 35 mm) starts in August and is based on the natural phytoplankton present in the water. During phase II, the juvenile oysters are grown on sieves, piled up in the large raceways with a horizontal flow of water, earlier used as algal culture basins. For the supply of seawater, the use of differences in tidal levels as well as pumping has been considered. With regard to exploitation, several production schemes have been evaluated up to the economic workability...|$|R

City Center at Oyster Point was developed out of {{a small portion of the}} <b>Oyster</b> Point Business <b>Park.</b> It opened in phases from 2003 through 2005. The city invested $82 million of public funding in the project. Closely following Oyster Point, Port Warwick opened as an urban residential community in the new midtown business district. Fifteen hundred people now reside in the Port Warwick area. It includes a [...] city square where festivals and events take place.|$|R
50|$|Indian Mound Park, {{also known}} as Shell Mound Park or Indian Shell Mound Park, is a park and bird refuge located on the {{northern}} shore of Dauphin Island, a barrier island of Mobile County, Alabama in the United States. In addition to the many birds which visit, {{a wide variety of}} botanical species contribute to the natural offerings. The site is historically significant due to the presence of prehistoric Indian shell middens, mounds composed of discarded <b>oyster</b> shells. The <b>park</b> was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973. It is administered by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.|$|R

50|$|In 1919, the Theodore Roosevelt Association (originally {{known as}} the Permanent Memorial National Committee) was founded by friends and {{supporters}} of Roosevelt. Soon renamed the Roosevelt Memorial Association (RMA), it was chartered in 1920 under Title 36 of the United States Code. In parallel with the RMA was an organization for women, The Women's Theodore Roosevelt Association, that had been founded in 1919 {{by an act of}} the New York State Assembly. Both organizations merged in 1956 under the current name. This organization preserved Roosevelt's papers in a 20-year project, preserved his photos and established four public sites: the reconstructed Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site, New York City, dedicated in 1923 and donated to the National Park Service in 1963; Theodore Roosevelt Memorial <b>Park,</b> <b>Oyster</b> Bay, Long Island, New York, dedicated in 1928 and given to the people of Oyster Bay; Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., given to the federal government in 1932; Sagamore Hill (house), Roosevelt's Oyster Bay home, opened to the public in 1953 and was donated to the National Park Service in 1963 and is now the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site.|$|R
5000|$|As well as pottery, {{ceramics}} {{produced in}} Camulodunum {{also include a}} large tile industry, oil lamps and figurines. The colonia was also a major centre of glass production, and glass moulds (including a complete example) have been discovered in the town. Glass was produced throughout the Roman period of Camulodunum, including in the late 4th century, and glass-making waste was discovered at Culver Street from the mid-1st century. [...] Bone carving for ornamentation, metal working and jewellery making were also practiced, and a coin mint operated in the colonia. Archaeological excavations suggest that the period between 150 and 250 saw {{the largest number of}} active workshops in the colonia. The town was at the centre of a largely rural economy, with archaeological evidence of agricultural buildings in the colonia including the large buttressed tower granary found in the Southern part of the town, in use for much of the 2nd century, with a nearby corn-drying oven. Many ovens have been located in excavations around the town. A system of watermills appears to have operated along Salary Brook near Ardleigh {{to the north of the}} settlement, and other watermills may have operated on the Colne at the modern site of Middle Mill in Castle <b>Park.</b> <b>Oysters</b> from the Colne Estuary and Mersea Island have been an important food source throughout much of Colchester's history, and large dumps (some 0.5m thick) of oyster shells have been found at Balkerne Hill from the Roman period, along with mussels, whelks, cockles, carpet shells, winkle and scallop; fish imported from the River Colne and coast are represented by herring, plaice, flounder, eel, smelt, cod, haddock, gurnard, mullet, dragonet, dab, and sole. As well as the Sheepen river port, Roman roads lead to Mistley on the Essex bank of the River Stour and to a cluster of Roman-era buildings at West Mersea, both of which may also have possessed ports for the colonia. Imports of dates, wine (including Falernian wine), olive oil, jet, marble and other goods from across the Roman Empire have been found in Colchester, including a locally made amphora with an inscription suggesting that it held North African palm-tree fruit products. The trade in salt from local Red Hills also appears to have continued on from the Iron Age in the Roman period, but with more sophisticated evaporation kilns. Small numbers of tiles were imported from Eccles in Kent by Roman settlements in South-East Britain, including Camulodunum, for a brief time in the First Century, as was Kentish Ragstone for building.|$|R
