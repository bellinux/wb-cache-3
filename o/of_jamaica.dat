5|$|The monarchy <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica</b> has {{its roots}} in the Spanish monarchy, under the {{authority}} of which the islands were first colonised in the late 16th century, and later the English and then British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 6 August 1962, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica.</b> The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica,</b> Sir Patrick Allen.|$|E
5|$|As Morgan and {{his allies}} on the Assembly <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica</b> {{continued}} to deal with privateers and pirates, criticism of their action in London was fomented by two former governors <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica,</b> Carbery and Lynch. After Lynch paid £50,000 to Charles II, Morgan's commissions as lieutenant-governor and lieutenant-general were revoked and Lynch was appointed as the island's governor; Morgan still retained {{his position on the}} Assembly <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica.</b> Morgan had been a heavy drinker for several years; he received the news of the revocation of his positions badly and increased his intake of alcohol to the point where his health began to suffer. Lynch removed Morgan's supporters from the Assembly <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica</b> by 1683, and in October that year he removed Morgan and his brother-in-law, leaving the assembly packed with men loyal to him. In 1684 Lynch died, and was temporarily replaced as governor by his friend, the lieutenant-general, Hender Molesworth.|$|E

As a Category4 hurricane with wind speeds between 140mph (220km/h) and 145mph (230km/h), the center of Hurricane Dean passed 90mi (150km) south of Haiti, and that evening passed 25mi (40km) south <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica.</b> Two weather stations on the island <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica,</b> one at Ingleside and the other at Morant Bay, both reported in excess of 13in (33cm) of rainfall.

5|$|Exquemelin {{wrote that}} Morgan's men {{undertook}} widespread torture {{in several of}} the towns they captured. According to Stephen Snelders, in his history of piracy, the Spanish reports of Morgan's raids do not refer to torture being practiced on the residents of Porto Bello or Gibraltar – although there are reliable reports that it was carried out in Panama. The historian Patrick Pringle observes that while torture seems cruel and ruthless to contemporary eyes, it was an accepted part of judicial interrogation in many European countries at the time. Morgan always fought with a commission from the governor <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica.</b> In doing so, he was acting as a reserve naval force for the English government in the defence <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica.</b> As the Spanish did not recognise privateering as a legal activity, even if a captain carried letters of marque, they considered Morgan to be a pirate, something he firmly rejected.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, {{the then}} Governor-General <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica</b> Sir Kenneth O. Hall, {{indicated}} that he wished to step down due to declining health. He was persuaded {{to remain in the}} post for an additional half-year. On 13 January 2009, the Prime Minister <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica,</b> Bruce Golding (of the Jamaica Labour Party), announced that Allen would succeed Kenneth Hall as governor-general. The announcement generated controversy, both because Allen had strong ties to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, and because as an Adventist, Allen might be unable to attend events due to his strict observation of the sabbath. On 28 January 2009, Allen resigned from his presidency of the West Indies Union. He also resigned as {{chairman of the board of}} Northern Caribbean University, and other religious organisations in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Morgan was {{appointed}} a Knight Bachelor in November 1674 {{and returned to}} Jamaica shortly afterward {{to serve as the}} territory's Lieutenant Governor. He served on the Assembly <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica</b> until 1683 and on three occasions he acted as Governor <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica</b> {{in the absence of the}} post-holder. A memoir published by Alexandre Exquemelin, a former shipmate of Morgan's, accused the privateer of widespread torture and other offences; Morgan brought a libel suit against the book's English publishers and won, although the black picture Exquemelin portrayed of Morgan has affected history's view of the Welshman. He died in Jamaica on 25 August 1688. His life was romanticised after his death and he became the inspiration for pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Charley in Jamaica {{included}} one fatality {{and at least}} $1million in damages. Forming out of a tropical wave on August9, 2004, Charley quickly tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea and attained tropical storm status on August10. While passing south <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica</b> on August11, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. During its passage <b>of</b> <b>Jamaica,</b> Charley had maximum winds of 75mph (120km/h), a low-end Category 1 hurricane. Turning north, the storm impacted western Cuba as a Category 3 storm before making landfall in Florida as a strong Category 4. The storm eventually dissipated on August15. As Charley approached Jamaica, officials issued tropical storm watches and warnings before issuing a hurricane watch. Two cruise ships were diverted from docking in Jamaica, affecting 5,700 passengers. Numerous shelters were set up across the island; however, relatively few people sought refuge in them.|$|E

Repairing damaged roads and bridges cost about $4.3million. For at least one day, all schools and most businesses on the island were closed.|$|E
