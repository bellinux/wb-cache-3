2500|$|After {{reversing}} that holding, Cummings {{disposed of}} the case by remanding it to district court and invoking the ordinance's severability provisions. The new proceedings should ask West Allis which direction it would prefer {{to go with a}} revised ordinance. [...] "ould it rather retain the sound provisions of this statute and deal separately with the paraphernalia problems, <b>or</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> prefer to begin again with a more specifically drawn ordinance covering both paraphernalia and simulated drugs?" ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{cast the}} role of Buckaroo Banzai, Richter wanted an actor who [...] "could both look heroic with grease all over his face, and project the kind of {{intelligence}} you would associate with a neurosurgeon and inventor". The studio wanted a recognizable movie star, but Richter and Canton wanted to cast a relatively unknown actor. Richter looked in New York City because he assumed that an actor with experience on stage and small films [...] "would be able to completely interact with props". He had been impressed by Peter Weller's performance in Shoot the Moon and met with him. At first, the actor was hesitant to take the role because he was unclear on the overall tone of the movie. [...] "Would it be campy? Would it be a cartoon? <b>Or</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be the sort of wacky, realistic film that would catch people sideways—and not be a cartoon", Weller remembers thinking. Richter told him Banzai's story and convinced Weller to do the film. The actor says that he based his character on Elia Kazan, Jacques Cousteau, Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, and Adam Ant.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{nothing else}} {{has changed from}} {{experimental}} configuration to experimental configuration, and since {{in the first case}} the photon is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a particle and in the second case it is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a wave, Wheeler wanted to know whether, experimentally, a time could be determined at which the photon made its [...] "decision." [...] Would it be possible to let a photon pass through the region of the first beam-splitter while there was no beam-splitter in the second position, thus causing it to [...] "decide" [...] to travel, and then quickly let the second beam-splitter pop up into its path? Having presumably traveled as a particle up to that moment, would the beam splitter let it pass through and manifest itself as would a particle were that second beam splitter not to be there? <b>Or,</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> behave as though the second beam-splitter had always been there? Would it manifest interference effects? And if it did manifest interference effects then to have done so it must have gone back in time and changed its decision about traveling as a particle to traveling as a wave. Note that Wheeler wanted to investigate several hypothetical statements by obtaining objective data.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} drew sharp rebuttals from Law and Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam. In {{a speech}} at a forum organized by the Institute of Policy Studies, he argued that voters elect the President {{for the purpose of}} enabling him to exercise the discretionary powers granted to him under the Constitution, which means the President's accountability to the electorate is restricted to these matters. He then raised the argument that since Article 21(1) states that the President shall, [...] "in the exercise of his functions under this Constitution or any other written law, act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet", it would be unconstitutional for the President to speak on his own volition in the absence of Cabinet's advice. He also said that the President's constitutional position {{is similar to that of}} the British Monarch, quoting a letter of 4 December 1963 from the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to King Edward VIII in which it was stated that [...] "Ministers are willing to give an experienced Monarch who thoroughly understands and has always strictly observed constitutional limitations, a discretion to what he would say, and are content to take full responsibility knowing well that the Monarch will say nothing of which his Ministers would not approve". Shanmugam posed the question: [...] "If the purpose is to influence the Government, would the best approach be to go public, <b>or</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be to speak to the Prime Minister– as is generally done?" ...|$|E
