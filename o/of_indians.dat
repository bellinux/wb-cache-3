5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images <b>of</b> <b>Indians</b> in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use <b>of</b> <b>Indians</b> as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
5|$|As {{it turned}} out, {{there were no}} Indians, but only a single British officer, John Money of the 9th regiment, Burgoyne's deputy quartermaster.

5|$|In her 1953 novel Graham {{suggests}} that Point du Sable left Chicago {{because he was}} angered with the United States government, which wanted him to buy the land on which he had lived and called his own for the previous two decades.

5|$|People {{who kept}} more {{traditional}} ways had settlements along the Tamiami Trail {{and tended to}} speak the Mikasuki language. They later were federally recognized in 1962 as the Miccosukee Tribe <b>of</b> <b>Indians</b> of Florida. As metropolitan areas in South Florida began to grow, {{the two groups were}} closely associated with the Everglades. They struggled to maintain privacy while serving as tourist attractions. They earned money by wrestling alligators and selling craftworks. As of 2008, the Seminole Tribe of Florida had five reservations, and the lands of the Miccosukee Tribe <b>of</b> <b>Indians</b> were collectively considered a sixth reservation. The two tribes have each developed casino gaming on some of their properties to generate revenue for support, services and economic development.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Americans arrived at Île-aux-Noix, Fort St. Jean was defended by about 750 men {{under the command of}} Major Charles Preston. The {{majority}} of these were regular troops from the 7th and 26th Regiments of Foot and the Royal Artillery. There were 90 locally raised militia, and 20 members of Colonel Allen Maclean's Royal Highland Emigrants, men who were veterans of the French and Indian War. A detachment <b>of</b> <b>Indians</b> (probably Caughnawaga from a nearby village) patrolled outside the fort under the direction of Claude de Lorimier and Gilbert Tice. The Richelieu River was patrolled by an armed schooner, , under the command of Lieutenant William Hunter, with other boats under construction.|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican War of Independence from 18101821, Texas {{experienced}} much turmoil. Governor Manuel María de Salcedo {{was overthrown}} by rebels in 1810, but persuaded his jailer to release him and assist him in organizing a counter-coup. Three years later, the Republican Army of the North, consisting primarily <b>of</b> <b>Indians</b> and Americans, again overthrew the Texas government and executed Salcedo. The Spanish response was brutal, and by 1820 fewer than 2000 Hispanic citizens remained in Texas. Spain {{was forced to}} relinquish its control of New Spain in 1821, with Texas becoming a province of the newly formed nation of Mexico, leading to the period in Texas history known as Mexican Texas.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after taking}} over, Srinivasa Sastri {{successfully}} pressurized the South African government to withdraw Section 5 of the Immigration and Indian Relief (Further Provision) Bill which empowered South African immigration officers and boards to cancel registration certificates. Through his efforts, the Natal Commission for Indian Education was appointed on 17 November 1927. With Sastri's support and encouragement, dissidents of the Transvaal British Indian Association (TBIA) founded the Transvaal Indian Congress (TIC) on 18 December 1927. The TBIA later {{merged with the}} South African Indian Congress. Section 104 of the Liquor Bill prohibiting Indians from entering licensed premises was withdrawn. The Thornton Committee was established in 1928 to investigate the sanitary conditions <b>of</b> <b>Indians</b> in and around Durban.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of St. Louis (San Luis in Spanish), {{also known}} as the Battle of Fort San Carlos, was an {{unsuccessful}} attack led by the British on St. Louis (a French settlement in Spanish Louisiana, founded on the West Bank of the Mississippi River after the 1763 Treaty of Paris) on May 26, 1780, during the Anglo-Spanish War. A former British militia commander led a force primarily <b>of</b> <b>Indians</b> and attacked the settlement. Fernando de Leyba, the Lieutenant Governor of Spanish Louisiana, led the local militia to fortify the town as best as they could and successfully withstood the attack.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe <b>of</b> <b>Indians</b> v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
