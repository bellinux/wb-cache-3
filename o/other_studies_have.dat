5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes.

In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus fruit {{bodies are}} {{sometimes}} infested with larvae, though {{not nearly as}} often as S.granulatus or B.edulis. Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare {{late in the season}} with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70–95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were the flies Mycetophila fungorum, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica. In contrast, <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of oxalic acid at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species Folsomia candida.|$|E

5|$|The bobcat prey base {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat {{is likely to have}} prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of prices in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. <b>Other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. <b>Other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, {{the third}} species, P. cyrtocristatus was named by John Ostrom. Its three known specimens, {{have been found}} in the Fruitland and Kaiparowits {{formations}} from Utah and New Mexico. The second specimen, the first known from the Kaiparowits Formation, was originally unassigned to a specific taxon. Of the Parasaurolophus species, P. cyrtocristatus it is the smallest, and has the most curved crest. Because of its possession of the two above features, it has often been speculated that it was a female of P. walkeri or P. tubicen, which were males, although P. tubicen lived approximately a million years later. As noted by Thomas Williamson, the type material of P. cyrtocristatus is about 72% the size of P. tubicen, close to the size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive sexual dimorphism in their crests (~70% of adult size). Even though many scientists have supported the possible fact of P. cyrtocristatus being a female, many <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found that it is not, because of the differences in age, distribution, and the large differences in the crest and its internal structure.|$|E
5|$|Japan has full {{religious}} freedom based on Article 20 of its Constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 {{percent of the}} Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-shūgō. However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather {{than the number of}} true believers. The number of Shinto shrines in Japan is estimated to be around 100,000. <b>Other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. According to Edwin Reischauer and Marius Jansen, some 70–80% of the Japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs. Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry.

Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead.

5|$|On 13 December 1920, Betelgeuse {{became the}} first star outside the Solar System to have the angular size of its {{photosphere}} measured. Although interferometry was still in its infancy, the experiment proved a success. The researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that Betelgeuse had a diameter of 0.047arcseconds, although the stellar disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0.055". Since then, <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> produced angular diameters that range from 0.042 to 0.069arcseconds. Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815ly yields a projected radius of the stellar disk of anywhere from 1.2 to 8.9AU. Using the Solar System for comparison, the orbit of Mars is about 1.5AU, Ceres in the asteroid belt 2.7AU, Jupiter 5.5AU—so, assuming Betelgeuse occupying {{the place of the}} Sun, its photosphere might extend beyond the Jovian orbit, not quite reaching Saturn at 9.5AU.|$|E
5|$|The Indian and Javan rhinoceros, {{the only}} {{members of the}} genus Rhinoceros, first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million–3.3 million years ago.

Although {{belonging}} to the type genus, the Indian and Javan rhinoceroses are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species. Different studies have hypothesized {{that they may be}} closely related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium. A detailed cladistic analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed Rhinoceros and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus, the Sumatran rhino. <b>Other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> suggested the Sumatran rhinoceros is more closely related to the two African species.

5|$|Traditionally, three {{distinct}} subspecies have been recognised: the Queensland koala (P.c. adustus, Thomas 1923), the New South Wales koala (P.c.cinereus, Goldfuss 1817), and the Victorian koala (P.c.victor, Troughton 1935). These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland koala {{is the smallest}} of the three, with shorter, silver fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull. The boundaries of these variations are based on state borders, and their status as subspecies is disputed. A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited gene flow between them, and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant unit. <b>Other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found that koala populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic variation. Such low genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of koala populations since the late Pleistocene. Rivers and roads have been shown to limit gene flow and contribute to the genetic differentiation of southeast Queensland populations. In April 2013, scientists from the Australian Museum and Queensland University of Technology announced they had fully sequenced the koala genome.|$|E
