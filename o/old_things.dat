25|$|Then Åke {{talked to}} the Swedish king, {{who was in a}} bad mood. Åke gave him {{valuable}} gifts and followed the king on the road until they came to the woods. Erik asked Åke why he, who was his man, had made such a difference between him and the Norwegian king. Åke answered that there was nothing to blame Erik for but that he had got the <b>old</b> <b>things</b> and the old hall because he was old whereas the Norwegian king was in the bloom of his youth. Åke also answered that he was no less the Swedish king's man than the Swedish king was his man. Hearing the words of treason, Erik had no other choice but to slay the impudent and treacherous Åke.|$|E
500|$|The {{lifetime}} of British writer, philosopher, and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (17591797) encompassed {{most of the}} second half of the eighteenth century, a time of great political and social upheaval throughout Europe and America: political reform movements in Britain gained strength, the American colonists successfully rebelled, and the French revolution erupted. Wollstonecraft experienced only the headiest of these days, not living to see the end of the democratic revolution when Napoleon crowned himself emperor. Although Britain was still revelling in its mid-century imperial conquests and its triumph in the Seven Years' War, it was the French revolution that defined Wollstonecraft's generation. As poet Robert Southey later wrote: [...] "few persons but those who have lived in it can conceive or comprehend what the memory of the French Revolution was, nor what a visionary world seemed to open upon those who were just entering it. <b>Old</b> <b>things</b> seemed passing away, and nothing was dreamt of but the regeneration of the human race." ...|$|E

500|$|Seth navigates {{the city}} on foot—cars, bicycles, and public {{transportation}} rarely even appear–as he talks with friends or rifles through used book shops. [...] For literary theorist Barbara Postema, the character fits the archetype of Walter Benjamin's flâneur—the wandering urban pedestrian {{out of touch with}} his own time and obsessed with the past. [...] Seth pines for a past not his own and obsessively collects consumer items from earlier in the 20th century. [...] His focus is primarily on the period from the 1930s to the 1950s, a time he feels particularly [...] "Canadian". [...] He goes as far as to wear an old-fashioned overcoat and broad-rimmed hat, for which passing teenagers taunt him, saying he looks like Clark Kent or Dick Tracy. [...] He declares to Chester: [...] "I do think life was simpler then... easier for people to find personal happiness." [...] Brown disagrees, saying, [...] "I think it's always been difficult for people to be happy." [...] Seth dreads the future and allows his memories of childhood to dominate his thoughts, but recognizes and criticizes his own obsessions: [...] "There's something in the decay of <b>old</b> <b>things</b> that provokes an evocative sadness for the vanished past. [...] If those buildings were perfectly preserved it wouldn't be the same." [...] Despite this consciousness, he continues to pursue his collecting.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1958 Comecon {{had begun}} to push for what was later termed an [...] "international socialist {{division}} of labor," [...] in which Albania was relegated to [...] "the task of supplying the member states with agricultural and mineral raw materials." [...] In May 1959 Khrushchev {{paid a visit to}} Albania with the aim of pressuring Albania's leadership into building up Yugoslav–Albanian and Soviet–Albanian ties and also to, in the words of historian Miranda Vickers, [...] "focus their economy on the growing of citrus fruits rather than concentrate on industrialization and the expansion of their oil industry... Khrushchev's visit was clouded by an atmosphere of mistrust, which culminated in a hurried departure two days earlier than scheduled." [...] According to Hoxha, Khrushchev displayed contempt for Albanian archaeology in Butrint and said to Rodion Malinovsky, the Soviet Defense Minister who was visiting the country with him, [...] "Look, how marvelous this is! An ideal base for our submarines could be built here. These <b>old</b> <b>things</b> [...] should be dug up and thrown into the sea... We shall have the most ideal and most secure base in the Mediterranean. From here we can paralyze and attack everything." [...] He was also said to have remarked to Hoxha to turn his country [...] "into a flourishing garden," [...] suggested he make it an attractive holiday spot for Soviet tourists, and that rather than produce grain, Albania should focus on growing oranges for export. Khrushchev allegedly said, [...] "The Soviet Union has such an abundance of grain that the mice eat more than you can produce here." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jon {{also said}} that his new band, Jon Oliva's Pain, is {{basically}} Savatage reincarnated, so it could co-exist with the more successful Trans-Siberian Orchestra. He did however state that a one-off anniversary tour featuring Skolnick, Wacholz and other past Savatage members is being planned with Paul O'Neill as a final send off to the band. Zachary Stevens {{has made it clear}} that he will participate in a 25th anniversary festivities with the band. Jon Oliva then said about the band [...] "Well, it's over but it's not over, you know what I mean? It's over right now because no one's doing anything. We haven't disbanded or anything. We have plans to do something in the future." [...] Jon also announced that he is doing [...] "some video compilation stuff, and editing <b>old</b> <b>things</b> for a bonus DVD to go with it, that has a ton of live Criss stuff in concert, a lot of backstage frolicking about, and going to castles in Europe".|$|E
2500|$|Śrīmaithilyavataraṇam (Sanskrit: श्रीमैथिल्यवतरणम्). When {{the four}} sons of Daśaratha enter their sixth year, their Upanayana {{ceremony}} is performed. In {{the kingdom of}} Mithilā, the king Sīradhvaja Janaka, a disciple of the seer Yājñavalkya, rules his kingdom as a Yogī. While performing the Somayajña sacrifice in Puṇyāraṇya with his wife Sunayanā, Janaka tills the land using a plough of gold on the ninth day of the bright half of the Vaiśākha month (Sītānavamī). Suddenly, the earth cracks open, and Sītā manifests from the earth as a sixteen-year-old, seated on a golden throne and being served by her eight companions. An Ākāśavāṇī (celestial announcement) declares Sītā to be the daughter of Janaka. Nārada arrives in Mithilā and eulogizes Sītā in 16 verses (12.45–12.60). Then Nārada requests Sītā to assume {{the form of an}} infant. The infant Sītā is taken by Janaka and Sunayanā to their palace and raised as their daughter. Once the child Sītā goes to {{the eastern part of the}} capital of Janaka. She asks Janaka about a bow that is being worshipped. Janaka tells her it is Pināka, the bow of Śiva, which was given by Śiva himself to his ancestor Devarāta. Sītā tells Janaka that <b>old</b> <b>things</b> should not be worshipped but thrown away, and starts dragging the onerous bow again and again, making it as her play-horse. On Janaka's request, [...] Sītā puts the bow, which could not be lifted by any human or divine being, back in its place. Paraśurāma sees this in his Samādhi on Mahendra mountain and then leaves for Mithilā, wishing to have a sight of the young Sītā.|$|E
