The economically efficient option would, however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries.

The scenario and world design incorporated Norse mythology, the works of William Shakespeare, fairy tales and early video games. 2D graphics were chosen over 3D graphics as Kamitani felt the style was stagnating, which necessitated presenting cutscenes as if on a stage rather than using traditional cinematography.

The review places the book within the context <b>of</b> <b>addressing</b> legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts {{to come to a}} resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E

The study also correlates the choice <b>of</b> <b>address</b> forms in Palestinian Arabic with social variables including interlocutors’ relationship, formality of context and participants’ social characteristics of age, gender, education, occupation, spoken dialect, etc. The hypothesis is that variations in the forms <b>of</b> <b>address</b> are correlated with age, sex, educational and occupational rank of the interlocutors as well as the setting, intimacy and social distance. With naturally-occurring examples <b>of</b> <b>address</b> forms gathered by 8 fieldworkers in the research site of Gaza, it was found that that the choices interlocutors make are dictated by the perceived social relationship that exists between them with kinship and degree of acquaintanceship being very significant. Examination of the data also reveals that interlocutors’ social characteristics of age, gender, occupation, education, etc. are also highly significant in the choice <b>of</b> <b>address</b> forms. For example, people who share the same gender, age, or occupational and educational rank show what Brown & Gilman (1960) referred to as reciprocal use <b>of</b> <b>address</b> terms while persons who differ in any of these categories tend to use forms <b>of</b> <b>address</b> non-reciprocally. These variations in address behavior among Palestinian speakers are discussed and explained based on the social functions <b>of</b> <b>address</b> forms and the cultural norms of the Palestinian community.
