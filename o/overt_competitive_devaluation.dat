40|$|This {{study shows}} that the {{learning}} by doing (LBD) effect has substantial, both quantitative and qualitative, consequences for the international transmission of monetary policy. LDB implies that a country can increase its productivity-increasing skill level, {{at the expense of the}} neighbour, by <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> engineered through low interest rates. If measured by the cumulative change in output after 12 quarters, LBD increases the harmful effect of <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> on foreign output by 85 Ð 125 %, when compared to the case without it. If LBD is sufficiently strong and the cross-country substitutability is high (low), it reverses the effect of monetary policy on foreign (domestic) welfare into negative (positive). Moreover, a combination of a high crosscountry substitutability and a sufficiently strong LDB effect implies that <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> increases both domestic output and welfare, at the expense of foreign output and welfare.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{economic}} context, <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> has become a common practice both in emerging and developed economies. But, despite their relatively recent popularity, the economic advantages of <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluations</b> are only illusory, since these involve huge long-term costs even for the states that resort to such policies. The main purpose of our research is to reveal {{the economic and political}} consequences of currency devaluations and to critically assess the protectionist thesis that a country needs to maintain a balanced trade with all its commercial partners. The research also contains a brief analysis of <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> policies applied by China.

5000|$|<b>Competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> is also {{associated}} with financial contagion. <b>Competitive</b> <b>devaluation,</b> which {{is also known as}} a currency war, is when multiple countries compete against one another to gain a competitive advantage by having low exchange rates for their currency. [...] "Devaluation in a country hit by a crisis reduces the export competitiveness of the countries with which it competes in third markets, putting pressure on the currencies of other countries; especially when those currencies do not float freely." [...] This action causes countries to act irrationally due to fear and doubt. [...] "If market participants expect that a currency crisis will lead to a game of <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation,</b> they will naturally sell their holdings of securities of other countries, curtail their lending, or refuse to roll over short-term loans to borrowers in those countries." ...|$|R

Contrary to the ambiguous results of strategic trade policy for markets with a fixed number of firms, {{it is always}} optimal to subsidize exports as long as entry is endogenous, under both competition in quantities and in prices. With homogenous goods the optimal export subsidy is a fraction 1 /€ of the price, where € is the elasticity of demand, {{the exact opposite of}} the optimal export tax in the neoclassical trade theory.

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} is an S-Curve in Colombia using {{bilateral}} and disaggregated quarterly data for the period 1991 - 2014. More precisely, the short-run effects of a depreciation on the TB are analysed in 27 industries covered by the PAG Free Trade Agreement. The S-Curve found in sectors representing 30 % of total industrial production suggests that in these cases <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluations</b> {{have a positive effect on}} the TB in the short run. However, the regression analysis using both OLS and FE methods shows that sizable ones are needed to produce the desired effects on trade flows. Our findings have important policy implications: since only large <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluations</b> can restore TB equilibrium, industrial restructuring would appear to be a more sensible strategy, though this cannot be achieved in the short run and is instead a medium/long-term goal...|$|R

500|$|States {{engaging}} in possible <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> since 2010 {{have used a}} mix of policy tools, including direct government intervention, the imposition of capital controls, and, indirectly, quantitative easing. While many countries experienced undesirable upward pressure on their exchange rates and {{took part in the}} ongoing arguments, the most notable dimension of the 2010–11 episode was the rhetorical conflict between the United States and China over the valuation of the yuan. In January 2013, measures announced by Japan which were expected to devalue its currency sparked concern of a possible second 21st century currency war breaking out, this time with the principal source of tension being not China versus the US, but Japan versus the Eurozone. By late February, concerns of a new outbreak of currency war had been mostly allayed, after [...] the G7 and G20 issued statements committing to avoid <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation.</b> After the European Central Bank launched a fresh programme of quantitative easing in January 2015, there was once again an intensification of discussion about currency war.|$|R
