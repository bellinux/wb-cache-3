40|$|Abstract Bivalve {{culture is}} of {{considerable}} {{economic and social}} interest in northeastern (NE) Brazil. The polyculture is an alternative approach to traditional monoculture for reducing {{the environmental impact of}} shrimp farming and improving oyster culture. Perkinsus marinus andPerkinsus olseni were found infecting oysters in NE Brazil and can threaten oyster production. This study evaluatedPerkinsus spp. occurrence in Crassostrea gasar during all production stages. <b>Oyster</b> <b>spats</b> were produced in a hatchery and grown in shrimp ponds in Rio Grande do Norte state. Perkinsus spp. were surveyed by Ray’s fluid thioglycollate medium and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence and intensity of infection were determined in oysters until they reached 7 cm. Results showed that the broodstock was already infected by Perkinsus (60 %), but the derived <b>spats</b> were Perkinsus-free. <b>Oyster</b> <b>spats</b> acquired Perkinsus infection when transferred to ponds. The prevalence gradually increased in the seven months following placement in ponds (73 %), and then decreased to 17 % by the tenth month. The infections were initially mild, but intensity increased at the final growth stage. In conclusion, it is possible to produce Perkinsus-free C. gasar <b>oyster</b> <b>spats</b> from infected broodstock, and their culture in shrimp ponds is feasible...|$|R

Alexandrium catenella, a paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) producer, is now regularly found in Thau lagoon (south of France) at concentrations up to 15 x 106 cellules. l- 1. In the same periods, events of oyster’s mortality are also observed causing huge economic losses. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the relationship between these toxic events and mortality phenomenon. For that, we conducted a field work to evaluate the presence of the toxic A. catenella in Thau lagoon during the years 2013 and 2014 in which high mortality of <b>oysters</b> <b>spats</b> were observed in spring. At the same time, we experimentally infected spats with the pathogenic bacterium V. tasmaniensis LGP 32 and kept them unfed or previously fed either with the toxic alga A. catenella or with nontoxic algae, Alexandrium tamarense or Tisochrysis lutea. Results showed that the toxic alga was present in the lagoon when spats' mortalities occurred suggesting A. catenella could be involved in these events. Moreover, our laboratory experiment showed that the exposure to A. catenella increases the susceptibility of spats to one of its pathogens, V. tasmaniensis LGP 32.

50|$|Most of {{the global}} Pacific <b>oyster</b> <b>spat</b> supply comes from the wild, but some is now {{produced}} by hatchery methods. The seed from the wild can either be collected by the removal of seaweed from beaches or by hanging shell (cultch in suspension from long lines in the open water. The movement towards hatchery-reared spat is important, as wild seed is susceptible to changeable environmental conditions, such as toxic algal blooms, which can halt the supply of seed from that region. In addition, several pests have been noted as considerable dangers to oyster seed. The Japanese oyster drill (Ocenebra japonica), flatworm (Pseudostylochus osterophagus), and parasitic copepod (Mytlilcola orientalis) have been introduced accidentally to aquaculture areas, and have had serious impacts on oyster production, particularly in British Columbia and Europe.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is {{the main}} oyster species {{produced}} in the world, and a key coastal economic resource in France. High mortalities affect Pacific oysters since 2008 in France and Europe. Their origins {{have been attributed to}} a combination of biotic and abiotic factors, underlining the importance of environment quality. The impact of water pollution has been pointed out and one of the pollutants, the genotoxic herbicide diuron, occurs at high concentrations all along the French coasts. Previous work has revealed that a parental exposure to diuron had a strong impact on hatching rates and offspring development even if spats were not exposed to diuron themselves. In this study, we explored {{for the first time the}} transcriptional changes occurring in <b>oyster</b> <b>spats</b> (non exposed) originating from genitors exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of diuron during gametogenesis using the RNAseq methodology. We identified a transcriptomic remodeling revealing an effect of the herbicide. Different molecular pathways involved in energy production, translation and cell proliferation are particularly disturbed. This analysis revealed modulated candidate genes putatively involved in response to oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in offspring of genitors exposed to diuron. Complementary measures of the activity of enzymes involved in these latter processes corroborate the results obtained at the transcriptomic level. In addition, our results suggested an increase in energy production and mitotic activity in 5 -month-spats from diuron-exposed genitors. These results could correspond to a “catch-up growth” phenomenon allowing the spats from diuron-exposed genitors, which displayed a growth delay at 3 months, to gain a normal size when they reach the age of 6 months. These results indicate that exposure to a concentration of diuron that is frequently encountered in the field during the oyster’s gametogenesis stage can impact the next generation and may result in fitness disturbance...|$|R

It was first recorded in the eastern Pacific Ocean in San Francisco Bay, California, in the 1940s, in Willapa Bay, Washington State in 1967, and in Humboldt Bay, California, in 1989.

40|$|Pacific <b>oysters</b> <b>spat</b> (Crassostrea gigas) {{were fed}} an algal diet (Tetraselmis suecica) {{whether or not}} {{supplemented}} with emulsions or liposomes rich in 18 : 1 n - 9, 18 : 2 n - 6 and 22 : 6 n - 3. The preferential accumulation and partitioning of the latter fatty acids between the polar and neutral lipids of C. gigas spat were followed. Additionally, the efficiency of emulsions and liposomes as fatty acid carriers for C. gigas spat were compared. The incorporation of dietary fatty acids was found to vary substantially according to the fatty acid carrier (emulsions vs. liposomes), the particular fatty acid (18 : 1 n - 9, 18 : 2 n - 6 or 22 : 6 n - 3), and the lipid fraction (neutral vs. polar lipids). A comparison of the percentage (% of the total fatty acids) and absolute concentration (mg g - 1 dry weight) of 18 : 1 n - 9, 18 : 2 n - 6 and 22 : 6 n - 3 in the total lipids of C. gigas fed solely T. suecica or lipid-supplemented diets, suggest the following order of preferential accumulation: 22 : 6 n - 3 > 18 : 1 n - 9 > 18 : 2 n - 6. Unlike 22 : 6 n - 3 which was accumulated in both the neutral and polar lipid fraction of C. gigas, 18 : 2 n - 6 and 18 : 1 n - 9 were mainly deposited in the neutral lipids. High dietary supplies of n - 6 and/or n - 3 PUFA seriously altered the n - 3 / n - 6 PUFA ratio in the neutral as well as polar lipids of spat. The fatty acid profile of emulsion-fed spat indicated a rather limited ability to elongate 18 : 2 n - 6 to 20 : 2 n - 6 whereas no clear evidence for desaturation to 20 : 4 n - 6 was observed. Irrespective of the diet, nonmethylene-interrupted-dienes and plasmalogens (detected as dimethylacetals) were abundant and located nearly exclusively in the polar lipids. The ash free dry weight (AFDW) of emulsion-fed spat {{was significantly higher than}} the AFDW of liposomes-fed spat which was in turn significantly higher than the AFDW of oysters fed solely algae.
