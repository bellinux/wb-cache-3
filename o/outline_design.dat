Cardiff Council granted planning permission for the building on 8 November 1999 and by 26 January 2000 the National Assembly voted in favour of progressing the project onto the next stage.|$|E
5|$|No battlecruisers {{were ordered}} after the three Invincible-class ships in 1905 until Indefatigable became the lone battlecruiser of the 1908–09 Naval Programme. A new Liberal Government had taken power in January 1906 and demanded {{reductions}} in naval spending, and the Admiralty submitted a reduced programme, requesting dreadnoughts but no battlecruisers. The Cabinet rejected this proposal {{in favour of}} two outmoded armoured cruisers but finally acceded to a request for one battlecruiser instead, after the Admiralty pointed out the need to match the recently published German naval construction plan and to maintain the heavy gun and armour industries. Indefatigables <b>outline</b> <b>design</b> was prepared in March 1908, and the final design, slightly larger than Invincible with a revised protection arrangement, was approved in November 1908. A larger design with more armour and better underwater protection was rejected as too expensive. Note; plan is of Invincible-class battlecruisers; the Indefatigable-class has a third superstructure element with 'P' & 'Q' turrets more widely spaced.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{having only}} an <b>outline</b> <b>design,</b> the {{designers}} RMJM/EMBT (Scotland) Ltd stated without foundation {{that the building}} could be completed within a £50m budget. [...] Nevertheless, these estimates were believed by officials. The two architectural practices in the RMJM and EMBT joint venture operated dysfunctionally and failed to communicate effectively {{with each other and}} the project manager. [...] The death of Miralles also gave rise to a substantial period of disharmony. The Brief emphasised the importance of design and quality over cost, and was not updated despite considerable evolution of the design. Ministers were not informed of grave concerns within the Scottish Office over the cost of the project and officials failed to take the advice of the cost consultants.|$|E
500|$|After Admiral Fisher was {{appointed}} First Sea Lord on 21 October 1904, he {{pushed through the}} Board of Admiralty in early December 1904 a decision to arm the next armoured cruiser with [...] guns {{and that it would}} have a speed no less than [...] Shortly afterwards he convened a [...] "Committee on Designs" [...] to investigate and report on requirements for future ships. While nominally independent, it served to validate decisions already made and to deflect criticism off Fisher and the Board of Admiralty, as it had no ability to consider options other than those already decided upon by the Admiralty. Fisher appointed all {{of the members of the}} Committee and himself as President of the Committee. During its last meeting on the 22 of February 1905 it decided on the <b>outline</b> <b>design</b> of the fast armoured cruiser. This, in turn, was approved by the Board on March the 16th with only minor changes, such as the reduction in the anti-torpedo boat armament from twenty to eighteen 12-pdr guns.|$|E
500|$|The Director of Naval Construction began {{preliminary}} design work {{even before the}} ship was purchased and submitted an <b>outline</b> <b>design</b> on 8February 1918. This design had a full-length flight deck and its most distinctive features were the two islands separated by the flight deck. Each island was to be [...] long, containing two funnels and a tripod mast. Although they were staggered {{to make it more}} difficult for an enemy ship to estimate the ship's course, they were to be connected to each other with heavy bracing. The bridge was to be mounted on top of this bracing which left a clear height of [...] for the aircraft on the flight deck. There was to be a [...] wide space between the islands where the aircraft were to be assembled before taking off. Aircraft would be transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators). A crane was to be located at the aft end of each island to lift aircraft aboard and to recover seaplanes. Bulk petrol storage consisted of [...] in [...] tins stowed on the forecastle deck and protected by [...] plating. Two ready-use tanks near the islands would allow aircraft on the flight deck to refuel. The ship's planned armament consisted of nine 6-inch guns and four [...] anti-aircraft guns mounted on the platform between the islands. Eagle retained the battleship's mixture of coal and fuel oil, but the quantities were increased to [...] of coal and [...] of oil, as the forward and rear 14-inch magazines and shell rooms were converted to be used as oil tanks.|$|E
