5|$|Playford {{retired from}} Parliament with a pension of $72 a week; he had {{resisted}} giving higher pensions to Ministers or longer-serving MPs throughout his tenure. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> {{thought of the}} Playmander, Playford was held in high regard for his integrity; during his premiership, there were no complaints of corruption or government largesse. Playford also prohibited his ministers from sitting {{on the board of}} directors of public companies or owning shares, lest they became conflicted in their decision-making. He returned to his orchard at Norton Summit, and took a continued interest in South Australian politics, but did not typically raise his opinions publicly; he was still consulted in private by Liberals up until his death, however. His closeness to Labor figures did not end either, offering advice to their new South Australian ministers, and assisting in a memorial to the former Labor Prime Minister John Curtin. In line with his reputation for promoting his state, Playford also privately lobbied the Liberal government in Canberra on behalf of the state Labor administration for more infrastructure funding. In 1977, when Don Dunstan celebrated his 50th birthday party, Playford was the only Liberal invited. There he socialised with former and future Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke, Dunstan, and other Laborites.|$|E

He astounded the climbing community by putting up a number of bold new free climbing routes on the Chief which, at the time, pushed the limits <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> thought was possible. More recently, Brad Zdanivsky became the first quadriplegic ever to reach the summit on 31 July 2005. In the summer of 2006, Sonnie Trotter established what was at the time considered to be the hardest traditionally protected single rock pitch in North America, and possibly the world: Cobra Crack (5.14).|$|E

500|$|With a $15 million budget, {{production}} {{began on}} February 23, 2009 in Atlanta, Georgia. Zombie acknowledged that filming in Georgia provided certain {{tax breaks for}} the company, but the real reason he chose that location was because the other locations {{he was planning to}} use were still experiencing snowy weather. For him, Georgia's landscapes and locations provided the look that he wanted for his film. During production, Zombie described the sequel as being [...] "Ultra gritty, ultra intense and very real" [...] and said {{that he was trying to}} create almost the exact opposite <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> would expect. Known for filming multiple sequences during production of his films, Zombie filmed an alternate ending to Halloween II. In the alternate ending, Loomis and Michael crash through the shed the police have surrounded, and out into the open air. As Loomis grasps at Michael's mask, and pleads for him to stop, Michael stabs him in the stomach, telling him to [...] "Die!".|$|E
500|$|Timberlake did a joint tour in North America with Christina Aguilera {{entitled}} the Justified and Stripped Tour, to support both Justified and Aguilera's 2002 album, Stripped. Timberlake's and Aguilera's managers suggested to both singers {{to go on}} a conjoint tour. Timberlake agreed with the suggestion, saying that [...] "It would be fun to be on tour with somebody who's that talented". Timberlake's further reasoning for touring with Aguilera was due to both singers wanting to [...] "break the mold <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> look at as teen pop and move into a different direction". For the tour, Timberlake wanted to transform arenas into clubs, stating that he wants people [...] "to feel like they're a part of the show and it's a party", remarking that anybody caught sitting down would get booted. For the tour, Timberlake performed with eight dancers, a 14-piece band which included four backup singers, three horn players and a DJ. The tour commenced on June 4, 2003 in Phoenix, Arizona and concluded on September 2, 2003 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The tour grossed approximately $45 million.|$|E

500|$|After Rowan County clerk Kim Davis defied Judge David L. Bunning's {{order to}} issue {{marriage}} licenses to same-sex couples, Bevin commended her [...] "willingness {{to stand for}} her First Amendment rights". Davis was confined to the Carter County jail for six days on contempt of court charges for refusing to comply with Bunning's order. On September 8, 2015, Bevin met with Davis in the jail and later attended a rally organized by Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee celebrating her subsequent release. Following a September debate at Bellarmine University, Bevin said, [...] "My intention {{has always been to}} execute this race on financial issues, on economic issues.

[...] Associated Press reporter Adam Beam wrote that the Davis case [...] "ignited the passions of religious conservatives in an already conservative state", and University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss opined that a campaign focused on cultural and social issues would be [...] "bad for Conway".|$|E
500|$|The group {{wrote and}} {{performed}} children's music {{that was different}} from {{what had been done}} previously; as Cook stated, [...] "we didn't just go down the route <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> think is kids' music". [...] They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook {{was one of the first}} guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. [...] Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, [...] "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. I think it would be really nice if in 15years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [...] Wiggles". [...] In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band [...] "they got into".|$|E
500|$|Richard's death {{encouraged}} the furtherance of this later negative image by his Tudor successors {{due to the}} fact that it helped to legitimise Henry VII's seizure of the throne. The Richard III Society contends that this means that 'a lot <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> thought they knew about Richard III was pretty much propaganda and myth building.' The Tudor characterisation culminated in the famous fictional portrayal of him in Shakespeare's play Richard III as a physically deformed Machiavellian villain, albeit courageous and witty, cheerfully committing numerous murders in order to claw his way to power; Shakespeare's intention perhaps being to use Richard III as a vehicle for creating his own Marlowesque protagonist. [...] Rous himself, in his History of the Kings of England, written during Henry VII's reign, initiated the process. He reversed his earlier position, and now portrayed Richard as a freakish individual who was born with teeth and shoulder-length hair after having been in his mother's womb for two years. His body was stunted and distorted, with one shoulder higher than the other, and he was [...] "slight in body and weak in strength". Rous also attributes the murder of Henry VI to Richard, and claims that he poisoned his own wife. Jeremy Potter, a former Chair of the Richard III Society, claims that 'At the bar of history Richard III continues to be guilty because it is impossible to prove him innocent. The Tudors ride high in popular esteem.' ...|$|E
