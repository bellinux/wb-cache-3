5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{did not make}} {{landfall}} in the Philippines, its close proximity brought several days of heavy rain to Luzon, leading to widespread flash floods and mudslides. Landslides across the region isolated many cities, including Baguio. Rivers began exceeding their banks on September10 and flooded surrounding areas. In the province of Ilocos Sur, ten {{people were killed in}} a single town after flood waters swept away many homes <b>overnight.</b> <b>In</b> many areas, waters were waist-deep and officials advised residents in low-lying areas to move to higher ground. Tropical storm force winds, recorded up to 88km/h (55mph) at the John Hay Air Base, also impacted the country. In Zambales Province, a tornado spawned by the typhoon injured three people and caused approximately $90,000 worth of damage. Another tornado struck the Clark Air Base, uprooting trees and damaging buildings. Losses from this tornado reached $150,000.|$|E

Panta bhat (rice soaked <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E

The first 500 set off at dusk on 11 November, led by a Colonel Figueroa and guided by Simón Susarte. They {{made it to the top}} of the Rock, reaching its southernmost peak near where O'Hara's Battery stands today, and descended part-way down the west side where they sheltered <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> St. Michael's Cave. At daybreak they climbed the Philip II Wall, which extends up the west side of the Rock, and killed the English sentries in the lookout point at Middle Hill. A drummer boy bringing food to the lookout saw the invaders and raised the alarm.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{controversy}} {{between the}} local organisation Galleri Texas and the state-owned corporation Follo Futura arose, regarding the hiring contract {{of the station}} building, and which of them were to operate the cultural meeting place. Follo Futura, which together with the Norwegian National Rail Administration and Rom Eiendom officially owned the station building wanted {{to take over the}} café business. They argued that they were better fit to operate it, since Galleri Texas did not have the economical capacity to run the café with the art exhibition and gift shop the whole week. The local community wanted Galleri Texas to operate the café, arguing that replacing a local company for a governmental one would weaken the local and patriotic spirit of the café. On 1 January 2010, the operation of the café and the cultural meeting place was transferred from Galleri Texas to Follo Futura, since Galleri Texas no longer could pay the rental costs. In 2010, smoke was tumbling out of the station, but it turned out that it was only a cigarette that had not been quenched, and had been laying <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> a flower basket.|$|E

5|$|The band's {{popularity}} {{continued to}} grow over the coming years. As the younger band members completed their high school studies, they performed frequent concerts in Antananarivo, staying <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> the student dorms with Raoul and Nono. Fafa moved to Antananarivo the shortly afterward {{to live with his}} parents, and the band often gathered at his family's home, where they composed many of their early songs. As each of the younger boys passed their baccalaureat, they moved to Antananarivo to continue their studies at the university, which they paid through a combination of state subsidies and the profits from their concerts. Political party representatives often approached band members to request them to become official supporters and party members, but the band preferred to remain politically independent.Another young and emerging group, Lolo sy ny Tariny, was recruited by the political party MFM, who attempted to pit the two groups against each other. Although there were occasional arguments between Bekoto and members of Lolo sy ny Tariny that garnered publicity, the band remained largely above political disputes.|$|E
5|$|The torch {{lighting}} ceremony {{took place}} on 17 July 1948 in Olympia, Greece. As with the 1936 Summer Olympic relay, the torch relay was begun by focusing the sun's rays onto kindling using a parabolic reflector, which then lit the first torch. The kindling was conducted by a Girl Guide leader from Pyrgos, Elis. She was only chosen the previous evening due to the unsettled state of the country; the Athenian girl who was trained for the ceremony was unable to travel to Olympia. In a symbolic gesture, the first runner, Corporal Dimitrelis of the Greek Army, laid down his arms and removed his military uniform before taking his torch in hand. The kindling material for the first torch was handed over as {{a gift from the}} Chairman of the Greek Olympic Committee to Collins, for Princess Elizabeth. It was then run to the Greek coast at Katakolo, where at 7pm it boarded the Greek destroyer Hastings bound for the island of Corfu. It stayed <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> the city of Corfu, and boarded HMS Whitesand Bay at 1:30pm the following day where the flame was switched to a specially equipped butane gas torch {{in order to ensure that}} there was a 48-hour lifespan available for the flame, despite the crossing only being expected to take 22 hours.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions {{were scheduled to}} be held before the Sunday race: two on Thursday and one on Friday. The first session was due to run for 105 minutes, and {{the second and third}} sessions were scheduled to last 90 minutes. Heavy rain on the days before the event resulted in the local clay absorbing a large amount of water. Only a small amount of evaporation had occurred due to low air temperatures. Race officials examined water that emerged through the track's surface in several areas on Thursday. The track surface had been drilled through <b>overnight</b> <b>in</b> an effort to drain collected water and prevent further seepage. CART's jet dryer was used on the track but, despite creating a dry track surface, water continued to appear through it. CART chief steward Chris Kneifel drove the pace car onto the track at 3:00p.m. British Summer Time (UTC+1) along with all 26 racing vehicles and 23 secondary cars under caution for five installation laps with both groups. No improvement was reported, and CART announced an hour later that the remainder of the day's activities were cancelled.|$|E
