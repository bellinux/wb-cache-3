50|$|Prior to that Kaplan was {{the creator}} and {{executive}} producer of the ABC News magazine, Primetime Live from 1989 to 1994. The program became one of the leading news magazines on television, regularly finishing in the top ten of all programs in his final three years there. The trademark <b>of</b> <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> became investigative journalism with award winning broadcasts focusing on child care, racism in the United States, slavery in the Caribbean, unsanitary and dishonest food handling by the major grocery chain Food Lion and the abuse of patients seeking pap smears and mammograms. Primetime Live also distinguished itself in its on-the-scene live coverage of such landmark news events as the Gulf War, the historic opening of the Berlin Wall, the 1989 San Francisco earthquake and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

50|$|The initial ABC News <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> {{broadcast}} revealed Porter had abused over 100 {{children in}} Massachusetts. Sawyer interviewed 30 adults {{who had been}} raped as elementary school children by Porter. The investigation revealed that instead of removing Porter after parents reported the abuse, the Catholic Church had moved him to a treatment center and then to Bemidji, Minnesota, where he continued to rape dozens <b>of</b> children. <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> interviewed 30 <b>of</b> Porter's victims and their parents, and confronted the priest who had knowingly transferred Porter from Massachusetts to Minnesota. They also contacted Porter himself, who still had contact with children as a Sunday school teacher at his church. The ABC News investigation discovered and interviewed a local babysitter who said she had also been sexually abused by Porter in 1984. After the report aired, {{it was discovered that}} Porter had also molested the babysitter's younger sister, a crime that was within the statute of limitations. This development allowed local Minnesota authorities to finally arrest Porter. Before Porter's arrest, Sawyer and her producer confronted the former priest at a local carnival. Porter initially tried to flee the cameras, and then turned and physically attacked the camera crew. After tackling the camera man, Porter fled on foot.|$|R
