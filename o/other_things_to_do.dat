25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, {{and the system}} is undermined when {{any one of the}} divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that {{there will not be a}} problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E
2500|$|Australia won the First Test by 8 wickets to go 1â€“0 {{up in the}} series, {{the fourth}} win in four Tests for Australia against England at the Woolloongabba. England's scoring rate of 23 runs in every 100 balls (the {{equivalent}} of 1.38 runs per six-ball over) {{was one of the}} worst in Test cricket, Australia made 34 runs off every 100 balls (the equivalent of 2.04 runs per six-ball over). The England manager Freddie Brown wanted to make an official complaint about Meckiff's bowling, but captain Peter May thought that it look like sour grapes. Instead they talked unofficially to the Australian chairman of selectors Sir Donald Bradman who retorted [...] "And what of the action of the England bowlers Tony Lock and Peter Loader?" [...] and that they should [...] "first of all put their own house in order". It was an inauspicious start to the brighter cricket May had promised, which was needed to revive the fortunes of Australian cricket that was being ignored by its youth. [...] "The Future of Australian Cricket at Stake...the average young Australian is inclined to spend most of his weekends under water...and caring for his lady-friend. There are many <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the sunshine than play cricket".|$|E

2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E

40|$|Thesis {{entitled}} Reviews Against Recovery Victim Wrong Arrests Ducted by The Police Investigator. The problem formulation is {{how does}} the recovery of victims wrongful arrest can be done. The type of the research of this thesis is a normative legal research. Recovery can be a victim wrongful arrest materially compensation regulated in Government Regulation No. 92 Year 2015 about the Second Amendment to Government Regulation No. 27 Year 1983 on the Implementation of the Criminal Procedure Code, which amount was determined based on the case provided in Article 77 and 95 Code of Criminal Procedure and <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that result in serious injuries or disabilities <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the work <b>to</b> result in death. The recovery of victims wrongful arrest next was in case rehabilitation. This recovery is provided to victims {{in the form of}} non-material recovery.

The <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is vindication the victims wrongful arrest, and an apology from the police to the victims and their families...|$|R
