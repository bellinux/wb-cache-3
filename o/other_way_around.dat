When he died as king of the combined kingdom in 900, Domnall II (Donald II) was the first man to be called rí Alban (i.e. King of Alba). The term Scotia would be increasingly be used to describe the kingdom between North of the Forth and Clyde and eventually the entire area controlled by its kings would be referred to as Scotland.|$|E

Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance between}} rival kingdoms was {{transformed}} in 793 when ferocious Viking raids began on monasteries like Iona and Lindisfarne, creating fear and confusion across the kingdoms of North Britain. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles eventually {{fell to the}} Norsemen. The king of Fortriu, Eógan mac Óengusa, and the king of Dál Riata, Áed mac Boanta, were among the dead after a major defeat to the Vikings in 839. A mixture of Viking and Gaelic Irish settlement into south-west Scotland produced the Gall-Gaidel, the Norse Irish, from which the region gets the modern name Galloway. Sometime in the 9th century, the beleaguered kingdom of Dál Riata lost the Hebrides to the Vikings, when Ketil Flatnose {{is said to have}} founded the Kingdom of the Isles. These threats may have speeded a long term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs.

5|$|Where spotted hyenas and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|E

40|$|Detection of {{molecular}} ions in mass spectrometry is typically accomplished by an ion colliding with a surface and then amplifying the emitted secondary electrons. It {{is well established}} that the secondary electron yield decreases as {{the mass of the}} primary ion increases [1 - 3], thus limiting the detection efficiency of large molecular ions. One <b>way</b> <b>around</b> this limitation is to use secondary ion detectors because the emission efficiency of secondary ions does not seem to decrease for increasing primary ion mass [1]. However this technique has limitations in timing resolution because of the mass spread of the emitted secondary ions. To find <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>around</b> high mass detection limitations {{it is important to understand}} existing mechanisms of detection and to explore alternative detector types. To this end, a superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) detector was used in measuring the secondary electron emission efficiency, se, for a MCP detector. STJ detectors are energy sensitive and do not rely on secondary emission to produce a signal. Using a linear MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, a STJ detector is mounted directly behind the hole in an annular MCP detector. This mounting arrangement allows ions to be detected simultaneously by each detector. The STJ detector sits in a liquid helium cryostat and is operated at 1. 3 K to minimize thermal noise (see [4, 5] for more details). Primary ions passing through the center hole of the MCP detector collide with the 0. 04 mm{sup 2 } STJ surface and generate a detector-pulse that is approximately proportional to the ion's total energy. A mask with a small hole in it was placed in front of the MCP detector so that the MCP and STJ detectors have approximately the same effective active areas. The ion beam diameter near the MCP is over 2. 5 cm (measured with a MCP-phosphorus screen detector) and the axial separation of the two detectors is about 4 mm. Both detectors were operated in pulse-counting mode and set to have the same effective deadtime...|$|R

It connects the southwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean (Scotia Sea) with the southeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and extends into the Southern Ocean. The passage is named after the 16th-century English privateer, Francis Drake, who was the first to discover it in 1578. Most sailing ship captains preferred the Drake Passage, which is open water for hundreds of miles, despite being often marked by very rough conditions and high winds. There is no significant land anywhere around the world at the 55.6 to 62.8 degrees south latitude of the Drake Passage. This is important to the unimpeded flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which carries a huge volume of water (about 600 times the flow of the Amazon River) through the passage and around Antarctica.|$|R
