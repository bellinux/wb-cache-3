40|$|AbstractThe {{main task}} of machine {{production}} is assuring their operating quality, directly depending on components <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Characteristics, assuring the components performing set functions under set operating conditions and assuring set components’ life, are considered as <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> of separate surfaces and whole components. The common method of engineering {{support of the}} <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> is based on necessity of assuring certain engineering and manufacturing quality parameters during production {{based on the assumption}} that they warrant reaching set <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics.</b> It is already proved that different sets and sequences of process methods can lead to similar components quality engineering and manufacturing parameters, but to significantly different <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The method of process design, based on superimposing process impact results on production subject, has run its course. Suggested concept of controlled forming of goods (in particular, components) characteristics considers their reached quality as a result of transforming its separate parameters, taking into account operative impact on production object, as well, as succession and mutual influence of forming features. In order to describe the transformation a mathematical tool, allowing deterministic stochastic modeling of such transformation, was worked out. The present work includes using the concept for controlled forming of set <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> of goods, using components as example. The perspective is to form technological solutions, 100 % assuring directly set <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> of <b>operating</b> surfaces or the whole component. It is demonstrated that the necessary and sufficient level of warranted assuring set <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> should be limited and should take into account influence of the emergence of the technological process as a system on results of the elementary solutions, performed in such system...|$|R

25|$|There {{is a high}} {{comorbidity}} {{of learning}} disorders (LDs) in children with ADHD, {{and for that reason}} the VADRS has been studied to determine if the performance item questions on the VARS can reliably predict if the child with ADHD has a comorbid LD (e.g. math, reading, spelling LDs). Results of a receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> (ROC) analysis show that children with ADHD can be reliably ruled out from have a comorbid LD based on the performance items on the VARS. This is clinically useful because it allows those without LDs to be ruled out and therefore reduce the amount of unnecessary referrals to healthcare professionals.|$|E

The results indicate that causality test is more revealing than correlation-based analyses. It is clear that capital structure theories are co-existent in different industries. The study provides ample evidence that simultaneity between corporate <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> and capital structure is prevalent with differential results in different industries and forms of debt. ...|$|R

The fact that the ChSP procedure uses cumulative results from two or more samples and that the parameters can be varied to produce a wide variety of <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> raises the question whether it may be possible for such plans to provide a given protection with less inspection than with single or double sampling plans.

40|$|Traditionally, the Bayesian {{formulation}} of the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) is implemented with a one-parameter model describing the association of dose with the probability of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Determination of the appropriate value of the prior variance is often done via simulation over a grid search of possible values until suitable <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> are found. However, it is under-appreciated that the <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> for a given value of the prior variance vary by the “skeleton,” which is the vector of a priori probabilities of DLT for each dose. The skeleton implicitly leads {{to a set of}} indifference intervals, with one interval for each dose, that contain values of the model parameter that support each dose being the MTD. To remove the need of selecting a value for the prior variance, we propose placing a uniform distribution over each of the indifference intervals, making the prior distribution for the model parameter a mixture of uniform distributions. Via simulation, we compare the <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the CRM using a traditional continuous prior to using the mixture-of-uniforms prior {{in a variety of settings}} and show that the mixture-of-uniforms prior leads to <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> that are less sensitive to the chosen skeleton...|$|R
