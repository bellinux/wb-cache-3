5|$|Before the {{announcement}} that all matches be held inside the Six Sides of Steel, TNA advertised that only two would be under such rules. These two matches later became the headlining bouts for the card. The first was announced on the March25 episode of Impact! as Team Nash (Kevin Nash, Sean Waltman, and Diamond Dallas Page) versus Team Jarrett (Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, and The Outlaw). Abyss versus A.J. Styles for a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match was the second announced on the April1 episode of Impact!, which became the main event <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gathering.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} bout on {{the card}} was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the challenger Rhino. At Sacrifice, Raven teamed with Sabu to face the team of Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. On the pre-show <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gathering,</b> Zbyszko announced if Jarrett pinned Raven during the contest then he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match. However, he added that if Raven pinned Jarrett during the contest then Jarrett would not have another title match for an entire year. Rhino ended up pinning Raven at the event, with TNA declaring him number-one contender on their website after the show. Tenay promoted Raven versus Rhino for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Unbreakable on the August19 episode of Impact!.|$|E
5|$|While {{working in}} Ring of Honor for a year, James also debuted as Alexis Laree in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on the company's second ever weekly pay-per-view, as a {{participant}} in a lingerie battle royal. She was not prominently featured until March 26, 2003, when she teamed with Amazing Red {{as part of his}} feud against the X Division Champion Kid Kash and Trinity. Laree competed in her first singles match with the promotion on April 2, 2003 in a losing effort against Trinity. Weeks later, she became the first member <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gathering,</b> a stable led by Raven in his feud against NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett. On April 16, Laree became the first (and thus far, only) woman to compete in a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match, after the Gathering challenged and defeated Jarrett. She continued to wrestle with the stable while they feuded with The Disciples of the New Church, taking part in an angle with Father James Mitchell burning her with a fireball and wrestling in another Clockwork Orange House of Fun match before leaving the company.|$|E

25|$|In 664 at the synod of Whitby, Oswiu {{accepted}} the usages of the Roman Church, {{which led to}} the departure of Bishop Colman of Lindisfarne.

500|$|Basavanna's nephew, Chennabasava, is {{more popular}} as a {{strategist}} and a theologian.

25|$|Shoghi Effendi later {{expressed}} {{to his wife}} and others that he had no foreknowledge of the existence of the Institution of Guardianship, least of all that he was appointed as Guardian.

25|$|In current practice, the Shalom Zachar is an informal, drop-in {{gathering}} {{which takes}} place after the Friday night meal.

Thus, a Shalom Zachar usually takes place in the home of the newborn (even if the newborn is still in the hospital), although it may also take place at the home of grandparents, in-laws, or even friends with whom the father is spending Shabbat.|$|E

25|$|The strike drew few student {{participants}} though two LC {{trustees and}} several alumni did appear {{to show their}} opposition to President Aguillard. About fifty persons gathereed at the auditorium to hold hands, pray, and sing. Organizers blamed the weak turnout on fear of retaliation by the college administration. LC had warned students in a notice that a strike would constitute a possible violation of college policies {{that could result in}} severe sanctions, such as suspension, denial of a degree, or expulsion, all on the first violation of the code. Media representatives were asked to leave the campus at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gathering.</b>|$|E
