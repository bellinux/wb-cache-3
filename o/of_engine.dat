50|$|Eliminating the {{mechanical}} {{connection between the}} engines and the propulsion has several advantages including increased freedom of placement <b>of</b> the <b>engines,</b> acoustical decoupling <b>of</b> the <b>engines</b> from the hull which makes the ship less noisy, and a reduction of weight and volume. Reducing acoustic signature is particularly important to naval vessels seeking to avoid detection and to cruise ships seeking to provide passengers with a pleasant voyage, but is of less benefit to cargo ships. Because ships anyway require electricity even when not underway, having all <b>of</b> the <b>engines</b> produce electricity reduces the number <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> needed compared to more traditional arrangements in which one pool <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> provides electricity and another pool <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> provides propulsion, reducing capital costs and maintenance costs.|$|R
5|$|Justice Simpson's {{report was}} tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 June 1951 {{by the new}} Minister for Civil Aviation, Larry Anthony. The Inquiry found that the Amana {{suffered}} total loss <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> power {{on at least one}} occasion, followed by rapid loss of height until it struck the ground. However, the evidence did not allow the court to determine the cause of the total loss <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> power. Consequently, the court was unable to determine the cause of the accident. Simpson stated he was satisfied water had not been introduced into the Amana's fuel system in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth.|$|E

5|$|About 260 {{models of}} lorry were produced, which were fitted with 35 types <b>of</b> <b>engine,</b> 20 {{different}} gearboxes, and 15 to 20 types of cabin.

5|$|The P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, {{the ethos}} of {{tactical}} flexibility meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel with a much smaller counterpart on the vertical stabilizer to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a ram air turbine upon the rear fuselage just forward of the vertical stabilizer to provide power for ancillary services in the event <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> failure.|$|E

5|$|The P.1127/Kestrel was an {{experimental}} V/STOL aircraft, {{which served as}} the forerunner {{for the production of}} the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the wider Harrier Jump Jet family. It served to demonstrate an entirely original technique of flight, as well as to trial a brand new type <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> {{in the form of the}} Pegasus turbofan engine. Despite this, the aircraft employed a principally conventional structure which, according to Mason, lent itself favourably to performing the intended ground attack operations envisioned for production aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 191 brought strong {{criticism}} from the media regarding the DC-10's safety and design. The DC-10 {{had been involved in}} two accidents related to the design of its cargo doors, American Airlines Flight 96 (1972) and Turkish Airlines Flight 981 (1974). The separation <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> one from its mount, the widespread publication of the dramatic images of the airplane missing its engine seconds before the crash, and a second photo of the fireball resulting from the impact, raised widespread concerns about the safety of the DC-10. The final blow to the airplane's reputation was dealt two weeks after the crash, when the aircraft was grounded by the FAA. Although the aircraft itself was later exonerated, the damage in the public's eye was already done.|$|E
5|$|Under LSWR ownership, the N15s were {{initially}} well received by crews, though the batch soon {{gained a reputation}} for poor steaming on long runs.

A series of trial runs changed this assumption, and demonstrated that steam pressure gradually decreased on the flat. The trials also revealed that the robust construction of the motion produced the heaviest hammerblow of any British locomotive class, and had caused cracked frames on the test locomotive.|$|E
