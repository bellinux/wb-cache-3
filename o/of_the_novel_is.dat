5|$|The American {{copyright}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> currently set {{to expire}} on January 1, 2022, while in the European union it entered the public domain in 1 January 2016.|$|E
5|$|The account starts briskly; {{only four}} pages {{are devoted to}} Ralph's early life and a further {{fourteen}} to his voyage to the Pacific Ocean on board the Arrow. He and his two companions– 18-year-old Jack Martin and 13-year-old Peterkin Gay– are the sole survivors of the shipwreck. The narrative is in two parts. The first describes how the boys feed themselves, what they drink, the clothing and shelter they fashion, and how they cope with having to rely on their own resources. The second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> more action-packed, featuring conflicts with pirates, fighting between the native Polynesians, and the conversion efforts of Christian missionaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{parallels}} to the Fitzgeralds were obvious. The protagonist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> Alabama Beggs (like Zelda, {{the daughter of}} a Southern judge), who marries David Knight, an aspiring painter who abruptly becomes famous for his work. They live the fast life in Connecticut before departing to live in France. Dissatisfied with her marriage, Alabama throws herself into ballet. Though told she has no chance, she perseveres and after three years becomes the lead dancer in an opera company. Alabama becomes ill from exhaustion, however, and the novel ends when they return to her family in the South, as her father is dying.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{first volume}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} on November 25, 2009. Twelve volumes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>were</b> published in all by Media Factory under their MF Bunko J imprint.|$|R

5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{considered}} a product of creolization, combining the African magical perspective of Macandal with the Catholic realism of Henri Christophe. A key aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> that the main character is of interest not because of his skin colour, but rather for his human attributes that allow universal reflection {{beyond the realm of}} race. In this sense, magic realism is a necessary tool of expression and the technique serves to confront the novel's hero, better develop his purpose as a man, and advance a simultaneously profound and straightforward understanding of the human experience.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>is</b> used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for {{what goes on in}} people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E

50|$|Initial {{reception}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>was</b> mixed, {{resulting in}} poor sales.|$|R
5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part {{in the tone of}} the novel. The tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E
5|$|Renji {{also finds}} {{out that it is}} her dream to write a fantasy novel, but due to her {{condition}} has never been able to get far. Renji loves to read novels, and after discussing it with Chihiro, he collaborates with her to see if he can finally make her dream come true. Through the process of writing the novel, the two eventually become very close and they fall in love with each other. As the story progresses and more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> written, Renji soon discovers that the novel is an allegory for Chihiro's life and how she sees the world around her due to the state of her limited memory.|$|E
25|$|In Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) by Jules Verne, the {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> set on Stromboli.|$|E
50|$|William II of England is {{indirectly}} <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> two historical novels by George Shipway, The Paladin and The Wolf Time. <b>The</b> {{main character}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> <b>is</b> Walter Tirel (or Tyrell), his supposed assassin, and <b>the</b> main thrust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> assassination was engineered by Henry I.|$|R

The plot follows his military career, rise to power, swearing of fealty to David I of Scotland, {{and support of}} a revolt against Malcolm IV. It concludes {{with the murder of}} Somerled.|$|E
25|$|The title <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> {{part of an}} old Imperial proverb; only {{in death}} does duty end. The {{beginning}} of each chapter opens with an extract from Commissar Viktor Hark's field journal, which is written in a font which resembles handwriting. This style changes slightly at points when Nahum Ludd scribes on Hark's behalf. The novel re-introduces Agun Soric, who was absent from the previous books in the 'Lost' arc.|$|E

25|$|Popcorn is a 1996 {{novel by}} the British writer Ben Elton. It shares themes {{with a number}} of movies from the mid-1990s, most notably Natural Born Killers by Oliver Stone and Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs by Quentin Tarantino. The play version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> used by the IEB (Independent Education Board) In South Africa as one of their Postmodern set-work plays for Dramatic Arts.|$|E
25|$|The book {{opens with}} the narrator, Casaubon (his name refers to {{classical}} scholar Isaac Casaubon, and also evokes a scholar character in George Eliot's Middlemarch) hiding in fear after closing {{time in the}} Parisian technical museum Musée des Arts et Métiers. He believes that members of a secret society have kidnapped Belbo and are now after him. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> then told in flashback as Casaubon waits in the museum.|$|E
25|$|These traits he {{integrated}} in Paradisul suspinelor, {{one of the}} most experimental (and possibly the earliest) avant-garde novel or novella by a Romanian—although it remains shadowed by Caragiale's Craii de Curtea-Veche. He added to the mix psychoanalytical and sexual themes, with an unreliable narrator that hinted the influence of André Gide. According to Vianu, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>is</b> also an imagist rearrangement of borrowings from Arghezi's prose, with echoes from Baudelaire's synaesthesia.|$|E
