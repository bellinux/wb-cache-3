50|$|The {{symmetrical}} diaminophenazine is {{the parent}} {{substance of the}} important dyestuff toluylene red or dimethyldiaminotoluphenazine. It is obtained by the oxidation of <b>orthophenylene</b> <b>diamine</b> with ferric chloride; when a mixture of para-aminodimethylaniline and meta-toluylenediamine is oxidized in the cold, toluylene blue, an indamine, being formed as an intermediate product and passing into the red when boiled; and also by the oxidation of dimethylparaphenylene diatnine with metatoluylene diamine. It crystallizes in orange-red needles and its alcoholic solution fluoresces strongly. It dyes silk and mordanted cotton a fine scarlet. It is known commercially as neutral red. For the phenazonium salts, see safranine. Phenazone is an isomer of phenazine, to which it bears the same relation that phenanthrene bears to anthracene.|$|E
40|$|Various 6 -aralkyl- 9 -substituted- 6 H-indolo[2, 3 -b]quinoxalines were {{synthesized}} by {{reaction of}} 1, 5 -disubstituted 2, 3 -dioxo- 2, 3 -dihydroindole and <b>orthophenylene</b> <b>diamine.</b> Appreciable anticancer activity of compounds 5 b, 5 d, 5 g and 5 l at various cell lines among 59 human tumor cell panels was observed. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for cytostatic activity against human Molt 4 /C 8 and CEM T-lymphocytes {{as well as}} for murine L 1210 leukemia cells. Compound 5 h exhibited an I C 50 of 23 mumol L- 1 against Molt 4 /C 8 and 38 mumol L- 1 against CEM compared to melphalan 3. 2 mumol L- 1 and 2. 5 mumol L- 1, respectively. The I C 50 for compound 7 i against L 1210 was 7. 2 mumol L- 1 compared to melphalan 2. 1 mumol L- 1. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{electrochemical}} current rectification phenomenon exhibited at an electrochemical interface constituted by a glassy carbon electrode {{covered with a}} bilayer of polymer films is discussed. The authors have shown that Methylene Blue (MB) redox species can be confined to a very thin insulating polymer film formed from <b>orthophenylene</b> <b>diamine.</b> The poly (opd) film exhibited excellent blocking properties to redox molecules in solution. On the other hand, the insulating poly(opd) film trapped with MB could mediate electron transfer between the redox molecules in solution and the electrode. Further, a second polymeric layer (Nafion film) trapped with ferrocene redox species was formed as the outer layer over the inner poly (opd) film containing MB. This bilayer-modified electrode, due to the {{significant difference in the}} redox potentials of the MB and ferrocene species immobilized in the inner and outer layers, respectively, exhibits unidirectional current flow and the results of the voltammetric investigations on the modified electrodes are described in this communication...|$|E
