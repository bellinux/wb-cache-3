5|$|X-Men: The Last Stand was {{released}} on May 26, 2006, to commercial success. It grossed approximately $459 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2006; {{it was at the}} time the highest-grossing film in the series and currently the fourth-highest-grossing film of the franchise. Critical reception was mixed, with the acting and the action scenes receiving positive notice, and criticism directed at the screenplay, and <b>overuse</b> <b>of</b> characters and style.|$|E
5|$|Alice in Wonderland {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release; although praised for its visual style and special effects, {{the film was}} criticized for its lack of narrative coherence and <b>overuse</b> <b>of</b> computer-generated imagery (CGI). At the 83rd Academy Awards, Alice in Wonderland won Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, and was also nominated for Best Visual Effects. The film generated over $1 billion in ticket sales and became the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run.|$|E

The wide spectrum <b>of</b> <b>overuse</b> injuries includes ligamentous injuries, soft tissue and osseous impingement, osteochondral lesions, tendon injuries, and stress fractures. Some conditions such as impingement syndromes and stress fractures may be missed on initial physical examination, and patients with such injuries often present to a sports or orthopedic clinic with persistent symptoms. With the increasing participation in sports, health-care professionals involved {{in the care of}} athletes at all levels must have a thorough understanding <b>of</b> <b>overuse</b> conditions <b>of</b> the foot and ankle, and the use of imaging in the management of these conditions.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of foot blisters and other <b>overuse</b> injuries <b>of</b> the lower limb {{is very high}} during basic military training (BMT). One hundred and eighty-nine subjects {{were divided into two}} intervention groups wearing alternative sock systems and one control group. Overall, 57 % of the 173 recruits who completed the training, developed foot blisters. Binary logistic regression revealed the type of sock, race, previous hiking or military experience, and known orthopedic foot conditions to be predictive variables for foot blisters. Fifty-three percent of the 173 recruits also developed another <b>overuse</b> injury <b>of</b> the lower limb (25. 4 % related to the knee joint).

5|$|Cannibal {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. However, a common complaint amongst critics was the <b>overuse</b> <b>of</b> Auto-Tune, while the album's production was generally highlighted. The album's lyrics generally polarized music critics; some praised her boldness, while others criticized {{them as being}} too raunchy. In the United States, the EP reached a peak of fifteen selling 74,000 copies in its first week of release. In Canada, the album achieved similar success reaching a peak of fourteen on the chart. Cannibal was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 500,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Despite precautions, the {{post-production}} faced significant delays {{owing to}} the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in {{the completion of the}} visual effects. The post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an <b>overuse</b> <b>of</b> CGI according to the cinematographer. The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that a person is at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis.

5|$|Like live action, machinima is {{recorded}} in real-time, and real people can act {{and control the}} camera. Filmmakers are often encouraged to follow traditional cinematic conventions, such as avoiding wide fields of view, the <b>overuse</b> <b>of</b> slow motion, and errors in visual continuity. Unlike live action, machinima involves less expensive, digital special effects and sets, possibly with a science-fiction or historical theme. Explosions and stunts can be tried and repeated without monetary cost and risk of injury, and the host environment may allow unrealistic physical constraints. University of Cambridge experiments in 2002 and 2003 attempted to use machinima to re-create {{a scene from the}} 1942 live-action film Casablanca. Machinima filming differed from traditional cinematography in that character expression was limited, but camera movements were more flexible and improvised. Nitsche compared this experiment to an unpredictable Dogme 95 production.|$|E

5|$|The film premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2008, and was {{released}} worldwide on May 22, 2008 to generally positive reviews from critics, although audience reception was more mixed. There was significant praise for the performances, action scenes, John Williams' musical score, and the costume design. Criticism, however, focused on the dialogue, storyline, pacing, and <b>overuse</b> <b>of</b> CGI. It was also a financial success like the previous three films in the series, grossing over $786 million worldwide, becoming the franchise's highest-grossing film when not adjusted for inflation, and the second highest-grossing film of 2008.

5|$|Takumi {{learns that}} he is an artificial, {{delusional}} clone with fabricated memories, created by Shogun – the real Takumi. His sister Nanami is being held in the location of the real Noah II, where she is made to awaken as a gigalomaniac and obtain a Di-Sword. Rimi – also a gigalomaniac – tries to save her, but is attacked by Norose and is taken prisoner in Nanami's stead. Shogun again meets with Takumi to tell him that he had intended to stop Nozomi from taking over humanity with Noah II, but that his body – aged from disease and <b>overuse</b> <b>of</b> gigalomaniac powers – hindered him, prompting him to create Takumi to do it in his stead. Takumi obtains a Di-Sword, and destroys the transmitters, revealing the nurse Hazuki to be the New Gen killer in the process by reading her memories and projecting them onto the screens on the buildings. An earthquake occurs, destroying much of Shibuya; Takumi rescues the other gigalomaniacs from the destruction, and continues to the location of Noah II. He fights Norose, but Noah II activates its self-defense mode, overwhelming Takumi with delusions; he reaffirms his existence, and destroys Norose and Noah II with his Di-Sword. As he lies in the ruins of Shibuya, depending on what delusions the player has chosen, he either gives up his life along with the dying Shogun's, or stays alive with Rimi.|$|E

50|$|<b>Overuse</b> {{injuries}} <b>of</b> {{the knee}} include tendonitis, bursitis, muscle strains and iliotibial band syndrome. These injuries often develop slowly over weeks or months.
