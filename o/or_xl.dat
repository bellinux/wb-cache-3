40|$|Abstract. The GeometricXL {{algorithm}} is a geometrically invariant {{version of the}} XL algorithm that uses polynomials of a much smaller degree than either a standard Groebner basis algorithm <b>or</b> an <b>XL</b> algorithm for certain multivariate equation systems. However, the GeometricXL algorithm as originally described is not well-suited to fields of even characteristic. This paper discusses adaptations of the GeometricXL algorithm to even characteristic, in which the solution to a multivariate system is found by finding a matrix of low rank in the linear span {{of a collection of}} matrices. These adaptations of the GeometricXL algorithm, termed the EGHAM process, also use polynomials of a much smaller degree than a Groebner basis <b>or</b> an <b>XL</b> algorithm for certain equation systems. Furthermore, the paper gives a criterion which generally makes a Groebner basis <b>or</b> standard <b>XL</b> algorithm more efficient in many cryptographic situations...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} 1 H NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{to determine the}} structural changes induced in the DNA oligomer d(5 '-GCGTACGC- 3 ') 2 upon conversion of the 4 '-hydroxy-methyl- 4, 5 ', 8 -trimethylpsoralen-DNA furan-side monoadduct (MAf) to the interstrand cross-link (XL). The MAf is a photochemical intermediate {{on the path to}} interstrand XL and has the psoralen intercalated into the helix. The local DNA structure is distorted in both adducts, but it returns to normal within three base pairs. The formation of XL requires displacement of the psoralen toward the initially unmodified strand, accompanied by a change in the hybridization of the thymine C- 5 and C- 6 carbons and a change in the local helix twist. The MAf is intercalated in the helix. There is no significant bend in the helix axis of either the MAf <b>or</b> <b>XL.</b> There are significant changes in the local helix dynamics upon photoadduct formation that may be recognized by cellular DNA repair enzyme systems. We hypothesize that the repair enzymes target lesions by detecting the conformational flexibility of the sugar-phosphate backbone induced by DNA-damaging agents...|$|E

However, the correct identification of covalently linked (cross-linked <b>or</b> <b>XL)</b> peptides analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry is still an open challenge. Here we present SIM-XL, a software tool that can analyze data generated through commonly used cross-linkers (e. g., BS 3 /DSS). Our software introduces a new paradigm for search-space reduction, which ultimately accounts for its increase in speed and sensitivity. Moreover, our search engine is the first to capitalize on reporter ions for selecting tandem mass spectra derived from cross-linked peptides. It also makes available a 2 D interaction map and a spectrum-annotation tool unmatched by any of its kind. We show SIM-XL to be more sensitive and faster than a competing tool when analyzing a data set obtained from the human HSP 90. The software is freely available for academic use at [URL] A video demonstrating the tool is available at [URL] SIM-XL is the first tool to support XL data in the mzIdentML format; all data are thus available from the ProteomeXchange consortium (identifier PXD 001677).

40|$|There is {{emerging}} {{evidence for the}} positive effects or benefits of coffee in patients with liver disease. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection {{to determine the effects}} of coffee intake on a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis: liver stiffness assessed by transient elastography (TE). We assessed coffee and tea intake and measured TE in 1018 patients with NAFLD, HCV, and HBV (155 with NAFLD, 378 with HCV and 485 with HBV). Univariate and multivariate regression models were performed taking into account potential confounders. Liver stiffness was higher in males compared to females (p < 0. 05). Patients with HBV had lower liver stiffness than those with HCV and NAFLD. After adjustment for age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, M <b>or</b> <b>XL</b> probe, and disease state (NAFLD, HCV, and HBV status), those who drank 2 or more cups of coffee per day had a lower liver stiffness (p = 0. 044). Tea consumption had no effect (p = 0. 9). Coffee consumption decreases liver stiffness, which may indicate less fibrosis and inflammation, independent of disease state. This study adds further evidence to the notion of coffee maybe beneficial in patients with liver disease...|$|E
40|$|Using decerebrate frogs (Rana catesbeiana), we {{investigated}} {{the role of}} vagal and laryngeal sensory feedback in controlling motor activation of the larynx. Vagal and laryngeal nerve afferents were activated by electrical stimulation of the intact vagal and laryngeal nerves. Pulmonary afferents were activated by lung inflation. Reflex responses were recorded by measuring efferent activity in the laryngeal branch of the vagus (Xl) and changes in glottal aperture. Two glottic closure reflexes were identified, one evoked by lung inflation or electrical stimulation of the main branch of the vagus (Xm), and the other by electrical stimulation of Xl. Lung inflation evoked a decrementing burst of Xl efferent activity and electrical stimulation of Xm resulted in a brief burst of Xl action potentials. Electrical stimulation of Xl evoked a triphasic mechanical response, an abrupt glottal constriction followed by glottal dilatation followed by a long-lasting glottal constriction. The first phase was inferred to be a direct (nonreflex) response to the stimulus, whereas {{the second and third}} represent reflex responses to the activation of laryngeal afferents. Intracellular recordings of membrane potential of vagal motoneurons of lung and nonlung types revealed EPSPs in both types of neurons evoked by stimulation of Xm <b>or</b> <b>Xl,</b> indicating activation of glottal dilator and constrictor motoneurons. In summary, we have identified two novel reflexes producing glottic closure, one stimulated by activation of pulmonary receptors and the other by laryngeal receptors. The former may be part of an inspiratory terminating reflex and the latter may represent an airway protective reflex. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Neurobiol. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The ubiquitously {{distributed}} MAP 1 S is a homologue of the exclusively neuronal distributed microtubule-associated protein 1 A and 1 B (MAP 1 A/B). They {{give rise}} to multiple isoforms through similar post-translational modification. Isoforms of MAP 1 S have been implicated in microtubule dynamics and mitotic abnormalities and mitotic cell death. Here we show that ablation of the Map 1 s gene in mice caused reduction in the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 <b>or</b> <b>xL</b> (Bcl- 2 /xL) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 B (P 27) protein levels, accumulation of defective mitochondria, and severe defects in response to nutritive stress, suggesting defects in autophagosomal biogenesis and clearance. Furthermore, MAP 1 S isoforms interacted with the autophagosome-associated light chain 3 of MAP 1 A/B (LC 3), a homologue of yeast autophagy-related gene 8 (ATG 8), and recruited it to stable microtubules in a MAP 1 S and LC 3 isoform-dependent mode. In addition, MAP 1 S interacted with mitochondrion-associated leucine-rich PPR-motif containing protein (LRPPRC) that interacts with the mitophagy initiator and Parkinson disease-related protein Parkin. The three-way interactions of MAP 1 S isoforms with LC 3 and microtubules {{as well as the}} interaction of MAP 1 S with LRPPRC suggest that MAP 1 S isoforms may play positive roles in integration of autophagic components with microtubules and mitochondria in both autophagosomal biogenesis and degradation. For the first time, our results clarify roles of MAP 1 S in bridging microtubules and mitochondria with autophagic and mitophagic initiation, maturation, trafficking, and lysosomal clearance. Defects in the MAP 1 S-regulated autophagy may impact heart disease, cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and a wide range of other diseases...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that, after being trained on A-B and A-C {{matching}} tasks, subjects match not only functionally-same Band C stimuli (stimulus equivalence), but also BC compounds with sameclass elements and BC compounds with different-class elements (equivalence-equivalence). Similar performances are required in classical analogies (a : b :: c : d). Therefore, some researchers have argued that equivalence-equivalence {{can serve as a}} behavior analytic model for analogical reasoning. Recent studies, however, have shown that compounds with same-class elements and different-class elements have different discriminative (S+, S-) properties. Hence, matching of same discriminative functions may have occurred. The present study aimed to design an equivalence-equivalence test in which the designated correct performances cannot be attributed to a process other than matching functionally-same relations. In Experiment 1, subjects were trained to relate X and Y stimuli to colors and X and l stimuli to forms. After equivalence was assessed (Y-Xl), the subjects received an equivalence-equivalence test in which only compounds with same-class elements were used: an XY <b>or</b> <b>Xl</b> compound as sample and an XY and Xl compound as comparisons (e. g., X 1 Y 1 -X 2 Y 2 IX 2 Z 2). All subjects passed the equivalenceequivalence test. However, as reported by 1 subject, and was later demonstrated in Experiment 2, these equivalence-equivalence tasks could be solved by matching functionally-same stimuli (e. g., Y 1 -colorY 2, hence Y 1 -Y 2). Experiment 3 demonstrated that this problem also exists in classical analogy tasks. When given the analogy tasks used by Goswami and Brown (1990), all subjects selected the correct dterm option {{on the basis of the}} b-term alone (equivalence). In Experiment 4, the equivalence-equivalence test was further modified to permit differentiation of matching functionally-same relations from matching functionally-same stimuli. All 5 subjects readily matched functionally-same equivalence relations, thus evidenced equivalence-equivalence or analogical reasoning...|$|E
