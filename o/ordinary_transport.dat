When q= 0 one recovers the single-particle distribution exactly. The equation of motion for F(p, R) generates an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for various distribution functions. In the Hartree approximation one obtains nonlinear integral equations analogous to the Vlasov equation in plasma physics. Such equations are convenient for exhibiting collective motions; in particular it appears that a collective mode exists in a φ^ 4 theory for a uniform infinite medium.

40|$|A {{real-time}} protocol {{is usually}} {{concerned with the}} transportation of a real-time data stream over a packet switched network. Among the major issues distinguishing real-time protocols from <b>ordinary</b> <b>transport</b> protocols {{is the problem of}} trading delay for loss. That is, if some loss of packets may be acceptable, and usually inevitable, the objective of the protocol is to minimize the delay of packets, subject to constraints on the acceptable loss. This is unlike usual transport protocols, which are designed to guarantee no loss at the expense of increased delays. This paper presents a model for the delay-loss tradeoffs in real-time transport protocols. It is demonstrated that, under very general assumptions, an optimal real-time protocol is a bang-bang protocol: there exists a threshold queue length such {{that as long as the}} packet queue length at the sender is less than the threshold the protocol should be an ordinary positive acknowledgment with retransmissions transport protocol.

40|$|The {{arguments}} {{for and against}} a single-molecule rotation mechanism for dielectric relaxation of water are surveyed. It is concluded that two distinct molecular mechanisms are operative in water. Single-molecule rotation is faster than the Debye relaxation time, τD, and possesses a smaller activation energy. It governs the abnormally fast proton mobility in water. The temperature dependence of τD agrees with that of water self-diffusion assuming a water hopping distance of 3. 3 Å, the separation between an occupied and unoccupied corners of a cube binding the pentawater tetrahedron. This slower translational mechanism controls the <b>ordinary</b> <b>transport</b> phenomena in water. “Tetrahedral displacement ” correlates with two tetrahedral normal modes: the antisymmetric stretch in extended tetrahedral structures at low temperatures and a torsion mode in loosely bound tetrahedra at high temperatures. The temperature dependence of the 180 cm- 1 Raman band is in quantitative agreement with the activation energy for water reorientation and, {{in the framework of}} a twodimensional model, also explains the activation energy for τD.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of III-V semiconductor heterostructures has enabled {{the study of}} {{a broad range of}} two-dimensional phenomena. These heterostructures are the building blocks of high frequency field-effect transistors (FETs). GaN-based heterostructures will have great impact in FET applications as they have the highest carrier densities achievable. In this thesis we studied electron transport in AlGaN/GaN samples covering a broad range of carrier density, from 0. 5 × 1012 cm^- 2 to 1. 0 × 1013 cm^- 2. We found at carrier densities below 5. 0 × 1012 cm^- 2, electron scattering from threading dislocations were the dominant scattering mechanism. The electron mobilities can be greatly enhanced by reducing the density of threading dislocations based on novel patterned growth techniques. We extended our studies to even higher carrier densities using lattice matched In 0. 16 Al 0. 84 N/GaN heterostructures. In particular, we investigated the magnetotransport regime in the presence of two subbands by using gated Hall bar samples. In addition to scattering processes, we also studied the spin-orbit interaction and phase coherence in GaN 2 DEG samples by performing weak antilocalization (WAL) measurements. The spin-splitting energies extracted from WAL were found to be much smaller than the previous reports based on Shubnikov-de Haas measurements. By studying the spin splitting energies as a function of Fermi wave-vector we obtained the linear and cubic spin-orbit parameters for GaN 2 DEG system. Furthermore, we used the WAL feature as a thermometer for the electron system, which allowed us to study energy relaxation processes in GaN. In contrast to GaN heterostructures, we used GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures to study two-dimensional electron transport at very low carrier densities. We focused on the deep insulation regime of integer quantum Hall liquids (IQHLs), a transport regime not accessible by <b>ordinary</b> <b>transport</b> measurements. We explored the charge dynamics in this regime by using single electron transistors (SET) in both unpatterned and antidot structures. SETs allowed us to monitor slow motion of charges {{in and out of the}} IQHLs.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In 1838 peat-cutters found a {{one-piece}} {{disc wheel}} the very clumsiness of which roused the curiosity of journalists and authorities, {{so that it}} was saved from destruction. Eventually the wel 1 known Leiden antiquarian L. J. F. Janssen (1848, pp. 94 - 97) examined and commented upon this wheel. Its close resemblance to what was known of the tympana of the Roman plaustra, coupled with a fallacious chain of tempting arguments, led him to the misconception that this wheel (and a second one of different type) was of Roman origin. Once labelled they were labelled forever; and in so far as they were not thought to represent giant lids or even table tops (Pleyte, 1882, p. p), these wheels and the more recent comparable finds continued to be considered of Roman origin. It was only in 1955, when still another wheel of the Same type turned up in direct connection with a Neolithic trackway at Nieuw-Dordrecht (then under excavation), that Dr. W. van Zeist {{came to the conclusion that}} at least this wheel was to be considered of Neolithic origin. Even so, it remained questionable whether al 1 wheels of this type were of Neolithic age, or whether these spanned a much longer period. Since 1955 five more one-piece disc wheels have been found in the peat. On the basis of the palynological evidence (dealt with by Mrs. M. R. van der Spoel-Walvius in a recent paper, 1964) and C 14 measurements, the wheels al 1 proved to be contemporary with the Nieuw-Dordrecht wheel. This was inducement enough to study the. whole group of one-piece oak disc wheels found in the Northern Provinces of the Netherlands, and to collect as much information on these finds as possible. We now know that a total of ten finds, comprising in al 1 thirteen one-piece disc wheels of the Same type, have been recovered from the peat deposits of the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel; of these ten finds, six could be dated, with the help of C 14 measurements and pollen analysis, to the end of the third millennium R. C. No comparable finds are known from other regions in the Netherlands. This study deals with the origin, dating, and implications of the wheel finds. Some later bi- and tripartite disc wheel finds are also discussed, notably those from the excavations at Ezinge in the years 1924 - 1934 (very kindly made available for publication by their excavator, Prof. Dr. A. E. van Giffen). In an introductory section, a brief survey is given of the present state of knowledge concerning the Neolithic cultures met with in the northern provinces of the Netherlands, to serve as a background for the discussion. The paper concludes with a complete catalogue of Dutch disc wheel finds. The historiography of wheeled traction sprang from the study of the representational art and the treatises of the ancients. As early as 1817, J. C. Ginzroth(1 nspector of Wagon-building to the King of Bavaria) published his magnificent work Die Wagen und Fahrwerke der Griechen und Römer und anderer alten Völker. Thus, the disc wheel became known from ancient art, and even such problems as wheels turning with the axles or on the axles were discussed, long before the first actual disc wheel find was recorded. In fact, the finds from Gasselterboerveen and Valthe, registered by L. J. F. Janssen in 1848, might wel 1 be the first authentic prehistoric disc wheels to enter scientific literature. The lack of actual finds must have been responsible for the often theoretical character of the discussions, which centred, for instance, on the question as to the invention of the wheel. Was the cart developed out of the sledge, which eventually might have been used with rollers underneath to carry stones (as Ginzroth had suggested), or was the vehicle invented in ritual context, and had spindle whorls been the prototypes for the wheel? Mötefindt (1918) gives a survey of the different opinions on this point, but he als 0 presents a classification of disc and early spoked wheels based on a realistic discussion of the available evidence, still largely derived from classica 1 sources. In the last half century, the multiplication of finds of actual remains and models of prehistoric wheels and vehicles has pushed the problems of theoretical character into the background; the centre of invention of wheeled vehicles and the history of their diffusion became the main points of interest. These problems have been specially dear to Childe, whose studies on the subject are of primary importance (1951, 1954, 1955). The most recent publication is by I. Bóna (1960), who, in a searching study, takes int 0 account new finds from Southeastern and Eastern Europe and their implications. Thus, at the outset of our discussion, the following synoptic picture can be drawn. The solid disc wheel can be traced back as far as the Uruk period (late 4 th millennium B. C.) in Mesopotamia, where script signs on pictographic tablets represent both sledges and vehicles which are identical to these sledges but for the wheels that are added underneath. From the early 3 rd millennium onward, wheeled vehicles (both wagons and carts) appear in the Royal tombs of Southern Mesopotamia serving as hearses (at Kish, Susa, Khafaje, and Ur) and in the representational art. The wheels present themselves already as compound plankbuilt discs with separate naves and tyres. By the beginning of the 3 rd millennium models of carts, wagons and wheels occur in Assyria (Tepe Gawra VIII) and Turkmenia (Anau I 11 and Shah Tepe ILI), demonstrating the rapid spread of wheeled traction. Still in the first half of the 3 rd millennium, model disc wheels make their appearance in some of the settlements of the Kuro-Araxes Culture in the Southern Caucasus and Eastern Asia Minor. The first disc wheel and wagon models of the Danubian area are hardly to be dated later. In the second half of the 3 rd millennium, solid disc wheels appear in the South-Russian steppe area, and, far to the East, in the Indus valley. Further afield in temperate Europe, the picture was by no means clear. Of the ambiguous engravings on the slabs of the portholed stone cist at Lohne-Zuschen (Hessen) in Germany, neither the date nor the fact that ox-drawn carts are really represented is agreed upon. The date secured by pollen analysis for a wooden disc wheel found at Beckdorf (Lower Saxony) in Germany at the end of the Neolithic or in the Early Bronze Age was but hesitantly accepted. Only the tripartite disc wheels from the North-Italian lakeside dwellings of Castione and Mercurago and from the Wasserburg Buchau in Southern Germany, datable to the 13 th century and c. 1000 B. C. respectively, gave a firm hold. Thus, it would even have been possible to believe that the spoked wheel had made its appearance in temperate Europe at an earlier date than the disc wheel. The spoked wheel is likely to have originated in connection with the adoption of the horse as a draught animal, when vehicles of lighter construction and greater manoeuvrability, such as war chariots, had to be constructed. Its centre of origin in the Near East, somewhere near the eastern border of Anatolia, is not yet clear, but the date of its first appearance may have been shortly after 2000 B. C. The earliest spoked wheel evidence from continental European soil is furnished by clay models from VëteFov settlements in Moravia and Slovakia, datable about I 500 B. C. (according to Bóna, shortly after 1400 B. C.). The history of spoked wheels in Europe can then be continued down int 0 the Iron Age by a series of models and actual bronze wheels belonging to votive wagons, wheeled cauldrons, wagons serving as hearses on the pyre and by representations of chariots on rock engravings. Thus, the spoked wheel was connected with ritual, burial and warfare. But <b>ordinary</b> <b>transport</b> in Europe probably remained true to disc wheels up to the beginning of. our era, as the disc wheel finds suggest. In the present study, the view is presented that the first disc wheels found their way into Northwestern Europe as an element of a specific group of cultures - the Battle Axe Cultures. The evidence seems to support this conception. It is based, however, on a limited number of chance finds, and future discoveries might conceivably show that the turning wheel was rather propagated by diffusion, independent of cultural barriers.

After microwave treatment, the metallic conductivity in the ohmic contact is not observed.

Evidence suggests that demand responsive transport pilots are popular among the users; however, their popularity makes them expensive. In contrast, integration of special passenger transportation services include benefits such as increased economic savings. A more efficient use of vehicles and more passengers per vehicle contribute to such effects. However, such coordination of transportation services increases the travel time for existing passengers. It is likely to meet resistance from certain powerful user groups. In addition, there are certain organisational barriers, given the different responsibilities and experiences of the various public authorities - at different political levels and sectors - that are responsible for the services today.

Congestion costs 1 % of the GDP of European Union (European Union 2014) and also causes significant {{emissions of carbon}} dioxide and other pollutants. This problem could be solved by transfering a part of passengers from private modes of transport to the public transport. But the essential condition is a sustainable development which means the accessibility on equal terms. Therefore, attention to the focus group – people with movement impairements, is neccessary. Since even under ideal conditions some of those people {{will not be able to}} use the <b>ordinary</b> public <b>transport</b> services, a special transportation service, called paratransit, should be offered. In this paper the parameters of paratransit as well as their variations are analyzed. Also the wider application possibilities are considered. The aspects of integration of paratransit into the existing system, pottential barriers for the integration and conditions for the integration are highlighted. The main purpose of this paper is to formulate the scenarios for the integration of paratransit into the existing public transport system based on the analysis of the scientific literature and the best practices, which could be used to form a policy of improving the accessibility of the public transport for people with movement impairments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The MCNP code is {{a general}} Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport program that is widely used in health physics, medical physics and nuclear {{engineering}} for problems involving neutron, photon and electron transport [1]. However, due to the stochastic nature of the algorithms employed to solve the Boltzmann transport equation, MCNP generally exhibits a slow rate of convergence. In fact, engineers and scientists can quickly identify intractable versions of their most challenging and CPU-intensive problems. For example, despite the latest advancements in personal computers (PCs) and quantum leaps in their computational capabilities, an <b>ordinary</b> electron <b>transport</b> problem could require up to several CPU-days or even CPU-weeks on a typical desktop PC of today. One common contemporary approach to help address these performance limitations is {{by taking advantage of}} parallel processing. In fact, {{the very nature of the}} Monte Carlo approach embedded within MCNP is inherently parallel because, at least in principle, every particle history can potentially be tracked individually in an independent processor. In practice, however, there are many issues that must be confronted to achieve a reasonable level of parallelization. First, of course, a suitable parallel computing platform is required. Next, the computer program itself should exploit parallelism from within by combining such tools as Fortran- 90 and PVM, for example. This article describes the installation and performance testing of th...|$|R
