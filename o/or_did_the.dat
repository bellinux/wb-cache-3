By 2013, the cumulative total of Nobel laureates affiliated with Princeton was 36. Princeton claims laureates who attended as students or who were employed when they received the Prize <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> research leading to it. Woodrow Wilson, {{the former president}} of Princeton, was the first Princeton-affiliated laureate, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919. Four Nobel Prizes were shared by Princeton laureates: James Cronin and Val Logsdon Fitch won the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics, Russell Alan Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr. won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics, David Gross and Frank Wilczek won the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, and Thomas Sargent and Christopher Sims won the 2011 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. Seventeen Princeton laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physics, more than any other category. Twenty-five laureates were members of the Princeton faculty, 12 laureates received their Ph.D. at Princeton, and four laureates, Woodrow Wilson, Eugene O'Neill, Gary Becker, and Michael Spence, were Princeton undergraduates.|$|E
