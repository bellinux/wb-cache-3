25|$|In {{the tournament}} quarterfinals Royce and Sakuraba battled {{for an hour}} and a half (six 15 minute rounds). Gracie opened the fight aggressively, raining punches from Kazushi's back while the Japanese worked an armlock from standing, but Sakuraba kept calm, knowing Royce had no {{knockout}} power and expecting him to waste his energy; he even came to the point <b>of</b> <b>smiling</b> to the cameras during the attack (Sakuraba went on later to claim that he was actually greeting a cameraman who was a personal friend of his). Towards the end of the round, Sakuraba nearly ended the match with a kneebar, while Gracie came back with a guillotine choke at the second, but Kazushi again joked to show he was out of danger by simulating to pull down Royce's gi pants. Sakuraba switched to attack at the third round, dominating the stand up and making Royce lie repeatedly on the ground to avoid him. As the confrontation stretched on, the Gracie's own no time-limit rules began to work against Royce as Sakuraba's wrestling skills and balance nullified Royce's ability to score a takedown and—in some instances—even pull guard. Even Royce's ever-present jiu-jitsu gi became a weapon for the wrestler to use against him as Sakuraba used it to help him control Gracie on the instances the fight did come to the ground. However, with Sakuraba's control of the takedown, these instances of ground warfare became increasingly sporadic. After Kazushi landed a long series of punishing leg kicks at the fifth and sixth rounds, Royce's brother, Rorion threw in the towel.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{through which}} people perceive different types <b>of</b> <b>smiles</b> and judge their authenticity remain unclear. Here, 19 different types <b>of</b> <b>smiles</b> were created {{based on the}} Facial Action Coding System (FACS), using highly controlled, dynamic avatar faces. Participants observed short videos <b>of</b> <b>smiles</b> while their facial mimicry was measured with electromyography (EMG) over four facial muscles. Smile authenticity was judged after each trial. Avatar attractiveness was judged once in response to each avatar’s neutral face. Results suggest that, in contrast to most earlier work using static pictures as stimuli, participants relied less on the Duchenne marker (the presence of crow’s feet wrinkles around the eyes) in their judgments of authenticity. Furthermore, mimicry <b>of</b> <b>smiles</b> occurred in the Zygomaticus Major, Orbicularis Oculi, and Corrugator muscles. Consistent with theories of embodied cognition, activity in these muscles predicted authenticity judgments, suggesting that facial mimicry influences the perception <b>of</b> <b>smiles.</b> However, no significant mediation effect of facial mimicry was found...|$|R

2500|$|The modern {{presidency}} {{holds the}} president {{as one of the}} nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as [...] "propagandized leadership" [...] which has a [...] "mesmerizing power surrounding the office". Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo-ops <b>of</b> <b>smiling</b> presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras. One critic wrote the image of John F.

It is well known that adults from the general population express different types <b>of</b> <b>smiles</b> according to the social context. The common morphology <b>of</b> these <b>smiles</b> is the bilateral or unilateral raising of the lip corners as a part of various more or less complex facial configurations with different functional meaning. The type <b>of</b> <b>smile</b> universally associated most clearly with a discrete positive emotional state is that which includes, in addition to the bilateral raising of the lip corners, the raising of the cheeks (Ekman, Davidson & Friesen, 1990). Although also referred to by other terms, such as “felt smile ” or “full smile, ” this type <b>of</b> <b>smile</b> is most commonly known as the Duchenne smile, in reference to the nineteenth-century French anatomist who defined the expression corresponding to frank joy (Ekman, 1989).

40|$|SMILE (small {{heterodimer}} partner interacting {{leucine zipper}} protein) {{has been identified}} as a corepressor of the glucocorticoid receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α. Here we show that SMILE also represses estrogen receptor-related receptor γ (ERRγ) transactivation. Knockdown <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> gene expression increases ERRγ activity. SMILE directly interacts with ERRγ in vitro and in vivo. Domain mapping analysis showed that SMILE binds to the AF 2 domain <b>of</b> ERRγ. <b>SMILE</b> represses ERRγ transactivation partially through competition with coactivators PGC- 1 α, PGC- 1 β, and GRIP 1. Interestingly, the repression <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> on ERRγ is released by SIRT 1 inhibitors, a catalytically inactive SIRT 1 mutant, and SIRT 1 small interfering RNA but not by histone protein deacetylase inhibitor. In vivo glutathione S-transferase pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays validated that SMILE physically interacts with SIRT 1. Furthermore, the ERRγ inverse agonist GSK 5182 enhances the interaction <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> with ERRγ and SMILE-mediated repression. Knockdown <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> or SIRT 1 blocks the repressive effect of GSK 5182. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GSK 5182 augments the association <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> and SIRT 1 on the promoter of the ERRγ target PDK 4. GSK 5182 and adenoviral overexpression <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> cooperate to repress ERRγ-induced PDK 4 gene expression, and this repression is released by overexpression of a catalytically defective SIRT 1 mutant. Finally, we demonstrated that ERRγ regulates SMILE gene expression, which in turn inhibits ERRγ. Overall, these findings implicate SMILE as a novel corepressor of ERRγ and recruitment of SIRT 1 as a novel repressive mechanism for SMILE and ERRγ inverse agonist...|$|R
40|$|SMILE (small {{heterodimer}} partner interacting {{leucine zipper}} protein) {{has been identified}} as a coregulator in ER signaling. In this study, we have examined the effects <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> on other NRs (nuclear receptors). SMILE inhibits GR, CAR and HNF 4 α-mediated transactivation. Knockdown <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> gene expression increases the transactivation <b>of</b> the NRs. <b>SMILE</b> interacts with GR, CAR and HNF 4 α in vitro and in vivo. SMILE and these NRs colocalize in the nucleus. SMILE binds to the ligand-binding domain or AF 2 domain of the NRs. Competitions between SMILE and the coactivators GRIP 1 or PGC- 1 α have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, an intrinsic repressive activity <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> is observed in Gal 4 -fusion system, and the intrinsic repressive domain is mapped to the C-terminus <b>of</b> <b>SMILE,</b> spanning residues 203 – 354. Moreover, SMILE interacts with specific HDACs (histone deacetylases) and SMILE-mediated repression is released by HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, in a NR-specific manner. Finally, ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays reveal that SMILE associates with the NRs on the target gene promoters. Adenoviral overexpression <b>of</b> <b>SMILE</b> represses GR-, CAR- and HNF 4 α-mediated target gene expression. Overall, these results suggest that SMILE functions as a novel corepressor of NRs via competition with coactivators and the recruitment of HDACs...|$|R
