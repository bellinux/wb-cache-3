60|$|He stood {{upon the}} bridge thinking, but his {{thoughts}} would only go backwards, {{and would do}} nothing for him as to his future conduct. He remembered his first walk with her, and the churchyard elms with the setting sun, and the hot dances in Mrs. Tappitt's house; and he remembered them without much of the triumph of a successful lover. It had been very sweet, but very easy. In so saying to himself he by no means threw blame upon Rachel. Things were easy, he thought, {{and it was almost}} a pity that they should be so. As for Rachel, nothing could have been <b>more</b> honest <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> his <b>taste,</b> than her mode of learning to love him. A girl who, while intending to accept him, could yet have feigned indifference, would have disgusted him at once. Nevertheless he could not but wish that there had been some castles for him to storm in his career. Tappitt had made but poor pretence of fighting before he surrendered; and as to Rachel, it had not been in Rachel's nature to make any pretence. He passed from the bridge at last without determining what he would say when he reached the cottage, but he did not pass on till he had been seen by the scrutinizing eyes of Miss Pucker.|$|R
5000|$|A French press {{works best}} with coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew coffee filter, about the {{consistency}} of kosher salt. Finer grounds, when immersed in water, have lower permeability, requiring an excessive amount of force to be applied by hand to lower the plunger and are <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> seep through or {{around the perimeter of}} the press filter and into the coffee. Additionally, finer grounds will tend to over-extract and cause the coffee <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> bitter. Coffee is brewed by placing the ground coffee in the empty beaker and adding hot—between —water, in proportions of about [...] of coffee grounds to [...] of water, <b>more</b> <b>or</b> less <b>to</b> <b>taste.</b> The brewing time is about two to four minutes. The plunger is pressed to separate the grounds and hold them at the bottom of the beaker. The mesh piston normally does not compress the coffee grounds, as most designs leave a generous space—about —below the piston in its lowest position. If the brewed coffee is allowed to remain in the beaker with the used grounds, the coffee may become astringent and bitter, though this is an effect that some users of the French press consider desirable. It is believed that the optimum time for brewing the coffee is around four minutes, and some consider the coffee spoiled after about 20 minutes. Other approaches, such as cold-brewing, require several hours of contact between the water and the grounds to achieve the desired extraction.|$|R
60|$|These 'slashing articles' were, indeed, things which, {{had they}} {{appeared}} as anonymous pamphlets, would have obtained the contemptuous reception which in an intellectual view no compositions more surely deserved; but whispered as the productions of one behind the scenes, and {{appearing in the}} pages of a party review, they were passed off as genuine coin, and took in great numbers of the lieges, especially in the country. They were written in a style apparently modelled on the briefs of those sharp attorneys who weary advocates with their clever commonplace; teasing with obvious comment, and torturing with inevitable inference. The affectation of order in the statement of facts had all the lucid method of an adroit pettifogger. They dealt much in extracts from newspapers, quotations from the Annual Register, parallel passages in forgotten speeches, arranged with a formidable array of dates rarely accurate. When the writer was of opinion he had made a point, you may be sure the hit was in italics, that last resource of the Forcible Feebles. He handled a particular in chronology as if he were proving an alibi at the Criminal Court. The censure was coarse without being strong, and vindictive when it would have been sarcastic. Now {{and then there was a}} passage which aimed at a higher flight, and nothing can be conceived more unlike genuine feeling, <b>or</b> <b>more</b> offensive <b>to</b> pure <b>taste.</b> And yet, perhaps, the most ludicrous characteristic of these facetious gallimaufreys was an occasional assumption of the high moral and admonitory tone, which when we recurred to the general spirit of the discourse, and were apt to recall the character of its writer, irresistibly reminded one of Mrs. Cole and her prayer-book.|$|R
5000|$|....., chapbook {{writer and}} bellman, was born, it is believed, at Raploch, near Stirling, in 1724. He was much deformed, {{and found the}} {{wandering}} life of a chapman (<b>or</b> pedlar) <b>more</b> <b>to</b> his <b>taste</b> than any settled trade; but when the highland army of Prince Charles Edward {{was on its way}} south in September 1745, he gave up such occupation as he had, and followed the prince. It is probable he was merely a camp-follower, as he can scarcely have been a soldier, but he accompunied the forces to Derby, and back to Scotland, and was present at Culloden (16 April 1746). Five months later he published A full, particular, and true Account of the Rebellion in the year 1745-6.:Composed by the Poet, D. Graham,:In Stirlingshire he lives at hame.To the tune of [...] "The Gallant Grahams," [...] etc. This work is written throughout in a rough doggerel, but is historically useful as the undoubted testimony of an eye-witness. Its popularity was very great. No copies of the first or second (1752) editions are known to exist. Graham settled in Glasgow, and is said to have become a printer, but this is doubtful; at all events he became skellat, bellman or town-crier, of Glasgow about 1770. He is described as [...] "a bit wee gash bodie under five feet," [...] as being lame in one leg, [...] "with a large hunch on his back, and another protuberance on his breast." [...] He died on 20 July 1779. Graham wrote, under assumed names, a large number of chapbooks, such as Jockey and Maggys Courtship, The History of Buckhaven, Comical Transactions of Lothian Tom, History of John Cheap, the Chapman, Leper the Taylor, The History of Haverel Wives, Simple John and his Twelve Misfortunes, etc. All his works were exceedingly popular,and early editions have become very rare. Although coarse, they are not wanting in humour, and they are valuable to the student of folklore as containing very numerous references to current superstitions. Sir Walter Scott warmly appreciated Grahams talent, and so late as 1830 entertained the idea of printing a correct copy of the original edition of the rhyming history of the rebellion as his contribution to the Maitland Club publications. The idea was not carried out. Grahams collected writings were edited with notes, together with a biographical and bibliographical introduction, and a sketch of the chap literature of Scotland, by George MacGregor, 2 vols. 1883 (250 copies only).|$|R

5000|$|Maeun-tang (...) or spicy fish stew {{is a hot}} spicy Korean cuisine fish soup boiled with gochujang (Korean red chili pepper paste), kochukaru (chili powder), {{and various}} vegetables.

As its main ingredient, fresh or saltwater fish is cut into several pieces and boiled with ground beef, green vegetables such as watercress and garland chrysanthemum. Onion, radish, chilis, crown daisy, garlic, and sometimes zucchini and bean curd are added to the mixture to absorb the chili pepper paste which is the main flavoring of this dish. It is then seasoned with chili powder, garlic, soy sauce, and additional gochujang may be added once <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|R
