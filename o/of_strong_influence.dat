50|$|Clarence Stein {{attended}} the Ethical Culture Society’s Workingman’s School, which influenced {{his interest in}} the city life and social responsibility through its teaching. Stein was closely influenced by the founder of Ethical Culture, Felix Adler, and teacher, John Lovejoy Elliott, in involvement with movements and committees, such as the Hudson Guild Settlement House and the Progressive Reform movement in New York City at the turn-of-the-century. Therefore, Stein’s enrollment at Workingman’s School proved to be <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> <b>influence</b> on his later interests and achievements. The very principle of the Ethical Culture Society being “that an individual’s growth toward excellence comes from furthering the unlike excellence of others”, exemplifies the basis of Stein’s life achievements through the RPAA.|$|E

50|$|One {{should also}} {{take into account}} the fact that the {{variables}} of heritability and environmentality are not precise and vary within a chosen population and across cultures. It would be more accurate to state that the degree of heritability and environmentality is measured in its reference to a particular phenotype in a chosen group of a population in a given period of time. The accuracy of the calculations is further hindered by the number of coefficients taken into consideration, age being one such variable. The display of the influence of heritability and environmentality differs drastically across age groups: the older the studied age is, the more noticeable the heritability factor becomes, the younger the test subjects are, {{the more likely it is}} to show signs <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> <b>influence</b> of the environmental factors.|$|E
50|$|The Nordic Model, mainly {{refers to}} Nordic {{countries}} Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Finland but some include the Netherlands, also called 'Nordic corporatist' model because <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> <b>influence</b> of the corporatist {{elements such as}} labor unions and employers' organizations, advocates a highly developed and government-funded welfare state which provides generous unemployment benefits among other resources for the general public. Labor markets are kept mobile with easy firing and hiring, and government taking care of those laid off with unemployment benefits and retraining. The equality of the Nordic model is achieved through progressive taxation. As {{a result of the}} policy, Sweden, Denmark and Norway have the lowest income disparities in the world. Nordic countries have been enjoying high economic and productivity growth, but most remarkably they consistently conquer top spots in world happiness surveys.|$|E

Paleolimnological reconstructions from bottom sediments concurred with earlier studies showing the occurrence of eutrophication, and suggested climate change to be a co-driver of lake ecosystem change.

The study recommends the introduction of measures to reduce nutrient exports to the lake...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{have found}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> <b>influence</b> of {{magnetic}} field treatment on the starting stresses of individual dislocations in Czochralski-grown silicon (CZ-Si). It is shown that the exposure of CZ-Si samples with dislocations at room temperature to magnetic field reduces essentially the starting stresses for dislocation motion. The effect is absent in FZ-Si samples. We suppose that magnetic field causes the singlet-triplet transitions in thermally exited states of oxygen complexes in a dislocation core that changes the state of oxygen already situated on dislocations {{in such a way}} that the mean binding energy of oxygen with a dislocation is diminished...|$|E

The aim of this investigation has been the elucidation of the unusual signal sequence observed in earlier positive-ion MALDI experiments, which featured a spacing of 77 Da between the signals of fullerene-containing ions. Circumstantial evidence has been provided, which strongly indicates that the 77 Da correspond to a C 6 H 5 (phenyl) ligand.

40|$|Investigation of {{behavior}} of fast electrons in toroidal discharges was performed. The kinetic equation, describing evolution of fast particle distribution was derived and analyzed.

The role of ambipolar electric field was established and identified as an essential factor of the process of diffusion of fast electrons. The effect <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> <b>influence</b> of density profile on diffusion of fast particles was clearly demonstrated. Comparison with the experimental data, obtained on ZT- 40 M device, was carried out. The agreements with the results of these experiments is observed. ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{visualization}} {{results of}} highly-submerged cavitating water jet obtained with digital camera, {{the influences of}} related parameters such as: injection pressure, nozzle diameter and geometry, nozzle mounting (for convergent / divergent flow), cavitation number and exit jet velocity, were investigated.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this work}} was to {{estimate}} the parameters associated to the demand for açaí pulp in the retail market of Belém. Multiple regression analysis was applied to identify the key variables that impact on product consumption and to estimate the price and income elasticities and cross demand.

Fish and cassava flour were confirmed as complementary products <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> <b>influence</b> on the decisions of consumers. Product quality, with regard to its association to Chagas disease, also revealed a strong influence on product choice for household consumption.
