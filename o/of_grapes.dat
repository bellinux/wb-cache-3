5|$|The Columbia Gorge AVA {{is found}} in the Columbia Gorge. This region {{straddles}} the Columbia River, and thus lies in both Oregon and Washington; it is made up of Hood River and Wasco counties in Oregon, and Skamania and Klickitat counties in Washington. The region lies to the east of the summits of nearby Mount Hood and Mount Adams, situated in their rain shadows; thus, the region is significantly drier than the Willamette Valley. It also exhibits significant differences in elevation due to gorge geography, and strong winds common in the area also play a factor in the region's climate. This allows a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> to be grown in the Columbia Gorge. The region has nearly 40 vineyards, growing a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> including Syrah, Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot gris, Riesling, and Sangiovese.|$|E
5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and Malheur County. The region's climate is unique among AVAs in Oregon; the average temperature is relatively cool and rainfall is low, creating a shorter growing season. Current production {{is led by}} hardy grapes such as Riesling, Gewürztraminer, and Chardonnay. The climate also lends itself extremely well {{to the production of}} ice wine. However, the AVA is quite large and warmer microclimates within the area can also support different types <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.|$|E
5|$|All around are pubs and brothels. The Earl of Cardigan tavern is on {{one side}} of the street, and {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) with a bunch <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is adulterating a hogshead of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of Matthew Prior who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord successively of both the Rummer and Grapes and the Rummer".|$|E

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to evaluate the potentiality <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> residues {{to be used in the}} food industry. In the present work, the incorporation of 25, 50 and 75  g/kg <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> marc powder in fettuccini pasta preparation was evaluated over its cooking, nutraceutical and sensory properties. The results show that the incorporation of the dried by-product did not interfere in the water absorption and in the solid loss of the pasta after cooking. The addition <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> marc powder increased the total phenolic, condensed tannins, monomeric anthocyanin and compounds antioxidant capacity concentration in the cooked pasta due to the incorporation of polyphenols stemmed from grape. Sensory analysis showed that the incorporation <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> marc powder reduced the acceptance of aroma, aftertaste, flavor and appearance, regardless of the concentration of the dried residue added. Furthermore, the incorporation of 25  g/kg <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> marc powder presented the best overall acceptance, with lower changes of color, according to the CIELAB method. Based on the results, the addition <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> marc powder to pasta is an interesting alternative of use of this by-product, potentially reflecting on final product costs and representing an environmentally friendly way to manage industrial waste...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{attempts}} {{to estimate the}} technical efficiency <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> producers using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approach as well as survey data of 1388 farmers in Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong and Xinjiang Province in China, and clarify the relationship between technical efficiency and traceability information transfer. The results show that technical efficiency <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> producers ranges from 0. 8 to 0. 9 with a stable but low distribution; input of land and physical makes a great contribution to the increase of rural income which is followed by input of labor and agricultural machine; the level of technical efficiency has {{a significant impact on}} the traceability information transfer in the way that the higher the technical efficiency is, the higher the willingness for participants to transfer the traceability information will be. Therefore, the technical efficiency <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> producers should be increased to establish the grape traceable system, ensure the safety <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> products and improve the development <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> industry...|$|R
5|$|Grapes {{are mostly}} grown for making wine and vinegar as basic {{components}} of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or for eating as table grapes. Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour. Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with Southern Europe accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt. Wine production for Southern Europe was 37% of the world total in 2014, with Italy producing 4.8 mt, Spain 4.6 mt, France 4.3 mt, and Germany 0.9 mt.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the primary}} {{agricultural}} product from Rancho Camulos was wine. Ninety acres (360,000 m²) of vineyards were planted in the 1860s and Camulos wines and brandies were known throughout Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of Santa Barbara County, with 45 tons (40,900kg) <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> grown, making 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US gallons (3,000 L) of brandy. In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, wheat, corn and barley. Flower petals from roses grown at Camulos were shipped to Europe to make perfume.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} {{alcoholic}} drink in Switzerland is wine. Switzerland is notable for the variety <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> grown {{because of the}} large variations in terroirs, with their specific mixes of soil, air, altitude and light. Swiss wine is produced mainly in Valais, Vaud (Lavaux), Geneva and Ticino, with a small majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin. The most widespread varieties are the Chasselas (called Fendant in Valais) and Pinot noir. The Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino.|$|E

40|$|<b>Grape</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the oldest}} fruit crops domesticated by humans. The {{numerous}} uses <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> in making wine, beverages, jelly, and other products, {{has made it}} one of the most economically important plants worldwide. The complex phytochemistry of the berry is characterized by a wide variety of compounds, most of which have been demonstrated to have therapeutic or health promoting properties. Among them, flavonoids are the most abundant and widely studied, and have enjoyed greater attention among grape researchers in the last century. Recent studies have shown that the beneficial health effects promoted by consumption <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> and grape products are attributed to the unique mix of polyphenolic compounds. As the largest group <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> polyphenols, flavonoids are the main candidates considered to have biological properties, including but not limited to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective activities. Here, we discuss the recent scientific advances supporting the beneficial health qualities <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> and grape-derived products, mechanisms of their biological activity, bioavailability, and their uses as nutraceuticals.

5|$|The {{town centre}} was {{extensively}} remodelled in the 1970s, a scheme {{financed by the}} Showering family who owned the town's cider manufactories. The scheme included a new library (in a faithful copy of a former inn, The Bunch <b>of</b> <b>Grapes,</b> which had been demolished), and a new entertainment complex called The Centre, entirely in concrete, {{on the eastern side}} of the market square. When the allegedly Roman Chi Rho amulet was found in the Fosse Lane excavations in the 1990s, the complex was renamed The Amulet in honour of the find. It has recently been renamed again as The Academy.|$|E
5|$|While the {{cultivation}} <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> and fruit trees supported a flourishing wine {{industry in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries, the effects of Prohibition and a legacy of restrictive laws after its repeal devastated the industry. For 50 years, New Jersey was limited by law to one winery license for every 1,000,000 state residents, which by 1980 effectively allowed for only seven wineries. The growth of the state's winery industry has been bolstered by the 1981 New Jersey Farm Winery Act, which repealed many Prohibition-era laws and allowed many small growers to open new wineries.|$|E
5|$|The {{regional}} specialties {{that are}} a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. Geographical variation in eating was primarily the result of differences in climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually {{had to settle for}} cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates were available in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effects <b>of</b> including <b>grape</b> pomace in the diet of pigs on pork quality and oxidative stability of body fat enriched with omega- 3 fatty acids. Four treatments were compared: T 1) Control diet based on corn and soybean meal; T 2) Diet with inclusion of 3 % of a canola (50 %) and flaxseed (50 %) oil blend; T 3) Diet with inclusion of 3 % of the oil blend and sequential levels of 3 and 5 % <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> pomace; T 4) Diet with inclusion of 3 % of the oil blend and sequential levels of 6 and 10 % <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> pomace. Inclusion <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> pomace in the diet led to an increase (P 0. 10) with dietary inclusion of oils blend. Neither the inclusion of the oil blend, nor the grape pomace had any effect (P> 0. 10) on the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the loin samples, despite the higher PUFA content in the fat of pigs fed the oil blend. Antioxidant effect <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> pomace was not possible to prove when measured by TBARS, but the increased redness of the pork from pigs fed with this ingredient suggested a possible antioxidant effect <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> pomace...|$|R
30|$|Another {{potential}} use <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> pomace in {{pharmaceutical industry}} is {{as a drug}} delivery vehicle. Some drugs are either unstable or no soluble in water. Considering this, microemulsions <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> pomace are considered as suitable vehicle of delivery of topical antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant (tocopherol), steroidal, antibacterial, antifungal drugs and various local anesthetics. Kumar et al. (2014) achieve better drug absorption across skin compared to cream, gel or lotion. In these conditions, the pharmaceutical market would potentially receive benefit by the addition <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> pomace microemulsion as a raw ingredient and satisfy the consumers’ demand for organic, less toxic drugs.|$|R
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> can {{be pressed}} to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
5|$|González-Gordon worked most of {{his life}} for the family company González Byass, which specializes in making sherry. He was the fifth {{generation}} of the family to chair the company. While working for the firm he was involved in the making, tasting and commercialisation of sherry and in later years he also helped the company expand into producing brandy and several sorts of wine. Immediately after he finished his studies in 1946 he joined the business and started at the bottom with the picking and crushing <b>of</b> <b>grapes.</b> During this time he also learned about the solera system, which is used to age different type of liquids. His interest in oenology had only developed after visiting California the year he graduated. He visited California after previously being sent to New York by boat with twelve containers of wine. In 1955 he founded the first research center for viticulture and winemaking in Spain by establishing one at González Byass. For twenty years he was occupied as head of wine selection at the company. González-Gordon also served on the board of González Byass beginning in 1961, and was president of the company between 1993 and 1999. During this period González-Gordon managed to expand the business by exporting all over the world, including to the United States, United Kingdom, China and East Asia. After his time as president he continued to serve as an advisor to his son, Mauricio Junior, who took over his position. Apart from his work at González Byass González-Gordon also diverted some of his time towards the regulatory council of the sherry making industry, serving for 24 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate antioxidant activity of different parts <b>of</b> Shahani black <b>grape</b> berries. The antioxidant activity <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> berry juice, seed and skin extracts were measured by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (Ferric Ammonium Thiocyanate) and free radical scavenging activity (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) methods. Vitamin E and Butylated Hydroxy Toluene (BHT) were used as reference values. The free radical scavenging capacity <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> extracts followed this order: seed methanol extract> skin extract> grape juice> seed hexane extract. Meanwhile, inhibitions of lipid peroxidation of seed methanol and hexane extracts were the highest, grape skin extract activity was intermediate and that <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> juice was the lowest. It seems that the antioxidant activity <b>of</b> samples from <b>grape</b> seed and skin extracts to be mainly based on inhibition of lipid peroxidation, whereas the Antioxidant Activity <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> juice is based on free radical scavenging activity. The results indicate that Shahani black grape has potent antioxidant activity specially on lipid peroxidation and has beneficial effects on human health and help to prevent disease which are caused by free radicals...|$|R
