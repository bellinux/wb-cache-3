5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost. Another possibility is that long head hair {{is a result of}} Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups <b>or</b> <b>individuals,</b> however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E

5|$|The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reconstructed the child's face {{to provide}} the public with an {{estimation}} of the victim's appearance during life. They aimed to generate tips to a potential identity and to locate the individual <b>or</b> <b>individuals</b> responsible for the disposal of her body. After the reconstruction was released and news coverage began nationwide {{a large amount of}} public attention emerged; an estimated 56 million people viewed reports on the case. Half of these occurred within the first week after the body was found.|$|E
5|$|The Office of the Special Prosecutor {{was founded}} {{with the passage}} of a bill in the Icelandic {{parliament}} 10 December 2008. The aim was to investigate suspected criminal conduct leading up to, in connection with or {{in the wake of the}} banking crisis, whether these relate to the activities of financial undertakings, other legal entities <b>or</b> <b>individuals,</b> and, as appropriate, to follow up these investigations by bringing charges in court against those concerned.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies <b>or</b> <b>individuals</b> that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E

5|$|The {{east coast}} of the U.S. also began to consume more ice, {{particularly}} as more industrial and private customers found uses for refrigeration. Ice became increasingly used in the northeast of the U.S. to preserve dairy products and fresh fruit for market, the chilled goods being transported over the growing railroad lines. By the 1840s, ice was being used to transfer small quantities of goods further west across the continent. Eastern U.S. fishermen began to use ice to preserve their catches. Fewer businesses <b>or</b> <b>individuals</b> in the east harvested their own ice independently in winter, most preferring to rely on commercial providers.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren {{was officially}} {{described}} by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, who derived the bird's specific name {{derived from the}} Latin term elegans 'elegant'. He gave its location as the East Coast, but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia. Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described birds from the southern karri forests as subspecies warreni in 1916 {{on the basis of}} darker female plumage. However, others have not observed this subsequently and the consensus is that no separate subspecies are recognized. In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations <b>or</b> <b>individuals.</b>|$|E

5|$|The royal court {{consisted}} of leading nobles, office holders, ambassadors and supplicants who surrounded the king or queen. At its centre was the monarch {{and members of}} the Privy Chamber. Gentleman of the chamber were usually leading nobles <b>or</b> <b>individuals</b> with kinship links to the leading noble families. They had direct access to the monarch, with the implication of being to exert influence, and were usually resident at the court. Although increasingly based at the royal palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh, the monarch and the court were often itinerant, spending time at one of the royal palaces, such as Linlithgow, Sterling and Falkland, or undertaking a royal progress to a part of the kingdom to ensure that the rule of law, royal authority or smooth government was maintained.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its 66 {{years of}} operating, the orphanage took in {{approximately}} 2,500 individuals. Approximately four per cent of all boys who stayed there were orphans, whereas the remainder had living parents; {{most of them}} either came from poor or troubled families who were unable to afford to look after them. The orphanage also took in child migrants. Only boys from the ages of 5 to 16 were taken care there. However, the Sisters of Mercy sometimes took in families in need <b>or</b> <b>individuals</b> who were 3 years old or younger. One of the Sisters of Mercy's aims was to keep brothers together if possible, {{and if they had}} sisters, they would be housed at the St. Joseph's Orphanage. Although the building could only house up to 100 boys, the capacity rose to between 140 and 250 boys during the Second World War, far above the suitable capacity of the building.|$|E
5|$|Odes {{were first}} {{developed}} by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as Pindar, and Latin, such as Horace. Forms of odes appear {{in many of}} the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins. The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction, and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (<b>or</b> <b>individuals),</b> with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode. Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the qasida in Persian poetry.|$|E

5|$|Since the post-World War II timber boom {{driven by}} the need of raw {{materials}} from industrial countries, Sabah forests have been gradually eroded by uncontrolled timber exploitation and the conversion of Sabah forest lands into palm oil plantations. Since 1970, forestry sector have contributed for over 50% of the state revenue, of which a study conducted in 1997 revealed the state had almost depleted all of its virgin forests outside the conservation areas. The state government were determined to maintain the state biodiversity while {{to make sure the}} state economy continue to alive. While in the same time facing hard task to control such activities although there is laws to prevent it. In addition, the need for development and basic necessities also became an issue while to preserving the nature. Mining activities had directly released pollutants of heavy metals into rivers, reservoirs, ponds and affecting groundwater through the leaching of mine tailings. An environmental report released in 1994 reported the presence of heavy metal at the Damit/Tuaran River that exceeded the water quality safe levels for consumption. The water in Liwagu River also reported the presence of heavy metal which was believed to be originated from the Mamut Copper Mine. Forest fire also have become the latest concern due to drought and fires set by irresponsible farmers <b>or</b> <b>individuals</b> such as what happened in the 2016 forest fires where thousand hectares of forest reserve areas in Binsuluk of the west coast Sabah are lost.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Norwegian black metal scene were {{motivated}} to take violent action against this influence – for instance, the church burnings by black metal musicians Varg Vikernes, Samoth, Faust, and Jørn Inge Tunsberg, among others. While most bands <b>or</b> <b>individuals</b> did not go that far, an undercurrent of racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism continues to permeate parts of the black metal scene. Many Viking metal artists, however, including bands such as Enslaved and Einherjer, simply express interest in Vikings and Norse mythology and entirely reject the Satanic inclination of black metal, writing almost exclusively on Norse themes, without any racist or anti-Semitic undertones. Whereas black metal during the 1990s took a militant and destructive stance toward the status quo, Viking metal looked {{to the past and}} took a populist, anti-system approach which eschewed violence. Viking metal is both pre-Christian and post-apocalyptic– it looks to a pre-Christian past and imagines a post-Christian future. While opposition to Christianity drove the formation of Viking metal, some bands that play, or have played, Viking metal, such as Slechtvalk, Drottnar, and Holy Blood, subscribe to Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} North American {{calendar of}} the ELCA {{was different from}} its European counterparts in {{that it does not}} give equal weight (and sometimes gives no mention) to persons who may be commemorated in Scandinavian regions. One example would be the absence of St. Lucia on December 13, although she enjoys particular popularity in Sweden. But Lutheran calendars also differ amongst one another in North America, with some individuals commemorated on multiple calendars but on different days (e.g., St. Bernard of Clairvaux on August 19 in the LCMS and August 20 in the ELCA) <b>or</b> <b>individuals</b> commemorated on one calendar and not the other (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. on January 15 for the ELCA and C. F. W. Walther on May 7 for the LCMS); with the 2006 publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELW) as a replacement to the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW), some of these deficiencies in the ELCA calendar have been corrected. Within the ELCA, This Far by Faith and Libro de Liturgia y Cantico both prescribe calendars with additional commemorations specific to the ethnic communities they were intended to be used in (African Americans and Latinos respectively). The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has a different, somewhat minimized calendar when compared the LCMS and especially the ELCA.|$|E
