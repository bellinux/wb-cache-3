In 1743 John Roberts and Huw Bedward from Y Rhiw {{were found}} guilty {{of the murder of}} two shipwrecked sailors on the beach at Porth Neigwl on 6 January 1742, and hanged; Jonathan Morgan had been killed by a knife thrust into the nape <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> Edward Halesham, described as a boy, had been choked to death. A ship claimed to be from France unloaded illicit tea and brandy at Aberdaron in 1767, and attempted to sell its cargo to the locals; a Revenue cutter discovered salt being smuggled at Porth Cadlan in 1809; and a schooner en route from Guernsey to Scotland was reported to have offloaded lace, tea, brandy and gin at Y Rhiw in 1824.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the night, Kilroy was {{tortured}} and sodomized. He was then led {{out to the}} field and Constanzo killed him by chopping the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> head with a machete. His brain was then boiled on a nganga, an African metal pot that Constanzo used to stew human and animal remains. Kilroy's limbs were chopped off above his knees to facilitate his burial. A wire was inserted in his spinal cord to pull the bones out once the body decomposed. The cult members then dug a hole on the grounds and buried Kilroy's corpse.|$|E

500|$|Continuing {{from the}} cliffhanger ending in [...] "Colony", Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is beaten and kidnapped by [...] "Mulder", {{who is really}} the Bounty Hunter in disguise. When the real Mulder (David Duchovny) finds the wrecked hotel room, his sister Samantha {{explains}} that the Bounty Hunter will set up a hostage exchange to swap Scully for her. She further explains that the Bounty Hunter can only be killed by piercing the base <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> that his toxic alien blood is deadly to humans. Finally, Samantha reveals that the clones are the progeny of two original aliens, and worked at abortion clinics {{to gain access to}} fetal tissue. Their objective was to set up an extraterrestrial colony on Earth, an effort that has gone {{as far back as the}} 1940s. However, because the clones' experiments were considered to have tainted their alien race, the Bounty Hunter was sent to kill them.|$|E
500|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{anonymously}} given {{information about}} Jason's case, and they soon investigate. At the McPeck house, Jason says that angels {{came to him}} {{and one of them}} pinched the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> now his cancer is gone. [...] Scully examines his neck and finds an incision exactly like the one she received when she was abducted. Upon leaving, Scully finds The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in her car. The Smoking Man tells her that {{he was the one who}} saved Jason's life, and that since he is dying he wants to atone his previously evil behavior by giving the cure to Scully. Scully leaves, but not before The Smoking Man gives her his phone number. Scully traces the number to The Smoking Man's office address. He explains that he is dying of a cerebral inflammation that developed after his surgery (...) [...] [...] She agrees to go on a trip to retrieve the cure, but wears a wire, in order to send taped recordings of their conversations to Mulder.|$|E
2500|$|A friend {{described}} him during these difficult years: “A fellow of medium height, {{with a shock}} of dark brown hair, light brown eyes (Pan’s eyes) and a deeply lined face. He looks, and is, ill-nourished. When painting he gets pains in the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> in his back and becomes so keyed up that he cannot eat. But he still worries the canvas with his brushes and fingers until {{at least part of}} his vision is realized.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Daladier {{was born}} in Carpentras, Vaucluse. Later, he would become known to many as [...] "the bull of Vaucluse" [...] because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thick <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> large {{shoulders}} and determined look, although cynics also quipped that his horns were {{like those of a}} snail. During World War I, he rose from private to captain and company commander.|$|R

2500|$|In June 1902, Baird married Georgia O. Robertson at the Washington Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri.

2500|$|A Midrash {{noted that}} dots appear above the word [...] "and kissed him" [...] ( [...] , vayishakeihu) in [...] Rabbi Simeon ben Eleazar taught that {{wherever}} one finds the plain writing exceeding the dotted letters, one must interpret the plain writing. But if the dotted letters exceed the plain writing, one must interpret the dotted letters. In [...] the plain writing equals in number the dotted letters, so Rabbi Simeon ben Eleazar taught that [...] conveys that Esau kissed Jacob {{with all his}} heart. Rabbi Jannai replied that if this were so, {{there would be no}} reason for dots to appear over the word. [...] Rabbi Jannai taught that the dots mean that Esau wished to bite Jacob, but that Jacob's neck turned to marble and Esau's teeth were blunted and loosened. Hence the words [...] "and they wept" [...] in [...] reflect that Jacob wept because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> Esau wept because of his teeth. Rabbi Abbahu in Rabbi Johanan's name adduced support for that conclusion from Song of Songs [...] which says: [...] "Your neck is as a tower of ivory." ...|$|E
2500|$|The only {{surviving}} manuscript miniature by Rogier van der Weyden shows Philip the Good {{wearing a}} chaperon in style B. Next to him stands Chancellor Nicolas Rolin, using a less exuberant version of style B; only he has sufficient status to wear his chaperon indoors in the Duke's presence. Apart from the Bishop of Tournai, next to Rolin, {{all the other}} men are bare-headed, even Philip's young heir, {{despite the fact that}} several of them are high-ranking intimates who, like the Duke, wear the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece. But as far as can be seen, all have hats. [...] The man in grey seems to be carrying another sort of hat, but all the other ones visible are chaperons worn in style F, mostly with the cornettes to the front. The young Charles the Bold has his patte wrapped round the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> the man on the extreme right has his bourrelet further than usual down his back, with the patte hanging down from it. Most of the chaperons are black, although the man in blue has one in salmon-pink; black was having one of its earliest periods of being the most fashionable colour at the time.|$|E
5000|$|A miner here tied a stick <b>of</b> {{dynamite}} around <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> lit the fuse. Relatives {{and friends}} say they can't imagine {{why he did}} this. Of course {{this is only a}} theory, but he may have been tired of living.|$|R
60|$|When he was {{gotten on}} shore again, all his comrades came about {{him to see}} what he had got; he hung the string <b>of</b> beads round <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> ran dancing about with the other things in his hand, {{as if he had been}} mad.|$|R
60|$|And {{out here}} amongst the bees and blossom, where the {{blackbirds}} were improving each minute their new songs, {{and the air}} was so fainting sweet with scents, her heart would not be stilled, but throbbed as though danger were coming on herself; and she saw her son as a little boy again in a dirty holland suit with a straw hat down the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> flushed <b>and</b> sturdy, as he came to her from some adventure.|$|R
2500|$|Bella awakens {{from her}} {{transformation}} from human to vampire, {{aware of her}} new abilities, but unaware of changes within the coven, such as Jacob having imprinted on her child, Renesmee. While inside the house, the Cullens and Jacob are standing around Renesmee, when Bella approaches. Jacob grows fearful and attempts to grab Renesmee. Bella is extremely suspicious of Jacob's odd possessiveness of Renesmee. Jacob tells Bella of {{the one thing that}} neither he nor his pack has control and says [...] "it's a Wolf thing." [...] Bella becomes extremely agitated and tells Edward to take the child out of the room. Bella then grabs Jacob by the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> drags him outside. She throws him into the field and a heated conversation starts. Bella demands that Jacob stays away from Renesmee. Jacob says [...] "You know I can't do that." [...] Bella then punches him near a patch of trees. This move triggers the appearance of the Clearwaters, Seth and Leah both in wolf form. Jacob tells them that everything is fine. Jacob reminds Bella of the times they had in the past and asks her if she rejects to which she does. Jacob claims that there was a major reason why he imprinted on their child, because he and Renesmee were meant to be together but accidentally called Renesmee [...] "Nessie". This angers her even more when she notices that he nicknamed her after the [...] "Loch Ness Monster". When Bella attempts to attack Jacob again, Seth Clearwater lunges at her. She grabs him and throws him into a tree, slightly injuring him, as his wolf form absorbed most of the impact. Bella apologizes to Seth for injuring him. Jacob then rushes to check on him. It also appears that Bella's father, Charlie, has been attempting to contact the Cullens for updates on Bella's illness. They intend to tell him she didn't survive, which requires that they move away from Forks, Washington to protect their identities. Jacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, tells Charlie that Bella is in fact alive and well. He explains that Bella had to change in order to survive. Charlie, now confused about his daughter, wonders why she had to change. Jacob morphs into a wolf, revealing his tribe's shape-shifting power, but does not tell Charlie about vampires as this would put him in danger and become a target for the Volturi or Charlie might spread word across Forks.|$|E
