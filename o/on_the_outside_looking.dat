5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation {{about the idea of}} re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E

In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings.

500|$|Bustles Tracy Dye wrote that, in {{addition}} to [...] "7 Lessons About Life & Facing Fear", the song also reinforces the importance of pursuing other opportunities, the belief that [...] "material items don't lead to fulfillment", building new relationships and friendships, exploring new environments, {{and the concept of}} girl power. BuzzFeed's Aylin Zafar described [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "an anthem for anyone who has ever felt they were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>looking</b> into a place ... that they yearned to be a part of."

[...] Donna Dickens of HitFix concurred that the song's lyrics are about [...] "yearning to break free from suffocating parental expectations". Writing for Billboard, Taylor Weatherby identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a song about [...] "fantasizing over living a life you can’t," [...] to which he believes many people are able to relate. Derrick Gill of KXKX believes that the song is also based around the traditional saying [...] "Is the grass greener on the other side?" ...|$|E
2500|$|David Ansen of Newsweek {{said the}} film [...] "is lushly, impeccably mounted—perhaps too much so. Mendes, a superb stage director, has an {{innately}} theatrical style: everything pops {{off the screen}} a little bigger and bolder than life, but the effect, rather than intensifying the emotions, calls attention to itself. Instead of losing myself in the story, I often felt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in, appreciating the craftsmanship, but one step removed from the agony on display.

5000|$|The Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, {{built in}} 1543, {{is the oldest}} of the Old Goa churches still standing. Initially it was a parish church, then collegial. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>the</b> church <b>looks</b> like a small fortress; the {{entrance}} porch flanked by small cylindrical towers with cupolas is typical of late-Gothic and Manueline Portugal, particularly in the Alentejo region.

In the chancel, besides the altarpiece dedicated to Our Lady of <b>the</b> Rosary, there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall a carved alabaster cenotaph in Persian or Indian style, with the inscription: [...] "Aqui jaz Dona Catarina, mulher de Garcia de Sá, a qual pede a quem isto ler que peça misericórida a Deus para sua alma" [...] ("Here lies Dona Catarina, wife of Garcia de Sa, asks those who read this to asks mercy of God for the soul.")

50|$|Peniel Chapel, {{which was}} built by the Methodists, {{and was one of}} the first {{buildings}} to be completed in the settlement, was quite unlike most Welsh chapels. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> it <b>looked</b> like a Greek temple, while inside <b>the</b> pulpit was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> end wall rather than the more traditional long side wall. Methodists had begun a Sunday School in a house in 1805, and in 1808 Madocks gave them <b>the</b> land <b>on</b> a 99-year lease, subject to a peppercorn rent. It was completed in two and a half years — 18 months before the church — and the first service was led by Thomas Charles from Bala. Since Madocks and his family were there, he conducted the service in English, and the two men became friends, with Charles often visiting Tan-yr-Allt, where Madocks lived.|$|R
40|$|Dr. Kwan Hsu {{was neither}} a superstar nor a celebrity. Her name {{does not come}} up in conversations about {{important}} contributors to her field of biophysics nor is she instantly recognizable for her contributions to Portland State University 2 ̆ 7 s international program or the state of Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s business ties with China.

She was a peripheral member of a well-known Chinese family, but few in the United States know of or perhaps have interest in, but otherwise, she had no great connections or family ties to generate interest in her story. How does one process a collection for a woman who does not meet the traditional criteria for excellence or success or public interest for an archive? Where is the value to the larger historical narrative of our time in preserving the memories of someone who was non-remarkable, or, conversely, someone who may be even too unique to contribute to that greater narrative? These are the questions I wrestled with when I first came to this collection. As my research progressed, I realized that I faced more questions, and that to come to any understanding that might answer them, I {{was going to have to}} research the history of archives and archival processes. Science, the Cold War, Communist China, women, the immigrant experience, all of these issues became part of my thesis, however shallowly I was able to investigate them. Questions of identity and historiography, of power and discourse were explored. In the end, what I found was that a collection that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looked</b> unimpressive and unenlightening, could indeed be very valuable, and provide insight into any number of areas of current interest in historical research. This is that story...|$|R
