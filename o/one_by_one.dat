5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to incorporate a clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one.</b> Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E

5|$|Boogeyman 2 is a 2007 American supernatural horror film {{edited and}} {{directed}} by Jeff Betancourt and the sequel to the 2005 film Boogeyman. The film was written by Brian Sieve and stars Danielle Savre, Matt Cohen, Tobin Bell and Renee O'Connor. Savre portrays Laura Porter, a woman who witnessed her parents' murder alongside her brother as a child.

However, her fears become reality as her fellow patients are murdered <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one.</b> Once an outlaw {{has been found}} and shot (shooting the outlaw does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to the first-person {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must shoot the rapidly moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, or take the initiative and shoot first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E
