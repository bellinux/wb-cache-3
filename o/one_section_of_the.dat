5|$|<b>One</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M11 {{extension}} {{was due to}} tunnel under George Green in Wanstead.

5|$|M-72 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a state highway by 1919 along a segment of its current route. It was extended southward in the mid-1920s and westward in the 1940s. <b>One</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern highway added to M-72 in 1940 previously existed as M-208 in the 1930s east of Grayling. Another section of highway near Empire was disconnected {{from the rest of}} M-72 until the gap was eliminated later in the decade. All of M-72 was completely paved by the early 1960s. The highway was rerouted in a few places in the 1950s, and the last new segment shifted in 1973 near Kalkaska.|$|E
5|$|The crew of EO-19 {{conducted}} {{their first}} Extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, on July 14. Before the mission, {{the crew had}} trained to use special tools in order to release a stuck solar array on {{the exterior of the}} Spektr module. During the spacewalk, the pair cut a problematic restraint from the solar array. All but <b>one</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> array deployed successfully. They then proceeded to inspect a docking mechanism in preparation for the relocation of the Kristall module. The final task of the spacewalk was to inspect a solar array on Kristall that was not tracking the Sun properly. The excursion ended after five hours and thirty-four minutes outside the station.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into <b>one</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city of Łódź, which they later walled off {{to form a}} ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family {{was unable to find}} work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, other {{difficulties}} were surfacing. Sharon {{reported to}} Southern Command that <b>one</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roller bridge, being towed by Erez's brigade, had been damaged {{and that the}} engineers needed {{a few hours to}} repair it. He also requested additional forces to help secure the corridor, noting the stiff resistance facing Reshef's brigade. Sharon's report prompted Bar-Lev to alert Adan to prepare to open the corridor with his division. Sharon argued for Adan's division to cross the canal on rafts and to proceed with Operation Abiray-Lev without waiting for the bridges. Both Gonen and Bar-Lev rejected Sharon's suggestion since, without a secure corridor to the canal, Israeli forces on the west bank would be threatened with encirclement. Subsequently, Bar-Lev ordered that no more Israeli forces or equipment would cross to the west bank until the bridges had been laid.|$|E
5|$|Zimmerman {{returns to}} the Sanctuary also after his unit are killed by the attacks. Now believing Magnus is who she says she is, Zimmerman recounts {{the events of the}} plague to her; ten years ago, a {{contagion}} was released in Old City, transforming humans to cannibalistic creatures. When containing the city failed, the disease spread throughout the globe and despite her best efforts, Magnus could not find a cure and was eventually killed in Buenos Aires. Several world governments deployed nuclear weapons in an attempt to stop the threat until they fell. All Sanctuary personnel apart from Zimmerman were killed in the process. Only around 100,000 unaffected humans remain in colonies in the Arctic and remote islands. Jessica is revealed to be infected and alerts the creatures to the Sanctuary after she transforms, forcing Zimmerman to kill her. Both Magnus and Zimmerman fortify <b>one</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sanctuary so Magnus can learn, via computer files, how the plague started. Zimmerman is revealed to have been infected during his last skirmish, and sacrifices himself to buy Magnus more time.|$|E

5|$|As the {{gameplay}} {{designs were}} being implemented, Brown switched {{focus to the}} game's aesthetics. Scenes from the game were sketched on storyboards to aid development. Cauldron IIs game world, the witch's castle, was designed to resemble Palace Software's logo as an advertising tactic. Brown photographed separate screens {{of the game and}} assembled them into a complete map, showing the shape of his company's logo, for video game magazines. Enemy designs were similar to those in the previous game, based on the Halloween holiday. Brown envisioned a graphical effect for the game's narration, showing a book whose pages turned as the story is read. However, technical limitations at the time prohibited the implementation of such a visual effect. Brown also wanted the game's visuals to scroll seamlessly as the character moved through the game world, but flick-screening (showing <b>one</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world at a time) was more feasible. As with the previous game, Brown created a Plasticine model of the witch character as a reference for a painting that was used for the game's box art. The group tested the game prior to release and deemed it too challenging. They reduced the difficulty level so that more players could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|When US12 was {{designated}} in Michigan on November 11, 1926, {{along with the}} other original US Highways, it ran along a more northerly course. It originally replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 along Michigan Avenue in the state, the route of the much older St. Joseph Trail, a footpath used by Native Americans before European settlement in the area. It entered from Indiana as it does now, but it followed the Lake Michigan shoreline farther north to Benton Harbor–St. Joseph before turning eastward to run through Kalamazoo, Battle Creek and Jackson. In the Ann Arbor area, it followed a more northerly path into Detroit before terminating downtown. In the 1940s and 1950s, sections of the highway were converted into expressways and freeways. Starting in 1959, these freeway segments were renumbered as part of I-94, and in January 1962, US12 was shifted to replace US Highway112 (US112). That highway, when it {{was designated}} in 1926 replaced the original M-23 along the Chicago Road. Later, US112 replaced the first M-151 when the former was extended to New Buffalo in the mid-1930s. Since 1962, the highway has remained relatively unchanged aside from minor truncations in the city of Detroit. US112 previously had two business loops, both of which were renumbered Business US12 (Bus. US12) in 1962. In 2010, the Niles business loop was decommissioned, but the one in Ypsilanti remains. <b>One</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former US112 was renumbered US112S for a few years in the 1930s.|$|E
