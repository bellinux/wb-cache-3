The VNQDD campaigned mainly among these facets of societythere were few workers or peasants in its ranks. The party's popularity {{was based on a}} groundswell of anti-French feeling in northern Vietnam in the 1920s; many writers had assailed society for glorifying military actions against China, Champa, Siam and Cambodia, Vietnam's historical rivals, while neglecting to oppose French colonialism. The VNQDD admitted many female members, which was quite revolutionary for the time. It set about seeking alliances with other nationalist factions in Vietnam. In a meeting on July 4, 1928, the Central Committee appealed for unity among the Vietnamese revolutionary movements, sending delegates to meet with other organisations struggling for independence. The preliminary contacts did not yield any concrete alliances. The VNQDD also assailed the Vietnamese communists of Ho Chi Minh for betraying the leading nationalist of the timePhan Bội Châuto the French in return for a financial reward.

II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the trackless wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, Knobbly, and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge.

5|$|The match {{began as}} a scrappy affair, with plenty of {{challenges}} and little expansive football on show. The game's first notable chance went to Rooney, but Kolo Touré intervened and blocked his effort. Rooney then played in Giggs, whose shot was closed down by Sol Campbell. It took a while before Arsenal gained composure and played their usual passing game, and a move involving Edu and Fredrik Ljungberg in the 19th minute resulted in Rio Ferdinand carelessly tackling the latter. Ferdinand was not shown a card for his challenge – the first controversial decision referee Riley made during the match, which surprised Arsenal as the defender made a professional foul to prevent Ljungberg running clear on goal. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Reyes {{to open up the}} United defence, but the Dutchman's shot was saved by Roy Carroll. The United goalkeeper was on hand to save Henry's low shot three minutes before the break, after the striker was put through by Edu. During the first half action, both Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) were booked for fouling Reyes. Ashley Cole also received a yellow card for his tackle on Rooney. The Arsenal defender was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end</b> of a challenge by Van Nistelrooy minutes after, as he attempted to shield the ball and hold on to possession.

The reverse pattern of information flow was observed on correct responses. Our findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence indicating that the anterior insula rapidly detects and conveys error signals to dmPFC, while the latter might use this input to adapt behavior following inappropriate actions...|$|R
50|$|While reasons vary, in most stories, it {{is because}} extraterrestrials {{are looking for a}} new world to colonize or {{otherwise}} dominate. The aliens are often used to portray nearly all-powerful beings, placing <b>the</b> strongest forces <b>on</b> Earth at <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end</b> of attacks that they can barely understand. This theme is one of the earliest in science fiction, demonstrated by H. G. Wells in The War of the Worlds and Doctor Who, where the invasions in the 1960s, 70s and the 80s are small scale, and the invasions from the 1990s and later are more-large scale, in works such as Independence Day. In such scenarios, the author often uses deus ex machina to allow the invasion to be repulsed. In others, like Footfall and Worldwar, the author depicts aliens only slightly more advanced than the inhabitants of Earth, and are fought to a stand-still or defeated in battle. The opposite has also been depicted, with Earth becoming a refuge to aliens as seen in the Men in Black series of movies, and Alien Nation series.|$|R

40|$|Wave {{propagation}} is a ubiquitous concept throughout physics. When {{the aim is}} {{to focus}} a wave at a given point in space or time, the resolution that can be achieved is usually limited by diffraction. However, time reversal is a method which takes advantage of multipath elements in a given channel and uses them to obtain resolution beyond the diffraction limit. This is known as super-resolution. This remarkable ability of time reversal systems to focus beyond conventional limits has found applications ranging from ultrasound, to underwater acoustics, and electromagnetics. Multipath elements of a wireless channel usually degrade the performance of such systems, but using time reversal, the multipath elements can actually lead to an advantage. When a time reversal system at RF frequencies is implemented in a waveguide, the important governing parameters that influence the effectiveness are bandwidth, number of antennas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transmitting and <b>receiving</b> arrays, number of propagating modes, and reflections from terminations {{at the end of the}} waveguide. For single antennas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transmitting and <b>receiving</b> <b>ends,</b> fine focusing resolution in space and time can be obtained if the channel is dispersive enough.
