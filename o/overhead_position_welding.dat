30|$|Spray arc is {{required}} for thicker section than short arc. It is very suitable when a high deposition rate is needed and when deep penetration {{is required}} for welding of massive base materials that can tolerate high heat input. The large weld pool makes vertical or <b>overhead</b> <b>position</b> <b>welding</b> difficult, {{especially in the case}} of plain carbon steel and stainless steels. For joining steels, the transition current can be varied more than when welding aluminium alloys. A spray arc can be used with almost all common alloys containing aluminium and also nickel alloys, copper alloys, stainless steels, magnesium, and carbon steels (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Althouse et al. 2004; Robert and Messler 2004; Goecke 2005 a, b; Jeffus and Bower 2010). Despite the advantages of conventional spray arc, odd arc instabilities and disordered metal transfer have restricted its adoption. In spray arc mode, the current and voltage are almost steady, which leads to random droplet size and frequency (Hutt and Lucas 1982). Therefore, high fume, spatter, and heat input are generated. As a result of insufficient control, the weld quality can be adversely affected. It should also be noted that the argon-based shielding gas used to achieve spray arc is more expensive than CO 2. In view of these drawbacks, spray arc is unsuitable for aluminium, structural steel, coated steel, and high-strength steels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{prediction}} of welding parameters and weld bead geometry for GMAW process in <b>Overhead</b> T-fillet <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> (4 F) {{is presented in}} this paper. This <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> is applied in construction of steel structures and ship building. The task to discover the range of welding parameter that can deposit quality fillet <b>weld</b> in <b>overhead</b> <b>position</b> is difficult, {{and the cost of}} developing them by trial and error is high. Robotic GMAW welder is employed to weld in 4 F position with CO 2 shielding. The current, voltage and speed as parameters, wire extension at 13 mm constant. Only weld coupons are analyzed by macro-etching and the fillet geometry is plotted graphically to display the correlation with the respective welding parameter, particularly the heat input. Trend-lines with mathematical formulas are selected to develop the fillet geometry predictor. The predicted fillet geometry is validated by comparing with the values from actual welded coupons. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the predicting calculator is less than 1. 0 mm, it is therefore accurate and valid for industrial application...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: <b>Position</b> <b>welding</b> {{technology}} {{was developed by}} using disk laser-GMA hybrid welding in this research. Design/methodology/approach: The effect of hybrid welding parameters such as the shielding gas composition and laser-arc interspacing distance were investigated for the bead-on-plate welding. The pipe girth welding was implemented and the adequate arc welding parameters were selected according to the <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> from a flat <b>position</b> to an <b>overhead</b> <b>position.</b> Findings: The optimized shielding gas composition and laser-arc interspacing distance for disk laser-GMA hybrid welding were 80 % Ar- 20 % CO 2 and 2 mm, respectively for the bead-on-plate welding. The sound welds could be achieved even in the pipe girth welding, but the proper joint shape should be prepared. Research limitations/implications: The laser-arc hybrid welding was implemented for pipe girth welding {{as a kind of}} 3 -dimensional laser welding and the process parameters could be optimized according to the various target materials and sizes. Practical implications: The optimized process parameters for the disk laser-arc hybrid welding can extend the application of the laser hybrid welding technology.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} use of a modern welding power source {{equipped}} with advanced arc control functions. At the Laboratory of Welding Technologies of CTU in Prague we have focused on GMAW welding of steel using Sigma Galaxy, a modern welding power source produced by Migatronic. Sigma Galaxy is equipped with functions called Intelligent Arc Control and Sequence Repeat. According to the manufacturer, controlling an arc by these functions should significantly stabilize the welding process, lower the heat input and the deformation, and improve the weld quality. To evaluate the benefits of these functions completely, single V butt welds were performed on S 275 J 2 structural steel 10 mm in thickness (2 weld layers: root+capping layer) in PF and PG <b>positions.</b> <b>Welding</b> was monitored by the Welding Information System, and was compared with standard GMAW welding.

40|$|Laser welding {{has been}} {{increasingly}} utilized to manufacture {{a variety of}} components thanks to its high quality and speed. For components with complex shapes, the <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> needs be continuously adjusted during laser welding, which makes it necessary to know {{the effects of the}} <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> {{on the quality of the}} laser welds. In this paper, the weld quality under two (flat and horizontal) <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> were studied comparatively in the laser welding of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy, in terms of weld profiles, process porosity, and static tensile strengths. Results show that the flat <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> led to better weld profiles, less process porosity than that of the horizontal <b>welding</b> <b>position,</b> which resulted from the different actions of gravity on the molten weld metals and the different escape routes for pores under different <b>welding</b> <b>positions.</b> Although undercuts showed no association with the fracture positions and tensile strengths of the welds, too much porosity in horizontal laser welds led to significant decreases in the strengths and specific elongations of welds.

The weld edge is main characteristics of the <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> image, here the visual technique for detecting the <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> based on Hough transformation is proposed. The <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> can be detected and recognized through Hough transformation, while the weld edge image is detected using the Canny operators.

30|$|In {{order to}} control heat input and reduce spatter {{generation}} and fumes, power sources {{have been developed}} {{with the ability to}} release one drop for a sequence of arc and pulsed time. The arc uses direct current (e.g. pulsed GMAW) or alternative current (e.g. AC-GMAW) with different current waveforms. A pulsed arc can be used in all <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> and with all base material thicknesses in both manual and automatic welding systems. Out of <b>position</b> <b>welding</b> is also possible due to the lower than average current level. Because of the low heat input, this mode is suitable for filling gaps. It is widely used in the GMAW of aluminium (Kah et al. 2012). The method is suitable for welding all standard and high performance grades of stainless steel when nickel base or stainless steel filler metals are used. High alloy steels can also be welded by pulsed arc. Super austenitic stainless steel exhibits better mechanical and metallurgical properties with optimized parameters in GMA welding compare to conventional spray (Sathiya et al. 2012). Pulsed arc welding has applications in the shipbuilding industry, for example, out of <b>position</b> <b>welding</b> of high strength low alloy base materials in ship hull fabrication. The advantages of pulsed arc in shipbuilding are that its electrode efficiency is higher compared to flux-core arc welding (FCAW), and it can deliver lower hydrogen weld deposits (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Knopp and Lorenz 2002; Althouse et al. 2004; Laren 2004; Ueyama et al. 2005; Lebedev 2010; Torbati et al. 2011; Kah et al. 2013).|$|R

50|$|It is very {{difficult}} to achieve the highest standards of quality and safety using manual welding. This is due to certain <b>welding</b> <b>positions,</b> <b>overhead</b> and down-hand <b>welds</b> for example, often leading to faulty welds due to restricted access the user has in these <b>welding</b> <b>positions.</b> In order to have complete control over the weld pool, a perfect balance must be maintained between gravitational force and surface tension at every position of the torch.By using mechanised variants of the technique, certain parts of the welding process are handled by mechanical components. Note that a welder will always be monitoring and controlling the process. In an ideal situation, all welding parameters would be fully programmed before welding is started. In practice, however, the presence of variable constraints means that it is often necessary for the welder to make corrective interventions.|$|R

State-of-the-art CAD/CAM based manufacturing systems ease the creation of welding contours significantly but position deviations resulting, e. g., from workpiece tolerances or misplacements must still be compensated. Seam tracking systems are rather complicated to handle during process qualification as they require adjustment to a start position and are subject to be misguided by disturbances in the material. Besides, it is difficult to apply seam tracking to scanner-based micro welding operations.
