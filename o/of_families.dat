5|$|During the High Middle Ages, Crompton was a {{collection}} of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, swamp and a single corn mill, occupied by a small and close community <b>of</b> <b>families.</b> The area was thinly populated and consisted of several dispersed hamlets, including Whitfield, High Crompton, Cowlishaw, Birshaw and Bovebeale (above Beal). These hamlets were situated above the water-logged valley bottoms and below the exposed high moors. Owing to complicated local arrangements of land tenure, inheritance, and absentee landlords, the local lordship was weak, and Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. This slowly facilitated comparative freedoms and independence for the early people of Crompton, which encouraged the influx <b>of</b> <b>families</b> from the neighbouring parish of Rochdale, including the Buckleys, Cleggs, Greaves and Milnes.|$|E

30|$|Second, in most {{empirical}} studies, {{the level}} <b>of</b> <b>family</b> involvement is often measured as the proportion <b>of</b> <b>family</b> ownership and managerial rights in an enterprise.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} recent methodological and {{theoretical}} developments associated with studies <b>of</b> long-distance <b>family</b> migration. The {{starting point for}} the discussion is that previous quantitative-based studies have over-privileged economic-related outcomes, and masked the underlying social and cultural decision-making processes <b>of</b> <b>family</b> migrants. Emphasising the perceived merits of qualitative frameworks to tease out the 'non-economic' dimensions <b>of</b> <b>family</b> migration, the paper identifies two issues of concern. First, some current under-researched themes <b>of</b> <b>family</b> migration are illuminated, and an unfolding research agenda for qualitative studies <b>of</b> <b>family</b> migration is outlined. It is contended that this provides a useful entrée to future research activities. Second, and with this in mind, the paper stresses the need for more sophisticated analyses of the human agency <b>of</b> <b>family</b> migrants. Therefore, and building upon Halfacree's thesis of the intentional/unintentional agency <b>of</b> <b>family</b> migrants, an adaptation of Giddens' stratification model of action is presented. It is argued that this will allow a more structurationist reading <b>of</b> <b>family</b> migration decision-making processes, and a fuller understanding of non-economic processes and outcomes. Finally, the paper stresses the complementarity between qualitative and quantitative methods, and calls for the utilisation of mixed-method research designs for studies <b>of</b> <b>family</b> migration...|$|R
