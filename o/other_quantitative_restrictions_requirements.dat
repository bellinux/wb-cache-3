40|$|In {{response}} to the global Önancial crisis a new policy paradigm emerged in which capital controls and <b>other</b> <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> on credit áows {{have become part of}} the standard crisis prevention policy toolkit. A new strand of theoretical literature studies the use of capital controls in a context in which pecuniary externality justiÖes policy interventions. Within the same theoretical framework adopted in this literature, we show that the optimal design of crisis prevention (ex-ante) policies depends on the e§ectiviness of crisis management (ex-post) policies. This interaction between ex-ante and ex-post policies gives rise to a new rationale for the use of capital controls. SpeciÖcally, we show that when ex-post policies are e§ective in containing crises, {{there is no need to}} intervene ex-ante with capital controls. On the other hand, if crises management policies entail e¢ ciency costs and hence lose e§ectiveness, then the optimal policy mix consists of both ex-ante and ex-post interventions so that crises prevention policies become desirable. In our model, the optimal policy mix combines capital controls in tranquil times with real exchange rate support to limit its depreciation during crises times and yields welfare gains of more than 1...|$|R

40|$|Nontariff {{barriers}} {{have become}} one of the key issues in agricultural trade policy and trade negotiations. Laws and regulations of a country, in addition to being directly protective, often give administrators wide leeway for interpretation which results in restrictive trade flows. The domestic agriculture of most developed countries is protected by {{one or more of the}} following: <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions,</b> licensing <b>requirements,</b> variable levies, export subsidies, minimum import prices, import calendars, state trading, mixing regulations, health and sanitary regulations, and standards and labelling. Ultimately, nontariff barriers must be negotiated like tariffs and other protective devices. Key words: agricultural trade, international trade policy, trade restriction. Agricultural trade negotiations have become increasingly complex. As the General Agree-ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) partici-pants prepared for the so-called Tokyo Round of negotiations after the U. S. Trade Act of 1974 was passed, it was evident that there were different forces at work and different players in the commercial policy game as compared to other rounds of bargaining since World War II (for a historical review, see Tontz). The complexity of this "new situa-tion " is due in large part to nontariff trade barriers originating from technology and the administrative bureaucracies, which have made commercial problems of the mid-twentieth century unique. Nontariff barrier problems, along with ag-ricultural policy issues, were pushed into the background during the Kennedy Round negotiations of 1962 - 67. There was an initial underestimation of the nature and level of the ultimate significance of such barriers to the countries involved. Moreover, a common ag-ricultural policy for the European Community was being evolved during that period. Not until after formal negotiations were completed did participants in the bargaining realize the real importance of the nontariff barrier issue...|$|R
40|$|Prices for {{commodities}} such as {{minerals and}} metals have increased significantly {{over the past few}} years. At the same time, there has also been an increase in restrictions on the export of raw materials which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper provides information on the present situation regarding the use of export restrictions and international disciplines on these measures. Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions take various forms such as export duties, <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and licensing <b>requirements.</b> The number of countries applying export duties over the period 2003 - 2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current WTO rules, unlike <b>quantitative</b> export <b>restrictions</b> which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. Export restrictions have also been discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of export duties. Export restrictions, by creating a differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an advantage. Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives, not all rely on such restrictions. Alternative policy options with different trade impacts are used. In view of the significant impacts of export restrictions on global supply chains, transparency on the use and implementation of such measures should be substantially improved. transparency, <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions,</b> accession, export licensing, food security, conservation of natural resources, subsidy, raw materials, terms-of-trade, fiscal receipts, trade policy review, Doha Development Agenda, regional trade agreements, export restrictions, export duties, social objectives, tariff escalation, non-agricultural market access, WTO disciplines...|$|R

40|$|The subject {{developed}} in my thesis {{relates to the}} "Exclusions from prohibition of quantitative restrictions". The origin of these exclusions {{can be found in}} the internal market law and more precisely in the free movement of goods. The free movement of goods is one of the four fundamental freedoms on which is based the internal market of the European Union. The free movement of goods is ensured by removing fiscal and non-fiscal barriers that hinder trade between Member States and which are prohibited between Member States. The fiscal barriers involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties, all charges having equivalent effect and other fiscal barriers such as internal taxations. The non fiscal barriers involve direct <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> which are quotas and bans, as well as measures having equivalent effect to <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> (MEE). These non fiscal barriers are prohibited but they can be justified in some cases. Direct <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> almost disappeared while measures having equivalent effect to <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> may exist in various forms and variations.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of mobile and networked applications {{has resulted in}} an increased demand for execution “sandboxes”—environments that impose irrevocable restrictions on resource usage. Existing approaches rely on kernel modification for enforcing <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> (e. g., limiting CPU utilization of an application to 25 %). However, the general applicability of such approaches is constrained by the difficulty of modifying shrink-wrapped operating systems such as Windows NT. This paper presents a user-level sandboxing approach for enforcing <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> on resource usage of applications. Our approach actively monitors an application’s interactions with the underlying system, proactively controlling them to enforce the desired behavior. Our approach leverages a core set of user-level mechanisms that are available in most modern operating systems: fine-grained timers, monitoring infrastructure, debugger processes, priority-based scheduling, and pagebased memory protection. We describe implementation of a sandbox on Windows NT that imposes <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> on CPU, memory, and network usage. Our results show that application usage of system resources can be restricted to within 3 % of desired limits with minimal run-time overhead. ...|$|R

30|$|The nineties {{represent}} {{a paradigm shift}} in India’s economic policy making. The period witnessed significant changes in trade and industrial policies opening more avenues for private initiatives in the economy signaling {{a departure from the}} state-directed planned industrialization. The policy changes involved a concerted effort to integrate India {{with the rest of the}} world, by liberalizing trade, which could be classified into two broad groups: (a) those which were intended to reduce domestic distortions and (b) those intended to ease trade with the rest of the world. The rationale for import liberalisation by way of reduction in tariff rates and a movement away from the <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> was to bring cost reduction via lowering the prices of intermediate inputs and to enhance competitiveness of the final products. Controls via <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> which accounted for 90 per cent of items in the pre 1991 era, decreased dramatically to 51 per cent even as early as in 1994 – 95 (Joshi and Little, 1996).
