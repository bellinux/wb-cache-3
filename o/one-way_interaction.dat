The first is proactive, regular posting of new online content (digital photos, digital videos, text) and conversations, as well as the sharing of content and information from others via weblinks. The second part is reactive conversations with social media users responding to those who reach out to your social media profiles through commenting or messaging Traditional media such as TV news shows are limited to <b>one-way</b> <b>interaction</b> with customers or 'push and tell' where only specific information is given to the customer with few or limited mechanisms to obtain customer feedback. Traditional media such as paper newspapers, of course, do give readers the option of sending a letter to the editor, but this is a relatively slow process, as the editorial board has to review the letter and decide if it is appropriate for publication. On the other hand, social media is participative and open, as participants are able to instantly share their views on brands, products, and services. Traditional media gave control of message to the marketer, whereas social media shifts the balance to the consumer (or citizen).|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} the local phase {{relationship}} between the low-level atmospheric circulation and the sea surface temperature (SST) on the duration of atmospheric anomalies is statistically evaluated. Using 5 -day-average data from the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis, {{it is found that}} most of the long-lasting atmospheric anomalies are locally coupled with SST anomalies, with their number decreasing from the equator to the extratropics. The longerlasting anomalies tend to have relationships of cyclonic-over-cold or anticyclonic-over-warm phase in the extratropics, and cyclonic-over-warm or anticyclonic-over-cold in the Tropics. This preferential phase relationship of the long-lasting anomalies is consistent with a predominant ‘‘atmosphere-driving’ ’ situation in the extratropics and an ‘‘ocean-driving’ ’ one in the Tropics. A similar analysis using data from a <b>one-way</b> <b>interaction</b> model, with the ocean always forcing the atmosphere is carried out to compare the results with those from the reanalysis. The results show that the <b>one-way</b> <b>interaction</b> produces fewer (more) long-lasting anomalies in the extratropics (Tropics). These differences arise mostly in atmosphere-driving situations, namely, the cyclonic-over-cold or anticyclonic-over-warm phase relation. This suggests that ignoring the atmosphere’s feedback effect on the ocean can lead to erroneous damping (lengthening) of atmospheric anomalies in the extratropics (Tropics). 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new {{mechanism}} that induces barotropic {{instability in the}} ocean is discussed. It {{is due to the}} air–sea interaction with a quadratic drag law and horizontal viscous dissipation in the atmosphere. The authors show that the instability spreads to the atmosphere. The preferred spatial scale of the instability is that of the oceanic baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation. It can only be represented in numerical models, when the dynamics at this scale is resolved in the atmosphere and ocean. The dynamics are studied using two superposed shallow water layers: one for the ocean and one for the atmosphere. The interaction is due to the shear between the two layers. The shear applied to the ocean is calculated using the velocity difference between the ocean and the atmosphere and the quadratic drag law. In <b>one-way</b> <b>interaction,</b> the shear applied to the atmosphere neglects the ocean dynamics; it is calculated using the atmospheric wind only. In two-way interaction, it is opposite to the shear applied to the ocean. In <b>one-way</b> <b>interaction,</b> the atmospheric shear leads to a barotropic instability in the ocean. The instability in the ocean is amplified, in amplitude and scale, in two-way interaction and also triggers an instability in the atmosphere...|$|E

The rule {{takes into account the}} phase relationship between the low-level vorticity anomalies and the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies. Analysis of the frequency of persistent coupled anomalies for five-day average data shows that, in general, the ocean tends to force the atmosphere in the tropics while the atmosphere tends to force the ocean in the extratropics. The results agree well with those obtained independently using lagged correlations between atmospheric and oceanic variables, suggesting that the dynamical rule is generally valid. A similar procedure carried out using data from the NCEP global model run with prescribed SST (in which the coupling is one-way, with the ocean always forcing the atmosphere) produces fewer coupled anomalies in the extratropics. They indicate, not surprisingly, an increase in ocean-driving anomalies in the model.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that human learning and memory is mediated by multiple memory {{systems that are}} each best suited to different requirements and demands. Within the domain of categorization, at least two systems are thought to facilitate learning: an explicit (declarative) system depending largely on the prefrontal cortex, and a procedural (non-declarative) system depending on the basal ganglia. Substantial evidence suggests that each system is optimally suited to learn particular categorization tasks. However, it remains unknown precisely how these systems interact to produce optimal learning and behavior. In order to investigate this issue, the present research evaluated the progression of learning through simulation of categorization tasks using COVIS, a well-known model of human category learning that includes both explicit and procedural learning systems. Specifically, the model&# 39;s parameter space was thoroughly explored in procedurally learned categorization tasks {{across a variety of}} conditions and architectures to identify plausible interaction architectures. The simulation results support the hypothesis that <b>one-way</b> <b>interaction</b> between the systems occurs such that the explicit system "bootstraps" learning early on in the procedural system. Thus, the procedural system initially learns a suboptimal strategy employed by the explicit system and later refines its strategy.

40|$|International audienceThe last 810 {{years of}} a control {{integration}} with the ECHAM 1 /LSG coupled model are used to clarify {{the nature of the}} ocean-atmosphere interactions at low frequencies in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific. To a first approximation, the atmosphere acts as a white noise forcing and the ocean responds as a passive integrator. The sea surface temperature (SST) variability primarily results from short time scale fluctuations in surface heat exchanges and Ekman currents, and the former also damp the SST anomalies after they are generated. The thermocline variability is primarily driven by Ekman pumping. Because the heat, momentum, and vorticity fluxes at the sea surface are correlated in space and time, the SST variability is directly linked to that in the ocean interior. The SST is also modulated by the wind-driven geostrophic fluctuations, resulting in persistent correlation with the thermocline changes and a slight low-frequency redness of the SST spectra. The main dynamics are similar in the two oceans, although in the North Pacific the SST variability is more strongly influenced by advection changes and the oceanic time scales are larger. A maximum covariance analysis based on singular value decomposition in lead and lag conditions indicates that some of the main modes of atmospheric variability in the two oceans are sustained by a very weak positive feedback between the atmosphere, SST, and the strength of the subtropical and subpolar gyres. In addition, in the North Atlantic the main surface pressure mode has a small quasi-oscillatory component at 6 -year period, and advective resonance occurs for SST around 10 -year period, both periods being also singled out by multichannel singular spectrum analysis. The ocean-atmosphere coupling is however much too weak to redden the tropospheric spectra or create anything more than tiny spectral peaks, so that the atmospheric and oceanic variability is dominated in both ocean sectors by the <b>one-way</b> <b>interactions...</b>|$|R

The study used the 18 July to 5 August 1995 ARM-CART (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement-Cloud Atmospheric Radiation Test-bed) data, which was collected at the ARM-CART site in the mid-western United States and analyzed for single column modeling (SCM) studies. The new findings affirm the earlier findings that the vegetation, which increases the solar energy absorption at the surface together with soil and soil-moisture dependent processes, which modulate the surface, fluxes (particularly evapotranspiration) together help to increase the local rainfall. In addition, the results also show that for the particular study period roughly 50 % of the increased evaporation over the ARM-CART site would be converted into rainfall with the Column, while the remainder would be advected out to the large-scale.

The natural diffusion process from core cities to the periphery covers approximately 25 - 30 km, and the presence of international roads extends this range by 20 km. The results confirm the hypothesis of an endogenous growth pattern...|$|R
40|$|We present {{preliminary}} {{data on the}} flow-induced haemodynamic and structural loads exerted on a penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer (PAU). Specifically, <b>one-way</b> fluid–structure <b>interaction</b> analysis {{was performed on the}} aortic model reconstructed from a 66 - year-old male patient with a PAU that evolved into an intramural haematoma and rupture of the thoracic aorta. The results show that elevated blood pressure (117 mmHg) and low flow velocity at the aortic wall (0. 15 m/s 2) occurred in the region of the PAU. We also found a low value of time-averaged wall shear stress (1. 24 N/m 2) and a high value of the temporal oscillation in the wall shear stress (oscillatory shear index = 0. 13) in the region of the PAU. After endovascular treatment, these haemodynamic parameters were distributed uniformly on the luminal surface of the stent graft. These findings suggest that wall shear stress could be considered one of the major haemodynamic factors indicating the structural fragility of the PAU wall, which ultimately lead to PAU growth and rupture...|$|R
