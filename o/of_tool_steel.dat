40|$|This work {{addresses}} the events {{involved in the}} fracture <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> aiming to understand the effect of primary carbides, inclusions, and the metallic matrix on their effective fracture toughness and strength. Microstructurally different steels were investigated. It is found that cracks nucleate on carbides or inclusions at stress values lower than the fracture resistance. It is experimentally evidenced that such cracks exhibit an increasing growth resistance as they progressively extend, i. e., R-curve behavior. Ingot cast steels present a rising R-curve, which implies that the effective toughness developed by small cracks is lower than that determined with long artificial cracks. On the other hand, cracks grow steadily in the powder metallurgy <b>tool</b> <b>steel,</b> yielding as a result a flat R-curve. Accordingly, effective toughness for this material is mostly independent of the crack size. Thus, differences in fracture toughness values measured using short and long cracks must be considered when assessing fracture resistance <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> especially when <b>tool</b> performance is controlled by short cracks. Hence, material selection for <b>tools</b> or development <b>of</b> new steel grades should take into consideration R-curve concepts, {{in order to avoid}} unexpected tool failures or to optimize microstructural design <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> respectively.

40|$|Purpose: The {{economical}} impacts {{and complexity}} <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> justify {{the lot of}} efforts for their development,processing and application. In particular the main goal is the attainment of isotropic microstructures characterisedby homogeneous distribution of fine carbide particles and segregation free. The paper offers a review <b>of</b> thePowder Metallurgy <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> currently manufactured, their properties are discussed with particular regard totheir main application and attained performances. Design/methodology/approach: Powder Metallurgy {{is the way to}} make the goal, its alloying flexibility allowsthe production <b>of</b> new <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> that cannot be made by conventional processes, because of segregation andrelated hot workability problems. Findings: In practice, through the Powder Metallurgy route it is possible to achieve the highest levels ofproperties, specifically related to toughness, mechanical behaviour, wear and corrosion resistances of theproduced alloys. Research limitations/implications: The use of Powder Metallurgy route allows, through the HIP consolidationfrom tiny powder particles, to facilitate the production <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> alloy grades able to reach very high performances. Moreover the application of coatings can determin e further advantages. Practical implications: When using thin coatings, like PVD deposited layers, the PM steels more uniformlydistributed and fine carbide structure was found to give a clear improvement in the interface quality of therelative coated systems. Conversely, the less uniform traditional steels carbide distribution resulted in a lesscontinuous contact between the substrate and the coating. Originality/value: The paper demonstrate the superior value and perfomances <b>of</b> PM <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> and theirbetter adaptability to PVD coatings. In particular, cold working, plastics and high speed applications are themain interested and advantageously affected by the uniqueness <b>of</b> PM <b>tool</b> <b>steels.</b> Some comparison betweenequivalent traditional and PM <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> grades are presented...|$|R
