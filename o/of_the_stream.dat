5|$|From its {{headwaters}} downstream to the downstream-most {{crossing of}} the Scranton/Moosic line, the drainage basin of Stafford Meadow Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From that point downstream to its mouth, the stream is classified as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A large section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> from its headwaters to the lower Pennsylvania Route 307 bridge meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream {{at least as far}} upstream as river mile 6.82 and as far downstream as its mouth. The stream was stocked with 500 adult and fingerling rainbow trout in 1894–1895. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Fish Commission speculated that there were native brook trout in part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E

The forested land occurs primarily on the valley slopes, while the bottom of the valley contains a number of small farms.

In lacks a riparian buffer in parts of Scranton. However, there are large hemlock stands along the stream above Lake Scranton.
