25|$|Parental {{views are}} perhaps the most {{essential}} factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society. The values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent's <b>occupational</b> <b>status.</b> Parents from the professional class tend to raise their children to become curious independent thinkers, while working class parents raise their children to have a more communal perspective with a strong respect for authority. Middle class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values while working class parents emphasize external values.|$|E
25|$|While many Americans cite {{income as}} the prime {{determinant}} of class, <b>occupational</b> <b>status,</b> educational attainment, and value systems are equally important variables. Income is in part determined by the scarcity of certain skill sets. An occupation that requires a scarce skill set which is attained through higher educational degree, and which involves higher autonomy, responsibility and influence, will usually offer higher economic compensation. Qualifying for such higher income often requires that individuals obtain the necessary skills (e.g., by attending law, medical, or postgraduate school) and demonstrate the necessary competencies. There are also differences between household and individual income. In 2005, 42% of US households (76% among the top quintile) had two or more income earners; as a result, 18% of households but only 5% of individuals had six-figure incomes. To illustrate, two nurses each making $55,000 per year can out-earn, in a household sense, a single attorney who makes a median of $95,000 annually.|$|E

30|$|Such {{a result}} is {{strictly}} {{related to the}} peculiar comparative design of the study. Intergroup comparisons are the most frequent type of comparisons in studies of immigrant populations.

25|$|Decrees {{were made}} in January 1982 {{concerning}} official recognition of persons and bodies responsible for noise monitoring, the monitoring of carbon monoxide and benzene levels in the atmosphere at workplaces, and the inspection of electrical installations. A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations. A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery (listed in a decree of April 1981) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved. It also specified the {{information to be provided}} by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an <b>occupational</b> <b>status</b> for this group of people. In June 1982, a new popular savings book paying index-linked interest was introduced, under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 (FF 20000 for households) savings in that scheme. Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings. A banking law of January 1984 entitled individuals lacking current accounts who had been refused by three banks to ask the Bank of France to designate a bank or the postal bank to provide them with free accounts.|$|E
500|$|MTBI has a {{mortality}} rate of almost zero. The symptoms of most concussions resolve within weeks, but problems may persist. These are seldom permanent, and outcome is usually excellent. The overall prognosis for recovery {{may be influenced}} by a variety of factors that include age at the time of injury, intellectual abilities, family environment, social support system, <b>occupational</b> <b>status,</b> coping strategies, and financial circumstances. People over age55 may take longer to heal from MTBI or may heal incompletely. Similarly, factors such as a previous head injury or a coexisting medical condition have been found to predict longer-lasting post-concussion symptoms. [...] Other factors that may lengthen recovery time after MTBI include psychological problems such as substance abuse or clinical depression, poor health before the injury or additional injuries sustained during it, and life stress. Longer periods of amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the injury may indicate longer recovery times from residual symptoms. [...] For unknown reasons, having had one concussion significantly increases a person's risk of having another. Having previously sustained a sports concussion {{has been found to be}} a strong factor increasing the likelihood of a concussion in the future. Other strong factors include participation in a contact sport and body mass size. The prognosis may differ between concussed adults and children; little research has been done on concussion in the pediatric population, but concern exists that severe concussions could interfere with brain development in children.|$|E

2500|$|In the US, Richard A.

Originally, it was Peterson (1992) who coined the term 'cultural omnivore' to address an anomaly observed in the evidence revealed by his work with Simkus (Peterson and Simkus, 1992) which showed that people of higher social status, contrary to elite-mass models of cultural taste developed by French scholars with French data, were not averse to participation in activities associated with popular culture. The work rejected the universal adaptation of the cultural capital theory, especially in the 20th century in advanced post-industrialist societies like the United States.|$|E

30|$|Finally, we further {{explore the}} {{underlying}} mechanisms through which macro-level factors such as region and industry characteristics affect income inequality among different social groups. Our findings show that both region and industry factors affect the level of income inequality for different genders, urban and rural residents, different educational groups, party members and non-members, different <b>occupational</b> <b>statuses,</b> and different types of work unit. Especially, as the proportion of state-owned entities in an industry increases, the income gaps among various social groups widen substantially.

30|$|In this paper, we use pooled {{longitudinal}} {{data from the}} Labour Force Survey (LFS) collected by the Italian Institute for National Statistics (ISTAT).

Significant residual correlations, observed in the UK and in Southern countries, mask respectively penalties to upward mobility and an insurance against downward mobility. Insignificant residual effects encompass significant penalties to both downward and upward mobility in Germany and France, a parachute for self-employed in Ireland and no patterns in Nordic countries. In quantile regressions, residual background correlations appear to increase along the earnings distribution. Even if we are not able to provide causal explanations, we suggest that in unequal countries results would hardly agree with a standard human capital explanation. intergenerational occupational mobility, index of social mobility, economic returns to intergenerational occupational mobility, international comparison. ...|$|R
