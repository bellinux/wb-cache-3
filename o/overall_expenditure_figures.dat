40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} attendees' perceived importance and performance of two major exhibitions in China and to understand the impact of the performance dimensions on attendees' <b>overall</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The results of the paired-sample t-test found that there were significant differences between attendees' perceived importance and performance of the two exhibitions. The results of the importance-performance analysis showed that 10 out of 21 attributes were in the area of "keep up the good work," 2 were in the area of "concentrate here," 8 were in the area of "low priority," and 1 was in the area of "possible overkill. " Principal component analysis on the 21 attributes generated 4 factors. A multiple regression was performed to test the relationship between attendees' satisfaction with the four factors and their <b>overall</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The result showed that two out of four factors-F 2 : Hotel, Food, and Attractions and F 4 : Facilities-were significant predictors for attendee's <b>overall</b> <b>expenditure.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the ongoing debate about economic inequality in India during the post-reform period. We analyze consumption inequality through the hitherto neglected lens of nonfood expenditure. Using household level consumption expenditure data from the quinquennial "thick" rounds of the NSS, we show that inequality within food and non-food groups has declined, even as <b>overall</b> <b>expenditure</b> inequality has increased over time. We suggest that the rise in <b>overall</b> <b>expenditure</b> inequality {{is due to the}} increased weight in the household budget of non-food spending, which tends to be more unequal than food spending. We also show that inequality is very different across broad non-food items. Durables, education, healthcare, and consumer services show the most rapid increases in real expenditure, and also display the highest levels of inequality. Finally, we offer some possible mechanisms for this phenomenon and suggest policy measures to deal with this form of inequality...|$|R

We find that urban-rural disparity constitutes 15 %- 25 % of <b>overall</b> <b>expenditure</b> inequality. A large difference exists between {{urban and rural areas}} in the magnitude of inequality among districts. After controlling for the urban-rural difference, inequality among districts accounts for 15 %- 25 % of overall inequality. While disparity between five major island regions is almost negligible, inequalities between districts within provinces appear to have played an increasingly important role in both urban and rural areas. Given unequal geographic distributions of resource endowments, public infrastructure, and economic activities, some spatial inequalities are inevitable. Nevertheless, sustained efforts are necessary to reduce spatial inequalities to facilitate national unity, cohesion, and stability.

40|$|The thesis aims {{to analyse}} how Social Services are {{organised}} and financed in Chile, {{with a special}} focus on the regional impact of social policies. In the first place, the study concentrates on describing the procedures and strategies that each social ministry or sector, (Health, Education, Housing, Social Security) has for financing its programmes. This makes possible {{for the first time}} in the Chilean case an intersectoral view of the organization of social services. In order to address this issue it was necessary to investigate the formal sectoral organization and its functions. Special emphasis is given to the analysis of the ministerial budgeting and planning procedures discussing its links and problems. The study also gauges the discretionary powers that the regional social services have; this was approached through the analysis of different models of decentralization and government functions. To obtain information in this area, interviews were undertaken with social sector planning and budgeting specialists. Since 1975, the Government has advocated a new "regionalization" policy, aimed at decentralising the power of national Government, eliminating regional inequalities, and reducing poverty. In the second place, therefore, the study analyses the patterns of the regional allocation of social expenditures testing its relation to regional well-being, urbanization and needs. To address this issue it was necessary to define some standard criteria to allocate the actual social <b>expenditure</b> <b>figures.</b> However, to obtain the social <b>expenditure</b> <b>figures</b> it was necessary to study the inter- and intra-ministerial transfers and price indexes. Estimates of regional social expenditures per capita are produced for the first time for Chile; they cast light on the present pattern of regional allocation of social <b>expenditures.</b> These <b>figures</b> are then compared with regional social indicators of need in order to determine the relationship between these variables.
