500|$|On September 18, the airmen woke up {{very early}} to make final preparations. A weather {{observation}} aircraft took off {{an hour before}} the first B-29 to report the latest meteorological conditions along the path ahead. Dumbo and Super Dumbo aircraft (B-17s and B-29s rigged for air-sea rescue) stood by, on alert. With the airfield lit by truck headlamps, Number 1 commanded by Giles was first to take off, a little after 6:00 local time, as dawn began to glow in the east. Next, LeMay's ship took off at 6:15am, 4:15pm Eastern War Time in Washington, with Lieutenant Colonel Kingsbury at the throttles and First Lieutenant Potts at the controls. O'Donnell's Number 3 took <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes later.

500|$|During the campaign, Missouri was {{involved}} in a friendly fire incident with the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate [...] According to the official report, on 25 February, Jarretts Phalanx CIWS engaged the chaff fired by Missouri as a countermeasure against enemy missiles, and stray rounds from the firing struck Missouri, one penetrating through a bulkhead and becoming embedded in an interior passageway of the ship. Another round struck the ship on the forward funnel, passing completely through it. One sailor aboard Missouri was struck in the neck by flying shrapnel and suffered minor injuries. Those familiar with the incident are skeptical of this account, however, as Jarrett was reportedly over [...] away at the time and the characteristics of chaff are such that a Phalanx would not normally regard it as a threat and engage it. There is no dispute that the rounds that struck Missouri did come from Jarrett, and that it was an accident. The suspicion is that a Phalanx operator on Jarrett may have accidentally fired <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> rounds manually, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this.|$|E

[...] Four days later the group left for a tour of American arenas but Liam refused to go; the band decided to continue the tour with Noel on vocals. Liam rejoined the tour on 30 August, and on 4 September 1996, Oasis performed [...] "Champagne Supernova" [...] at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

This event prompted media speculation that the group were splitting up. The brothers soon reconciled and decided to complete the tour.|$|E

He took a shortcut off Texas highways 77 and 83 to reach the house, and recalled going over [...] at some point, and brushing <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cars along the way by gesturing with his left hand. Once he reached Rancho Viejo, he ignored the entrance and drove instead through a field of palm trees. As he drew closer to Fischer's house, he heard police sirens at a distance. When he arrived, he saw his son's body holding a garden hose. The running water had covered the entire roadway with Fischer's blood. Witnesses, including Eric, recall seeing a short-bearded Hispanic man in his mid-20s driving a white, four-door vehicle with Mexican license plates speeding away after the attack. Kathy then phoned one of Fischer's closest friends before school started and asked him if he knew if Fischer had any enemies. Fischer's friend could not think of anyone who disliked him, and only recalled that he and Fischer had been in an altercation with a group of boys at a football game.|$|E
