5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are <b>only</b> <b>too</b> aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 28 January, Surcouf {{captured}} the 12-gun Diana, loaded with 6000 bags of rice. The next day, Cartier met a 26-gun Indiaman, Triton, armed with 12-pounders and a 150-man crew; having decided to attack, and recognising <b>only</b> <b>too</b> late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent, Surcouf, feeling threatened and unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men. After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag, before hoisting French colours {{at the very last}} moment and launching a violent assault. In the ensuing 45-minute battle, Triton suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed, including her captain, Captain Burnycat, and the first officer, Picket; The prisoners were transferred to Diana, which Surcouf released against a 30,000 rupee ransom.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be <b>only</b> <b>too</b> aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E

5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was <b>only</b> <b>too</b> happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E
25|$|Yet the law itself remains {{problematic}} {{not only}} because of the threat the language carries in France, but because it is even now being considered for emulation by countries that lack France’s commitment to rule of law and human rights. Such a model serves <b>only</b> <b>too</b> well as cover for those nations who persecute under the guise of law enforcement.|$|E
25|$|Allen {{retired in}} 1958, and Burns tried to soldier on without her. The show was renamed The George Burns Show {{with the cast}} intact except for Allen. The locale of the show was changed from the Burns home to George Burns' office, with Blanche Morton working as Burns' {{secretary}} so she could help Allen {{keep an eye on}} him. Allen's absence was <b>only</b> <b>too</b> obvious and impossible to overcome. The renamed show barely lasted a year.|$|E

25|$|The regency under Isabella Maria was {{extremely}} unstable; discord reigned in the government, there were {{divisions within the}} municipal councils, rivalries between ministers and at one point, after the resignation of General Saldanha, a revolt in Lisbon. With Princess Isabella Maria dangerously ill, Peter resolved to entrust his brother Miguel with the kingdom, which Miguel was <b>only</b> <b>too</b> eager to accept. A decree was promulgated on July 3, 1827 that granted Miguel his new role, and he departed from Vienna for Lisbon.|$|E
25|$|Shaftesbury's {{philosophical}} {{activity was}} confined to ethics, religion, and aesthetics where {{he was one of}} the earliest writers to bring into prominence the concept of the sublime as an aesthetic quality. For metaphysics, properly so called, and even psychology, except so far as it afforded a basis for ethics, he evidently had no taste. Logic he probably despised as merely an instrument of pedantic judgment for which, in his day, and especially at the universities, there was <b>only</b> <b>too</b> much ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} between what Bob had become, {{and what he}} saw himself as, led him to be impulsively inclined to follow the lead set by the more headstrong Terry, who led them recklessly into one scrape after another. Bob usually blamed his drinking, heavy smoking, poor diet and reckless behaviour on Terry, a view Audrey and Thelma <b>only</b> <b>too</b> willingly agreed with. This may have been true in part, but actually Bob needed little persuasion to stay out drinking with Terry or to behave accordingly.|$|E

25|$|The {{implication}} {{of all this}} is that the Mercian submission to Alfred – a crucial step {{in the creation of a}} single English kingdom – occurred not just because of one battle, Alfred's victory over the Great Army at Edington in 878, but also because of another, more distant battle, 'God's revenge' on the Mercians at the Conwy, when Anarawd of Gwynedd and his brothers defeated Æthelred and so brought about that collapse of the Mercian hegemony in Wales from which Alfred was <b>only</b> <b>too</b> pleased to benefit.|$|E
25|$|Like a juggler keeping three {{balls in}} the air at once, Bonaparte had to balance the dangers of the three sectors against each other, keeping them in clear {{relative}} perspective. Although he had singled out Alvinczi as his main target, it was <b>only</b> <b>too</b> clear that an aggressive move on the part of Davidovich or even by Wurmser might compel the French to abandon their operations against the main Austrian army and move every available man to reinforce the threatened area. Defeat on any sector could well spell catastrophe and the destruction of the Army of Italy.|$|E
25|$|The Judsons were {{instrumental}} {{in the development of}} the early infrastructure of Lynden and Whatcom County. At the request of Judson, Holden enlisted the help of the native Nooksack Indians to remove the Little Jam (which they were <b>only</b> <b>too</b> glad to do), working for three months. After the Little Jam was removed, Holden and Phoebe raised $1,500 to hire a contractor, Judge Plaster, to remove the Big Jam, which he completed in 1877. Judson served breakfast and lunch for the Indian workers on both occasions. In addition, she and Holden blazed the first trail to what is now Fishtrap Creek, then the site of a communal fishtrap.|$|E

25|$|As an {{unmarried}} and childless empress, it was imperative for Elizabeth {{to find a}} legitimate heir to secure the Romanov dynasty. She chose her nephew, Peter of Holstein-Gottorp. Elizabeth was <b>only</b> <b>too</b> aware that the deposed Ivan VI, whom she had imprisoned in the Schlusselburg Fortress and placed in solitary confinement, {{was a threat to}} her throne. Elizabeth feared a coup in his favour and set about destroying all papers, coins or anything else depicting or mentioning Ivan. Elizabeth had issued an order that, should any attempt be made for him to escape, he was to be eliminated. Catherine II upheld the order and when an attempt was made he was killed and secretly buried within the fortress.|$|E
25|$|In episodes {{broadcast}} in 1987, Angie secure herself {{a job as}} the manageress of The Vic's rival drinking establishment, The Dagmar. Owner, James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), is <b>only</b> <b>too</b> happy to have Angie's expertise on board for his new, suave wine bar. Angie and Den continue to row constantly and in a bid for revenge, Angie vows to take Den 'to the cleaners' for her divorce settlement. In retaliation, Den installs his mistress, Jan, as the new landlady of The Queen Vic, which only infuriates Angie even more. However, Den and Jan's cohabitation eventually leads {{to the end of}} their relationship, when Den decides that Jan is too posh for him, and so by the summer of that year orders her to leave.|$|E
25|$|Scooter's uncle J.P. Grosse {{owns the}} theatre, and rents {{it to the}} Muppets, as Scooter is <b>only</b> <b>too</b> happy to remind Kermit. In a deleted scene from It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, Kermit reveals that J.P. has died and left the theatre to the Muppets in his will. This would have taken place some time after 1996, as J.P. can be seen (and {{referred}} to as such {{by the head of}} the KMUP network) in episode 107 of Muppets Tonight, the 1990s reworking of The Muppet Show. The Muppet Theater is shown to be in New York City as Rachel Bitterman plots to tear down the Muppet Theater and build a club. She is thwarted when Pepe the King Prawn manages to get the Muppet Theater to be made into a national landmark.|$|E

25|$|The {{privateer}} Robert Surcouf had had {{a successful}} cruise in the Indian Ocean capturing several vessels, including the pilot boat Cartier, which he renamed Hasard. He transferred his remaining men from his ship Émilie to Hasard and on 28 January, sighting Triton at anchor, decided to attack. He recognised <b>only</b> <b>too</b> late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent. Surcouf, feeling unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men, After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag, before hoisting French colours {{at the very last}} moment and launching a violent assault. In the ensuing 45-minute battle, Triton suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed, including Burnyeat and the first officer, Picket; Surcouf transferred his prisoners to Diana, another vessel that he had captured, and which he released to her captain against a 30,000 rupee ransom.|$|E
25|$|Minuit and {{his family}} joined the Dutch West India Company, {{probably}} in the mid 1620s, and was sent to New Netherland in 1625 to search for tradable goods other than the animal pelts which were then the major product coming from New Netherland. He returned in the same year, and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland, taking over from Willem Verhulst. He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4, 1626. Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 guilders. According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley, Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys, chief of the Canarsees, who were <b>only</b> <b>too</b> happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of a separate University of Bucharest Art History Department for Tzigara was a project which split the academic and political world. At the core of such disputes was Nicolae Iorga, from the History Department, who argued that his own courses also covered art, and who consequently became Tzigara's main adversary. The proposal of expanding University was also defeated in Parliament by Lahovary, the Senate president, who probably still resented for his 1906 comments. The debates prolonged themselves over the following years. In 1909, Tzigara-Samurcaș, Grigore Tocilescu and George Murnu competed {{with each other for}} the Archeology Chair, and this created a dispute over whether art historians could not lecture in archeology (Murnu eventually won the contest, despite being exposed for plagiarism by Tzigara, in articles for the magazine Noua Revistă Română). The same year, he was in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, where he visited the Skansen, Bygdøy and Lyngby open-air museums, but suggested that a similar project would be redundant at home, arguing that peasant society in Romania was <b>only</b> <b>too</b> visible around Bucharest. He was much more impressed with the Nordic Museum, which reportedly became the template for his Bucharest museum.|$|E
