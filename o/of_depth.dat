5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software on the console. This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> (through computer stereo vision and Structured light) within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range <b>of</b> <b>depth,</b> although the camera could only allow a video capture of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, empty space where the camera was unable to capture video within the field <b>of</b> <b>depth.</b> Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the video capture within the view of the virtual camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works of others in the Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E
50|$|The same {{factors that}} {{determine}} <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field also determine <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> focus, but these factors can have different effects {{than they have}} in <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field.

For distant subjects (beyond macro range), <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> focus is relatively insensitive to focal length and subject distance, for a fixed f-number.

40|$|NACA model 11 -C {{was tested}} with four {{different}} <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> step {{to obtain information}} as to the effect <b>of</b> the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> step on the water performance.

Small <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> step were found to give lower resistance at speeds below and at the hump speed of the model and greater <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> step lower resistance at high speeds.

5|$|A simple record <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> {{and time}} for a dive is useful as a legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control <b>of</b> <b>depth,</b> by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E

5|$|As {{technology}} improved, measurement <b>of</b> <b>depth,</b> {{latitude and}} longitude became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points.

This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E

5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar.

CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion <b>of</b> <b>depth,</b> as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E
