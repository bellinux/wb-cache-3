5|$|From January to October 1890, Morris serialised his novel, News from Nowhere, in Commonweal, {{resulting}} in improved circulation for the paper. In March 1891 {{it was published}} in book form, before being translated into French, Italian, and German by 1898 and becoming a classic among Europe's socialist community. Combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction, the book tells the tale of a contemporary socialist, William Guest, who falls asleep and awakes in the mid-20th century, discovering a future society based on common ownership and democratic control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems; it was a depiction of Morris' ideal socialist society.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist revisionism of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing {{the abolition of the}} eleven plus exam.|$|E
5|$|While many Manhattan {{scientists}} {{expected that}} the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> delivery {{of the atomic bomb}} would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the proximity fuze program, expected that it would involve considerable effort. The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where a scale model of the Fat Man plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.|$|E

25|$|Collectivist anarchism advocates the {{abolition}} of {{both the state and}} private ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the collectivization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.|$|E

30|$|Theorem  4.6 {{suggests}} that R_σ is an approximation for a threshold that decides stability {{in a way}} similar to the basic reproduction number.

25|$|Like anarchist-communists, anarcho-syndicalists seek {{to abolish}} the wage system and private {{ownership}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production, which they believe lead to class divisions.

40|$|Basic {{decision}} theory for discrete random variables <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multivariate geometric (power series) type is developed.

25|$|Lord Gladwyn {{pointed out}} that the German Free Democrats were in {{coalition}} with the German Social Democrats.

25|$|The more {{production}} {{comes to}} rest on exchange value, hence on exchange, the more important do the physical conditions of exchange — the means of communication and transport — become for the costs of circulation.

25|$|Like other Lutheran church bodies, the ELCA confesses {{at least}} two Sacraments: Communion (or the Eucharist) and Holy Baptism (including infant baptism).

25|$|Marxist socialists {{ultimately}} {{predict the}} emergence of a communist society based on the common ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production, where each individual citizen would have free access to the articles of consumption (From each according to his ability, to each according to his need). According to Marxist philosophy, equality in the sense of free access is essential for freeing individuals from dependent relationships, thereby allowing them to transcend alienation.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{the history}} of civilization, these {{preconditions}} did not exist, and taxes were based on other factors. Taxes on wealth, social position, and ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production (typically land and slaves) were all common. Practices such as tithing, or an offering of first fruits, existed from ancient times, and can be regarded as a precursor of the income tax, but they lacked precision and certainly were not based on a concept of net increase.|$|E
25|$|Collectivist anarchism (also {{known as}} anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary form of anarchism, {{commonly}} associated with Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume. It is a specific tendency, {{not to be confused}} with the broad category sometimes called collectivist or communitarian anarchism. The tendency emerged from the most radical wing of mutualism during the late 1860s. Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized, being made the joint property of the commune (municipality).|$|E
