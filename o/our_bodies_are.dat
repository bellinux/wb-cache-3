500|$|With the Lords of the Welsh Marches now in rebellion, Montfort {{solicited}} {{the aid of}} Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales. Llywelyn {{agreed to}} help, in return for full recognition of his title and the promise that he could keep all military gains. Whatever benefits this alliance might have brought Montfort, the large concessions cost him popularity at home. Meanwhile, Edward laid siege {{to the town of}} Gloucester, which fell on 29 June. Montfort's goal now became to unite with the forces of his son Simon, and engage with the royal army, but the younger Simon moved much too slowly westwards from London. Eventually Simon made it to the baronial stronghold of Kenilworth, but [...] Edward managed to inflict great losses on Simon's forces, many of whom were quartered outside the castle walls. From there the Prince moved south, where on 4 August, using many banners captured at Kenilworth to deceive Montfort into thinking his reinforcements were arriving, he managed to trap the older Montfort in a loop of the Avon, blocking off the only bridge and thereby forcing Montfort to fight without his son's reinforcements. When Montfort realized this, he allegedly commented: [...] "May the Lord have mercy upon our souls, as <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> theirs." ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. In psychology, the way {{in which}} we {{perceive}} <b>our</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> what is called “body image”, a concept which is associated with our social and psychical functioning. A positive image of one’s own <b>body</b> <b>is</b> connected with being attractive, having high self-esteem, high self-confidence and general satisfaction with life [1]. Therefore, contentment, or lack thereof, of one’s body comprises an emotional element of body image [2]. The feelings we have towards <b>our</b> <b>body</b> <b>are</b> changing all the time, as well as other behaviours and are conditioned by individual circumstances and mood. Nevertheless, ou...|$|R

2500|$|In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins {{describes}} {{an approach to}} life-extension that involves [...] "fooling genes" [...] into thinking the body is young. Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to Peter Medawar. The basic idea is that <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, {{we should be able}} to prevent these genes from switching on, and {{we should be able to}} do so by [...] "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Joseph Smith, {{the founder}} of the Latter Day Saint movement, taught: [...] "There {{is no such thing as}} {{immaterial}} matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes; We cannot see it; but when <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> purified we shall see that it is all matter." [...] This spirit element has always existed; it is co-eternal with God. It is also called [...] "intelligence" [...] or [...] "the light of truth", which like all observable matter [...] "was not created or made, neither indeed can be". Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints view the revelations of Joseph Smith as a restoration of original Christian doctrine, which they believe post-apostolic theologians began to corrupt in the centuries after Christ. The writings of many of these theologians indicate a clear influence of Greek metaphysical philosophies such as Neoplatonism, which characterized divinity as an utterly simple, immaterial, formless, substance/essence (ousia) that transcended all that was physical. Despite strong opposition from many Christians, this metaphysical depiction of God eventually became incorporated into the doctrine of the Christian church, displacing the original Judeo-Christian concept of a physical, corporeal God who created humans in His image and likeness.|$|E

30|$|Merleau-Ponty {{says that}} the common man needs the {{perceptive}} faith to live, to move around, to communicate, even to socialize. However, our eyes are no longer pure.
