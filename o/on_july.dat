5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 27. Initially, virgorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. <b>On</b> <b>July</b> 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235miles (375km) east-southeast of Barbuda.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued to organize, and subsequent {{to the development of}} a low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Caribbean Sea, the hurricane maintained a northwest trajectory. It passed south of Jamaica <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 1, where heavy rainfall flooded roads and railways. The hurricane crossed western Cuba <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 3. High winds {{on the island}} destroyed hundreds of houses, and the storm's rainfall damaged the tobacco crop.

5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather near Panama {{drifted to}} a location south of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression Four-E <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 9. It moved westward through {{a hostile environment}} of strong shear. The wind shear disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the shear, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 12 and was named Cristina. This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned {{to the north and}} peaked <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 14. Then, the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into a swirl of clouds <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 16, without ever threatening land. No impact was reported.|$|E
5|$|An {{unstable}} area {{developed a}} circulation {{and became a}} tropical depression <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 4. It headed west- northwest and became a tropical storm <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 7. The next day, it was a hurricane {{and turned to the}} west. Continuing to strengthen, it reached Category4 intensity <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 9. This windspeed was the highest of the season. The hurricane turned to the southwest and gradually weakened. By July 11 it was nearly stationary. It then headed northwestward again and continued weakening, becoming a tropical storm <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 13. It weakened into a depression <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 14 and dissipated immediately thereafter. Denise brought winds of near-gale force to parts of Mexico, but otherwise caused no damage or casualties.|$|E

5|$|Beryl {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about}} 18hours as it paralleled the Mid-Atlantic and New Jersey coasts, during which an eye-like feature {{developed in the}} center of the convection.

Steering winds ahead of an approaching mid-level trough caused Beryl to accelerate northeastward, and early <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket. The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200UTC <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod.

5|$|By July 11, dry air and {{unfavorable}} {{wind shear}} prevented the convection from developing near the center. The low became elongated, though <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 12 the overall convection became more concentrated {{as it turned}} to a northeast drift. An approaching mid-level trough caused the system to accelerate northeastward across Florida Panhandle, though upon doing so the thunderstorm activity quickly diminished. <b>On</b> <b>July</b> 13, forecasters expected the system to be absorbed by the approaching trough. However, the low pressure area emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean near North Carolina early <b>on</b> <b>July</b> 14, and upon doing so its convection increased and became better organized.
