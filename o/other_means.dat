5|$|The Battle of the Eastern Solomons was unquestionably an American victory, but it {{had little}} {{long-term}} result, apart from a further reduction in the corps of trained Japanese carrier aviators.

In May 1958, York also began working with Lincoln Labs, MIT's radar research lab, to begin researching ways to distinguish warheads from decoys by radar or <b>other</b> <b>means.</b> This project emerged as the Pacific Range Electromagnetic Signature Studies, or Project PRESS.|$|E

5|$|As in {{many other}} African societies, prebendalism and high rates of {{corruption}} continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote rigging and <b>other</b> <b>means</b> of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E
5|$|Businesses {{that employ}} 50 {{or more people}} but do not offer health {{insurance}} to their full-time employees pay a tax penalty if the government has subsidized a full-time employee's healthcare through tax deductions or <b>other</b> <b>means.</b> This {{is commonly known as}} the employer mandate. This provision was included to encourage employers to continue providing insurance once the exchanges began operating. Approximately 44% of the population was covered directly or indirectly through an employer.|$|E
5|$|Export is {{a special}} resource, only {{available}} to the three Asian civilizations, and is used to hire foreign troops and research technologies from the consulate, where the player can choose a foreign ally or, for the Japanese, isolationism. Export is generated automatically when the villagers are gathering, but its gather rate is much slower than other resources, making it challenging to afford a large foreign army. Export Rate / Experience points are also generated by <b>other</b> <b>means</b> (like sacred cows for Indians) and are specific to each clan.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Dull began {{a search}} for a new {{official}} symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and <b>other</b> <b>means</b> to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot.|$|E
5|$|In his {{comprehensive}} study, Soviet Military Deception in the Second World War, Glantz {{summarized the}} Russian doctrine as involving both active and passive deception and surprise.

Some species such as the red-naped sapsucker sally into the air to catch flying insects, and many species probe into crevices and under bark, or glean prey from leaves and twigs. The rufous {{woodpecker}} specialises in attacking the nests of arboreal ants and the buff-spotted woodpecker feeds on and nests in termite mounds. Other species such as the wrynecks and the Andean flicker feed wholly or partly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Paraguay is a {{landlocked}} country and {{for much of}} its history it was difficult of access, except by sailing from the Atlantic up the River Paran√° and hence the River Paraguay (see map) as the early Spanish explorers had done. There were <b>other</b> <b>means</b> of ingress, but they would have required an invading force to be resupplied through difficult and hostile country. So the command of the river was key {{to the security of}} Paraguay, who feared and distrusted its two much larger neighbours Brazil and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some <b>other</b> <b>means,</b> and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E

5|$|The Australian-designed and {{manufactured}} Type 3 Teleradio transmitter/receiver {{had been developed}} prior to the war by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) (AWA) to provide long-range wireless communications across Australia and in the surrounding islands of New Guinea, the Solomons, and Fiji where the plantations, airstrips, mines and settlements were widely separated.

Following the September11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City when all general aviation was grounded, one of the first planes to fly over the World Trade Center site was a CAP aircraft taking photographs.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} {{center at}} the mosque also suffered. The once well stocked library at al-Azhar was neglected, and manuscripts of Fatimid teachings that were held at al-Azhar were destroyed. The Ayyubid dynasty promoted the teaching of Sunni theology in subsidized madrasas (schools) built throughout Cairo. Student funding was withdrawn, organized classes were no longer held at the mosque, and the professors that had prospered under the Fatimids were forced to find <b>other</b> <b>means</b> to earn their living.|$|E
