25|$|As of 4 January, {{there is}} almost total {{blackout}} in Gaza City, North Gaza, Middle Area and Khan Yunis. 90% of the telephone network, including both cellular service and land lines, is down, since it depends on backup generators with dwindling fuel stocks. Since the Israeli ground operation, 75% of Gaza's electricity has been cut off and the Palestinian technicians face difficulties reaching damaged lines because of the military attacks. As of 7 January, much {{of the population of}} the Gaza Strip continues to live without electricity. By 16 January, the twenty first day of the attacks, most households still do not have any electricity. As of 22 January, twenty five days after the beginnings of the attacks, 40 percent of the 1.5 million population remains without electricity. The remaining 60 percent receive only intermittent supply that can reach only 6 hours per day in the north of the Gaza strip. Spare parts and <b>other</b> <b>equipments</b> are a priority. After 8 days of the ceasefire, a month since the beginning of the attacks, the power plant is working on only one turbine, producing 30 MW instead of the daily full capacity of 80 MW cause of the lack of industrial fuel. By 29 January, the electricity situation has returned to its pre-27 December status, with much of the Gaza strip receiving only intermittent electricity. Certain areas are receiving very little power as a result or some low-voltage lines breakage. In order to meet demand throughout the territory, GEDCO (Gaza Electricity Distribution Co.) has put in place a power cut schedule where Gaza and North Gaza will face power cuts of eight hours three times a week; and the Middle Area and Khan Yunis will face power cuts of 6–8 hours twice per week. Those cuts does include unintentional power cuts.|$|E
500|$|... "Up in the Air" [...] was {{released}} on March 18, 2013, as the lead single from the album. It premiered {{on the same day}} from the International Space Station, after being launched aboard a spacecraft loaded with scientific experiments and <b>other</b> <b>equipments.</b> Critical reception to the song was mostly positive, with much of the praise going to its sonic variety and introspective lyrics. The track peaked at number three on the Alternative Songs in the United States and garnered significant commercial outcomes internationally, reaching the top fifteen of Finland, Lebanon, Portugal, and Russia.|$|E

60|$|Out on {{the main}} road leading to the {{principal}} bridge over the river the sun was boiling hot, and many a soldier felt more like seeking shelter and resting than like pushing forward with his heavy gun and <b>other</b> <b>equipments.</b> But General Lawton was here and there, encouraging every one, and they pushed on until a sharp fire between the enemy and the advance guard told that a running fight, and perhaps a regular battle, would soon be at hand.|$|E

He plays rough pranks, too, on occasion; and has a big horse-laugh in him, {{where there is a}} fop to be roasted, or the like. We will leave him for the present, in hope of other meetings.|$|E

60|$|The party now crowded {{round the}} Snake, {{and began to}} {{question}} him with eagerness. His replies were somewhat vague, and but partially understood. He told a long story about the horses, from which it appeared {{that they had been}} stolen by various wandering bands, and scattered in different directions. The cache, too, had been plundered, and the saddles and <b>other</b> <b>equipments</b> carried off. His information concerning Mr. Miller and his comrades was not more satisfactory. They had trapped for some time about the upper streams, but had fallen into the hands of a marauding party of Crows, who had robbed them of horses, weapons, and everything.|$|E
60|$|The Poughkeepsie {{was only}} a sloop-of-war, or a corvette, in construction, number of her guns, and rate; {{but she was a}} ship of the {{dimensions}} of an old-fashioned frigate, measuring about one thousand tons. The frigates of which we read half a century since, were seldom ever as large as this, though they were differently built in having a regular gun-deck, or one armed deck that was entirely covered, with another above it; and on the quarter-deck and forecastle of the last of which were also batteries of lighter guns. To the contrary of all this, the Poughkeepsie had but one armed deck, and on that only twenty guns. These pieces, however, were of unusually heavy calibre, throwing thirty-two pound shot, {{with the exception of the}} Paixhans, or Columbiads, which throw shot of even twice that weight. The vessel had a crew of two hundred souls, all told; and she had the spars, anchors, and <b>other</b> <b>equipments</b> of a light frigate.|$|E
60|$|Raoul saw he had {{rather more}} than an hour to spare. To fight the felucca, unsupported, against so many enemies, and that in a calm, was quite out of the question. That small, low craft might destroy a few of her assailants, but she would inevitably be carried at the first onset. There was not time to get the ballast and <b>other</b> <b>equipments</b> into the lugger, so as to render her capable of a proper resistance; nor did even she offer the same {{advantages}} for a defence, unless in quick motion, as the ruins. It was determined, therefore, to make the best disposition of the two vessels that circumstances would allow, while the main dependence should be placed on the solid defences of stone. With this end, Ithuel was directed to haul his felucca to a proper berth; the first lieutenant was ordered to get as much on board le Feu-Follet as possible, in readiness to profit by events; while Raoul himself, selecting thirty of his best men, commenced preparing the guns on the rocks for active service.|$|E

6000|$|The Banquetting House {{is now a}} sort of {{military}} and naval museum; with the swords and saddles and uniforms and <b>other</b> <b>equipments</b> of divers English heroes in glass cases, and models of battle-ships, and {{of the two most}} famous English battles, likewise under glass. I was not so vain of my reading about battles as not to be glad of seeing how the men-of-war deployed at Trafalgar; or how the French and English troops were engaged at Waterloo (with the smoke coming out of the cannons' mouths in puffs of cotton-wool), when Blücher modestly appeared at one corner of the plan in time to save the day. [...] "But we should 'ave 'ad it, without 'im?" [...] a fellow sight-seer of local birth anxiously inquired of the custodian. [...] "Oh, we should 'ave 'ad the victory, anyway," [...] the custodian reassured him, and they looked together at some trophies of the Boer war with a patriotic interest which we could not share. I do not know whether they shared my psychological interest in that apposition of Napoleon and of Nelson which, in this place, as in several others in England, invests the spiritual squalor of war-memories with the glamour of two so supremely poetic, yet so different personalities. Whatever other heroes may have been, these dreamers in their ideals shed such a light upon the sad business of their lives as almost to ennoble it. One feels that with a little more qualification on the creative side they could have been literary men, not of the first order, perhaps, but, say, historical novelists.|$|E
60|$|Walter {{thought so}} too, and, {{springing}} over a hedge, ran {{off into a}} neighbouring wood, resolving to take a turn, and come back by the longer way to the house, {{so as to avoid}} the road. He walked across the wood, looking up at the ripening nuts, and now and then springing up to reach one, telling himself all the time that it was untrue, and that the King could not, and should not be defeated. The wood grew less thick after a time, and ended in low brushwood, upon an open common. Just as Walter was coming to this place, he saw an unusual sight: a man and a horse crossing the down. Slowly and wearily they came, the horse drooping its head and stumbling in its pace, as though worn out with fatigue, but he saw that it was a war-horse, and the saddle and <b>other</b> <b>equipments</b> were such as he well remembered in the royal army long ago. The rider wore buff coat, cuirass, gauntlets guarded with steel, sword, and pistols, and Walter's first impulse was to avoid him; but on giving a second glance, he changed his mind, for though there was neither scarf, plume, nor any badge of party, the long locks, the set of the hat, and the general air of the soldier were not those of a rebel. He must be a cavalier, but, alas! far unlike the triumphant cavaliers whom Walter had hoped to receive, for he was covered with dust and blood, as if he had fought and ridden hard. Walter sprung forward to meet him, and saw that he was a young man, with dark eyes and hair, looking very pale and exhausted, and both he and his horse seemed hardly able to stir a step further.|$|E
