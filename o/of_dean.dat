5|$|The {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> {{turned to}} the north, and became embedded within a large mid-level trough off the East Coast of the United States. Convection increased around the system early on August 24. The system became better organized, with indications of a broad surface circulation forming about 400miles (645km) west-southwest of Bermuda. However, a reconnaissance flight into the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> reported a broad low pressure area with the strongest winds and convection located far from the area of minimum pressure, indicating it had some non-tropical characteristics. The weak disturbance passed {{to the west of}} Bermuda early on August 25, and subsequently began to drift to the northeast. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> produced convection near its developing circulation, and on August 26, while located 220miles (350km) north of Bermuda the system organized sufficiently enough to be re-classified a tropical depression. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center did not re-initiate advisories until fifteen hours later.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th {{century the}} bishop began {{to reside in}} Llandaff {{for the first time}} in centuries; no bishops of the see resided in Llandaff for almost 300 years. In 1836 there was another {{unsuccessful}} attempt to transfer the see—this time to Bristol. After the attempt at transferring the see, the office <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> was restored to Llandaff; the position had not been filled in 700 years. The office <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> was separated from that of the Archdeacon of Llandaff in November 1843. The restoration of the Dean's office was the beginning of better times for the cathedral. The new Dean, William Bruce Knight, was instrumental in bringing about the much-needed restorations.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Barbara Ross-Lee, DO was {{appointed}} to the position <b>of</b> <b>dean</b> of the Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine; she was the first African-American woman to serve as the dean of a U.S. medical school.

5|$|Shortly after Dean formed, the {{government}} of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. When the storm weakened and ultimately dissipated, the warnings were canceled. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> produced unsettled conditions across Bermuda, including a wind gust of 41mph (66km/h) and light rainfall of 0.31inches (8mm). The passage <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> resulted in the coldest day of August 2001 on the island. Dean produced wind gusts peaking at 63mph (103km/h) in Newfoundland, along with rainfall up to 4.2inches (107mm) in eastern Newfoundland. On land, wave heights reached 30feet (9.3m), while a buoy offshore reported a peak wave height of 47feet (14.4m).|$|E

50|$|The {{trend toward}} the {{demotion}} and elimination <b>of</b> <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> women was first observed by Sarah Blanding in 1946, who noticed <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> women being subordinated to male administrators {{in charge of}} general student affairs. By 1962, only 30% <b>of</b> <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> women reported directly {{to the president of}} their institution, and by the 1970s the position itself had become rare.|$|R
5|$|St Briavels Castle {{is located}} on a spur {{dominating}} a position above the River Wye, on {{the western edge of}} the Forest <b>of</b> <b>Dean.</b> The castle is predominantly built of local old red sandstone and limestone. The castle site is surrounded by an in-filled moat; now a garden, the moat was originally wet and fed by a spring underneath the moat itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{main bar}} {{was large and}} black, with black and white zebra-patterned {{wallpaper}} {{on the walls of}} the room. An indoor waterfall surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. The club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, often featured the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and the slapstick comedy duo <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> Martin and Jerry Lewis.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> eventually {{moved up}} into Oklahoma, where it caused heavy rainfall, forcing roads to close and rescues to be made. Dean also dropped heavy rain across the Midwest states as well. Some areas in Kansas {{received more than}} seven inches of rain. Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana each had areas that received more than 5inches (127mm) of rain from Dean.|$|E
50|$|Upon her husband's {{death from}} {{tuberculosis}} in 1891, Martha Foote Crow left Grinnell to become {{assistant professor of}} English literature at the University of Chicago. In 1900, she became <b>dean</b> <b>of</b> women at Northwestern University. While at Northwestern, she participated {{in the formation of}} an association <b>of</b> <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> women, organizing the 1903 Conference <b>of</b> <b>Deans</b> <b>of</b> Women of the Middle West.|$|R
50|$|In a Canadian {{university}} or a college, a dean is typically {{the head of}} a faculty, which may include several academic departments. Typical positions include <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> Arts, <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> Engineering, <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> Science and <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> Business. Many universities also have a <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> Graduate Studies, responsible for work at the postgraduate level {{in all parts of the}} university.|$|R
50|$|In {{the initial}} years, the {{responsibilities}} <b>of</b> the <b>dean</b> <b>of</b> {{women were not}} standardized, {{but in the early}} 20th century it quickly took on the trappings of a profession. The first professional conference <b>of</b> <b>deans</b> and advisers <b>of</b> women was held in 1903. In 1915, the first book dedicated to the profession was published, Lois Rosenberry's The <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> Women. In 1916, the National Association <b>of</b> <b>Deans</b> <b>of</b> Women was formed at Teachers College. By 1925, there were at least 302 <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> women at American colleges and universities.|$|R
5|$|After a {{lunch with}} Logan, Veronica notices that the Hearst Lampoon’s offices were egged. Weevil tells her the Dean's office was egged the same night, which Veronica relays to her father. Keith {{receives}} {{the police report}} <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> O’Dell’s death, but he doesn’t find anything useful in it. Keith interrogates the Lilith house girls, who admit to egging his office, but seem to have alibis for the Dean’s death. However, Keith later informs Veronica that Nish’s alibi doesn’t check out for the Dean’s car {{but that it was}} likely true for Mindy’s car, putting her under suspicion.|$|E
5|$|After {{doing some}} more searching, Veronica discovers {{that one of}} the lab members {{actually}} stole the monkey after developing a special bond with it. The lab member knew he could blame it on PHAT. Veronica decides to tell the other lab members that she was unable to find the monkey, although she is surprised to learn that they will quickly get another monkey. Veronica has a heartfelt conversation with Piz, although soon afterward, she goes back to Logan. Keith decides to take the case <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> O’Dell’s death. The next morning, Piz walks up to Veronica excitedly, but Logan appears, making things awkward and causing Piz to leave sadly.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, {{the forward}} speed <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> {{continued}} to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane. While approaching southern Newfoundland, Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8. Shortly thereafter, Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65mph (105km/h). Later that day, Dean emerged into the far north Atlantic and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{shopping}} areas <b>of</b> <b>Deans.</b> The main shopping centre <b>of</b> <b>Deans</b> is the Carmondean Centre {{which consists of}} some small shops, sit-in and take-away restaurants, a bank and a Morrisons supermarket. There is also a care home called Restondene. The other area is along Main Street in the Livingston Station area <b>of</b> <b>Deans</b> {{where there is a}} Co-Operative store and a few take-away food shops.|$|R
5|$|Although Dean {{remained}} {{away from}} the United States coastline, it produced storm tides of 1.7ft (0.51m) to North Carolina. In Atlantic Canada, hurricane-force winds were reported in Nova Scotia and Sable Island. Newfoundland reported winds of only 50mph (80km/h). Moderate rainfall was reported on Newfoundland, with most areas of the island experiencing at least 1in (25.4mm) of precipitation. Rainfall on Newfoundland peaked at 2.7in (68.58mm) on the south coast of the island, near the location of Dean's landfall. A majority of rainfall was reported {{on the west side}} <b>of</b> <b>Dean,</b> but minimal precipitation had been recorded to the east of the storm. High winds were reported on {{the eastern side of the}} storm, however, with lighter winds along the western quadrants <b>of</b> <b>Dean.</b> Offshore, waves up to 26ft (7.92m) were reported and Sable Island reported rainfall of 0.59in (15mm). Although there were no reports of damage in Atlantic Canada from Hurricane Dean, three sailors had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard when their boat got dismasted during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{international}} assistance, five-year development programs during the terms <b>of</b> <b>Dean</b> Domingo Lantican (1958–1971) of the School of Forestry, and Dean Dioscoro Umali (1959–1970) of the College of Agriculture were also instrumental {{in developing the}} campus.

5|$|In 1831 {{there were}} {{extensive}} riots in the Forest <b>of</b> <b>Dean,</b> led by Warren James. After {{the intervention of}} the military, the rioters were dispersed and order restored, but a range of complaints were levied about the enforcement of the local laws on miners and metal-workers. There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s, but the degree of violence in this case was much greater. An act of Parliament followed, establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and recent events at the Castle.|$|E
