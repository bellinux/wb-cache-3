50|$|Bill Shively {{edited the}} very first <b>Open</b> <b>Sky</b> in which writers and visual artists of any sort could {{contribute}} 400 pages {{to be included in}} the magazine. Red Sky Poetry Theatre considered its collective efforts to be more conducive to the creative process, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Essentially, <b>Open</b> <b>Sky</b> wasn't edited so much as compiled. Shively's brainchild, <b>Open</b> <b>Sky,</b> eventually became a quarterly publication. The only person to submit to all twelve issues of <b>Open</b> <b>Sky</b> was author Dann O'Keefe. <b>Open</b> <b>Sky</b> became <b>Open</b> Sound in 1989 with 200 pages. Ezra Mark was the editor of the first Open Sound. Ezra Mark was later on the board of Subtext, another poetry series.|$|R

40|$|The primary {{intention}} of this thesis {{is to examine}} <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> policy and its far-reaching impact on the Asia-Pacific region. In order to achieve this, we will describe the historic evolution of economic regulation in civil air transport, which {{laid the foundation for}} an <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> regime. Moreover, the scope of an <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> regime on a global scale is addressed. Then, a detailed study of the essential elements of bilateral <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> agreements is undertaken. Afterwards, an analysis of the current economic air transport regulation in Asia-Pacific is conducted. With the emergence of the <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> trend, most Asia-Pacific nations began to liberalize their air transport industries. Yet, bilateral agreements remain the primary means to attain this goal. More necessarily, several Asia-Pacific countries' air transport policies will be comprehensively examined. This examination includes Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia. Finally, a perspective for liberalization via a hybrid of bilateral and sub-regional <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region is presented...|$|R

Then, the thesis conducts a detailed study {{of the law and}} practice pertaining to regional <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> Agreements in Europe, Latin America, Australasia and in the Asia/Pacific region. Afterwards, an analysis of the main provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement is made with reference to air transport.

More importantly, a complete analysis of the New Air Transport Agreement Between Canada and the United States implementing an <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> regime as for 1995 is made in Chapter V. Finally, a critical analysis of this <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> Agreement is made and perspectives are given as to the future inclusion of Mexico, Chile and, later on, of all of Latin America...|$|R
40|$|The Treaty on <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> (<b>Open</b> <b>Skies)</b> is {{intended}} {{among other things}} to provide, {{in the words of}} its preamble, means ``to facilitate the monitoring of compliance with existing or future arms control agreements. `` <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> permits overflights of the territory of member states by aircraft equipped with an array of sensors of various types. Their types and capabilities are treaty-limited. To find useful application in monitoring a cut-off treaty <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> would need to be amended. The number of signatories would need to be expanded so as to provide greater geographical coverage, and restrictions on sensor-array capabilities would need to be relaxed. To facilitate the detection of impending violations of a cut-off convention by <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> overflights, the data base provided by parties to the former should include among other things an enumeration of existing and former fuel cycle and research facilities including those converted to other uses, their precise geographic location, and a site plan...|$|R
