There is no consensus among modern scholars on the classification {{of the argument}}; some {{say that it is}} ontological while <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is cosmological.|$|E

25|$|According to Kaplan the Sabbatical cycles in Sefer HaTemunah {{can be used}} as a {{basis for}} calculating the age of the universe. While Sefer HaTemunah sees the world as {{existing}} in the second cycle, <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is in the seventh cycle. If so, Adam was created when the universe was 42,000 years old, and six worlds were created and destroyed before the creation of Adam. This thesis was laid out by Rabbi Isaac ben Samuel of Acre, a 13th-century Kabbalist, who said that when calculating the age of the universe, one must use divine years rather than physical years.|$|E
25|$|Stout was {{probably}} born in Little Creek Hundred, Kent County, Delaware, son of Jacob Emanuel Stout {{and his second}} wife Mary Griffin Stout. His ancestors came to Kent County from New Jersey in the 17th century. Like many in the area, {{his father was a}} reluctant revolutionary in 1776, but later served six years in the Delaware General Assembly. Jacob Stout married Angelica Killen in 1795 and had four children, Mary, William, Henry, Sarah Ann, and William Jacob. The exact location of their home is debated. Some say it was north of Leipsic and <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was west of it, on the Cheswold Road. It was nearby in any case, as {{he was one of the}} founders of Leipsic. He was also President of the Smyrna Bank from 1844 until 1847. They were members of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
25|$|The first {{description}} of symptoms associated with alcoholic polyneuropathy were recorded by John C. Lettsome in 1787 when he noted hyperesthesia and paralysis in legs more than arms of patients. Jackson {{has also been}} credited with describing polyneuropathy in chronic alcoholics in 1822. The clinical title of alcoholic polyneuropathy was widely recognized by the late nineteenth century. It was thought that the polyneuropathy was {{a direct result of}} the toxic effect alcohol had on peripheral nerves when used excessively. In 1928, George C. Shattuck argued that the polyneuropathy resulted from a vitamin B deficiency commonly found in alcoholics and he claimed that alcoholic polyneuropathy should be related to beriberi. This debate continues today over what exactly causes this disease, some argue it is just the alcohol toxicity, others claim the vitamin deficiencies are to blame and still <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is some combination of the two.|$|E

25|$|The match {{had already}} had a moment of {{controversy}} earlier. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. It was ruled not out by the umpires. It was some years before TV replays {{could be used in}} umpiring decisions. Viewers watching replays had divided opinions: some thought it was a clean catch, while <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> passed through the fielder's fingers to touch the grass before coming to rest in his hands. (If modern TV umpiring review had been in use, there was sufficient doubt to rule it not out.) Some commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time honoured tradition. Chappell maintained he was not sure about the catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90, before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had cupped his hands under the ball.|$|E
25|$|This is {{followed}} by {{an examination of the}} attacks on the Pentagon. The film opposes the official story of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, alleging that the path of destruction does not match what a 757 would leave. In particular it claims that the size of the hole in the Pentagon, a lack of debris and, little landscape damage seem inconsistent with prior airliner crashes. It also alleges that too few parts were recovered from the crash site to reliably ascertain that they were of a Boeing 757, and that a flywheel observed at the site seemed too small to {{have been part of the}} aircraft's engine turbine. Experts officially declared that the wheel was part of the APU, but <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> didn't come from the APU of a 757 but likely from an E-3 Sentry aircraft. The film also claims that the alleged hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour had difficulty operating basic controls on a small Cessna that he rented at a flight school, and that perhaps not even an experienced pilot could have maneuvered the reflex angle of turn at the airspeed and altitude at which the aircraft approached without going into a high speed stall. The film mentions three cameras on nearby buildings that allegedly caught the entire incident at the Pentagon on film, which it says the government confiscated and has refused to release in full.|$|E
500|$|Opinions {{differ on}} {{who was the}} founder of modern {{ecological}} theory. Some mark Haeckel's definition as the beginning; <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was Eugenius Warming with the writing of [...] (1895), or Carl Linnaeus' principles on the economy of nature that matured in the early 18th century. Linnaeus founded an early branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature. His works influenced Charles Darwin, who adopted Linnaeus' phrase on the economy or polity of nature in The Origin of Species. Linnaeus {{was the first to}} frame the balance of nature as a testable hypothesis. Haeckel, who admired Darwin's work, defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature, which has led some to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous.|$|E

500|$|Walter J. Boyne, {{director}} of the National Air and Space Museum and a prolific aviation author, mentions Coandă in passing {{a few times in}} his works. Boyne discusses Coandă briefly in one of his books, The Leading Edge: [...] "Professor Henri Coanda, whose scientific work was impeccable, designed and built a jet aircraft in 1910; it, like Martin's Kitten , was superbly built and technically advanced—and could not fly." [...] In a later magazine article sidebar, Boyne described more details: [...] "Romanian inventor Henri Coanda attempted to fly a primitive jet aircraft in 1910, using a four-cylinder internal combustion engine to drive a compressor at 4,000 revolutions per minute. It was equipped with what today might be called an afterburner, producing an estimated 500pounds [...] of thrust. Countless loyal Coanda fans insist that the airplane flew. <b>Others</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> merely crashed." ...|$|E

[...] Though the unit {{did not have}} an {{official}} moniker during their years of activity, Blaine has stated that the term was sometimes used disparagingly in the early 1960s by members of the industry's old guard of [...] "coat and tie" [...] session players, who felt that, with their penchant for wearing [...] "t-shirts and jeans" [...] to sessions and their embrace of rock and roll, they were going to [...] "wreck" [...] the music industry. [...] According to biographer Kent Hartman, [...] "Some of the studio musicians I interviewed swear they heard it applied to themselves as early as 1963; <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was later.
