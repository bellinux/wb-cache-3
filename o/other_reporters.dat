5|$|The first {{mainstream}} US {{print media}} outlet {{to cover the}} matter was the Chicago Tribune, whose Southwest Bureau Chief, Howard Witt, wrote a piece covering the story on May 20. Witt had received {{a summary of the}} situation from Alan Bean, a Texas minister who had founded the advocacy group Friends of Justice. The group sent its document to <b>other</b> <b>reporters</b> and bloggers. In it Bean demanded that outside authorities, not those in LaSalle Parish, deal with the case, and that no incarceration of the defendants occur. Britain's The Observer also featured an article on the case on May 20.|$|E
5|$|The mission did {{fail and}} the {{internal}} settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to <b>other</b> <b>reporters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with <b>other</b> <b>reporters</b> by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E

5|$|The Serbian {{defeat in}} the Serbian Campaign in autumn 1915, {{prompted}} France and Britain to transfer troops from the Gallipoli Campaign to Greek Macedonia. The Macedonian Front was established to support {{the remnants of the}} Serbian army to conquer Vardar Macedonia. After the failure of the August Offensive, the Gallipoli campaign drifted. Ottoman success began to affect public opinion in Britain, with criticism of Hamilton's performance being smuggled out by Keith Murdoch, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett and <b>other</b> <b>reporters.</b> Stopford and other dissident officers also contributed to the air of gloom and the possibility of evacuation was raised on 11 October 1915. Hamilton resisted the suggestion, fearing the damage to British prestige but was sacked shortly afterwards and replaced by Lieutenant General Sir Charles Monro. Autumn and winter brought relief from the heat but also led to gales, blizzards and flooding, resulting in men drowning and freezing to death, while thousands suffered frostbite.|$|E

25|$|Seldes {{spent the}} next ten years as an {{international}} reporter for the Chicago Tribune. He interviewed Lenin in 1922. He and three <b>other</b> <b>reporters</b> were expelled in 1923 when Soviet authorities, who routinely censored foreign reporters' telegraphed dispatches, found articles by the four reporters, disguised as personal letters, being smuggled out in a diplomatic mailpouch to avoid censorship. The expulsion was facilitated, according to Seldes, after his publisher, Colonel Robert McCormick, failed to show sufficient respect when writing to the Soviets to protest censorship.|$|E

The investigation, which led to multiple articles in the paper, sparked a criminal investigation of Columbia, and led to significant changes in the way the federal government compensated hospitals, according to Bruce Vladek, then the head of the Medicare program. An article in the magazine Content cited the work by Eichenwald, Gottlieb and two <b>other</b> <b>reporters</b> as the year’s best public service journalism. Eichenwald received his second Polk award, along with his colleagues, for this work.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among the}} Post's {{anonymous}} sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant {{was identified as}} William Mark Felt, Sr., {{deputy director of the}} FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and <b>other</b> <b>reporters</b> were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All of the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in Rosslyn over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted leaks about Watergate with Time magazine, the Washington Daily News and other publications.|$|E
25|$|In {{his grand}} jury testimony, Rove testified {{he learned of}} Plame's CIA {{affiliation}} from journalists and not from government officials. Rove testified that Novak called him in July 2003 to discuss a story unrelated to Plame or Wilson. Eventually, according to Rove, Novak told him he planned to report in an upcoming column that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove told the grand jury {{that by the time}} Novak had called him, he had already learned of Plame from <b>other</b> <b>reporters,</b> but that he could not recall which reporters had told him. When Novak inquired about Wilson's wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard something like that, according to the source's recounting of the grand jury testimony for the Associated Press. Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name. Rove also testified to the grand jury that he had heard from Libby that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove testified that Libby told him that he heard the information from journalists.|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, Rob Walker of Yahoo! called PewDiePie's {{popularity}} [...] "insane", writing, that it [...] "strikes me as {{considerably more}} curious — I mean, {{you know who}} Rihanna is, but would you recognise this kid if he were standing in line behind you at the bank?" [...] Walker, among <b>other</b> <b>reporters</b> and some casual gamers, have questioned the reasons for his popularity, while <b>other</b> <b>reporters</b> have criticised his rise in notability. Walker commented on PewDiePie's interaction with his audience, writing, [...] "While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly {{more than willing to}} make fun of himself in the process." [...] In 2015, The Verge wrote, [...] "Love it or hate it, his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record." [...] He refers to his fan base as the [...] "Bro Army" [...] and addresses his audience as [...] "bros". On this, Walker wrote, [...] "Profanity aside, it's a bummer that his persona includes constant references to his viewers as [...] "bros," [...] and that he's loose with words like [...] "bitch" [...] when his gaming adventures lead him into contact with female villain characters. Given how smart this guy clearly is when he speaks directly, I suspect he could modify his demeanor in a way that remained engaging to a young fan base but somehow contributed to improving gamer-land’s sometimes disturbingly bro-centric attitude." [...] However, both Walker and Reed have commented on PewDiePie's intelligence, with Reed opining, [...] "He's much more thoughtful and self-aware than he seems in many of his videos." ...|$|E

The journalist George Frederic Parsons wrote a piece for The Atlantic Monthly in which he identified the fears of middle-class Americans concerning labor radicalism, and asserted that the workers had only themselves to blame for their troubles. Edward Aveling remarked, [...] "If these men are ultimately hanged, {{it will be the}} Chicago Tribune that has done it." [...] Schaack, who had led the investigation, was dismissed from the police force for allegedly having fabricated evidence in the case but was reinstated in 1892.|$|E

[...] The Tribunes cultural criticism was also prominent: John Crosby's radio and television column was syndicated in 29 newspapers by 1949, and Walter Kerr began a successful three-decade career as a Broadway reviewer at the Tribune in 1951. [...] Its Paris edition, still profitable after the war, published the first columns by Art Buchwald. However, the paper's losses were continuing to mount. [...] Whitelaw Reid was gradually replaced by his brother, Ogden R. Reid, nicknamed [...] "Brown", to take charge of the paper. [...] As president and publisher of the paper, Brown Reid tried to interject an energy his brother lacked and reach out to new audiences. [...] In that spirit, the Tribune ran a promotion called [...] "Tangle Towns", where readers were invited to unscramble the names of jumbled up town and city names in exchange for prizes. [...] Reid also gave more prominent play to crime and entertainment stories. [...] Much of the staff, including Whitelaw Reid, felt there was too much focus on circulation {{at the expense of the}} paper's editorial standards, but the promotions initially worked, boosting its weekday circulation to over 400,000.|$|E

40|$|Protein {{degradation}} is {{a critical}} factor in controlling cellular protein abundance. Here, we compare classical methods for determining protein degradation rates to a novel GFP fusion protein based-method that assesses the intrinsic stability of cloned cDNA library products by flow cytometry [Yen et al. (2008) Science 322, 918]. While no method is perfect, we conclude that chimeric gene reporter approaches, though powerful, should be applied cautiously, due principally to GFP (green fluorescent protein) (or <b>other</b> <b>reporter</b> tag) interference with protein organelle targeting or incorporation into macromolecular assemblies, both of which cause spuriously high degradation rates...|$|R
