5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the most {{significant}} anti-war works of art, The Disasters of War had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen <b>outside</b> <b>a</b> small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1863.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support <b>outside</b> <b>a</b> clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E
5|$|By 1:30 pm, around 1,000 monks had congregated {{inside to}} hold a meeting while <b>outside</b> <b>a</b> large crowd of pro-Buddhist {{students}} had formed a human barrier around it. The meeting soon ended and all but a hundred monks slowly left the compound. Nearly one thousand monks, accompanied by laypeople, returned to the cremation site. The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00 pm, thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside Xá Lợi. The police encircled the pagoda, blocking public passage and giving observers the impression that an armed siege was imminent by donning riot gear.|$|E

5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods <b>outside</b> <b>a</b> host.|$|E
5|$|Fans gained {{national}} attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham {{in his first}} away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone. Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player <b>outside</b> <b>a</b> local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.|$|E

Atherton's MP is Chris Green (politician) who won the parliamentary seat for Bolton West at the 2015 General Election. Howe Bridge is in the Leigh constituency represented by Jo Platt.|$|E

5|$|Hunt {{sustained}} a foot {{injury in the}} Broncos Round 15 match and was sidelined for eight weeks. While out injured, {{early in the morning}} on 30 July 2006, Hunt was at the scene of a fight <b>outside</b> <b>a</b> Brisbane night club in Brisbane's CBD. The media, notably Channel 7 and Channel 10, alleged Hunt was the instigator of the incident, claiming he squirted water on a woman. The Broncos denied he had any involvement in the incident although a woman gave his name to police. Hunt also denied involvement, insisting he was merely a bystander.|$|E

The penalty for all these offences is life imprisonment.

5|$|Marsh only {{played in}} two more {{first-class}} matches, which {{came in the}} two seasons following his no-balling. In a later season, the touring England cricket team objected to his selection in an opposition team. There were calls for Marsh to be selected for Australia, but Noble, the New South Wales selector, refused to select him, citing his controversial action. In later years, Marsh turned to alcohol and was briefly jailed for assault. He {{was killed in a}} brawl <b>outside</b> <b>a</b> pub; two men were charged with manslaughter but were acquitted.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors <b>outside</b> <b>a</b> work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E
