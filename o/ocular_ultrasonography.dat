30|$|<b>Ocular</b> B-mode <b>ultrasonography</b> (US) is an {{important}} adjuvant for the clinical assessment {{of a variety of}} ocular diseases. When ophthalmoscopy is not possible, mainly due to opacification of the transparent media (e.g., mature cataract or vitreous haemorrhage), US can guide the ophthalmologist in diagnosing disease and choosing treatment. The superficial location and cystic structure of the eye make US ideal for imaging of the eye. Moreover, dynamic study helps distinguish between various conditions that would otherwise be difficult to differentiate in some clinical setting, such as vitreous, retinal, and choroidal detachment. US is also good technique for detecting other pathologic conditions such as lens dislocation, vitreous haemorrhage, asteroid hyalosis, optic disc drusen, and tumors (e.g., choroidal melanoma, metastases, hemangioma). An understanding of the basic anatomy of the eye, the US technique, and common entities that affect the ocular globe will allow radiologists to offer this valuable imaging modality to patients and referring clinicians. This article focuses on the US anatomy and pathologic conditions that affect the posterior ocular segment.|$|R

40|$|Canine uveal cysts are anatomically {{localized}} to regions {{within the}} eye not easily visualized during routine ophthalmic examination. In {{order to establish}} the clinical relevance of uveal cysts in certain disease processes as cyst-associated glaucoma, and/or golden retriever pigmentary uveitis, a more sensitive diagnostic tool needs to be established. The {{purpose of the study}} was to compare ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) with standard <b>ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> for detection of canine uveal cysts and to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver agreement for detection of uveal cysts with UBM. Two hundred and two eyes were enucleated from 101 dogs. Two examiners examined 202 eyes by means of UBM (50 MHz) to identify uveal cysts. A board-certified radiologist then examined 98 of the 202 eyes by means of standard <b>ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> (7 - to 12 -MHz linear transducer). Subsequently, one examiner dissected all 202 eyes under magnification from an operating microscope to definitively identify uveal cysts. Each examiner was masked to other examiners’ findings. Sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver agreement were calculated for detection of cysts by UBM. The results of this study demonstrated that uveal cysts were detected by UBM in 55 of 202 (27 %) eyes by one examiner and 29 of 202 (14 %) eyes by the other. No cysts were detected in the 98 eyes examined with standard <b>ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Dissection results revealed that cysts were present in 64 of 202 (32 %) eyes including 29 of 98 (30 %) eyes examined by standard <b>ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> The mean sensitivity of UBM for cyst detection was 47 %; mean specificity was 92 %. Uveal cysts not identified with UBM were often small (mean diameter, 490 µm). Interobserver agreement was high (? = 0. 81). In conclusion, UBM was more effective than standard <b>ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> for detection of uveal cysts in enucleated eyes.

40|$|Background Choroidal folds may {{be caused}} by several {{underlying}} ocular and orbital diseases; they are classified as idiopathic when no obvious cause is found. the objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether acquired choroidal folds are associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Methods in this observational case series, three patients with normal fundus examination later developed choroidal folds. They underwent complete <b>ocular</b> examination, B-scan <b>ultrasonography,</b> fluorescein angiography, optic coherent tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging. A neurological consultation, lumbar puncture and measurement of opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were also obtained for all patients. Results Three patients with previously normal ocular fundus developed choroidal folds, and optic nerve subarachnoid space enlargement was seen on B-scan. Clinical and radiological evaluations identified elevation of intracranial pressure, and biochemical analysis of CSF was normal, suggesting a diagnosis of pseudotumour cerebri, which was later confirmed. the first patient developed choroidal folds in one eye first, and 4 years later in the fellow eye. the second patient presented with bilateral optic disk swelling secondary to intracranial hypertension. After treatment, which lowered CSF pressure, bilateral choroidal folds were identified by OCT, fluorescein angiography and ocular fundus photograph. the third patient also developed choroidal folds in one eye, but his fellow eye was difficult to evaluate due to a chorioretinitis scar on the macula. OCT identified choroidal folds in all three patients and in the second patient, it also revealed retinal nerve fiber layer damage. Conclusions Acquired choroidal folds and optic nerve subarachnoid space enlargement may be signs of idiopathic intracranial pressure elevation. Nevertheless, this diagnosis should be confirmed by lumbar puncture. Comprehensive imaging studies should be performed to rule out expanding tumors. the lower CSF pressure in our first two patients suggests that choroidal folds or optic disk swelling may depend on the level of intracranial pressure and may be points in a continuum of clinical presentations.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of postsurgical shallow {{anterior}} chamber and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) simulating malignant glaucoma. Methods: A 20 -year-old woman underwent EX-PRESS® device implant for treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma. Results: Postoperative examination showed a shallow anterior chamber, the EX-PRESS® device embedded in the iris, an IOP of 28 mm Hg, and an annular detachment of the choroid ciliary body, suggesting hyperfiltration followed by EX-PRESS® blockage. The anterior chamber was restored using an ophthalmic viscoelastic and an additional suture was applied ensuring the scleral flap.

Changes in ICP were indirectly measured by changes in optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). 12 healthy male volunteers underwent 3 days of DI. ONSD was indirectly assessed by <b>ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) of the middle cerebral artery was gauged using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. CA was evaluated by two methods: (1) transfer function analysis was calculated to determine the relationship between mean CBFV and mean arterial blood pressure (ABP) and (2) correlation index Mxa between mean CBFV and mean ABP. ONSD increased significantly during the first day, the third day and the first day of recovery of DI (P < 0. 001). DI induced a reduction in Mxa index (P < 0. 001) and an elevation in phase shift in low frequency bandwidth (P < 0. 05). After DI, Mxa and coherence were strongly correlated with ONSD (P < 0. 05) but not before DI. These results indicate that 3 days of DI induces significant changes in ONSD most likely reflecting an increase in ICP.

Methods: In a population-based cross-sectional ophthalmic survey of 2418 adults (≥ 40 years old) living in the rural villages in central Myanmar, height and weight were measured using a standardized protocol, and body mass index was calculated. Non-cycloplegic refraction and corneal curvature were determined by an autorefractor. Ultrasound pachymetry was performed and ocular biometry, including axial length, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and vitreous chamber length were measured using A-mode <b>ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Results: Height and weight were significantly correlated with age, gender and all the ocular biometric parameters, except lens thickness. After adjusting for age and gender, taller and heavier persons had eyes with longer axial length, deeper anterior and vitreous chambers, and flatter and thicker corneas than shorter persons. Height was not significantly correlated with refraction, and heavier persons tended to be less myopic (P < 0. 001). Multivariate linear regression models revealed consistent results with the findings for association between height, weight and ocular biometry and refractive error.

Thirteen cases were probably having progressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis types 1 or 2 in view of their persistent cholestasis in the presence of normal γ-glutamyl transpeptidase level. Sixty were left with a diagnosis of ‘idiopathic neonatal hepatitis’. Ophthalmological assessment showed abnormal findings in 39 cases (34. 8 %). The most common finding was unilateral/bilateral optic nerve drusen in 12 cases (10. 7 %), followed by posterior embryotoxon in 11 (9. 8 %) cases. Ocular findings were observed in several cholestatic disorders, including in 64. 3 % of patients with AGS, 50 % with NPD, 36. 7 % of infants with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, and 14. 3 % with biliary atresia. Conclusion Ophthalmological assessment {{should be part of the}} workup for the diagnosis and assessment of cholestatic infants...|$|E
40|$|Thyroid {{cancer has}} {{progressively}} become the eighth most common malignant tumor {{with an annual}} increase rate of 4 % and is incriminated in 7. 7 % to 10 % of all ma-lignancies found in patients between 15 and 24 years of age [1]. Despite these alarming demographic data pertain-ing to thyroid cancer, distant hematogenous spread to the uvea continues to be exceptionally rare. In a survey of 420 patients with uveal metastatic tumors, thyroid cancer was only documented in 2 cases [2]. Two recent publications found 15 cases of metastatic thyroid carcinoma to the eye in the literature, {{the majority of these}} being follicular thy-roid carcinomas [3, 4]. We describe a patient with papillary thyroid carcinoma who had bilateral uveal metastases and extraocular extension of the tumor in one eye. The malig-nancy had an unusually aggressive clinical course follow-ing the appearance of choroidal metastases. Case Report A 62 -year-old man presented with a red and painful right eye. He had begun to experience visual problems 8 months earlier, which rapidly deteriorated in the last 2 months. He had undergone a total thyroidectomy for papillary carci-noma 4 years prior. Fifteen months later, metastatic disease was discovered in his sternum and he received iodine- 131 therapy. His condition remained stable thereafter. Upon examination, his visual acuity was light perception in the right eye and 20 / 25 in the left eye. Microcystic cor-neal edema, a fixed and dilated pupil, and rubeosis iridis were found in the right eye. There was total serous retinal detachment and the intraocular pressure was 45 mmHg (applanation). <b>Ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> demonstrated a single choroidal lesion with a basal diameter measurin...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Peters anomaly {{is a rare}} {{developmental}} malformation {{involving the}} anterior segment of the eye, which culminates in amblyopia or congenital blindness. Multiple ocular and/or systemic malformations have been observed with this anomaly, and novel comorbidities continue to be reported. Case Presentation: The probands were monozygotic twin boys (twin I and twin II) born to consanguineous parents at 36 weeks of gestation. Coarse facial features and deep-seated eyes were noted at birth. At 6 months, ophthalmic examination revealed that both twins were unable to blink in response to light, or to fixate and follow a moving object. Both twins had prominent horizontal nystagmus. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated varying degrees of central leukoma (corneal opacity) associated with iridocorneal adhesion, which is characteristic of type I Peters anomaly. No cataractous changes were observed. Normal intraocular pressure and disorganized retina were observed. Pupillary abnormalities included bilaterally underdeveloped pupils and bilateral absence of pupils was noted. Ocular MRI showed bilateral microphthalmia and optic nerve hypoplasia, with a small optic chiasm in both twins. At this age, the diagnosis of Peters anomaly was made. At 16 months of age, both twins developed deep venous thrombosis and purpuric skin lesions. Investigations revealed a hereditary thrombophilia secondary to a homozygous mutation causing protein C deficiency, which is a rare thrombotic condition. <b>Ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> revealed bilateral vitreous hemorrhaging linked to altered coagulation. One twin developed bilateral inguinal hernia and cryptorchidism. Conclusion: The novel concordance of Peters anomaly in these monozygotic twins sharing a mutation in PROC gene provides further evidence that this anomaly has a genetic basis. Hypoplasia of the optic nerves and optic chiasm, along with severe protein C deficiency and bilateral absence of the pupils, are associated comorbidities that have not previously been reported with this anomaly...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} efficacy of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) by ultrasound as a noninvasive method for detecting raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in intensive care unit, to compare with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of raised ICP and to prognosticate ONSD value with treatment. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study on 101 adults by including 41 healthy individuals in group A as control and 60 patients in group B admitted with fever, headache, vomiting, and altered sensorium. We examined them in supine position using 10 MHz linear array probe on closed eyelid. ONSD was measured 3 mm behind the globe in each eye. A mean binocular ONSD > 4. 6 mm in female and 4. 8 mm in male was considered abnormal. Midline shift, edema, effacement or ONSD > 5. 0 mm on T 2 MRI suggestive of elevated ICP was used {{to evaluate}} ONSD accuracy. Results: Group A mean ONSD was 4. 6 mm in females and 4. 8 mm in males. Group B mean ONSD for 17 females was 5. 103 ± 0. 6221 mm (P = 0. 002) and for 43 males 5. 081 ± 0. 5799 mm (P = 0. 032). Radiological sign of raised ICP was confirmed in 35 patients (females = 11 and males = 24) with high ONSD value. Sensitivity of detecting raised ICP by ONSD was 84. 6 % in females and 75 % in males while specificity was 100 % in both genders. Out of 25 patients without radiological signs of raised ICP 10 patients showed high ONSD (females = 4. 735 mm and males = 4. 907 mm). ONSD was well prognosticated with treatment modalities. Conclusion: Bedside <b>ocular</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> for measuring ONSD can be used an early test for diagnosing raised ICP as it is a noninvasive, cost effective bedside test, which can be repeated for re-evaluation...|$|E
