While fending off a Space Pirate assault, Samus and her fellow bounty hunters are {{attacked}} by her doppelgänger, Dark Samus, who incapacitates them with a mutagenic material called Phazon. After losing contact with the <b>other</b> <b>hunters,</b> the Federation sends Samus on a mission to determine what happened to them.

25|$|Simon the Monster Hunter (voiced by Jim Belushi) - The {{main and}} {{recurring}} antagonist of the series. Simon {{is a human}} who is determined to prove that monsters exist and wants to exterminate them. He wears a thick-collared jacket and glasses. Before becoming a monster hunter, he tried to capture Bigfoot and built a giant robot. Simon once had to save Ickis from three <b>other</b> <b>hunters</b> when attempted to take sole credit for exposing monsters to the human world, though he warned Ickis {{that he would go}} right back to trying to expose them.

He was credited with leading these native peoples as an auxiliary force during the successful Forbes Expedition of 1758. In 1760, Gist accompanied Daniel Boone and <b>other</b> <b>hunters</b> on a trek to Abingdon, Virginia, then called Wolf Hill. The two then split up, with Boone going on to Long Island and Gist traveling to Cumberland Gap. He {{was said to have}} sired Sequoyah in 1760 or 1761, but this is unlikely because the Anglo-Cherokee War was raging and Gist was serving in Adam Stephen's colonial Virginia regiment against the Cherokees. This unit advanced as far as Long Island before peace was made between the two sides.|$|E
25|$|After {{progressing}} {{through various}} areas, including chapels, forests, small towns, universities, castles, odd nightmare locations, underground labyrinths, and churches, eventually the Hunter is led towards another spectral realm, the Nightmare of Mensis, wherein the player encounters Mergo, {{who is the}} source of the nightmare, and Mergo's guardian, known as Mergo's Wet Nurse. Only after slaying Mergo's Wet Nurse, and letting Mergo die by extension, is the final phase of the game initiated. When the Hunter returns to the Hunter's Dream, Gehrman offers to free the player from the Dream and return them to the World in the morning. At this point, three different endings are possible depending on the player's actions. Choosing to accept Gehrman's offer unlocks the Yharnam Sunrise ending. Gehrman uses his scythe to behead the player, who then awakens in Yharnam as the sun rises. In the Hunter's Dream, the Doll bids the Hunter farewell. Choosing to refuse Gehrman's offer unlocks one of two endings; the second ending, Honoring Wishes, is the default ending for this case. To save the Hunter from being trapped in the dream, Gehrman initiates a battle with the player. After Gehrman is defeated, a mysterious being called the Moon Presence arrives and embraces the player, binding them to the dream. Some time later, the Doll is seen pushing the player, now sitting in Gehrman's wheelchair, back to the workshop in the Hunter's Dream. The Doll remarks that a new Hunt will begin, signifying that the player has taken Gehrman's place in guiding <b>other</b> <b>Hunters.</b>|$|E

500|$|Metroid Prime Hunters: When the Federation {{receives}} an unusual telepathic message regarding an [...] "Ultimate Power," [...] Samus {{is sent to}} the remote Alimbic Cluster in the Tetra Galaxy to investigate and secure it. Others have also received the message, and six rival bounty hunters arrive with similar intent. When all parties arrive at the source of the transmission, it is revealed that the message was a false lure sent by an ancient creature known as Gorea, who intended to manipulate visitors into releasing it from a void between dimensions. Upon this revelation, Gorea attacks and syphons the energy from the <b>other</b> <b>hunters,</b> allowing it to commandeer their weapons. After killing Gorea, Samus and the <b>other</b> <b>hunters</b> escape the cluster, empty handed, but alive. It was released on the handheld Nintendo DS in 2006. It was also the first game that many played on the DS since, at its original release in some regions, the console came bundled with a game card entitled Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt, a demo of the game.|$|E
500|$|After warding off {{the other}} bounty hunters, Samus {{retrieves}} the eight Octoliths and opens the Infinity Void. Here, she and the other six hunters confront Gorea, who originated the telepathic message {{in an attempt to}} free itself.

As Samus and the <b>other</b> <b>hunters</b> evacuate the exploding Oubliette on their respective ships, three Alimbic spirits appear before an armorless Samus, and honor her with a salute.|$|E
500|$|As {{the public}} outcry against the few Maverick {{incidents}} becomes {{too great to}} deny, the government steps in, and under the advice of Dr. Cain, forms an elite military police organization called the [...] "Maverick Hunters". The Hunters are to capture or disable any Reploids that {{pose a threat to}} humans, provide damage control at Maverick uprisings, help with disaster recovery, and perform other tasks as needed. To lead this group, Cain designs a very advanced Reploid, thought to be immune to whatever defect causes Mavericks. This robot, named Sigma, heads the Hunters for some time before ultimately becoming a Maverick himself, alongside {{the vast majority of the}} <b>other</b> <b>Hunters.</b> Sigma seizes control of a small island, driving out all human occupants. Claiming that the humans are inferior and that they are limiting the growth and potential of Reploids, he calls for his followers to begin a massive extinction effort. X, guilt-ridden at having helped design such a dangerous race, joins forces with the only other remaining Hunter, Zero, in order to stop Sigma at any cost.|$|E

500|$|Azazel's last {{appearance}} chronologically {{is in the}} second season finale [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose", where he kidnaps Sam and the other young adults that he had infected. He visits Sam in a dream, and reveals that his [...] "special children" [...] must {{fight to the death}} to determine who will lead his army. Although Sam is the demon's favorite, the super-strong Jake Talley becomes the winner. As Dean sells his soul to another demon in exchange for Sam's resurrection, Azazel gives Jake the Colt and coerces him to travel to a cemetery {{in the middle of a}} giant devil's trap. Though Sam and Dean, along with <b>other</b> <b>hunters,</b> attempt to stop him, Jake uses the Colt as a key to unlock a mausoleum there. This action briefly opens a gateway to Hell, releasing Lilith and hundreds of other demons. With the devil's trap around the cemetery now broken, Azazel confronts the Winchesters and easily overpowers them. However, John's soul escapes through the Gate, and distracts Azazel long enough for Dean to shoot him dead with the Colt.|$|E
500|$|The sixth season episode [...] "Weekend At Bobby's" [...] is {{centered}} on Bobby; Sam and Dean are largely relegated to a side-plot while the episode focuses on Bobby's constant working to cover <b>other</b> <b>hunters</b> while also trying to reclaim his soul from Crowley. After a year's research into Crowley's human life—allowing them to track down his mortal remains, whose destruction would 'kill' Crowley {{in the same manner}} as exorcising a ghost—Bobby eventually regains his soul by threatening to burn Crowley's human remains. Although the restored but soulless Sam attempts to kill Bobby in [...] "Appointment in Samarra" [...] as part of a ritual to prevent his soul returning to him—Sam being concerned about reports that the psychological damage his soul will have sustained while being tortured by Lucifer will destroy him—Bobby easily forgives Sam after his soul is restored, recognizing that Sam was not responsible though he is awkward around him at first due to his actions. Bobby then collaborates with the Winchesters in tracking down Eve, the mother of all monsters, when she is released from Purgatory by a ritual performed by dragons, even after their first attempt results in Bobby being possessed by a brain-controlling slug Eve has created and the death of his old friend and mentor Rufus in [...] "And Then There Were None".|$|E

The minute gradations of culture cannot be closely examined here, but the process is upwards, from people like the Fuegians and Diggers, to the builders of the kitchen-middens--probably quite equals of the Eskimos***--and so through the condition of Ahts.|$|R
500|$|Fleet Admiral Castor Dane, the {{commander}} of a Galactic Federation flagship Olympus, calls {{for a meeting with}} Samus Aran and three other bounty hunters—Rundas, Ghor, and Gandrayda.

The meeting ends abruptly when Space Pirates attack the Federation fleet. Samus and the <b>other</b> bounty <b>hunters</b> are deployed to the planet Norion, where the Space Pirates are concentrating an attack on a Federation naval base. While suppressing the attack, Samus learns that a Phazon asteroid, called a Leviathan Seed, will soon collide into Norion. Samus and the <b>other</b> bounty <b>hunters</b> attempt to activate the base's defense systems, when they are suddenly attacked by Dark Samus. With the <b>other</b> bounty <b>hunters</b> knocked out, a severely wounded Samus manages to activate the system just in time to destroy the Leviathan Seed before she falls unconscious.|$|R

2500|$|About noon on July 17, Nolan met {{the buffalo}} hunters led by James Harvey. [...] One {{of the key}} players was the hunters' main guide Jose Piedad Tafoya, a former Comanchero. He knew the Llano like {{the back of his}} hand but was weak in English. With <b>other</b> <b>hunters</b> helping, Tafoya talked to Nolan under the shade of a huge old pecan tree on Bull Creek which was [...] east of Muchaque Peak in Borden County, Texas.
