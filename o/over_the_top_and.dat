5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|Next in the line, to the north, was Quinn's Post, {{defended by}} the 15th Battalion and the 2nd Light Horse Regiment. For {{some time after}} the start of the Turkish attack, the Turks {{opposite}} Quinn's just threw hand grenades at the post. Around 03:30 the Turks' machine-guns and rifles opened fire at the Australians. This lasted for about an hour when the Turks went <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> assaulted the post. As elsewhere, they were stopped by the weight of the Australian fire, not only from the trench they were attacking, but also by the defenders at Pope's and from the 2nd New Zealand Artillery Battery. Three more Turkish attacks were also repulsed in a similar fashion.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She {{wants to do something}} that's so <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.|$|E

5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity to}} write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant {{to look as if}} it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned {{in order to provide}} control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E

His teammate Jackie McGlew claimed Pollock could have made an outstanding bowler—"He bowled right <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> really made the ball 'fizz'"—but he bowled mainly for enjoyment and with a light heart. In total, he took 4 Test wickets and 43 in first-class cricket. He was also a naturally gifted fielder.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} {{it is now}} a requirement by law to build fish ladders into the design of a weir that ensures that fish can bypass the barrier and access upstream habitat. Unlike dams, weirs do not usually prevent downstream fish migration (as water flows <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> allows fish to bypass the structure), although they can create flow conditions that injure juvenile fish.. Recent studies suggest that navigation locks have also potential to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.|$|E

5|$|TNA {{then held}} an impromptu Ten-Man Gauntlet match to {{determine}} Kevin Nash's replacement {{in the main}} event.

Styles, Jeff Hardy, Kip James, Lance Hoyt, Monty Brown, Rhino, Ron Killings, Sabu, and Samoa Joe. The rules for a Gauntlet match are as follows: two wrestlers start the match with another entering at 2 minute intervals. The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing them <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope <b>and</b> down to the floor.

Fickett was critical of the [...] "parking" [...] storyline, saying that it was [...] "a bit <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> runs a bit thin", but he did think that the scene at the end with Kevin was [...] "a sweet and genuine moment". Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly stated that, in relation to the previous episode [...] "Dinner Party", [...] "Last night's show took another approach. Don't get me wrong.

The 19th season brought along the return of a past houseguest as the 17th houseguest, but he was actually there to take the spot of one of the 16 new houseguests, as a consequence for one of the newbies taking a temptation.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{sequence}} of [...] "Jame Raho" [...] establishes {{the characters of}} the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an [...] "ideal son" [...] who does all the right things. A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence—this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan—but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he {{is different from the}} rest. This concept is furthered by speed ramping and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style. The twilight scenes of [...] "Maa" [...] were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample—they planned to replace him with another singer—but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} half, Arsenal {{struggled}} to overrun Wrexham {{as the home}} side limited their time on the ball and closed players down quickly.

In the 82nd minute, Wrexham were awarded free kick from [...] Having faked to take it quickly, Thomas lined up the shot which arrowed into the top corner past Seaman. The Arsenal goalkeeper had got fingertips from his right-hand to the effort, {{but not enough to}} stop it flying in. Within two minutes of the equaliser, Wrexham went ahead: a poor clearance by Winterburn resulted in Davies latching onto the ball <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and,</b> instead of volleying an effort on goal, he squared it for Watkin. Adams went across the midfielder in an attempt to intervene, but fumbled. An outstretching Watkin poked the ball past Seaman which went beneath the goalkeeper. Arsenal responded by dominating the final minutes with repeated attacks, but Wrexham's defence stood firm. Carter had the ball in the net late on, but the referee ruled the goal out for offside; the final whistle was blown moments later and sparked a pitch invasion from the joyous home fans.|$|E
