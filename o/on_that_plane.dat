25|$|Soil is an {{assemblage}} of particles that have little to no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>plane.</b> The {{angle of internal friction}} is thus closely related to the maximum stable slope angle, often called the angle of repose.|$|E
25|$|Given a curve {{contained}} on the x-y plane, its {{tangent vector}} T is also contained <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>plane.</b> Its binormal vector B can be naturally postulated {{to coincide with}} the normal to the plane (along the z axis). Finally, the curve normal can be found completing the right-handed system, N = B × T. This form is well-defined even when the curvature is zero; for example, the normal to a straight line on a plane will be perpendicular to the tangent, all co-planar.|$|E

2500|$|In mathematics, a spherical {{coordinate}} system is a coordinate system for three-dimensional space where {{the position of a}} point is specified by three numbers: the radial distance of that point from a fixed origin, its polar angle measured from a fixed zenith direction, and the azimuth angle of its orthogonal projection on a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith, measured from a fixed reference direction <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>plane.</b> It {{can be seen as the}} three-dimensional version of the polar coordinate system.|$|E

2500|$|In graph theory, a {{planar graph}} is a graph {{that can be}} {{embedded}} in the plane, i.e., it can be drawn on the plane {{in such a way}} that its edges intersect only at their endpoints. [...] In other words, it can be drawn {{in such a way that}} no edges cross each other. [...] Such a drawing is called a plane graph or planar embedding of the graph. A plane graph can be defined as a planar graph with a mapping from every node to a point on a plane, and from every edge to a plane curve <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>plane,</b> such that the extreme points of each curve are the points mapped from its end nodes, and all curves are disjoint except on their extreme points.|$|E
2500|$|The Jacobean {{debate on}} the Union {{took place in the}} early years of the reign of James I of England, who came to the English throne in 1603 as James VI of Scotland, and was {{interested}} in uniting his kingdoms of England (including Wales) and Scotland.

This wider union did not in fact come about in the 17th century (apart from the arrangements of the 1650s under the Commonwealth); but at the time of the Union of England and Scotland in 1707 arguments from this earlier period were again put into circulation.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{approach}} {{involves the}} determination of a point on the Mohr circle called the pole or the origin of planes. Any straight line drawn from the pole will intersect the Mohr circle at a point that represents the state of stress on a plane inclined at the same orientation (parallel) in space as that line. Therefore, knowing the stress components [...] and [...] on any particular plane, one can draw a line parallel to that plane through the particular coordinates [...] and [...] on the Mohr circle and find the pole as the intersection of such line with the Mohr circle. As an example, let's assume we have a state of stress with stress components , , and , as shown on Figure 7. First, we can draw a line from point [...] parallel to the plane of action of , or, if we choose otherwise, a line from point [...] parallel to the plane of action of [...] The intersection {{of any of these}} two lines with the Mohr circle is the pole. Once the pole has been determined, to find the state of stress on a plane making an angle [...] with the vertical, or in other words a plane having its normal vector forming an angle [...] with the horizontal plane, then we can draw a line from the pole parallel to that plane (See Figure 7). The normal and shear stresses <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>plane</b> are then the coordinates of the point of intersection between the line and the Mohr circle.|$|E

60|$|The {{intellectual}} {{trouble in}} the matter, as it presents itself to me, comes in upon this, that the question does not lie in one plane. So many discussions ignore this fact, {{and deal with it}} on one plane only. For example, we may take the whole business on the plane of the medical man, ignoring all other considerations. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>plane</b> it would probably be almost easy to reason out a working system. It never has been done by the medical profession, as a whole, which is fairly understandable, or by any group of medical men, which is the more surprising, but it would be an extremely interesting thing to have done and a material contribution to the sane discussion of this problem. It would not solve it but it would illuminate certain aspects. Let the mere physiological problem be taken. We want healthy children and the best we can get. Let the medical man devise his scheme primarily for that. Understand we are shutting our eyes to every other consideration but physical or quasi- physical ones. Imagine the thing done, for example, by a Mr. Francis Galton, who had an absolutely open mind upon all other questions. Some form of polygamy, marriage of the most transient description, with reproduction barred to specified types, would probably come from such a speculation. But, in addition, {{a number of people who}} can have only a few children or none are, nevertheless, not adapted physiologically for celibacy. Conceive the medical man working that problem out upon purely materialistic lines and with an eye to all physiological and pathological peculiarities. The Tasmanians (now extinct) seem to have been somewhere near the probable result.|$|E
