Refrigeration shops were monitored to ensure good practice and identify refrigerant brands on the market. Few shops had CFC12 and R134a, and shops {{with a mixture of}} refrigerants had them seized. R-406A, a new refrigerant compatible with CFC12 and HFC134a systems, was found in use. Seminars, with more than 1,420 participants, were held on good refrigeration practice, hydrocarbon as an alternative refrigerant and hydrocarbon technology transfer. The import of equipment using chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was banned in 2010, and customs officers were trained in their detection. Applications for financial incentives from three cold-storage facilities were approved, and the facilities were inspected. EPA officers visited the three major foam-producing factories in Accra and Nsawam to ensure worker safety and environmental compliance.|$|E

Two parallel biofilter columns with granular activated carbon (GAC) and filter sand following a pilot scale <b>ozone</b> <b>unit</b> to treat secondary municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent were studied. The biologically activated carbon (BAC) biofilter outperformed the sand biofilter in terms of DOC, DO and UV 254 removal. In addition, GAC supported more biological activity than sand media. Genotoxicity results show reduced wastewater genotoxicity following ozonation and further reduction following BAC and sand biofiltration. However, bacterial re-growth did occur in both biofilters following ozonation and needs to be taken into consideration when implementing ozone-biofiltration units...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{increase}} of water shortage and competition for fresh water is raising the awareness that {{an increase in}} water use efficiency in horticulture is a necessity. At the same time, environmental awareness and legislation (e. g. the EU Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC) restricts the emissions of nutrients and plant protection products (PPPs). In the Netherlands in soilless growing systems much effort is put into measures to enable maximal recycling of nutrient solutions, thereby decreasing the required amount of fresh water needed and the emission of nutrients and PPPs. Recycling of water fluxes also implicates that the drain water has to be disinfected to prevent rapid dispersal of pathogens. Heat treatment, filtration, Ozone and UV treatment are commonly used disinfection technologies. Some of these technologies (Ozone and UV) {{are known for their}} ability to break down PPPs and therefore their joint application (disinfection and end-of-pipe purification of discharged drain water) have been studied. In this paper we present the results of the integration and optimisation of ozone technology in a cucumber and a sweet pepper soilless cultivation. An Agrozone <b>ozone</b> <b>unit</b> that alternately treated the recycled nutrient solution for the elimination of pathogens and removed PPPs from discharge water was investigated. The <b>ozone</b> <b>unit</b> eliminates pathogens and PPPs by direct oxidation of organic material batchwise. It was shown that both disinfection of the recirculating nutrient solution and removal of PPPs from discharge water are possible with the same ozone equipment, if installed correctly. Preliminary tests with Tomato Mosaic Virus have shown that this technology can completely disinfect (from 402 to 0 lesions per plant), and remove up to 98 % of PPPs from standardised greenhouse discharge water. For disinfection purposes shorter treatment times and lower ozone doses can be applied...|$|E
40|$|Man, {{with its}} activities, {{produces}} and uses substances that have {{negative impact on}} the environment and the human health, and can cause an economic damage. Consequently, they have a great impact on quality of life. Among the most harmful chemicals are Ozone Depleting Substances that are subject of regulation with international conventions. This Paper supports the fact that each country has to undertake national efforts for ozone depleting substances reduction and elimination. In that respect, the general objective of the Paper is to present the Macedonian unique experience regarding its efforts to reduce or eliminate these substances. The following two aspects were subject to the research: national legislation which regulates the Ozone Depleting Substances import and export as well as the implementation of the projects that resulted with the elimination of Ozone Depleting Substances quantities in the period 1995 – 2010. The research outcomes confirm the starting research hypothesis i. e. that with adequately created and implemented national action, the amount of Ozone Depleting Substances consumption can dramatically fall.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{analyzing}} {{the changes to}} aerosol properties caused by the dust storm called “China’s Great Wall of Dust” that originated from the Taklimakan Desert in April 2014. IDDI (Infrared Difference Dust Index) images from FY- 2 E and true color composite images from FY- 3 C MERSI (Medium Resolution Spectral Imager) show the breakout and transport path of the dust storm. Three-hourly ground-based measurements from MICAPS (Meteorological Information Comprehensive Analysis and Process System) suggest that anticyclonic circulation occupying the Southern Xinjiang basin and cyclonic circulation in Mongolia form a dipole pressure system that leads to strong northwesterly winds (13. 7 – 20 m/s), which favored the breakout of the dust storm. IDDI {{results indicate that the}} dust storm breakout occurred at ~ 2 : 00 UTC on 23 April in the Taklimakan Desert. Four-day forward air mass trajectories with the HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model gives the simulation results of the dust transport paths and dust vertical distributions, which are consistent with the corresponding aerosol vertical distributions derived from CALIPSO. The Aerosol Index (AI) data of TOU (Total <b>Ozone</b> <b>Unit)</b> aboard FY- 3 B are first used to study the areas affected by the dust storm. From the AI results, the dust-affected areas agree well with the synoptic meteorological condition analysis, which supports that the synoptic meteorological conditions are the main reason for the breakout and transport of the dust storm. Anomalies of the average MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) distributions over northeast Asia during the dust storm to the average of the values in April between 2010 and 2014 are calculated as a percent. The results indicate high aerosol loading with a spatially-averaged anomaly of 121 % for dusty days between 23 April and 25 April. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) retrievals of VSD (Volume Size Distribution) and SSA (Single Scattering Albedo) show that while the aerosol properties in Dalanzadgad, which is closer to the dust source, were influenced primarily by coarse dust particles, the aerosol properties in Beijing were mostly contributed by fine dust particles that transported over longer distances and at high atmospheric levels...|$|E

40|$|Concentrated {{animal feeding}} {{operations}} (CAFOs) are facing serious challenges {{of responding to}} new regulations soon to be implemented in California limiting emissions of reactive organic gases (ROGs). The justifications for these new regulations are {{the federal and state}} (SB 700) requirements to bring areas classified as ozone non-attainment into attainment and the time-lines set by EPA. Ozone is formed by reaction of ROGs and NOx in the presence of sunlight. ROGs comprise a fraction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being emitted from CAFOs. The research results and published findings quantifying ROG emissions from CAFOs are limited and confounded by the fact that not all VOCs are ROGs. In addition, the reactivities of ROGs vary. Some ROGs referred to as highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) can create 10 times more <b>ozone</b> per <b>unit</b> of ROG than those less reactive. Study results indicate that VOCs emitted from agricultural facilities are different from those emitted from petrochemical and industrial facilities in the urban areas. Because of the urgency of the EPA timeline, the California Air Resource Board (CARB) has been forced to use the only emission factor they could find for CAFOs. For dairy animals, VOC emissions are approximated using 12. 8 pounds per animal pe...|$|R
2500|$|This is {{the most}} common type of ozone {{generator}} for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the [...] "hot spark" [...] coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade <b>ozone</b> generators, these <b>units</b> usually work by means of a corona discharge tube. They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce nitrogen oxides as a by-product. Use of an air dryer can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an oxygen concentrator can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.|$|R
40|$|A {{suite of}} 10 {{autonomous}} <b>ozone</b> monitoring <b>units,</b> each powered using renewable energy, {{was developed and}} built to study surface ozone in Antarctica during the International Polar Year (2007 – 2009). The monitoring systems were deployed in a network around the Weddell Sea sector of coastal Antarctica with a transect up onto the Antarctic Plateau. The aim was to measure for a full year, thus gaining a much-improved broader view of boundary layer ozone seasonality at different locations {{as well as of}} factors affecting the budget of surface ozone in Antarctica. Ozone mixing ratios were measured based on UV photometry using {{a modified version of the}} commercial 2 B Technologies Inc. Model 202 instrument. All but one of the autonomous units measured successfully within its predefined duty cycle throughout the year, with some differences in performance dependent on power availability and ambient temperature. Mean data recovery after removal of outliers was on average 70 % (range 44 – 83 %) and precision varied between 1. 5 and 8 ppbv, thus was sufficiently good to resolve year-round the main ozone features of scientific interest. We conclude that, with adequate power, and noting a minor communication problem, our units would be able to operate successfully at ambient temperatures down to − 60 °C. Systems such as the one described in this paper, or derivatives of it, could therefore be deployed either as local or regional networks elsewhere in the Arctic or Antarctic. Here we present technical information and first results from the experiment...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{emission}} factors from biomass burning {{are prone to}} large errors since they ignore the interplay of mixing and varying pre-fire background CO 2 levels. Such complications severely affected our studies of 446 forest fire plume samples measured in the Western US by the science teams of NASA's SEAC 4 RS and ARCTAS airborne missions. Consequently we propose a Mixed Effects Regression Emission Technique (MERET) to check techniques like the Normalized Emission Ratio Method (NERM), where use of sequential observations cannot disentangle emissions and mixing. We also evaluate a simpler "consensus" technique. All techniques relate emissions to fuel burned using C(burn) = delta C(tot) added to the fire plume, where C(tot) approximately equals (CO 2 = CO). Mixed-effects regression can estimate pre-fire background values of C(tot) (indexed by observation j) simultaneously with emissions factors indexed by individual species i, delta, epsilon lambda tau alpha-x(sub I) /C(sub burn)) I,j. MERET and "consensus" require more than emissions indicators. Our studies excluded samples where exogenous CO or CH 4 might have been fed into a fire plume, mimicking emission. We sought to let the data on 13 gases and particulate properties suggest clusters of variables and plume types, using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). While samples were mixtures, the NMF unmixing suggested purer burn types. Particulate properties (b scant, b abs, SSA, AAE) and gas-phase emissions were interrelated. Finally, we sought a simple categorization useful for modeling ozone production in plumes. Two kinds of fires produced high ozone: those with large fuel nitrogen as evidenced by remnant CH 3 CN in the plumes, and also those from very intense large burns. Fire types with optimal ratios of delta-NOy/delta- HCHO associate with the highest additional <b>ozone</b> per <b>unit</b> Cburn, Perhaps these plumes exhibit limited NOx binding to reactive organics.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of atmospheric ozone is nonuniform both {{in space and}} time. Local ozone concentration vary with altitude, latitude, longitude, and season. Two year ozonesonde data, January 1981 to December 1982, observed at four Canadian stations and 2. 5 year backscattered ultraviolet experiment data on the Nimbus- 4 satellite, April 1970 to August 1972, observed over five American stations were used to study {{the relationship between the}} total ozone, vertical height {{distribution of}} the ozone mixing ratio, vertical height distribution of half total ozone, and the local tropopause height. The results show that there is a postive correlation between total <b>ozone</b> in Dobson <b>Units</b> and the tropopause height in terms of atmospheric pressure. This result suggests that local intrusion of the statosphere into the troposphere, or the local decreasing of tropopause height could occur if there is a local increasing of total ozone. A comparison of the vertical height distribution of the ozone mixing ratio, the modified pressure height of half total ozone and the tropopause height shows that the pressure height of an ozone mixing ratio of 0. 3 micrograms/g, and the modified pressure height of half total ozone are very well correlated with the tropopause pressure height...|$|R
40|$|In {{the unfortunate}} {{event of a}} natural {{disaster}} affecting San Luis Obispo, response from national entities cannot be relied upon for a timely or efficient response. Local disaster recovery is superior because it minimizes response time, the need for costly stockpiling and creates a solution that is uniquely suited to the community that empowers local people in their most troubled times. Extensive planning is required for local disaster recovery and this project aims to provide the research and recovery system design required to implement an effective recovery plan. Potable water is the primary need {{for people in the}} disaster situations described in this paper. San Luis Obispo has the local manufacturing capability to meet all of the cities potable water needs. Clearwater Technology is a leading manufacturer of Ozone generating equipment. Using a modified version of their skid mounted <b>ozone</b> filtration <b>unit,</b> filters can be deployed at Red Cross disaster shelters. To accomplish effective deployment filtration units will have to be assembled faster than Clearwater can typically build products and under very unfavorable circumstances. To reach this ambitious goal Industrial Engineering techniques including lead time reduction, set up time reduction, human factors and design for assembly must be employed. The main focus of this project is improving the parts kitting process with respect to lead time minimization and human factors considerations. Research in these topics provides an additional benefit to Clearwater Technologies who can implement these strategies to take advantage of numerous cost benefits. The results of this project yielded significant monetary savings from reduced parts kitting time as well as from reduced repetitive strain as a result of human factors recommendations. A disaster contingency guide was delivered to Clearwater detailing how all necessary activities should be accomplished in a minimum amount of time. The mutually beneficial nature of preparing the city for disaster, giving students valuable design experience and improving Clearwater’s day to day operations provides a proof of concept for the envisioned Cal Poly Responding to Emergencies using Local Industry (RELI) center. It is a hope of this project that this vision will be brought to reality through the continued efforts and collaboration of Cal Poly students and local industry...|$|R
