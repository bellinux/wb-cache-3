5000|$|Storm were a {{software}} development team for The Sales Curve (Silkworm, The Ninja Warriors), who were affiliated with Accolade. The conversion project was managed by Dan Marchant, with programming by Andrew Taylor, music by Tony Williams, and graphics by Sean McClurg. Before {{working on the}} ZX Spectrum conversion, Taylor spent two weeks reading reviews of other scrolling games and studied videos of the arcade board gameplay. He noted several challenges: [...] "There are some huge sprites in here, some {{half the size of}} the screen, which use up a vast amount of memory. The <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in St Dragon each alien seems to make a much more complicated series of moves than in, say, R-Type, so we've got to try and reproduce them all, which is pretty complicated." [...] He also wanted to achieve smooth scrolling, rather than the by-character-block movement in R-Type, without sacrificing speed. A method called [...] "pre-shifts" [...] was eventually used, in which several versions of a sprite are held in memory, each in a slightly different position, then cycled through to give the appearance of smooth movement. This used up more memory, so restricted the game to the 128K models of Spectrum. The larger sprites, such as the leaping Puma, were handled by dividing them into strips of separate but co-ordinated entities.|$|E

At the time of filming for [...] "Three of a Kind", David Duchovny, who portrays Fox Mulder, was unavailable for filming because he was preparing his directing debut, [...] "The Unnatural". Only David Duchovny's voice appears in the episode, during a scene when The Lone Gunmen electronically synthesize it in order to convince Scully to travel to Las Vegas. In order to compensate for this loss, co-executive producers Vince Gilligan and John Shiban decided to write an episode based around The Lone Gunmen. The two wanted to bring back several characters and unresolved plot lines, mostly notably the disappearance of Susanne Modeski. Gilligan explained, [...] "I'd been thinking a lot about what happened to Susanne Modeski—what happened to her after she drove off with X in that mysterious car at the end of 'Unusual Suspects'". Gilligan and Shiban soon formulated a plot that revolved around the Lone Gunmen in Las Vegas. [...] "Las Vegas just seemed a really good place to put these guys.

Nevertheless, lizards occupy a prominent position due to a nearly endless variability in forms of territorial behaviour on the levels of higher taxons, species, populations and individuals. Examples could be systems of social dominance hierarchy, female territoriality or interspecific territoriality. Importance of territoriality is obvious {{as a way of}} reproduction control and exclusive usage of space and resources and has a positive impact on individuals that are able to defend their territories. On the other hand, there is a higher exposure to predators and a cost in a form of depleted energy.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVDs) {{are responsible}} for 30 % of all death causes worldwide, {{and according to the}} World Health Organization predictions this negative trend will be continued further on. CVDs include diseases related to macro and microvascular system. There are numerous underlying risk factors, but the biggest emphasis is on those that can be modified and therefore lower the incidence of CVD, its complications, and causative morbidity and mortality due to CVDs. This is especially related to hypertension, hyperlipidemias, smoking, increased body mass, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and inadequate level of physical activity and unfavourable dietary habits. The last two are the mostly highlighted and all preventive measures and actions go in that direction. From the aspect of diet, high intake of fats in total, and especially saturated and trans fats, high intake of salt, and high intake of simple carbohydrates, i. e. refined carbohydrates present the backbone of unfavourable dietary habits responsible for rising global problem of CVDs. World’s, European’s as well as the national’s guidelines for prevention and treatment of CVDs contain specific guidelines aiming at the abovementioned aspects. Several dietary approaches arise from these guidelines, but the Mediterranean diet positioned itself as the most optimal for its centuries-old reputation. The <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Mediterranean diet contains all of the principles set by guidelines, and has another important aspects - the aspects of cultural, sociological, and quality-of-life aspect.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fundamental}} principle of classical portfolio theory states that mature capital markets are nearly efficient thus offering no extra returns and low possibilities for international portfolio diversification. Thus {{it is not}} a surprise that in the recent 20 years mutual funds from emerging economies with their high growth rates, frequent abnormal returns and less than perfect positive correlation with developed economies have been attracting an increasing volume of international investment flows. In this context evaluation of emerging markets funds performance has become a frequent topic of discussion and research by modern portfolio theory and theory of capital markets equilibrium. Here it is necessary to state two things about existing studies: the one thing is that they provide quite mixed results - on average, local equity funds do not generate abnormal returns, but they still exist; and the <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such evidence is structured predominantly upon country evidence, thus limiting the possibility to derive some generalized conclusions about mutual fund performance in particular groups of emerging economies or emerging economies per se. Another common drawback of existing studies is their frequent usage of data suffering with survivorship bias, which in light of short time-series of available observations, obviously do not add precision to conclusions, derived on the basis of such samples. In light of the stated above the paper aims to reevaluate absolute and relative risk-adjusted performance of open-end equity mutual funds on the sample of advanced, secondary and frontier economies from the Central and Eastern Europe, from the South Eastern Asia, from the Middle East and North Africa, and BRIC economies for the time span from Q 1 / 2000 to Q 1 / 2015. Following established practice, fund performance is evaluated by means of unconditional and conditional single-factor and multifactor CAPM time-series regressions under which individual fund returns are regressed over factor loadings, given by Sharpe and Treynor ratios, Jensen's alpha and M squared, Fama-French and Carhart measures, raw input data for which is collected from Bloomberg terminal and data sets of World Development Indicators and International Financial Statistics. On the basis {{of a large number of}} performance measures and attributes employed in this research as well as survivorship-bias free database, the chosen study provides a useful insight into mutual fund performance of particular groups of emerging economies or emerging economies per se, documenting important country and regional characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{tracking}} of livestock Cue: For pastoralist communities, livestock {{are like a}} bank account ? the assets on which the community depends. But keeping a careful watch on livestock is not always easy. Many cattle herders brand their animals to leave a permanent, identifying mark on their skin. However, increasingly there are demands for cattle owners to have much more detailed information about their animals, especially {{if they wish to}} sell to foreign markets. In Botswana and Kenya a new technology is currently being tested that aims to provide herders with this detailed information they need. A pilot project, being implemented by a Kenya-based organisation called ERMIS (Environment Research Mapping and Information Systems in Africa), uses small computer chips which are swallowed by the cattle, and which act as an electronic identification system. Linked to satellite-based global positioning systems (GPS), the computer chips are able to keep a record of the animal?s movements. Julius Muchimi, Executive Director of ERMIS explained the benefits and some of the potential hazards of the new technology to Susanna Thorp. IN:		?The technology is actually being ? OUT:		? within the pastoral communities. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 43 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Julius Muchimi on a high tech approach to livestock identification and tracking, which could help to protect cattle and the grazing resources they depend on. Transcript Muchimi	The technology is actually being used in the livestock sector basically in terms of a livestock identification and also the trace back mechanism. And what is happening is that livestock are actually identified in terms of where they come from and then it also helps in terms of identifying how the animals move around pastoral areas and how they can also be traced back in case they are actually lost or in case they are stolen. So it is actually is able to have an identification number and it is also able to give information on where the animal is actually located or where it is at any specific time. Thorp	Now you mentioned the trace back system, this is actually for when you are exporting animals and the EU requirements now insist {{that you have to be}} able to know where that animal has come from and what it has been through in terms of treatments, that?s right isn?t it? Muchimi	Yes that is true because for the African countries to penetrate into the EU market then that is a requirement that the animal must be identified in terms of where it has come from and that is actually the key thing. In Botswana, we know Botswana is actually doing very well in the livestock market and in Kenya we are unable to penetrate the EU market but we are seeing that by taking that technology and using it within our livestock sector then we are going to have a niche within the European Market. So we are trying to advance the technology, one, to penetrate into the European Market and two, to be able to also retain and contain our livestock resources within our territories so that then we can bring down the issue of cattle rustling, stealing cattle within the country and also across the borders to other countries. So we want to retain our assets and we want to get our market niche. Thorp	What about with actually managing pastoral rangelands, I mean is there the potential to sort of see how the pastoralists are using the land and help them make the most so that they are not contributing to degradation issues? Muchimi	The technology is actually quite important in terms of resource allocation because you can know the number of animals that are within a given region, and you can actually be able to have a kind of a regional appropriation of pastoral resources like the grazing resources, where water is and also where pasture is. So you can actually be able to apportion, so that you have sustainable use of natural resources. So it is actually a technology that - well used - then it can also bring a lot of sustainability. And I think actually that is the strength in that you can allocate resources in an equitable way. Thorp	So it sounds like it could be quite successful but what challenges are there in using this technology? Muchimi	One is the issue of the cost. We have to really think is it really affordable by the community? The <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> can the community also be able to now take the technology further by using GPS and using the GIS software because the technology is actually moving. The question is, is it an appropriate technology that the community can use without external assistance? So the issue is actually sustainability of the technology. Thorp	But what about the information that is generated and who owns that information? I mean if you are using these very modern technologies and you are using a computer chip and you are linking it in with GPS, then there is the potential for other people to take that information and use it for other means? Muchimi	Yes that is actually a problem. If you look at the technology, it was invented for military purposes, monitoring your enemies or even remotely monitoring resources that are outside your territory. So when you bring this technology then you give your enemy a chance of knowing exactly where your assets are, where your animals are, and if they want to track it, it is actually very clear. They can actually use GIS and other systems to monitor actually where you are migrating to, where you are grazing your animals and also where you are also possibly going to sell. So they can intercept you. So it is a technology that needs a lot of care and we have to look at actually, are the communities secure by using this technology because it exposes them, it makes them vulnerable. Thorp	So, some good advantages, but some disadvantages that have to be taken into consideration. Do you see it as something that will be taken up more widespreadly? Muchimi	Yes because the benefits are more than even the threats. Many communities we would like to move forward because it is securing their livestock and it is also securing the environment, meaning the sustainability of the whole livestock production system within the pastoral communities.
