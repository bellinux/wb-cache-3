5|$|Less formally: Consider all {{possible}} (not actual) worlds {{in which you}} always choose the right. In all those, {{there will be a}} subpart of the world that says you were free to choose a certain right <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> action, but does not say whether you chose it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then you'd chose the wrong.|$|E

5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b> The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E
60|$|Then {{of course}} there was more fighting, as every one knew would happen, except the British Colonial Office; indeed all Zululand ran with blood.

Often I wonder whether Party politics will not in the end prove the ruin of the British Empire. Well, thank Heaven, I shall not live to learn.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{attempts}} to define Mary Wollstonecraft’s Mary: A Fiction and Maria <b>or</b> The <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman as early feminist propaganda from its historical perspective. Initially, feministic values {{as well as}} propaganda {{are connected to the}} eighteenth century with the help of contemporary scholars.  These theories are then applied on Wollstonecraft’s Mary: A Fiction and Maria <b>or</b> the <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman, in order to establish these as propaganda. The conclusion reached is that Wollstonecraft had a political and feminist aim when writing her novels as there are many similarities between Mary: A Fiction and Maria <b>or</b> The <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman and her political text A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Thus, it is possible to regard Mary: A Fiction and Maria <b>or</b> The <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman as early feminist propaganda...|$|R

5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Conviction, {{the game}} {{would have no}} {{interactive}} torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and {{it was hoped that}} players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray and there are no right <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.|$|E
5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain actions are right <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b> Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XII, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} released by Square Enix in 2006, {{revolves around the}} attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the cadre of other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their stories were created by Yasumi Matsuno. The characters were designed to look and behave unlike any that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their stories were written to create a script where neither side was truly right <b>or</b> <b>wrong,</b> but instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E
