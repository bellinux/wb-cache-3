5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{asked to}} remain in Korea to fly another 25 flights, but his request was denied. He was given the option of {{choosing}} which base he wished to be stationed at in the United States; he requested Bryan AFB in Bryan, Texas. He served there as a flight instructor, and was joined by his wife and son. His second child was born there in 1953. During a training exercise with a cadet, a trainee pilot caused a flap to break <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> sending it spinning out of control. Grissom climbed from the rear seat of the small craft {{to take over the}} controls and safely land the jet.|$|E
5000|$|Neosho and Sims had {{performed}} a valuable service, drawing <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> {{that might otherwise}} have hit Fletcher's carriers. Meanwhile, Yorktown and Lexingtons planes found Shōhō and sank her. One of Lexingtons pilots reported this victory with the radio message, [...] "Scratch one flattop".|$|R
50|$|After {{overhaul}} in Pearl Harbor in August 1944, Edwards reported {{arrival at}} San Pedro Bay, Leyte, 30 October for patrol. She joined the assault {{force for the}} landings at Ormoc on 7 December. Here the destroyer splashed several of the attackers as well as aiding ships they had damaged. A resupply echelon to Ormoc met similar opposition but drove <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> and got <b>the</b> convoy through.|$|R

5|$|Her {{choice to}} {{film in the}} Kingdom met some resistance. In discussion, Bigelow found that her cast and crew shared {{stereotypes}} of the region from American culture. “Sadly people in America and Los Angeles have these perceptions,” she said. “But once you get <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> you realise it's like Manhattan without the trees,” she continued. As Iraq dominated discourse in America and across the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{confronted by}} Scully, Sharon denies that Max brought a {{radioactive}} substance aboard the plane, but divulges {{that she is}} not actually Max's sister. She also gives up details about his underground life. Scully subsequently tells Mulder that Max worked at an environmental energy plant in Colorado under an alias, and believes that he may have caused the crash after bringing plutonium on board; Mulder, however, believes that Max was taken <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> by a UFO, and that Rehbun's injuries were caused by exposure to the craft. Scully informs Mulder that Max's body has already been pulled from the crash site. Meanwhile, Sharon is abducted from her hotel room.|$|E
5|$|After finding Sharon's trashed hotel room, Mulder {{meets with}} Millar, who {{tells him that}} the door was pulled <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> from the outside while it was in flight. Later, Frish finds his {{colleague}} dead from a faked suicide. A group of commandos arrive to capture Frish, but he escapes. Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds later, {{there was an explosion}} and the plane disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO. He finds Sharon nearby, having just been returned by her abductors.|$|E

30|$|Using all the {{relocated}} feature points, we next remove outliers from {{a set of}} tentative matches by Homography-RANSAC. We rather use a vanilla RANSAC {{instead of}} the state-of-the-art spatial verification [59] by {{taking into account the}} spatial density of feature correspondences. To detect inlier matches lying on several planes, Homography-RANSAC is repeated while excluding the inlier matches of the best hypothesis. The RANSAC inlier/outlier threshold is set to be loose to allow features <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
50|$|At 08:51, 4 {{minutes after}} takeoff, {{during the final}} descent, the {{aircraft}} hit several trees, losing {{a large part of}} the right wing. It struck the ground tail-first, sliding along the field for 110 m, breaking into three parts before coming to a stop. 25 people were injured, 2 of them seriously, but there were no fatalities. One of the reasons of no fatalities was said to be the brace position that had been instructed by the flight attendants. The tail cone of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> broke <b>off</b> and <b>the</b> main landing gear of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> dug marks on the field and sheared <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>plane's</b> nose gear also broke <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> aircraft was determined to be damaged beyond repair and was written off.|$|R
5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize {{that all of them}} are still alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having gotten <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> While driving to the hospital, they are involved in a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E
25|$|After {{asking a}} flight {{attendant}} for permission to move to seat 26K, saying {{he could get a}} better view from that seat, Yousef moved to that seat and tucked the assembled bomb into the life vest pocket under that seat. He exited the aircraft in Cebu. Philippine domestic Flight Attendant Maria De La Cruz noticed that Yousef had switched seats {{during the course of the}} Manila to Cebu flight and got <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> in Cebu with the domestic cabin crew, but did not pass the information along to the international flight crew that boarded at Cebu for the trip to Tokyo. 25 other passengers also got <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> at Cebu, where 256 more passengers and a new cabin crew boarded the plane for the final leg of the flight to Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and blew <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane's</b> vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were able to keep <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 May, Chicago {{was ordered}} from Nouméa to join Commander, Southwest Pacific, {{and on the}} 4th she {{supported}} [...] in her strike against the Japanese on Tulagi, Solomon Islands during the Battle of the Coral Sea. On 7 May, she proceeded, with the Support Group, to intercept and attack the Japanese Port Moresby invasion group. The following day, the group underwent several Japanese air attacks, during which Chicago suffered several casualties from strafing, but drove <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> and proceeded ahead until {{it was clear that}} the Japanese force had been turned back.|$|R
5000|$|Once allowed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> and {{transferred}} to various emergency shelters in and around Gander ("Darkness and Trees"), the passengers and crew watch replays of {{the attacks on the}} news and learn the true reason why they were grounded ("Lead Us Out of the Night"). The frightened and lonely passengers desperately try to contact their families and pray for their loved ones, while the townsfolk work through the night to help them in any and every way they can ("Phoning Home / Costume Party / I Am Here / Prayer").|$|R
25|$|The {{crash was}} caused by turbulence-induced {{structural}} failure. Due to buffeting stresses, the stabilizer shaft broke and the B-52's vertical stabilizer came <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> It was found 1.5 miles (2.4km) from where the plane struck the mountain side. With {{the loss of the}} vertical stabilizer, the aircraft had lost its directional stability and rolled uncontrollably.|$|E
25|$|The hijackers, {{reported}} as three Bolivian men, demanded {{to speak with}} President Calderón. They claimed to be carrying a package with tape and cables, which {{was said to be}} an explosive device. The government went into an emergency meeting, in what was being described as a national emergency. At 14:37, most hostages were taken <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> and evacuated by bus.|$|E
25|$|On September 10, 1978, a {{small private}} plane {{carrying}} United States Marine Corps Reserve officers Maj. Virgil Osborne, Capt. James Robbins, and Capt. Wayne W. Wisbrock smashed {{into one of}} the bridge's suspension cables while flying in a heavy fog. The impact tore the wings <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> which then plunged into the Straits of Mackinac. All three men were killed.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 a small {{aeroplane}} {{landed on the}} summit plateau of Helvellyn and took <b>off</b> again. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> was an Avro 585 Gosport, a two-seater biplane flown by Bert Hinkler, a test pilot who worked for A V Roe, <b>the</b> <b>plane's</b> manufacturers, at Woodford Aerodrome near Manchester.|$|R
50|$|On 16 Oct 1965, two Phantom jets {{collided}} {{in midair}} 20 mi from the America, both pilots ejected safely. On 3 September 1965 {{on the way}} to Taranto, a plane and pilot were lost when the catapult malfunctioned and tore the front landing gear <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plane; <b>the</b> <b>plane's</b> aux fuel tank ruptured and <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> went over <b>the</b> side. An airman was burned in the catwalk and the RA ejected safely but the pilot went down with <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> Since leaving Norfolk, America had lost five planes.|$|R
25|$|Stahlschmidt {{was awarded}} the German Cross in Gold on 9 April 1942. Stahlschmidt crash-landed and being shot down by ground-fire on 7 May in Werknummer 8480. The rocky terrain tore <b>off</b> <b>the</b> tail <b>plane</b> of <b>the</b> Bf 109.|$|R
25|$|On June 4, 2007, a Cessna Citation II crashed after {{reporting}} a runaway trim tab. The pilot issued a distress signal {{within five minutes}} after taking <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> then crashed into Lake Michigan two miles (3km) off shore. The plane was carrying an organ transplant team from the University of Michigan back to Willow Run Airport. There was a crew of two and four passengers aboard. All six died.|$|E
25|$|The fighter's wing {{collided}} with the top rear fuselage of the All American, almost cleaving the bomber's tail section off, leaving a large diagonal gash {{from the base of}} the All American's tail and severing the left horizontal stabilizer completely <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> Metal in the airframe near the right tailplane was the only thing keeping the tail section, housing the rear gunner, attached to the aircraft. The fighter broke apart, leaving some pieces in the bomber's fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The Klein bottle, proper, {{does not}} self-intersect. Nonetheless, {{there is a}} way to {{visualize}} the Klein bottle as being contained in four dimensions. By adding a fourth dimension to the three-dimensional space, the self-intersection can be eliminated. Gently push a piece of the tube containing the intersection along the fourth dimension, out of the original three-dimensional space. A useful analogy is to consider a self-intersecting curve on the plane; self-intersections can be eliminated by lifting one strand <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On 6 September 1970, the PFLP (including Leila Khaled) hijacked four {{passenger}} aircraft from Pan Am, TWA and Swissair on {{flights to}} New York from Brussels, Frankfurt and Zürich, and failed {{in an attempt}} to hijack an El Al aircraft which landed safely in London after one hijacker was killed and the other overpowered; and on 9 September 1970, hijacked a BOAC flight from Bahrain to London via Beirut. The Pan Am flight was diverted to Cairo; the TWA, Swissair and BOAC flights were diverted to Dawson's Field in Zarqa, Jordan. The TWA, Swissair and BOAC aircraft were subsequently blown up by the PFLP on 12 September, in front of the world media, after all passengers had been taken <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes.</b> <b>The</b> event is significant, as it was cited as a reason for the Black September clashes between Palestinian and Jordanian forces.|$|R
50|$|In April 2015 further arrests were made. It was {{reported}} that flights had started even before 1976, and continued until 1983. An organised military structure was in place to carry out these flights, Batallón de Aviación del Ejército 601 (Army Air Battalion 601), with a commander, sub-commander, chief of staff, and officers of five companies making up the unit. Soldiers who refused to take part, {{as well as others}} who acted as airfield guards and runway cleaners, testified that they had seen live people and corpses loaded onto aircraft; after taking <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> returned empty.|$|R
50|$|He was {{drifting}} {{and sitting}} {{out on the}} floats. All of a sudden <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> gave a big jerk and knocked him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> floats. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> was towed <b>off</b> and he barely made it to shore. He walked for miles while <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> was towed around the lake.|$|R
25|$|Adding to the plane's {{troubles}} was the pilots' {{decision to}} maneuver closely behind a DC-9 that was taxiing {{just ahead of}} them prior to takeoff, due to their mistaken belief that the warmth from the DC-9's engines would melt the snow and ice that had accumulated on Flight 90's wings. This action—which went specifically against flight manual recommendations for an icing situation—actually contributed to additional icing on the 737. The exhaust gases from the other aircraft melted the snow on the wings, but during takeoff, instead of falling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> this slush mixture froze on the wings' leading edges and the engine inlet nose cone.|$|E
25|$|A cell-first {{cross-section}} uses some hyperplane {{parallel to}} one of the octahedral cells of a 24-cell. Consider, for instance, some hyperplane orthogonal to the vector (1,1,0,0). The cross-section of {3,4,3,3} by this hyperplane is a rectified cubic honeycomb. Each cuboctahedron in this honeycomb is a maximal cross-section of a 24-cell whose center lies in the plane. Meanwhile, each octahedron is a boundary cell of a (4-dimensional) 24-cell whose center lies <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> Shifting this hyperplane till it lies halfway between the center of a 24-cell and the boundary, one obtains a bitruncated cubic honeycomb. The cuboctahedra have shrunk, and the octahedra have grown until they are both truncated octahedra. Shifting again, so the hyperplane intersects the boundary of the central 24-cell gives a rectified cubic honeycomb again, the cuboctahedra and octahedra having swapped positions. As the hyperplane sweeps through 4-space, the cross-section morphs between these two honeycombs periodically.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2006, Chen {{canceled}} {{plans to}} pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping to stop by either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Chen {{would not be allowed to}} step <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen's cancellation. The trip to Latin America will continue, however, without a US stopover. The US State Department claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to Cornell University eleven years ago. More recently, in addition, Taiwan's leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This recent American stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of the increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen's seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inauguration of Óscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, one of the few countries that recognized the Republic of China at that time. Laura Bush was also present to represent U.S. president George W. Bush. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her and shook her hands, while Chen's aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu photo-op. Chen's supporters saw this act as a step forward in Taiwan's struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claimed that it was a grave breach of international etiquette and put Taiwan to shame.|$|E
2500|$|Passengers {{and others}} praised the flight attendants' conduct after the crash. Cabin manager Lee Yoon-hye was last <b>off</b> <b>the</b> burning <b>plane.</b> San Francisco fire chief Hayes-White praised Lee's courage, saying, [...] "She {{wanted to make}} sure that {{everyone}} was off. ... She was a hero." ...|$|R
50|$|Minutes after {{departing from}} Haile Selassie I International Airport bound for Paris, when the {{aircraft}} was flying at some 29000 ft, seven {{members of the}} Eritrean Liberation Front stood up and tried {{to gain control of}} <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> A hand grenade that was armed by one of the hijackers was rolled down the aisle by a passenger. The grenade exploded in the rear part of the fuselage, some 6 in <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane's</b> centreline, blowing a hole in the cabin floor and damaging or severing several controls of the aircraft, including those of throttle of two engines, of the rudder, and of the horizontal stabiliser. Despite this, the crew turned back the airplane to the airport of origin and managed to land it safely; it sustained minor damages that were repaired later.|$|R
5000|$|The {{white balance}} of the two {{photographs}} are far <b>off.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> {{were part of the}} photograph, it would appear more yellow. This can be confirmed by comparison with the deck rail at the bottom of <b>the</b> photograph; <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> had nearly <b>the</b> same tint as the deck, while in the photo the two parts show obviously different in color.|$|R
