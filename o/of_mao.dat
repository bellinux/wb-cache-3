5|$|As the {{political}} winds of the Cultural Revolution shifted, Bo and his siblings were either imprisoned or {{sent to the}} countryside, and Bo Xilai was locked up for five years.

Bo Yibo was politically rehabilitated, and, in 1979, became vice premier.|$|E
5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity <b>of</b> <b>MAO</b> in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E

5|$|In February 1928 Peng joined general Ho Chien when Ho {{defected}} back to Chiang's forces, {{and gained}} a promotion to full colonel after rejoining Chiang. After rejoining Chiang's Nanjing government, Peng {{was stationed in}} the mountainous Pingjiang County, northwest of Changsha. His orders were to eliminate local groups of communist guerrillas who had fled to the area following the Shanghai massacre of 1927. Because Peng had secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party, he instead kept his unit passive and began to organize local Communist Party branches. Peng made contact with local communist guerillas, nominally attached to the forces <b>of</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong and Zhu De, and decided to issue a pronouncement {{in favor of the}} Communists on July 18, 1928.|$|E
5|$|The {{early life}} of Chinese revolutionary and {{politician}} Mao Zedong covered the first 27 {{years of his}} life, from 1893 to 1919. Born in Shaoshanchong, Shaoshan in Hunan province, Mao grew up as the son <b>of</b> <b>Mao</b> Yichang, a wealthy farmer and landowner. Sent to the local Shaoshan Primary School, Mao {{was brought up in}} an environment of Confucianism, but reacted against this from an early age, developing political ideas from modern literature. Aged 13 his father organised a marriage for him with Luo Yigu, the daughter of another land-owning family, but Mao denounced the marriage and moved away from home.|$|E
5|$|The {{interviews}} helped improve Nixon's financial position—at {{one point}} in early 1975 he had only $500 in the bank—as did the sale of his Key Biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy Nixon friends such as Bebe Rebozo. In February 1976, Nixon visited China at the personal invitation <b>of</b> <b>Mao.</b> Nixon had wanted to return to China, but chose to wait until after Ford's own visit in 1975. Nixon remained neutral in the close 1976 primary battle between Ford and Reagan. Ford won, but was defeated by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter in the general election. The Carter administration had little use for Nixon and blocked his planned trip to Australia, causing the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to withhold its official invitation.|$|E

5|$|The women's {{movement}} {{during the}} Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), like other movements in this period, came {{to depend on}} the cult <b>of</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong. During the Cultural Revolution, the women’s movement was viewed as bourgeois and reactionary since it had originated in the West. The ACWF shutdown in 1968 because it was considered anti-revolutionary. The party argued that the women’s movement needed to be completely immersed in the revolutionary movement instead of harboring its own agenda. The offices of the ACWF were occupied by the army and many of the female cadres who had been involved with the women’s movement were sent to labor camps in the countryside. Women’s work ceased to function until the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the shock}} of the Western public, the {{practice}} of Vietnamese monks self-immolating was not unprecedented. Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The French colonial authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Huế in the 1920s, but he managed to starve himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of Harbin in 1948 when a monk seated down in the lotus position on a pile of sawdust and soybean oil and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the communists <b>of</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong. His heart remained intact, as did that of Đức.|$|E
5|$|During the Long March Zhu and Zhou Enlai {{organized}} certain {{battles in}} tandem. There were few positive effects since {{the real power}} was {{in the hands of}} Bo Gu and Otto Braun. In the Zunyi Conference, Zhu supported Mao Zedong’s criticisms of Bo and Braun. After the conference, Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs. In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth Red Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First Red Army. When separation between the two divisions occurred, Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao, the leader of Fourth Red Army, to go south. The Fourth Red Army barely survived the retreat through Sichuan Province. Arriving in Yan'an, Zhu directed the reconstruction of the Red Army under the political guidance <b>of</b> <b>Mao.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1949 Zhu {{was named}} Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army (PLA);it {{is in this}} way posterity regards him as a {{principal}} founder of the PLA. He also served as the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party (1956–1966) and Vice-Chairman of the People's Republic of China (1954–1959). Zhu oversaw the PLA during the Korean War within his authority as Commander-in-Chief. In 1955, he was conferred {{to the rank of}} marshal. At the Lushan Conference, he tried to protect Peng Dehuai, by giving some mild criticisms of Peng; rather than denouncing him, he merely gently reproofed his targeted comrade, who was a target <b>of</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong. Mao wasn't satisfied with Zhu De's behavior. After the conference, Zhu was dismissed from vice chairmen of Central Military Commission, not in least part due to his loyalty for the fallen Peng.|$|E
5|$|Although the CCC {{became a}} {{powerful}} political {{force in the}} following years, at the 8th National Congress in 1956 its inspectors were warned about abusing their power and becoming independent of their local party committees. Its power waned during the Great Leap Forward, but the CCC, the Secretariat and the Organisation Department became the chief weapons {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Leap to combat corruption and reverse verdicts on rightists. The CCC played its new role until the Cultural Revolution, a socio-political movement which lasted from 1966 until 1976, when it was affected by purges (partly due to its close ties to Peng Zhen, one of the first highly ranked officials purged during the Cultural Revolution). At the 9th National Congress in 1969 the CCC was abolished, removed from the party constitution and replaced by special-case organisations (such as the Central Case Examination Group) formed under Mao and Kang Sheng. Despite its abolition at the congress, little criticism was directed at the CCC during the Cultural Revolution; although CCC Deputy Secretary Min Yifan was criticised by the Red Guards, a revolutionary youth movement independent of the party (but inspired by Mao) during the Cultural Revolution, most of their disapproval focused on his career on local committees rather than the CCC. Talk of an internal party-control system would not resurface until the death <b>of</b> <b>Mao</b> and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that MAO inhibitors were {{eventually}} replaced by tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors {{in the treatment of}} depression, there is still enormous interest in the function <b>of</b> <b>MAO.</b> The discovery of different MAO subtypes has led to research on selective MAO subtype inhibitors, which have been shown to exhibit reduced side effects and greater specificity during inhibition. These MAO subtype inhibitors are being used in the treatment of geriatric depression and as potential replacements for MAO reuptake inhibitors.
