40|$|The thesis investigates optical {{measuring}} {{and statistical}} data processing, and presents {{a method to}} understand and reduce sawing variation by examination of sawn timber sizes. Continuous timber size control offers improved opportunities for analysing <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> or even individual sawblades. The thesis is illustrated with seven <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> case studies {{that relate to the}} development of the technique. Log and cant breakdown is examined in single- and double-arbor circular saws and bandsaws. The first analysis of each <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is made in normal production, and the second using a controlled benchmarking test. A total of 44350 logs were sawn in the study. The behaviour of a <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is described using such descriptors as total, within-board and between-board standard deviations, and sawblade bend. Based on observations in benchmarking, an equation y=αeβx±R, where α and β are constants, R the process reproducibility, and x a variable that expresses sawing time and saw load, can be established for each of the <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> descriptors. An example is the total standard deviation descriptor function s= 0. 21 e 0. 58 x± 0. 11, established for a single-arbor circular saw in a 4 -piece saw set-up. The method will help a sawmill to establish descriptors and equations used to describe the behaviour of their <b>saw</b> <b>machines,</b> to baseline <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> performance and to compare it to best practices in the industry. The descriptors may be used to establish current, short- or long-term capabilities and characteristics. The method can be used to examine various production conditions and tooling, such as effects of log size, feed speed, and sawing time. Other factors include saw speed, sawblade parameters, operation of setworks and feedworks, and effects of seasons. The results of the study show that sawblade behaviour, feedworks and work piece holding problems, and previous <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> may be causes of large sawing variation. reviewe...|$|R

In this study we evaluated the extent of thermal damage which occurs in four different methods of osteotomy and the effects it can have on bone healing. We further wanted to test whether a special osteotomy plate we constructed can lead to diminished heat generation during osteotomy and enhanced bone healing. The four methods evaluated included osteotomy performed by chisel, a newly constructed osteotomy plate, Gigly and <b>oscillating</b> <b>saw.</b> Twelve adult sheep underwent osteotomy performed on both tibiae. Bone fragments were stabilized using a fixation plate. Callus size was assessed using standard radiographs. Densitometry and histological evaluation were performed at 8 weeks following osteotomy. Temperature measurements were performed both in vivo during the operation, and ex vivo on explanted tibiae. The defects healed without complications and showed typical course of secondary fracture healing with callus ingrowth into the osteotomy gap. Radiographic examination of bone healing showed a tendency towards more callus formation in bones osteotomized using Gigly and <b>oscillating</b> <b>saw,</b> but this difference lacked significance. Use of Gigly and <b>oscillating</b> <b>saw</b> elicited much higher temperatures at the bone cortex surface, which subsequently lead to slightly impaired bone healing according to histological analysis. BMD was equal among all bones. In conclusion, the time required for complete healing of the defect differed depended greatly on the instruments used.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionClosing-wedge high tibial {{osteotomy}} is {{a surgical}} option {{for patients with}} isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis and varus knee alignment. Vascular complications are rare, but incriminate the use of <b>oscillating</b> <b>saw</b> or osteotome. It {{is important to know}} the steps of this surgery that involve risk of vascular injury and what to do to decrease that risk. HypothesisPerforming the distal osteotomy cut using an <b>oscillating</b> <b>saw</b> is a step with high risk of vascular injury. A protective device behind the tibia may decrease this risk. Materials and methodsIn this descriptive angiographic cadaver study, closing-wedge high tibial osteotomy was performed on 6 cadaveric knees in 90 ° knee flexion, and the distance between the surgical instrument and the popliteal artery was measured on fluoroscopy with artery opacification at the various steps of surgery. ResultsTibial osteotomy with <b>oscillating</b> <b>saw</b> involves high vascular risk: the mean distance between the saw-blade and the popliteal artery is 10. 6 mm in 90 ° knee flexion. Using a specific device placed behind the tibia protects the vascular structures. DiscussionHigh tibial osteotomy is indicated in medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee and can be performed by closing or opening-wedge. Vascular injuries in closing-wedge osteotomy exist and it is recommended to perform this surgery at 90 ° knee flexion, although some studies report that this does not move the artery out of the way. A risk of vascular lesion should be kept in mind. The oscillation of the saw and the direction of the osteotomy should also be taken into consideration when performing a closing-wedge high tibial osteotomy {{in order to protect the}} popliteal artery.

30|$|Frierson et al. {{conducted}} a study comparing three different osteotomy techniques in assessment of regeneration properties in distraction osteogenesis. Their findings showed that vessels bridging the regenerate gap were diminished in the group in which the <b>oscillating</b> <b>saw</b> was used to perform the osteotomy. However, there was an abundance of vessels bridging {{the gap in the}} remaining two groups, corticotomy and multiple drill hole groups. This then led them to conclude that the <b>oscillating</b> <b>saw</b> may lead to delayed consolidation [51]. The challenge of keeping the medullary endosteal supply in continuity during the corticotomy has surfaced repeatedly [22, 29]. Dividing the anteromedial and anterolateral cortices through an anterior approach is relatively simple. To complete the corticotomy, a rotational force is applied. This frequently results in an oblique fracture through the posterior cortex as it is the central axis of rotation. The medullary contents are said to undergo shearing that disrupt the vascular supply. Frierson, Kojimoto, Kawamura and Aronson all confirmed neovascularisation of arterioles following transection of the medullary blood supply. Frierson’s work also confirmed osseous regeneration in distraction can be achieved following complete transection of the medullary vascular supply. In addition, there were no histological or radiological differences between the corticotomy and transverse osteotomy groups.|$|R

A general linear model (repeated measures) was used to identify within-group and between group differences (PIEZO vs CTR) at different timepoints. Statistical significant differences were set at p 0. 05). The pain rate was higher in the control group at all time points. Conclusions: Piezosurgery technique seemed to assure a low risk procedure and a conservative approach.

By using a frequency of 25 – 29 kHz only mineralized tissue is cut, sparing the soft tissue. This reduces the risk of nerve lesions. As {{there is a lack of}} experience with this technique in the field of orthopaedic bone surgery, we performed the first ultrasound osteotomy in hand surgery. Method While performing a correctional osteotomy of the 5 th metacarpal bone we used the Piezosurgery ® Device from Mectron [Italy] instead of the usual <b>oscillating</b> <b>saw.</b> We will report on our experience with one case, with a follow up time of one year. Results The cut was highly precise and there were no vibrations of the bone. The time needed for the operation was slightly longer than the time needed while using the usual saw.

Using the fine tip enables curved cutting and provides an opportunity for new osteotomy techniques.
