An additional year's funding was made available to give time to examine alternative <b>operating</b> <b>models,</b> and in 2011 the museum was reopened by Charles Lambie, the chairman of the trustees of Canterbury Archaeological Trust, who intended to build an extension to the building focusing on the penal history of Westgate. Lambie died in 2012, having invested £1 million in the project, causing the closure of the museum and generating fresh questions about the building's future. In 2014, the council agreed to assign the lease to the One Pound Lane company, who stated that they intended to reopen the existing museum and develop a restaurant and bar in the premises. The Westgate reopened to the public on August 3rd, 2015.|$|E

2500|$|While {{disruptive}} innovation will typically [...] "attack a traditional business {{model with a}} lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly," [...] foundational innovation is slower, and typically {{has the potential to}} create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational innovation tends to transform business <b>operating</b> <b>models</b> as entirely new business models emerge over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of technological and institutional change that gain momentum more slowly. [...] The advent of the packet-switched communication protocol TCP/IP—originally introduced in 1972 to support a single use case for United States Department of Defense electronic communication (email), and which gained widespread adoption only in the mid-1990s {{with the advent of the}} World Wide Web—is a foundational technology.|$|E

The concept of ITaaS as an <b>operating</b> <b>model</b> is not limited to or dependent on cloud computing. Several proponents of ITaaS as an <b>operating</b> <b>model</b> will insist that the ability for an IT organization to deliver ITaaS is enabled by underlying technology models such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
