5|$|Rather than {{sticking}} to the formulas of , which remain popular in Japan even today, Bashō aspired to reflect his real environment and emotions in his hokku. Even during his lifetime, the effort and style of his poetry was widely appreciated; after his death, it <b>only</b> <b>increased.</b> Several of his students compiled quotations from him about his own poetry, most notably Mukai Kyorai and Hattori Dohō.|$|E
5|$|Shoup's {{opposition}} to the war <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> over time; he initially pushed for a negotiated settlement but later supported a unilateral pullout from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its air operations, he remained opposed to any strategy that risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E

Hail up to 1 in (25mm) wide, wind gusts over 50mph (60km/h), and many reports of wind damage were reported in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts before noon. Severe weather is an unusual occurrence in the morning, and the activity <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> in severity towards the middle of the afternoon.|$|E

5|$|The common {{soldiers}} fought bravely at first, {{but they}} were saddled with low pay (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> over time.|$|E

Starting with Mircea the Shepherd (15451559), the first prince placed on the throne by the sultan, the crown became negotiable, {{according}} to the largest tribute offered. Even Michael the Brave who in time would turn against the Ottomans ascended the throne {{with the support of}} some people who had influence with the Sublime Porte, among them Sir Edward Barton, the English ambassador to Istanbul.|$|E

On Saturday, March 28 at 11:30am the Storm Prediction Center issued a Day2 moderate risk of severe weather for southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, northwest Illinois and much of Wisconsin.

5|$|By August, as the {{serviceability}} and {{the quantity}} of the Luftwaffe's inventory steadily diminished due to combat, demand for air support <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> as the VVS recovered. The Luftwaffe found itself struggling to maintain local air superiority. With the onset of bad weather in October, the Luftwaffe was on several occasions forced to halt nearly all aerial operations. The VVS, although faced with the same weather difficulties, had a clear advantage thanks to the prewar experience with cold-weather flying, {{and the fact that}} they were operating from intact airbases and airports. By December, the VVS had matched the Luftwaffe and was even pressing to achieve air superiority over the battlefields.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} word planet, though it had yet to be defined, had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in the Solar System. After 1992, however, astronomers began to {{discover}} many additional objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars. These discoveries not <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly large enough to be stars, while others were smaller than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a planet could be.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} the Coffin family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves <b>only</b> <b>increased.</b> Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing {{to give to the}} runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure a steady supply of goods to assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{regarded}} the second Pittsburgh convention {{as a serious}} threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Buczynski {{started at}} the Old School Elementary in Queens, where he made good grades and {{particularly}} enjoyed music, reading, drawing, and painting. In August 1954, his mother gave birth to his first brother, Frank, whom he would remain fond of despite the seven-year age gap. Although his family was Roman Catholic, he took an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Ancient Egypt and Classical Greece, which he read about in books. He began devising and performing his own rituals to the deities of these religions, sparking his lifelong interest in Contemporary Paganism. His interest in Pagan religion <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> following his father's sudden death {{from a heart attack}} at age 31 in August 1958. His mother married Edward Nascato in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the whiskey tax, westerners {{had a number of}} other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception that the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> tensions on the frontier.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, Clairmont {{became a}} lover of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had a second child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin. In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate. Godwin's debts {{continued}} to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter. At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with {{the tension in the}} Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdist Rebellion {{broke out}} in 1881 when a {{religious}} leader, the self-proclaimed Mahdi, declared a jihad against the Egyptian government, which had been subject to British domination since {{the construction of the}} Suez Canal around a decade earlier. Leveraging widespread resentment towards European influence in Egypt and preaching renewal of the Islamic faith, the Mahdi began to accumulate followers and soon presented a serious threat to the government. Early Egyptian-led efforts to suppress the movement failed spectacularly, and their humiliating defeat {{at the hands of the}} outnumbered, outgunned, and undersupplied Mahdist force <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> their leader's fame and reputation.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{met with}} some initial success {{in his new}} role, {{learning}} Samoan and implementing a number of reforms. He focussed on transforming the country's economy into one based upon agriculture with a long term view of Samoan self-governance, and also implemented welfare and educational programs. His results were such that his term of three years in Western Samoa was extended by a further two years. He was also knighted, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the June 1925 Birthday Honours. However, {{over the next two}} years he had to deal with the increasing influence of the Mau movement, a nationalist group agitating for independence via peaceful means. While his administrative experience was helpful for carrying the reforms he had initiated, he lacked the political and diplomatic skills to deal with the Mau. He took a heavy handed approach to asserting his authority and deported several leaders of the Mau. This did not have the desired effect and dissent amongst the general population towards the New Zealand administration <b>only</b> <b>increased.</b> Richardson was forced to call in marines from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy to deal with the civil unrest. Shortly afterwards, on 31 March 1928, he retired. Later in the year he was the New Zealand representative to the League of Nations meeting which discussed the administration of Western Samoa.|$|E

5|$|With every {{subsequent}} improvement made to {{the ground}} since the Second World War, the capacity steadily declined. By the 1980s, the capacity had dropped from the original 80,000 to approximately 60,000. The capacity dropped still further in 1990, when the Taylor Report recommended, and the government demanded that all First and Second Division stadia be converted to all-seaters. This meant that £3–5million plans to replace the Stretford End with a brand new stand with an all-standing terrace at the front and a cantilever roof to link {{with the rest of}} the ground had to be drastically altered. This forced redevelopment, including the removal of the terraces at the front of the other three stands, not <b>only</b> <b>increased</b> the cost to around £10million, but also reduced the capacity of Old Trafford to an all-time low of around 44,000. In addition, the club was told in 1992 that they would only receive £1.4million of a possible £2million from the Football Trust to be put towards work related to the Taylor Report.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September {{the family}} moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace, Brighton on the south coast of England where tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with the revolutionary Europe left behind. Parliamentary figures, {{particularly}} Disraeli, travelled down to visit them, as did Metternich's former friend Dorothea Lieven (Melanie led a reconciliation between the two). Expecting a visit from Metternich's daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline, {{the family moved}} to a suite of rooms at Richmond Palace on 23 April 1849. Visitors included Wellington, who still watched out for Metternich; Johann Strauss, the composer; and Dorothea de Dino, sister of Metternich's former lover Wilhemine of Sagan; and former lover Katharina Bagration. Metternich was showing his age, and his frequent fainting was cause for worry. The ex-Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor Franz Joseph I and his government. Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact, and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph; sincere or not, it buoyed Metternich considerably. From mid-August Melanie began to push for a move to Brussels, a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs. They arrived in October, staying overnight in the Hotel Bellevue. With revolution subsiding, Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna. Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited for an opportunity to re-enter Austrian politics. It was a pleasant enough (and cheap) stay, first in the Boulevard de l'Observatoire and later in the Sablon area—filled with visits from politicians, writers, musicians and scientists. For Metternich, however, the tedium and homesickness <b>only</b> <b>increased.</b> In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna, Prince Schwarzenberg, to ask if he might return if he promised not to interfere in public affairs. In April he received an affirmative reply, authorised by Franz Joseph.|$|E
