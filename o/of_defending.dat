5|$|France had {{threatened}} to invade the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. In 1808, the Spanish Crown sent their Navy, {{under the command of}} Puerto Rican Captain Ramón Power y Giralt, to prevent the invasion of Santo Domingo by the French by enforcing a blockade. Col. Rafael Conti organized a military expedition with the intention <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> the Dominican Republic. They were successful and were proclaimed as heroes by the Spanish Government.|$|E

This is the last mention of Melissenos in Anna Komnene's Alexiad. He died on 17 November 1104.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflicts}} with Pyrrhus {{would have a}} great effect on Rome. Rome had shown it was capable of pitting its armies successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and that the Greek kingdoms were incapable <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> their colonies in Italy and abroad. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing the Greek colonies. Now, Rome effectively dominated the Italian peninsula, and won an international military reputation.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} argued that defended prey {{have tended to}} evolve {{conspicuous}} traits because predators more readily learn to avoid defended prey when they are conspicuous. However, a rival theory proposes that defended prey have evolved such characters because {{it allows them to}} be distinguished from undefended prey. Here we investigated how the attributes <b>of</b> <b>defended</b> (unprofitable) and undefended (profitable) computer-generated prey species tended to evolve when they were subject to selection by foraging humans. When cryptic forms <b>of</b> <b>defended</b> and undefended species were similar in appearance but their conspicuous forms were not, defended prey became conspicuous while undefended prey remained cryptic. Indeed, in all <b>of</b> our experiments, <b>defended</b> prey invariably evolved any trait that enabled them to be distinguished from undefended prey, even if such traits were cryptic. When conspicuous mutants <b>of</b> <b>defended</b> prey were extremely rare, they frequently overcame their initial disadvantage by chance. When Batesian mimicry <b>of</b> <b>defended</b> species was possible, defended prey evolved unique traits or characteristics that would make undefended prey vulnerable. Overall, our work supports the contention that warning signals are selected for their reliability as indicators of defense rather than to capitalize on any inherent educational biases of predators...|$|R

5|$|Weiquan lawyers {{tend to be}} {{especially}} critical {{of the lack of}} judicial independence in China.

5|$|According to this view, {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, had no real loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes were their own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led {{to a decline in}} traditional military discipline, and internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> the empire effectively.|$|E

In the meantime, the 85th Battalion had completed reorganizing at Inshas Base and returned to Ismailia, where it was placed under Azmy's command once again. The 129th Sa'iqa Group retreated to Abu Suweir, north of Ismailia, to reorganize, and Heikal was also informed of his group's new area of operations, with the objective <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> the Upper Bridge, and the crucial Cairo-Ismailia Desert Road that incorporated the bridge.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament in 1642, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the town invested money in Kingswear's castle doors. The following year, Prince Maurice besieged and took the town. An earthwork fort, called Mount Ridley or Kingsworth, may subsequently have been built to protect the vulnerable position behind Kingswear Castle; an alternative supposition is that the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth, capturing Kingswear from Sir Henry Cary, the High Sheriff of Devon, who had been left in charge <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> it.|$|E

Gruenwald was a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who had moved to Israel after the war. In a self-published pamphlet in 1952 he accused Kasztner, by then an Israeli civil servant, of having collaborated with the Nazis by dealing with Eichmann. Brand testified for Kasztner, but instead <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> him {{took the opportunity to}} accuse the Jewish Agency, whose officials became the first Israeli government, of having helped the British scupper the blood-for-goods proposal.|$|E

5|$|Following this, the 17th Brigade {{advanced}} towards Guadagasal, {{but after}} supply problems ground {{this to a}} halt, throughout March and April a series of patrols were sent out towards Mubo. By late April the brigade was detached to the 3rd Division, a primarily Militia formation, which took up the task <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> Wau. Throughout this time, engineers from the 6th Division, including the 2/1st Field Company, would to improve supply lines throughout the area, cutting a road to Wau. The 2/2nd Field Ambulance also provided support to the brigade's operations, establishing medical services close to the Australian forward areas.|$|E
5|$|Italian armies easily outnumbered {{those of}} the British, who were {{defending}} multiple areas in North Africa with skeleton forces. With Cyrenaica and the Sudan under threat as well as Somaliland, only token units were available to control what was considered a relatively unimportant possession. In fact, until December 1939 British policy had been to abandon Somaliland altogether {{in the face of}} invasion. However, General Archibald Wavell, the newly appointed commander of British armies in Africa, successfully recommended to the British Chiefs of Staff that Somaliland be defended. A multiracial congregation of five battalions, the minimum force that was adjudged capable <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> the region, was assembled by the beginning of August.|$|E

5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is {{a visual}} novel {{adventure}} {{game in which}} the player takes the role of Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney, and attempts to defend their clients in five cases.

Each case starts with an opening cinematic showing a murder; shortly thereafter, the player is given the job <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> the prime suspect of the case.

However, the East Timorese government places a high priority on re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> the country. In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little progress has been made in implementing the Force 2020 plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{acquisition}} of the Hunter had solved part of the Swiss dilemma of needing to support both its ground forces and to deploy an air-to-air capability, but while the Hunter could provide some counter-air defense over a battlefield and escort ground-support fighters it was not supersonic nor was it capable <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> Swiss airspace. In 1961, the Swiss Parliament voted to procure 100French Dassault Mirage IIICs for this purpose and 67BL-64 Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles from the British.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission of}} the Swiss Air Force {{historically}} has been to support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory, with a secondary mission <b>of</b> <b>defending</b> the sovereignty of Swiss airspace. During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland was literally {{caught in the middle}} of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E

Brougham having declined, Bellingham was represented by Alley, assisted by Henry Revell Reynolds.
