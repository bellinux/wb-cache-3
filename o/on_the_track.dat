50|$|Suicides on tracks {{may take}} place through the person either jumping onto, walking, lying or sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> Lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> {{may result in}} decapitation.

Accidents including people walking, lying or sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> usually occur at night when the driver's visibility is reduced, reducing {{the chance of a}} failed suicide. People who commit suicide in this manner usually stay at or around the place for the suicide {{for an extended period of}} time before the actual suicide.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> songs <b>on</b> Dylan's 1975 album Blood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tracks</b> {{have been}} {{described}} by several of Dylan's biographers and critics as arising from the tension as his marriage to Sara collapsed. The album was recorded soon after the couple's initial separation. Dylan biographers Robert Shelton and Clinton Heylin have cautioned against interpreting the album as naked autobiography, arguing that Blood <b>On</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tracks</b> works <b>on</b> many levels—musical, spiritual, poetic—as well as a personal confession. [...] Dylan himself denied {{at the time of}} the album's release that Blood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tracks</b> was autobiographical, but Jakob Dylan has said, [...] "When I'm listening to 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' I'm grooving along just like you. But when I'm listening to Blood <b>On</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tracks,</b> that's about my parents." ...|$|R

Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007, but Mills felt that Bolt's technique was much improved, pinpointing improvements in Bolt's balance at the turns over 200 m and an increase in his stride frequency, giving him more driving power <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

A crowd of 30,000 people showed up to see him as he was hand-walked for about 45 minutes in front of the grandstand and in the paddock. Zayat, Baffert and Espinoza were also given their permanent keepsake Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown trophies in a ceremony that evening. American Pharoah's popularity was so high that his win made the cover of Sports Illustrated, he was photographed for Vogue, and during the NBA Playoffs, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, Steve Kerr, suggested that American Pharoah was the only athlete better than LeBron James.|$|E

5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E

5|$|Kumba {{features}} four {{steel and}} fiberglass trains, each containing eight cars. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train. The block sections only allow for three trains to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> at any one time, meaning the ride can still operate at full capacity when one train is receiving maintenance. Under three train operation, the ride caters for 1,700 riders per hour.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} {{is about a}} {{relationship}} just out of his reach and the turmoil that ensues. The track also explores feelings of regret and heartbreak. The song received highly positive reviews from music critics, who praised the atmospheric production, Ocean's falsetto and writing ability. Some critics noted the possible bisexual undertones featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most drivers stayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> {{during the}} caution, {{allowing}} Bowyer {{to remain the}} leader on the restart.

Landon Cassill went to the garage due to failing brakes on lap 56. Johnson moved into sixth, as Edwards passed McMurray five laps later for second. By lap 64, Bowyer's lead was over 3.5 seconds.|$|E

5|$|On May 8, 2013, Universal Orlando {{announced}} {{the expansion of}} Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Diagon Alley, along with the Hogwarts Express attraction, to be located on the former site of the Jaws attraction. By the end of August 2013, all six passenger cars and both tenders had been spotted in the backstage area, waiting to be assembled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> The first of the two trains was installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> on October 24, 2013. By the beginning of December 2013, the second train had been placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> In January, the resort previewed {{the interior of the}} Hogwarts Express through a live cast. On December 2, 2013, Orlando Attractions Magazine, an amusement park website, spotted one of the trains being tested for the first time. In mid-March 2014, Universal Orlando Resort released further information about the ride, including concept animations. On June 24, 2014, the resort announced that the Diagon Alley expansion, including the Hogwarts Express, would officially open to the public on July 8, 2014. A week later, Universal Orlando soft-opened the Hogwarts Express, without any announcement. Within a month of the Hogwarts Express' opening, one million riders had ridden the attraction. It had taken approximately {{two and a half years}} to develop.|$|E

5|$|The race {{started at}} 4:48p.m.; Kyle Busch {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{heading into the}} first corner and led the field on the first lap. Carpentier went up the track on the same lap but avoided hitting the barriers, while Reutimann did the same and scraped the outside wall, causing right-rear damage to his car. He was black-flagged by NASCAR because debris was dangling from his vehicle. Reutimann's right-rear tire exploded while entering the pit road on lap five but no debris was left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> On lap eight, Bowyer hit the wall, causing Kahne to drive down the track. He also made contact with Jamie McMurray, who slid through the infield frontstretch grass, causing the first caution flag {{and the appearance of}} the pace car. During the caution, most drivers elected to make pit stops for tires, and eighteen drivers remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} pods {{introduced}} to IndyCar in 2012 {{intended to prevent}} cars from becoming airborne when hitting another in the rear proved to be ineffective as there were major crashes resulting from such contact during the 2013 race in Houston involving Dario Franchitti and the 2017 Indianapolis 500 involving Scott Dixon. In addition the pods were often ripped from cars from light contact, placing hazardous debris <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> As a result the rear pods were eliminated for 2018.|$|E
