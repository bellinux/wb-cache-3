25|$|As he {{continued}} his academic career abroad in Chile and France after the tightening of Brazilian military dictatorship, Cardoso published several books and papers on state bureaucracy, industrial elites and, particularly, dependency theory. His work <b>on</b> <b>dependency</b> would be his most acclaimed contribution to sociology and development studies, especially in the United States. After presiding the International Sociological Association from 1982 to 1986 Cardoso was selected as a Fulbright Program 40th anniversary distinguished fellow and in that capacity was a visiting scholar and lectured at Columbia University on democracy in Brazil. Cardoso currently gives speeches and classes abroad. In June 2013 he was elected {{as a member of}} Academia Brasileira de Letras. He said his election was due to recognition for his academic achievements, rather than his political career.|$|E

It is also used regularly in research <b>on</b> <b>dependency,</b> and, less often, in studies on hostility and anxiety. [...] Furthermore, substantial evidence justifies the use of the Rorschach as a clinical measure of intelligence and thought disorder." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1536, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Castillo de San Lázaro, a massive fortress {{with a series of}} masonry walls up to 20 meters thick, the most formidable defensive complex of Spanish military architecture to this day. The port was growing in economic importance and strategic value, thanks to the Bay of Cartagena being protected by the Spanish military, as well as its proximity to Panama City, another important Spanish port. In 1538, the Crown authorized the encomienda in the colony; this was a social system that extracted forced labor and tribute from the Indians, whom it deemed [...] "free vassals".

2500|$|Modern {{dependency}} grammars, however, begin {{primarily with}} the work of Lucien Tesnière. Tesnière was a Frenchman, a polyglot, and a professor of linguistics at the universities in Strasbourg and Montpellier. His major work Éléments de syntaxe structurale was published posthumously in 1959 – he died in 1954. The basic approach to syntax he developed seems to have been seized upon independently by others in the 1960s {{and a number of other}} dependency-based grammars have gained prominence since those early works. DG has generated a lot of interest in Germany in both theoretical syntax and language pedagogy. In recent years, the great development surrounding dependency-based theories has come from computational linguistics and is due, in part, to the influential work that David Hays did in machine translation at the RAND Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency-based systems are increasingly being used to parse natural language and generate tree banks. Interest in dependency grammar is growing at present, international conferences <b>on</b> <b>dependency</b> linguistics being a relatively recent development ( [...] , , [...] ).|$|E

40|$|Most of our {{critical}} infrastructures {{consist of}} complex systems-of-systems that provide services or products. The coupling mechanism between the chained systems in such complex systems of systems is dependencies. Dependencies may propagate cascading failures. Most studies <b>on</b> <b>dependencies</b> in infrastructures {{are based on}} either an economic model or on a graph model. These regard dependencies mostly as an available or unavailable commodity. In this paper we describe a model view <b>on</b> <b>dependencies</b> showing why dependencies in reality are far more complex {{than some of the}} models suggest. At the same time, we will present on-going work on how often serious cascading effects between various critical infrastructures occur based upon an empirical analysis of collected data...|$|R
