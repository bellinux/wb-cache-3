5|$|Towards the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> the {{functions}} {{and composition of}} households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder {{to the field of}} warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. The result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E
5|$|Bigger {{guns were}} developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury became an {{alternative}} to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective siege engine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms. This {{was part of}} a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.|$|E
5|$|In the High Middle Ages {{there were}} {{new sources of}} education, such as song and grammar schools.

Early examples including the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{languages}} {{existed in the}} multi-ethnic Empire, {{and some of these}} were given limited official status in their provinces at various times. Notably, by the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> Syriac had become more widely used by the educated classes in the far eastern provinces. Similarly Coptic, Armenian, and Georgian became significant among the educated in their provinces, and later foreign contacts made Old Church Slavic, Middle Persian, and Arabic important in the Empire and its sphere of influence.|$|E

All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry, according to the four bodily humours theory proposed by Galen that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity until the 17th century.|$|E
