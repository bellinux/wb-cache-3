40|$|Abstract. Currently, the SCC {{is already}} used in several {{countries}} and is considered a breakthrough in the building process <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> structures, as it increases productivity, reduces the demand for labor, work in time <b>of</b> <b>concreting</b> <b>and</b> improves the quality <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> the environment work. Innumerous investigations on SCC [2],[3],[4],[5] have been developing in order to know their behavior, improve their properties and applicability in different structural elements.

5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler ordered the {{construction}} of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but due to shortages, particularly <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> manpower, most of the strongpoints were never built. As the expected site of an Allied invasion, Pas de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo.|$|E
5|$|The French Army {{authorised}} fresh {{attempts to}} increase {{the strength of the}} fortifications in the autumn of 1939, but severe winter weather prevented the pouring <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> the delivery of the necessary materials.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the seismic {{performance}} <b>of</b> hollow reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> bridge columns, <b>and</b> to provide data for developing improved seismic design criteria. By using a sophisticated nonlinear finite element analysis program, the accuracy and objectivity of the assessment process can be enhanced. A computer program, RCAHEST (Reinforced Concrete Analysis in Higher Evaluation System Technology), is used to analyze reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> structures. Tensile, compressive and shear models <b>of</b> cracked <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> models <b>of</b> reinforcing and prestressing steel were used to account for the material nonlinearity <b>of</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete.</b> The smeared crack approach was incorporated. The proposed numerical method for the seismic performance assessment <b>of</b> hollow reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> bridge columns is verified by comparing it with the reliable experimental results. Additionally, the studies and discussions presented in this investigation provide an insight into the key behavioral aspects <b>of</b> hollow reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> bridge columns.|$|R

In the Normandy area, the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo. Rommel was assigned to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg, and was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Reserves for this group included the 2nd, 21st, and 116th Panzer divisions.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2008, {{construction}} crews {{made the}} last major concrete pour to top off the Trump tower's concrete core, which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow tower crane raised a bucket full <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper. Another ceremony occurred on August 19, when construction supervisors, structural engineers and company representatives from McHugh Construction made a minor concrete pour {{at the top of}} the Trump tower. Though Donald Trump was absent from both of these ceremonies, he, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump attended the topping off party on September 24, 2008. Original plans called for the windows to be completed and the spire erected in October 2008. However, the spire installation was delayed through high winds in December 2008, and was finally completed on January 3, 2009. Kamin's critical opinion is that the spire is not aesthetically complementary.|$|E

5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated by the use <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> brick. By varying {{the weight of the}} aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Point Light was {{designed}} by Alfred Hopkins and Associates to be a 41-foot (12m) octagonal tower. Construction of the tower was completed in March 1943; it is built of brown concrete blocks and topped with an octagonal wooden lantern. During the restoration effort, {{it was discovered that}} six different types of concrete blocks were used in the construction. The tower has a total of five windows, with two facing south and one for the north, east and west. The lantern gallery deck is constructed <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> lined with thirty two Italian marble balusters, originally imported from Italy around 1900. The interior has an iron ladder, originally wooden, that leads up to the watchroom level. The lighthouse design and masonry tower have Colonial Revival elements. It is the last lighthouse built in the state of Connecticut as an official navigational aid.|$|E
5|$|The US$1 million ($ million today) {{project was}} {{initiated}} by Pittsburgh Pirates' owner Barney Dreyfuss, {{with the goal}} of replacing his franchise's then-current home, Exposition Park. The stadium was made <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> steel (one of the first of its kind) in order to increase its lifespan. The Pirates opened Forbes Field on June 30, 1909, against the Chicago Cubs, and would play the final game that was also against the Cubs on June 28, 1970. The field itself featured a large playing surface, with the batting cage placed in the deepest part of center field during games. Seating was altered multiple times throughout the stadium's life; at times fans were permitted to sit on the grass in the outfield during overflow crowds. The Pirates won three World Series while at Forbes Field and the other original tenant, the Pittsburgh Panthers football team had five undefeated seasons before moving in 1924.|$|E

5|$|The station's {{architecture}} is an austere combination <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> stainless steel, with stacked banks of escalators supported from the cross-bracing structures spanning the station box and routes for passengers entering or leaving the station separated from those changing between lines. As {{with the other}} underground stations on the extension, the Jubilee line platforms feature platform screen doors to improve airflow through the system and increase safety. The station design won a number of awards including Civic Trust awards in 2000 and 2002, the Royal Fine Art Commission Millennium Building of the Year award in 2000 and the RIBA Award for Architecture in 2001. Both projects were jointly short-listed in 2001 for the RIBA's prestigious Stirling Prize.|$|E
5|$|Homer is {{relaxing}} on a Saturday when Marge {{tells him}} {{that he should be}} doing work around the house and yard. Homer overcomes his reluctance and takes Bart to Mom & Pop Hardware to get some equipment. But while there, Homer sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. Homer tries to install the pit, but bungles the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement. He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens, but only makes things worse. In the end, Homer is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement, which angers him. He vents his rage on the construct, mangling it further. Later, Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund, which he does not receive. On the way home, Homer loses control of the wagon containing the jumbled mess <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> bricks. It rolls down the highway and crashes into a woman's car, wrecking it. Homer flees the scene of the accident, but the woman tracks him down. It turns out that she is an artist named Astrid Weller (voiced by Isabella Rossellini), and sees Homer's handiwork as being a masterpiece of outsider art. Homer's exhibit goes to the Louvre: American Style museum and when Mr. Burns buys his work, Homer becomes a success.|$|E
