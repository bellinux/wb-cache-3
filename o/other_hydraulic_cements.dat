Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with <b>other</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements,</b> such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.|$|E

The FaL-G masonry hollow blocks were prepared without the use of conventional cement. Quarry dust and sand were used as fine aggregates as sustainable materials. The properties of FaL-G masonry hollow blocks were determined for different parameters. The experimental results reveal that the FaL-G hollow blocks are suitable to be used for the construction of masonry structures...|$|R

The rediscovery of Roman architectural practices as described by Vitruvius in De architectura, also led to the reintroduction of lime-pozzolan binders.

In order to achieve this objective it became evident to NASA that a Lunar Outpost will be needed to house scientists and astronauts who will be living on the moon for extended periods of time. A study has been undertaken by the authors and supported by NASA to study the feasibility of using lunar regolith with different binders such as molten sulfur, epoxy or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> as a construction material for different lunar structures. The basic premise of this study is that it will be more logical and cost effective to manufacture lunar construction materials utilizing indigenous resources rather than transporting needed materials from earth. Lunar concrete (made from <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Cement</b> and lunar soil) has been studied and suggested as the construction material of choice for some of the lunar projects. Unfortunately, its hydration requires water which is going to be a precious commodity on the moon. Therefore this study explores the feasibility of using binders <b>other</b> than <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> such as sulfur or epoxy with lunar regolith as a construction material. This report describes findings of this study which deals specifically with using molten sulfur as a binder for Lunar concrete. It describes laboratory experiments in which the sulfur to lunar soil simulant ratios by weight were varied to study the minimum amount of sulfur required to produce a particular strength. The compressive and tensile strengths of these mixes were evaluated. Metal and fiber glass fibers were added to some of the mixes to study their effects on the compressive and tensile strengths. This report also describes experiments where the sulfur is melted and mixed with the lunar regolith in a specially designed vacuum chamber. The properties of the produced concrete were compared to those of concrete produced under normal pressure...|$|R

The mixtures of the samples were fabricated and allowed them seven, fourteen and twenty eight days for curing before tested by compressive strength, three points flexural test, and indirect tensile strength to probe into their engineering properties. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> mortar samples used as control are analyzed for comparison.

Thus, the water absorption of fine aggregate must be concerned. The emulsion asphalt added too much may reduce the strength.

40|$|Currently, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> grouts are {{approved}} for Iowa Department of Transportation projects {{on the basis}} of a pullout test. However, other properties of the grouts should be evaluated. Therefore, this research was initiated to develop criteria to better evaluate <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> grouts. Fourteen grouts were tested for compressive strength, time of set, durability, consistency and shrinkage. Tested grouts all yielded compressive strengths higher than 3000 psi at 7 days and durability factors were well above 70. Time of set and consistency was adequate. The testing showed most grouts tested shrank, even though tested grouts were labeled non-shrink grouts. For many applications of grouts such as setting in anchor bolts and as a filler, minor shrinkage is not a problem. However, for some critical applications, shrinkage cannot be tolerated. The proposed Instructional Memorandum will identify those grouts which do not excessively shrink or expand in the tests used. Based on test results, criteria for evaluation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> grouts have been recommended.

40|$|Portland cement {{is a fine}} powder, gray {{or white}} in color, that {{consists}} of a mixture of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> materials comprising primarily calcium silicates, aluminates and aluminoferrites.
