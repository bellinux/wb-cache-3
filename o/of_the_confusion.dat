5|$|Elphinstone rapidly took {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> Harriers attack had created, passing Aalbers' bow and raking his ship. Elphinstone then threw his sails back, halting his ship and allowing Greyhound {{to maintain a}} position across Pallas bow from which he could inflict severe damage on the Dutch frigate without coming under fire himself. As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas, Harrier joined the attack. Gunfire from the Dutch ship gradually slackened, and finally stopped at 06:10, the Dutch flag was struck from the mast and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 (including 50 local recruits). Throughout the engagement, Victoria and Batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on Harrier, Troubridge waiting until the Dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking.|$|E

The other, formed from the Immortals and the Chomatenoi under Alexios's own command, was not arrayed in one continuous line, but broken up in small groups, intermingled with other groups of Turkish horse-archers. This command would advance on the rebels, attack them, then feign retreat and draw them into the ambush.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to take {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> expected {{after the death of}} the Polish king, Tsar Michael of Russia ordered an attack on the Commonwealth. A Muscovite army crossed the Commonwealth eastern frontier in October 1632 and laid siege to Smolensk (which was ceded to Poland by Russia in 1618, {{at the end of the}} Dymitriad wars). In the war against Russia in 1632–1634 (the Smolensk War), Władysław succeeded in breaking the siege in September 1633 and then in turn surrounded the Russian army under Mikhail Shein, which was then forced to surrender on 1 March 1634.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 September 1964, {{with general}} release in the United Kingdom the {{following}} day. Leicester Square {{was packed with}} sightseers and fans and police were unable to control the crowd due {{to the number of}} people. A set of glass doors to the cinema was accidentally broken and the premiere was shown ten minutes late because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confusion.</b> The United States premiere occurred on 21 December 1964, at the DeMille Theatre in New York. The film opened in 64 cinemas across 41 cities and eventually peaked at 485 screens. Goldfinger was temporarily banned in Israel because of Gert Fröbe's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during World War II.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{distinction}} between normative and positive theoretical statements in a game theoretic context from a Bayesian perspective.

She {{was born into a}} powerful ruling class of Normans, who traditionally owned extensive estates in both England and Normandy, and her first husband had been the Holy Roman Emperor Henry V. Following her father's death in 1135, Matilda hoped to claim the English throne, but instead her cousin Stephen of Blois was crowned king and recognised as the Duke of Normandy, resulting in civil war between their rival supporters. Geoffrey took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> to attack the Duchy of Normandy but played no direct role in the English conflict, leaving this to Matilda and her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester. The war, termed the Anarchy by Victorian historians, dragged on and degenerated into stalemate.|$|E
5|$|In February 1836 Edwards landed 170 {{black people}} in Texas, taking {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> surrounding {{the end of the}} Texas Revolution and the establishment of the independent Republic of Texas, which had not yet outlawed the importation of slaves. William Fisher, the customs collector on the Brazos River, wrote to the Texas Constitutional Convention that Edwards did not report the importation to the authorities, and Fisher went to Edwards' plantation to confront Edwards. Because of uncertainty about the legality of importing slaves, Fisher did not seize the slaves but referred the issue to the newly formed Texas Government after securing a monetary bond from Edwards. Although the new Texas Republic eventually outlawed the importation of slaves from anywhere but the United States, Edwards' landing of slaves from Cuba in early 1836 was never prosecuted. After this, Edwards also established a slave market on Galveston Bay, near present-day San Leon. In 1837, he was sued by Robert Peebles for fraud involving the sale of a slave with tuberculosis to Peebles. Peebles won the case.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the coalition army {{when most of}} it had crossed the Kalka River. The Mongols appear to have caught the coalition forces by surprise in a fast transition from horse archer fire to massed cavalry charges, because the coalition rout began incredibly quickly: the Rus forces {{bringing up the rear}} had not yet arrived on the battle by the time the front ranks were dissolving. The armies of Volhynia and Kursk made a gap in their line so that the fleeing Cumans could retreat. However, the Mongol heavy cavalry charged through the newly formed gap and also enveloped them. The army of Chernigov, which was not aware that the battle had started, was advancing when they collided head-on with the retreating Cumans. Using smoke bombs to disrupt the coalition's ability to coordinate, the Mongol cavalry took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> in the Chernigov line and attacked, causing the line to collapse. This, in turn, led to the death of Prince Mstislav of Chernigov.|$|E

When Hanna arrives on the scene unexpectedly with the police, McLaren and his crew engage them in a mid-street shootout, in which most of McLaren's crew are killed. After making an unlikely escape, McLaren is presented with an opportunity to leave Los Angeles for a new life with Eady, but he decides to first take revenge for Waingro's betrayal. However, after McLaren tracks down Waingro to a hotel room, he is ambushed by Hanna and his team. Waingro takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> to shoot McLaren through a closed door. While Hanna advises Waingro of his options in jail, for a string of previous murders, Waingro resists arrest and tries to pull a gun. In self-defence, Hanna forces Waingro through a hotel window, and Waingro falls fifteen floors to his death. In the final sequences, Hanna is reunited with his wife.|$|E

The resulting news bulletin slipped past Japanese censors and was broadcast throughout Dōmei's newswire network.

5|$|Multiple {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} regarding the ancestry {{of the founders of}} the Western Ganga dynasty (prior to the 4th century). Some mythical accounts point to a northern origin, while theories based on epigraphy suggest a southern origin. Historians who propose the southern origin have further debated whether the early petty chieftains of the clan (prior to their rise to power) were natives of the southern districts of modern Karnataka, the Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu or of the southern districts of modern Andhra Pradesh. These regions encompass an area of the southern Deccan where the three modern states merge geographically. It is theorised that the Gangas may have taken advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> caused by the invasion of southern India by the northern king Samudra Gupta prior to 350, and carved out a kingdom for themselves. The area they controlled was called Gangavadi and included regions of the modern districts of Mysore, Hassan Chamarajanagar, Tumkur, Kolar, Mandya and Bangalore in Karnataka state. At times, they also controlled some areas in modern Tamil Nadu (Kongu region starting from the 6th century rule of King Avinita) and Andhra Pradesh (Ananthpur region starting from the middle of the 5th century). The founding king of the dynasty was Konganivarma Madhava who made Kolar his capital around 350 and ruled for about twenty years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Determination of a patient's {{cognitive}} {{status by}} use of a valid and reliable screening instrument is of major importance as early recognition and accurate diagnosis of delirium is necessary for effective management. This study determined the reliability, validity and diagnostic value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Flemish translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NEECHAM <b>Confusion</b> Scale. Methods A sample of 54 elderly hip fracture patients {{with a mean age}} of 80. 9 years (SD = 7. 85) were included. To test <b>the</b> psychometric properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NEECHAM <b>Confusion</b> Scale, performance on the NEECHAM was compared to <b>the</b> <b>Confusion</b> Assessment Method (CAM) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), by using aggregated data based on 5 data collection measurement points (repeated measures). The CAM and MMSE served as gold standards. Results The alpha coefficient for the total NEECHAM score was high (0. 88). Principal components analysis yielded a two-component solution accounting for 70. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total variance. High correlations were found between the total NEECHAM scores and total MMSE (0. 75) and total CAM severity scores (- 0. 73), respectively. Diagnostic values using the CAM algorithm as gold standard showed 76. 9 % sensitivity, 64. 6 % specificity, 13. 5 % positive and 97. 5 % negative predictive values, respectively. Conclusion This validation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Flemish version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NEECHAM <b>Confusion</b> Scale adds to previous evidence suggesting that this scale holds promise as a valuable screening instrument for delirium in clinical practice.
