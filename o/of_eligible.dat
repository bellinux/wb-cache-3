5|$|The National Register of Electors is a continuously-updated {{permanent}} database <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> electors {{for federal}} elections in Canada maintained by Elections Canada. It {{was established in}} December 1996 when Bill C-63 was granted royal assent by the Governor General of Canada, and the preliminary National Register of Electors was populated with data in April 1997 during the final Canada-wide enumeration. It replaced a system which required door-to-door enumeration <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> electors for each electoral event. The database contains basic information about electors: name, address, sex, and date of birth. An elector may register or update their personal information between elections, or may request to be excluded from it per the Canada Elections Act.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for a {{politically}} active citizenry, and populism has been a longstanding force among the state's political parties.

With a turnout of 55% <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> members, 25,692 PC members voted yes and 1,344 voted no with 24 spoiled ballots; the party's constitution required a simple majority of its membership to approve the merger.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 2008, after a 5-week-long campaign, the Conservatives {{increased}} their seat count in parliament to 143, up from 127 at {{the dissolution of}} the previous parliament; however, the actual popular vote among Canadians dropped slightly by 167,494 votes. As a result of the lowest voter turnout in Canadian electoral history, this represented only 22% <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> Canadian voters, the lowest level of support of any winning party in Canadian history. Meanwhile, the number of opposition Liberal MPs fell from 95 to 77 seats. 155 MPs are required to form a majority government in Canada's 308-seat parliament, relegating Harper to minority government once again.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E

5|$|Due to Bowl Alliance (predecessor to the Bowl Championship Series) rules, the Orange Bowl {{following}} the 1996 season was played on December 31, instead of January 1 or later. This {{marked the first}} time that an Orange Bowl was played prior to New Year's Day: there were two Orange Bowls in the same calendar year—one in January, {{following the}} 1995 season, and the other in December, following the 1996 season. The Orange Bowl Committee, which had the fourth and sixth selections <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> Bowl Alliance teams, selected Big East champions Virginia Tech and Nebraska, an at-large selection that appeared to be a national championship game contender before its loss to Texas in the inaugural Big 12 Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|For the 2008 season, the ACC possessed nine tie-in games. The Orange Bowl was the conference's BCS {{game and}} granted an {{automatic}} bid {{to the winner}} of the ACC Championship Game.

The Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tennessee; the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina; and the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco, California submitted their preferences together, and selected in that order if an agreement between them could not be reached. A special clause also guaranteed that, with a minimum of eight wins, the loser of the championship game would be selected no lower than by the Music City Bowl. The Humanitarian Bowl had the eighth-overall choice followed by the inaugural EagleBank Bowl in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 4 August 1914, {{and as part of}} the British Empire, Southern Rhodesia was also now at war. The British South Africa Company (which then administered the territory) took no steps to aid recruiting for the forces, so many men paid their own fares to England to join up. A number <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> recruits could not afford to go, so Guest, together with Captain Alwyn Knowles of the Bedfordshire Regiment, who as a reserve officer was awaiting his call-up, organised a private fund to pay their passages. When the recruits arrived in England they were enlisted by Captain (later Colonel) John Banks Brady (who was in 1934 to be elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly as member for Bulawayo North) to form a Rhodesian platoon in the King's Royal Rifle Corps.|$|E

The electoral vote count was 234 for Harrison and 60 for Van Buren, with the popular vote closer at 1,275,390 for Harrison to 1,128,854 for Van Buren. Of the 60 Van Buren electors, 12 did not vote for Johnson, with 11 (all from South Carolina) choosing Littleton W. Tazewell for vice president, and one (from Virginia) favoring Governor James K.

5|$|In the 2005 college {{football}} season, the Atlantic Coast Conference had an automatic bid to the Gator Bowl.

This was the final year that the Gator Bowl had first pick <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> ACC teams, as contract renegotiations later resulted in the Gator Bowl slipping to the third selection, beginning with the 2006 {{college football}} season. Virginia Tech, losers of the 2005 ACC Championship Game, were chosen by the Gator Bowl Association to participate as the ACC's representative to the 2006 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the game, several players from each team announced their intentions {{to enter the}} 1998 NFL Draft.

North Carolina had seven players taken in the draft, three of whom were selected in the first round: Greg Ellis was taken with the eighth pick, Brian Simmons with the 17th pick, and Vonnie Holliday with the 19th pick. The four remaining selections were Omar Brown (103rd overall), Kivuusama Mays (110th), Robert Williams (128th), and Jonathan Linton (131st).

5|$|Originally {{called the}} Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female, the award was first {{presented}} to Donna Summer in 1980.

However, in 1988, 1992, 1994, and since 2005, this category was combined with the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and presented in a genderless category known as Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo. The solo category was later renamed to Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance beginning in 2005. This fusion has been criticized, especially when female performers are not nominated under the solo category. The Academy has cited a lack <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> recordings in the female rock category as the reason for the mergers.

5|$|The Fiesta Bowl {{hosted the}} {{national}} championship game for the 1995 season, and thus had {{the first and second}} pick <b>of</b> <b>eligible</b> Bowl Alliance teams.

The Sugar Bowl was assigned the December 31 date, marking the first time it had been held on that date instead of its traditional January 1 date since December 31, 1975. From December 31, 1972, to December 31, 1975, the game was held on New Year's Eve. Thus, there were two games held during the calendar year 1972 and none in calendar year 1976.
