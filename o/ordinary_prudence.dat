There {{is only one way}} and that is to recognise her complete equality of status with her fellows and to do so frankly, freely and unreservedly ... While one understands and sympathises with French fears, one cannot, but feel for Germany in the prison of inferiority in which she still remains sixteen years after the conclusion of the war. The continuance of the Versailles status is becoming an offence to the conscience of Europe and a danger to future peace ... Fair play, sportsmanship—indeed every standard of private and public life—calls for frank revision of the situation. Indeed <b>ordinary</b> <b>prudence</b> makes it imperative. Let us break these bonds and set the complexed-obsessed soul free in a decent human way and Europe will reap a rich reward in tranquility, security and returning prosperity.|$|E

However when Palmerston, {{alarmed by the}} blockade and the Trent affair, pressed for {{increasing the number of}} regular troops in Canada to 10,000, he met resistance. Sir George Cornwall Lewis, head of the War Office, questioned whether there was any real threat to Great Britain. He judged it [...] "incredible that any Government of <b>ordinary</b> <b>prudence</b> should at a moment of civil war gratuitously increase the number of its enemies, and, moreover, incur the hostility of so formidable a power as England." [...] In the debate in Parliament on June 21 there was general opposition to reinforcements, based on political, military, and economic arguments. [...] A long standing issue was the attempt by Parliament to shift more of the burden of Canadian defense to the local government. Colonial secretary Newcastle, felt that the requests by Williams were part of a pattern of the [...] "last few years" [...] in which he had [...] "been very fertile of demands and suggestions." [...] Newcastle was also concerned that there were no winter quarters available for additional troops and he feared desertions would be a serious problem.|$|E

"You {{have little}} to apprehend, my son, {{on the subject of}} your mother's character; if not perfect, she was wanting in no womanly virtue, and might, nay ought to have made any {{reasonable}} man happy. My offer was accepted, for I found her heart disengaged. Miss Warrender was not affluent, and, in addition to the other unjustifiable motives that influenced me, I thought there would be a satisfaction in believing that I had been chosen for myself, rather than for my wealth. Indeed, I had got to be distrustful and ungenerous, and then I disliked the confession of the weakness that had induced me to change my name. The simple, I might almost say, loose laws of this country, on the subject of marriage, removed all necessity for explanations, there being no bans nor license necessary, and the Christian name only being used in the ceremony. We were married, therefore, but I was not so unmindful of the rights of others, as to neglect to procure a certificate, under a promise of secrecy, in my own name. By going to the place where the ceremony was performed, you will also find the marriage of John Effingham and Mildred Warrender duly registered in the books of the church to which the officiating clergyman belonged. So far, I did what justice required, though, with a motiveless infatuation for which I can now hardly account, which cannot be accounted for, except by ascribing it to the inconsistent cruelty of passion, I concealed my real name from her with whom there should have been no concealment. I fancied, I tried to fancy I was no impostor, as I was of the family I represented myself to be, by the mother's side; and. I wished to believe that my peace would easily be made when I avowed myself to be the man I really was. I had found Miss Warrender and her sister living with a well-intentioned but weak aunt, and with no male relative to make those inquiries which would so naturally have suggested themselves to persons of <b>ordinary</b> worldly <b>prudence.</b> It is true, I had become known to them under favourable circumstances, and they had good reason to believe me an Assheton from some accidental evidence that I possessed, which unanswerably proved my affinity to that family, without, betraying my true name.

Thus it was with this philosopher, this man of the moment, the adventurer, the soldier of fortune; the world which he had meant to conquer, the fortune which he had vowed to win seemed to slip absolutely away from him.

Crown jewels are heirlooms in the same way, as representing not the possession of the sovereign, but the time-honoured dignity of the Crown. The Law, which, in general, concerns itself with our property or lives and our liberties, has in this matter bowed gracefully to the spirit of chivalry and has lent its aid to romance;--but it certainly did not do so to enable the discordant heirs of a rich man to settle a simple dirty question of money, which, with <b>ordinary</b> <b>prudence,</b> the rich man should himself have settled before he died." ...|$|E

6000|$|The hillock {{that rose}} out of the pond, {{in the form of}} a rocky little island, was one of those capricious {{formations}} that are often met with on the surface of the earth. It stood about thirty rods from the northern side of the area, very nearly central as to its eastern and western boundaries, and presented a slope inclining towards the south. Its greatest height was at its northern end, where it {{rose out of}} the rich alluvion of the soil, literally a rock of some forty feet in perpendicular height, having a summit of about an acre of level land, and falling off on its three sides; to the east and west precipitously; to the south quite gently and with regularity.

You remember, perhaps, what that pull is. I dare say you heard from Henrietta how we enjoyed our rustication at Siena. It is pleasant even {{to look back on}} it. We were obliged to look narrowly at the economies, more narrowly than usual; but the cheapness of the place suited the occasion, and the little villa, like a mere tent among the vines, charmed us, though the doors didn't shut, and though (on account of the smallness) Robert and I had to whisper all our talk whenever Wiedeman was asleep.

I had a longer battle to fight, on the matter of this vow, than any since my marriage, and had some scruples at last of taking advantage of the pure goodness which induced him to yield to my wishes; but I did, because I hate to seem ungracious and unkind to people; and human beings, besides, are better than their books, than their principles, and even than their everyday actions, sometimes. I am always crying out: 'Blessed be the inconsistency of men.' Then I thought it probable that, the first shock of the cold water being over, he would like the proposed new acquaintances very much--and so it turns out. She was very agreeable, and kind, and good-natured, and talked much about you, which was a charm of itself; and we mean to be quite friends, and to lend each other books, and to forget one another's offences, in print or otherwise. Also, she admits us on her private days; for she has public days (dreadful to relate!), and is in the full flood and flow of Florentine society. Do write to me, will you? or else I shall set you down as vexed with me. The state of politics here is dismal. Newspapers put down; Protestant places of worship shut up. It is so bad that it must soon be better. What are you both thinking of the 'Papal aggression'?[206] 'Are you frightened? Are you frenzied? For my part I can't get up much steam about it.

40|$|Tort law assesses {{negligence}} {{according to}} the conduct of a reasonable person of <b>ordinary</b> <b>prudence</b> who acts with due care {{for the safety of}} others. This standard assigns three traits to the person whose conduct sets the bar for measuring negligence: reasonableness, <b>ordinary</b> <b>prudence,</b> and due care for the safety of others. Yet contemporary tort scholars have almost exclusively examined only one of these attributes, reasonableness, and have wholly neglected to carefully examine the other elements key to the negligence standard: prudence and due care for the safety of others. It is mistaken to reduce negligence to reasonableness or to try to understand the sense of reasonableness contemplated by the negligence standard without reference to the virtues of prudence and benevolence. Taken together and analyzed in relation to one another, these three traits define a distinct evaluative perspective, according to which some actions expose oneself and others to inappropriate risk of physical harm, and others do not. In this Article, I only partially articulate this evaluative perspective, focusing on its dimensions defined by prudence and care and leaving to one side the dimension defined by reasonableness. I have restricted the exposition partly because of the limits of the article format, and partly to counterbalance the overattention to reasonableness that has characterized tort scholarship of the last fifty years...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{introduction}} to and commentary on the contributions to a 2 ̆ 2 Symposium on Negligence in the Courts: the Actual Practice. 2 ̆ 2 The contributors all conclude that the tests of negligence that are actually employed by the courts differ from the aggregate-risk-utility test that is generally assumed in the academic literature, including the Restatement of Torts. Patrick Kelley and Laurel Wendt 2 ̆ 7 s survey of all the standard jury instructions on negligence in the United States finds only one instruction, in Louisiana, that mentions a risk-utility or cost-benefit test of negligence, and that instruction merely suggests, as a discretionary option, the weighing of important societal (not purely private) benefits against the risk when applying the usual 2 ̆ 2 <b>ordinary</b> <b>prudence</b> 2 ̆ 2 standard. Stephen Gilles 2 ̆ 7 s investigation of British negligence cases demonstrates that British courts do not employ a literal cost-benefit balancing test, but rather typically employ a 2 ̆ 2 disproportionate cost 2 ̆ 2 test. I believe this test is better described as a 2 ̆ 2 prohibitive cost 2 ̆ 2 test, according to which the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s creation of a significant risk to others generally is reasonable only if the risk is significantly outweighed by the expected benefits to those being put at risk (either direct benefits to them as participants in the risky activity or indirect benefits that accrue to everyone in society) and {{has been reduced to}} the maximum extent possible without significantly impairing those expected benefits. Gilles also agrees that British courts apply different tests depending on the rights and relationships among the parties, and in particular depending on who is putting whom at risk for whose benefit - for example, depending on whether a person is putting herself at risk in order to benefit another, rather than vice versa, or whether the plaintiff is a trespasser on the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s land. Ron Allen and Ross Rosenberg 2 ̆ 7 s investigation of American negligence cases, which I supplement in my commentary with a discussion of some of my own previously unreported studies, discloses that American courts also rarely refer to the aggregate-risk-utility test and that, even in the two states (Louisiana and Illinois) in which the test is most often referenced, it is not actually applied by the courts. Indeed, Louisiana courts explicitly note that questions of reasonableness ultimately turn on considerations of justice and the rights and relationships among the parties. Anita Bernstein 2 ̆ 7 s contribution focuses on the perspective - objective or subjective - that is employed when analyzing persons 2 ̆ 7 alleged negligence. She notes that, contrary to the position taken in the draft Restatement Third, a distinction is often made between plaintiffs and defendants, with a more subjective perspective being applied to the former, especially when the person has a significant mental disability. In an extended commentary, I discuss the different perspectives applied to both defendants and plaintiffs in various types of situations, and I demonstrate that these differences cannot be explained by the usual administrative-convenience rationale, but rather are based, as with the substantive criteria of reasonableness, on the rights and relationships among the parties...|$|E
