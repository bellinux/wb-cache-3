5|$|Quisling tired {{during the}} final years of the war. In 1942 he passed 231 laws, 166 in 1943, and 139 in 1944. Social policy was the <b>one</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> still {{received}} significant attention. By that autumn, Quisling and Mussert in the Netherlands could be satisfied they had at least survived. In 1944, the weight problems Quisling had been having during the preceding two years also eased.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the orders}} of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, German forces had {{constructed}} {{a large number of}} static defensive positions and obstacles. Rommel had been appointed Inspector General of Coastal Defences and commander of Army Group B, in November 1943, by order of Adolf Hitler. On his arrival he had assessed the existing defences in the region and immediately began the process of improving them, particularly those situated inland as he believed no more than thirty percent of the German defences were adequate. These anti-airborne measures consisted of planting a large number of mines to create minefields, as well as the erection of so-called Rommel's asparagus; a system of wire-braced poles up to two metres in height, a great many of which were laced with mines or other booby-traps aimed at destroying gliders and killing or wounding airborne troops. Rommel noted in his diary, following an inspection of <b>one</b> <b>area,</b> <b>that</b> a division had placed over 300,000 stakes in the ground to deter airborne landings, and a corps had erected over 900,000. The Merville artillery battery was a particularly heavily fortified position. From the beach, it was protected by two strongpoints that included approximately thirty bunkers as well as an observation post, and the battery itself consisted of a bunker containing the battery's command post, two blockhouses, a light flak emplacement and four casemates able to contain artillery pieces up to dimensions of 150mm. The entire battery covered an area roughly four hundred metres in diameter and was surrounded by an inner perimeter of barbed wire, a minefield, and an outer perimeter of barbed wire as well as an anti-tank ditch.|$|E

25|$|Biologists {{and other}} {{research}} scientists constantly monitor the welfare, living conditions, {{and health of}} reindeer, {{as well as the}} ecological health of their habitat, and they make recommendations and set quotas designed to ensure that game resources and natural biodiversity are protected, managed, and maintained. Many factors, some of them difficult to measure or predict, are analyzed including natural cycles, parasites, disease, short-term weather conditions (relative harshness of winter or summer), long-term climate changes, and condition of food sources. Hunting is not the only factor affecting reindeer welfare, but it is <b>one</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> can be managed to some degree.|$|E
25|$|Although Denmark {{was spared}} {{many of the}} {{difficulties}} other areas of Europe suffered, its population still experienced hardships, particularly after the Germans took charge in 1943. Yet on the whole, Denmark {{can be said to}} have suffered the least of all the European combatants from the war. Many were killed and imprisoned because of their work resisting the German authorities. There were small bombing raids on select targets in the country, but nothing comparable to that suffered by, for instance, neighbouring Norway or the Netherlands. <b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> was badly damaged was the island of Bornholm, largely due to Soviet bombardment of the German garrison there in the very last days of the war.|$|E
500|$|During the Second World War Forglen was <b>one</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> had an Auxiliary Unit Patrol. Auxiliary Units were a top-secret {{resistance}} organisation formed {{down the}} entire {{eastern side of}} the UK. If Germany ever invaded, the patrol would go into hiding in an Operational Base. When the invasion was one to two weeks old, and things settled down, the patrol would come out at night and undertake guerilla warfare. Members of the patrols were trained as explosives experts and were well armed compared to the conventional British Army. [...] Research by Coleshill Auxiliary Research Team has identified the patrol members and an approximate location of the operational base in the estate.|$|E

2500|$|Advertising was <b>one</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> {{continued}} to have legal restrictions. In the late 1950s, the American National Association of Broadcasters banned condom advertisements from national television. This policy remained in place until 1979, when the U.S. Justice department had it overturned in court. [...] In the U.S., advertisements for condoms were mostly limited to men's magazines such as Penthouse. [...] The first television ad, on the California station KNTV, aired in 1975: it was quickly pulled after it attracted national attention. [...] And in over 30 states, advertising condoms as birth control devices was still illegal.|$|E
40|$|Currently the European Union (EU) {{consists}} {{of a group of}} nation states that exhibit an array of constitutional systems, ranging from the unitary to the fully federal. Among the EU member states, the United Kingdom (UK) has traditionally been regarded as an example par excellence of a unitary state. However, since taking office in the late 1990 s, Labour Governments have pursued a programme of constitutional reform. This has included the decentralisation of decision-making powers through a process of devolution to bodies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English Regions. <b>One</b> policy <b>area</b> <b>that</b> has been devolved as part of this process is environment policy. However, {{it could be argued that}} even before the formal 1998 Acts of devolution that environmental policy was already highly decentralised. Crucially though, <b>one</b> policy <b>area</b> <b>that</b> has been 'reserved' to the UK Executive in Whitehall and the Parliament in Westminster is international relations and EU matters, and UK environmental policy is <b>one</b> policy <b>area</b> <b>that</b> is deeply affected by EU level policy making. These circumstances, therefore, raise some important questions about British environmental governance, which this paper seeks to address. Crucially, what are the likely or potential implications of devolving environmental policy, whilst at the same time reserving EU relations to London (Whitehall and Westminster) ? In reflecting on these issues, this paper draws on theories and concepts derived from governance and historical institutionalist literature...|$|R

2500|$|Transportation was a {{major issue}} for the {{territory}} during the Parks administration.

2500|$|Following {{the court}} case, Levitt {{developed}} a thorough integration program. The company {{set up an}} integration committee headed by Howard Lett, an African American.

Lett recommended an attempt to discourage anti-integration activities known as [...] "Operation Hothead". Lett created a Human Relations Council to oversee possible disputes in community. James served as a member of that committee. The committee tried to solve problems of juvenile delinquency in the township. It opposed a curfew passed by the Township Council in the early 1970s.

2500|$|What is {{distinctive}} {{about this}} region is {{the diversity of}} habitats created by edaphic, topographic and climatic variability.

The rare palm Itaya amicorum is found on the upper Javari River. This ecoregion has the highest number of mammals recorded for the Amazonian biogeographic realm: 257 with 11 endemics.

2500|$|Its {{wholesale}} banking segment contains products sold to large- and middle-market commercial companies, {{as well as}} to consumers on a wholesale basis. This includes lending, treasury management, mutual funds, asset-based lending, commercial real estate, corporate and institutional trust services, and capital markets and investment banking services through Wells Fargo Securities. <b>One</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> is very profitable to Wells Fargo, however, is asset-based lending: lending to large companies using accounts receivable and inventory as collateral, though less traditional assets are often included in the collateral package. Historically, this type of lending has been done when normal routes of raising funds, such as the Capital Markets or unsecured bank loans, have been exhausted. The main business unit associated with this activity is Wells Fargo Capital Finance. Wells Fargo also owns Eastdil Secured, which is described as a [...] "real estate investment bank", but is essentially one of the largest commercial real estate brokers for very large transactions (such as the purchase and sale of large Class-A office buildings in central business districts throughout the United States).|$|E
