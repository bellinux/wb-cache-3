5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{species that}} are genetically {{compatible}} may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in pollinators.

Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that {{have some of the}} characteristics <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease-resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{base metal}} is iron, which {{is able to}} take on two {{crystalline}} forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six faces of the cube.|$|E

Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
