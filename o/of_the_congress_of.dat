5|$|The Soviet Union was {{established}} in 1922. However, the country's first constitution was adopted in 1924. Before that time, the 1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was adopted as {{the constitution of the}} USSR. According to the 1918 Constitution, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (CEC), whose chairman was head of state, had the power to determine what matters of income and taxation would go to the state budget and what would go to the local Soviets. The CEC could also limit taxes. In periods between convocations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Soviets the CEC held supreme power. In between sessions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Soviets the CEC was responsible for all the affairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Soviets. The CEC and the Congress of Soviets was replaced by the Presidium and the Supreme Soviet by several amendments to the 1936 constitution in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Between 1803 and 1815 all German regions {{west of the}} River Rhine were French, {{organised}} in the départements Roer, Sarre, Rhin-et-Moselle, and Mont-Tonnerre. As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Vienna these became part of various German states. A {{large part of the}} Palatinate fell to Bavaria, but having the metric system it was excepted from the Bavarian reform of weights and measures.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won {{numerous}} victories {{early on}} and declared independence. However, the declaration contradicted the principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Vienna and of the Holy Alliance, which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the liberal Greek insurgents.|$|E

5|$|The Central Executive Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Soviets {{issued a}} press decree that let the Bolsheviks {{suppress}} dissident newspapers. After {{the suppression of}} the Golos Truda by the Bolshevik government in August 1918, G.P Maximoff, Nikolai Dolenko and Efim Yartchuk established Volny Golos Truda (The Free Voice of Labour).|$|E
5|$|The Constitution of the Soviet Union {{recognised}} the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and {{the earlier}} Central Executive Committee (CEC) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Soviets {{as the highest}} organs of state authority in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Under the 1924, 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitution these bodies served as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union. The Chairman of these bodies personally performed the largely ceremonial functions assigned to a single head of state but held little real power.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated that the Soviet Union was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office, though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested. After the failed August Coup the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In February 1943, the West Nohno {{completed}} her nine-month journey {{when she arrived}} at Mobile, Alabama, after sailing via Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and Key West. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported that during this voyage, seaman James Orville Couchois had incited subordination and disloyalty among the crew. The head of the Naval Armed Guard detachment aboard West Nohno reported Couchois' activities, as well as comments from other crew members on the ship. After the ship had docked at Mobile, Couchois {{was removed from the}} ship and ultimately faced a trial for sedition. Couchois, who was the deck manager for the National Maritime Union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Industrial Organizations, was convicted and sentenced to a prison term of five years.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly of the Year XIII {{replaced}} the Triumvirate with an unipersonal head of state, the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Gervasio Antonio de Posadas was appointed Supreme Director, and Azcuénaga selected {{as one of}} his five advisors. In 1816 the Cabildo appointed him as protector of the freedom of the press. He became a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Tucumán in 1818, when it was moved from San Miguel de Tucumán to Buenos Aires. He was elected vice-president of the Congress in September and reelected in May 1819. The defeat of Buenos Aires in 1820 at the Battle of Cepeda, part of the Argentine Civil Wars, led to the closing of the Congress.|$|E
5|$|Three vice-presidents succeeded to the {{presidency}} due {{to the death of}} presidents - Sergio Osmeña (1944), Elpidio Quirino (1948) and Carlos P. Garcia (1957). They did not nominate a new vice-president, since the 1935 constitution was silent on the matter; a new vice-president would sit after the results of following elections were known. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo became president after the Supreme Court ruled that President Joseph Estrada resigned. Arroyo appointed Teofisto Guingona days after she ascended to power. The 1987 constitution mandated the President to nominate a vice-president from a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> the Philippines, in which both houses vote separately for confirmation via a majority vote.|$|E

5|$|Louis XVIII {{admitted}} the Count of Artois and his nephews the Dukes of Angoulême and Berry into the king's council in May 1814, upon its establishment. The council was informally headed by Prince Talleyrand. Louis XVIII took a large {{interest in the}} goings-on <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> Vienna (set up to redraw the map of Europe after Napoleon's demise). Talleyrand represented France at the proceedings. Louis was horrified by Prussia's intention to annex the Kingdom of Saxony, {{to which he was}} attached because his mother was born a Saxon princess, and he was also concerned that Prussia would dominate Germany. He also wished the Duchy of Parma to be restored to the Parmese Bourbons, and not to Empress Marie Louise of France, as was being suggested by the Allies. Louis also protested the Allies' inaction in Naples, where he wanted the Napoleonic usurper Joachim Murat removed in favour of the Neapolitan Bourbons.|$|E
