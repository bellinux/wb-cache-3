And all these garments, you must know, could be unfastened and taken off. I have known dolls--stylish enough dolls, to look at, some of them--who have been content to go about with their clothes gummed on to them, and, in some cases, nailed on with tacks, which I take to be a slovenly and unhealthy habit. But this family could be undressed in five minutes, {{without the aid of}} either hot water or a chisel.|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho propôs avaliar a influência das malhas de sombreamento (termorrefletora) instaladas externa e internamente em ambiente protegido coberto com polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD), cultivado com gérbera, na radiação solar global (Qg) e nos parâmetros da planta: crescimento, desenvolvimento e qualidade da gérbera. O experimento foi conduzido em dois ciclos no ano de 2004, na ESALQ/USP, em Piracicaba, SP, em ambiente protegido, dividido em dois módulos de produção. Os ambientes foram diferenciados um do outro pela instalação da malha termorrefletora (50 %) : malha externa (ambiente 1 - A 1) e malha interna (ambiente 2 - A 2). Nesses ambientes, os resultados dos dois ciclos mostraram alteração na Qg; nos ambientes A 1 e A 2 as Qg foram respectivamente 33, 6 e 21, 7 (1 º ciclo) e 27, 2 e 17, 9 % (2 º ciclo) em relação à observada externamente. Considerando-se os dois ciclos conclui-se que os resultados indicaram que não houve diferenças na qualidade das plantas nos dois ambientes, mas, analisando-se separadamente os dois ciclos da cultura, o A 1 (malha externa) foi o que mais favoreceu a qualidade das plantas de gérbera e somente as gérberas presentes no A 1 (malha externa) atenderam às exigências mercadológicas, quanto aos números de botões florais. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of low density polyethylene (PEBD) as a greenhouse cover in association with thermal shading screen installed in two different positions (outside and inside), cultivated with gerbera, on solar radiation (Qg), as well as on the growth and quality of gerbera plants. The experiment was carried out during two crop cycles in 2004, at ESALQ/USP, in Piracicaba, State of São Paulo, Brasil. A greenhouse was sub-divided into two parts and covered with PEBD differing from each other by the position of the thermal shading screen (50 %), witch was installed inside (at 3 m height) and <b>outside</b> (<b>covering</b> the plastic cover). The environment with the thermal screen outside was named A 1 and the other one with the thermal screen inside was named A 2. The results from the two crop cycles showed that the microclimate was changed by the covers of the greenhouses. Qg inside for A 1 and A 2 were respectively 33. 6 and 21. 7 (first cycle), and 27. 2 and 17. 9 % (second cycle) of the values measured outside. Considering the two crop cycles, the results showed that there were no differences in plant quality in both environments. However, A 1 was the most favorable environment for plant quality when considering the two crop cycles, separately the results separately. Also, only gerberas from A 1 showed themselves to have marketable characteristics...|$|E
