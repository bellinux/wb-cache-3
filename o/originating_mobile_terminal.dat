40|$|Each <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal</b> {{communicates}} {{with the}} wireline network through a nearby base station. In order to route incoming calls to a destination <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal,</b> the network must {{keep track of}} the location of each <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal</b> from time to time.

40|$|Cellular {{communications}} systems suffer from interference in particular at cell edge regions. This {{is also the}} case for downlink synchronization signals. Such synchronization signals are base station specific and uperimpose at a <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal</b> with different delays and amplitudes. This causes inter cellular interference depending on the cross correlation properties of the particular synchronization signals. Assuming knowledge about the positions of the serving and interfering base stations and having available a position estimate of the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal,</b> there is a-priori information about the different signal propagation delays at the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal's</b> position. Using this information, synchronization signals received from adjacent base stations can be timely related.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} spread of various <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> in our society, the {{importance}} of secure positioning is growing for wireless networks in adversarial settings. Recently, several authors have proposed a secure positioning mechanism of <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals</b> {{which is based on}} the geometric property of wireless node placement, and on the postulate of modern physics that a propagation speed of information never exceeds the velocity of light. In particular, they utilize the measurements of the round-trip time of radio signal propagation and bidirectional communication for variants of the challenge-and-response. In this paper, we propose a novel means to construct the above mechanism by use of unidirectional communication instead of bidirectional communication. Our proposal {{is based on the assumption}} that a <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal</b> incorporates a high-precision inner clock in a tamper-resistant protected area. In positioning, the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal</b> uses its inner clock and the time and location information broadcasted by radio from trusted stations. Our proposal has a major advantage in protecting the location privacy of <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal</b> users, because the <b>mobile</b> <b>terminal</b> need not provide any information to the trusted stations through positioning procedures.
