5|$|In February 2006 {{there were}} rumours that a 'third party' (believed to be a {{consortium}} headed by banker Sir Adrian Montague) had {{expressed an interest}} in buying out the present partners in the project. LCR shareholders rejected the proposal, and the government, which effectively could overrule shareholders' decisions as a result of LCR's reclassification as a state-owned body, decided that discussions with shareholders would not take place imminently, effectively backing shareholders' views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> takeover.|$|E
5|$|Public opinion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> {{project was}} split. Many {{residents}} supported the project, stating it {{would improve the}} safety of the highway; however, others believed that the reduction in lanes would result in increased traffic on Culver Road, which runs parallel to NY590 through Irondequoit, and that the roundabouts would make navigating the highway difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{cancelled}} in June 1967, when the French Government withdrew from participation. However, the cancellation {{was not the}} end of work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> design. BAC modified the specification to solely satisfy Royal Air Force (RAF) needs, reconfiguring the design as the UKVG and sought out new partners to procure the aircraft, which ultimately emerged as the Anglo-German-Italian consortium-funded MRCA (Panavia Tornado), a variable-geometry wing fighter/strike aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Calthrop {{appeared}} at the Light Railway Inquiry for the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway on 3–4 August 1897 and spoke particularly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> open level crossings {{and the use of}} transporter wagons. Calthrop claimed it only took 3 minutes to transfer wagons, based on his experience on the Barsi Light Railway. However the Order was not made until 8 September 1899 and in early 1900 the proprietors reached agreement with the Cambrian Railways to build the line. Their engineer, Alfred J. Collins, took charge of the engineering requirements, with consequent conservative 4-wheel wagons and other provisions.|$|E
5|$|In July {{an attempt}} by Representative (and future Vice President) Al Gore (D-Tennessee) to impose a one-year {{moratorium}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> system-wide cuts failed 214-197. In the end the Senate approved a smaller cutback, citing a 24% spike in Amtrak ridership after an oil shock during the summer, but the North Coast Hiawatha remained on the chopping block. In late September the Railway Labor Executives' Association, along with Senator John Melcher (D-Montana) and Representative Pat Williams (D-Montana), sued the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent the discontinuance of the service, then scheduled for October 1. A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last North Coast Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, 1955, the Bureau of Public Roads {{approved}} the Interstate Highway System spurs and connections in urban areas. Among these was a loop around the San Francisco Bay, soon numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) incorporated {{a number of}} existing legislative routes, including Routes 69, 108, 107, 75, and 74, crossing the Carquinez Strait <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Benicia-Martinez Bridge and ending at I-80 near downtown Vallejo. The first piece of this freeway north of the Carquinez Strait was at the I-80 cloverleaf interchange, built in the late 1950s when I-80 was upgraded through Vallejo. This was an extremely short roadway, beginning at Lemon Street, crossing under I-80 and Laurel Street, and ending at Reis Avenue and Cedar Street. In about 1960, it was extended east to the old highway (Columbus Parkway) between the cities, and was completed to the new bridge in about 1962, the year the bridge opened.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, McCain {{said he was}} {{temporarily}} suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying {{the first of the}} general election debates with Obama, in order to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis. McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Submarine Corporation {{construction}} {{facility was}} established on previously undeveloped {{land on the}} bank of the Port River, at Osborne, South Australia. Work on the site began on 29 June 1987, and it was opened in November 1989. South Australia was selected as the site of the construction facility based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> location of the facility and promises by the State Government to help minimise any problems caused by workers unions. The state's bid was aided by careful promotion to both Kockums and IKL/HDW during early in the project, and problems with the other states' proposals: Tasmania and Western Australia lacked the necessary industrial base, New South Wales could not decide on the location of the construction facility, Victoria's proposed site was poorly sited, and building in Liberal-led Queensland would have been politically unwise for the project when Labor was in power both federally and in all other states.|$|E

5|$|Woon {{was called}} to the Singapore Bar in 1985. The first edition of his book Company Law was {{published}} in 1988. The same year he became a Sub-Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law, then served as Vice-Dean from 1991 to 1995. On 1 February 1999 Woon was appointed a professor of law. In November 1990, Woon appeared before the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Bill (Bill No. 23/90) to make representations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> introduction of an elected President for Singapore.

5|$|All pipes {{water supply}} in the state was managed by the Sabah State Water Department, an agency {{under the control of}} Sabah Ministry of Infrastructure Development. Operating with 73 water {{treatments}} plants, an average of 1.19billion litres of water are distributed daily to meet Sabahan residents demands. The coverage of water supply in major towns has reach 100% while in rural areas, the coverage still around 75% with total public pipes length up to 15,031 kilometres. The only water supply dam in the state is the Babagon Dam which holds 21,000 million litres of water. To meet the increase demands, another dam named as Kaiduan Dam was being proposed to be built although being met with protest from local villagers who living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> site. Sabah has a natural gas demand of 350 mmscfd in 2013, which increase to 523 mmscfd in 2015. As Malaysia's liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are much cheaper through the subsidy that was given by the federal government, it was found out in 2015 that around 20,000 LPG cylinders in Sabah east coast were smuggled by immigrants from neighbouring Indonesia and the southern Philippines in a monthly basis to their countries that leading to many Sabahans hard to retrieve enough supplies of LPG. As a counter-measure, the Malaysian Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism (MDTCAC) has temporarily cancelled all permits to sell gas cylinders into neighbouring countries with a new policy will be implemented to control such illegal activities.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{proposed}} high-risk transmission channels, {{allowing the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic {{with the emergence of}} colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear wave {{propagation}} has, {{for the last}} couple of decades, become an increasingly more important tool in medical ultrasound imaging. Creating ultrasound images from echoes in the second harmonic frequency band provides a major enhancement to the image quality, reducing body wall reverberation and also reducing perturbations from off-axis echoes. The aim of this study has been to make a fast implementation of nonlinear wave simulation in ultrasound, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Propose</b> method, and investigate its agreement with the state-of-the art simulation tool, Abersim. Agreement between the methods has been investigated for a typical cardiac probe in the fundamental and second harmonic frequency band. The comparison showed good agreement for phase, amplitude, wave form and beam profile. Some overestimation of the center lobe in the beam profile was found, but this is expected for quasilinear methods. A fast implementation for simulation of nonlinear {{wave propagation}} in ultrasound has been made, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Propose</b> method. <b>The</b> new implementation and is performing simulations in the second harmonic frequency band 74 % [...] 93 % faster than the original implementation. </p...|$|R

5|$|The route {{was then}} to {{continue}} east under Fleet Street to Ludgate Circus for an interchange with the South Eastern and Chatham Railway's (SECR's) Ludgate Hill station, then south under New Bridge Street, and east into Queen Victoria Street where a station was planned {{to connect to}} the District Railway's Mansion House station. The route was then to continue under Queen Victoria Street to reach the CLR's station at Bank, where separate platforms below the existing ones were to be provided. The final section of the route developed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> loop {{from the year before}} with tunnels winding under the City's narrow, twisting streets. The tunnels were to run east, one below the other, beneath Cornhill and Leadenhall Street, north under St Mary Axe and west to Liverpool Street station, then south under Blomfield Street, east under Great Winchester Street, south under Austin Friars and Old Broad Street and west under Threadneedle Street where the tunnels were to connect with the existing sidings back into Bank. Two stations were to be provided on the loop; {{at the south end of}} St Mary Axe and at Liverpool Street station. To accommodate the additional rolling stock needed to operate the longer line, the depot was to be extended northwards. The power station was also to be enlarged to increase the electricity supply. The CLR estimated that its plan would cost £3,781,000 (approximately £ today): £2,110,000 for construction, £873,000 for land and £798,000 for electrical equipment and trains.|$|E
