5|$|The {{silver birch}} has an open canopy which allows plenty {{of light to}} reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (<b>Oxalis</b> acetosella). Small shrubs that grow {{on the forest floor}} include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} {{laid on the}} host plants and the larvae hatch to feed on them. The plants include members of the Oxalidaceae {{including}} <b>Oxalis</b> corniculata, some Leguminosae and Acanthaceae.|$|E

25|$|Plants have {{mechanisms}} that protect against {{adverse effects of}} strong light. The most studied biochemical protective mechanism is non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy. Visible-light-induced photoinhibition is ~25% faster in an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lacking non-photochemical quenching than in the wild type. It is also apparent that turning or folding of leaves, as occurs, e.g., in <b>Oxalis</b> species in response to exposure to high light, protects against photoinhibition.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} plant {{found on the}} {{peninsula}} are listed as either rare or threatened in Victoria or Australia including River Swamp Wallaby-grass (Amphibromus fluitans) listed as vulnerable in Australia, Purple Blown-grass (Lachnagrostis punicea subsp. filifolia) listed as vulnerable in Victoria and Pale-flower Cranesbill (Geranium sp. 3), Creeping Rush (Juncus revolutus), Dune Wood-sorrel (<b>Oxalis</b> rubens) and Dune Poa (Poa poiformis var. ramifer) all listed as rare in Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Calcium oxalate is {{the most}} common {{component}} of kidney stones. Early investigators isolated oxalic acid from wood-sorrel (<b>Oxalis).</b> Members of the spinach family and the brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts) are high in oxalates, as are sorrel and umbellifers like parsley. Rhubarb leaves contain about 0.5% oxalic acid, and jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) contains calcium oxalate crystals. Similarly, the Virginia creeper, a common decorative vine, produces oxalic acid in its berries as well as oxalite crystals in the sap, in the form of raphides. Bacteria produce oxalates from oxidation of carbohydrates.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure a}} {{subsistence}} economy, the Muisca irrigated their lands and varied their cultivation over different climatic zones. The {{geography of the}} area allowed for micro-ecological regions providing farmlands on the fertile plains and in higher altitude terrains such as mountain slopes. Quinoa and potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) were cultivated on the highest altitudes, maize and coca in the temperate regions and yuca, arracacha, pineapples, tobacco and cotton in the low-lying valleys with a warmer climate. Additionally, Cucurbita maxima, <b>Oxalis</b> tuberosa (oca), peppers and Ullucus tuberosus were cultivated by the Muisca. The surplus of the agricultural production was available for trading on the many markets throughout the Muisca territories.|$|E

2500|$|The low {{mountains}} of the Redwood Zone ecoregion lie entirely within the coastal fog zone. Elevation varies from 50 to 1800 feet (15 to 550 m). Historically, unbroken redwood forests moderated the local climate by trapping the coastal fog and producing shade. Remnants of unlogged redwood forest still survive east of Brookings, Oregon. Today, {{the region is}} characteristically covered by a mixed forest of coast redwood and Douglas-fir, with a shrub layer of vine maple, rhododendron, sword fern, and <b>oxalis.</b> The region covers [...] in the far southwestern corner of Oregon. Larger sections in northwestern California have not been mapped yet.|$|E
2500|$|Although the soft, orange {{sweet potato}} {{is often called}} a [...] "yam" [...] in parts of North America, the sweet potato is botanically very {{distinct}} from a genuine yam (Dioscorea), which is native to Africa and Asia and belongs to the monocot family Dioscoreaceae. To add to the confusion, a different crop plant, the oca (<b>Oxalis</b> tuberosa, a species of wood sorrel), is called a [...] "yam" [...] {{in many parts of}} Polynesia, including New Zealand. The United States Department of Agriculture requires that the label [...] "yam" [...] always be accompanied by [...] "sweet potato" [...] in U.S. retail sales of sweet potato.|$|E
2500|$|The Southern Oregon Coastal Mountains {{ecoregion}} is a geologically and botanically diverse ecoregion that is {{a transition}} zone between the Coast Range and the Siskiyou Mountains, which form part of the Klamath Mountains ecoregion to the east. Rising to an elevation of approximately , this region has the climate of the Coast Range but the varied lithology of the higher, more dissected Siskiyou Mountains, underlain by Jurassic sandstone, metamorphosed sediments, granite, and serpentinite. Distributions of northern and southern vegetation blend together here and species diversity is high. Douglas-fir, western hemlock, tanoak, Port Orford cedar, and western redcedar are present, along with salal, sword fern, vine maple, Oregon grape, rhododendron, California bay-laurel, bigleaf maple, grand fir, red alder, salmonberry, and <b>oxalis.</b> The region covers [...] in a remote area of Curry County in southwestern Oregon containing the Sixes and Elk River drainages. It includes Grassy Knob Wilderness within the Siskiyou National Forest.|$|E
2500|$|The Willapa Hills {{ecoregion}} (named for the Willapa Hills) {{consists of}} low, rolling hills and low, gently sloping mountains with medium gradient streams and rivers. It rises to {{an elevation of}} approximately [...] This region has a lower drainage density than other upland areas in the Coast Range. Logging is relatively easy and less expensive in this accessible terrain, and industrial timberland has almost completely replaced the historic forests. When disturbed, the silt- and clay-textured soils are easily eroded, thereby degrading stream quality. The vegetation consists of Douglas-fir and western hemlock forests, with sword fern, vine maple, salal, Oregon grape, and rhododendron shrub layer. Wetter slopes and riparian areas support red alder, western redcedar, bigleaf maple, salmonberry, and <b>oxalis.</b> Large herds of Roosevelt elk winter in the region. The region covers [...] in southwestern Washington and [...] in northwestern Oregon, inland from the coast.|$|E
2500|$|The mountainous Mid-Coastal Sedimentary {{ecoregion}} lies {{outside of}} the coastal fog zone and is typically underlain by massive beds of sandstone and siltstone. Elevation varies from 300 to 3000 feet (90 to 900 m). The region is more rugged than the geologically similar Willapa Hills. Its Douglas-fir forests are intensively managed for logging, and the slopes are prone to failure when disturbed, particularly south of the Siuslaw River. Stream sedimentation is {{higher than in the}} Volcanics ecoregion. The mature forest consists of Douglas-fir and western hemlock, with salal, sword fern, vine maple, Oregon grape, and rhododendron; tanoak may be found on drier slopes to the south. Wetter slopes and riparian areas support bigleaf maple, western redcedar, grand fir, red alder, salmonberry, and <b>oxalis,</b> with California bay-laurel in the south. This is the largest of the Coast Range subregions, covering [...] in the Central and Southern Oregon Coast Range.|$|E
2500|$|The Western Cascades Lowlands and Valleys {{ecoregion}} comprises {{a network}} of steep ridges and narrow valleys on the lower slopes of the Cascade Mountains. Elevation varies from 600 to 4000 feet (183 to 1219 m). Its mild, wet climate promotes lush forests dominated by western hemlock and Douglas-fir, with western redcedar, bigleaf maple, red alder, vine maple, salal, rhododendron, Oregon grape, huckleberry, thimbleberry, swordfern, <b>oxalis,</b> hazel, and blackberry. Soils are warmer here than in higher elevation ecoregions, {{and it is one}} of the most important timber producing areas in the Pacific Northwest. The steep valleys trending to the west contain high and medium gradient rivers and streams that support cold water salmonids, including the threatened Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout. Notable river drainages in Oregon include the North Umpqua, North and Middle Forks of the Willamette, McKenzie, North Santiam, South Santiam, Clackamas, Salmon and Bull Run River watersheds; and in Washington, the Lewis, Cowlitz, Nisqually, Puyallup, White, and Green River watersheds. Reservoirs store winter snowmelt for irrigation and municipal water supply in the Willamette Valley. The Westerns Cascades Lowlands and Valleys is the largest of the Cascades subregions, covering [...] in Oregon and [...] in Washington.|$|E
2500|$|The Volcanics {{ecoregion}} {{consists of}} steeply sloping mountains and capes underlain by fractured basaltic rocks. Elevation generally varies from 600 to 4100 feet (180 to 1250 m), although {{in some places}} the volcanic rock extends down to sea level. The region is marked by columnar and pillow basalt outcrops. Its mountains may have been offshore seamounts engulfed by continental sediments about 200 million years ago. High gradient, cascading streams and rivers occur, and the basaltic substrate preserves summer flows that are more consistent than streams on the sedimentary rocks in surrounding ecoregions. The streams still support runs of spring chinook salmon and summer steelhead. The region's Douglas-fir plantations are heavily logged. Mature forests consist of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, salal, sword fern, vine maple, Oregon grape, and rhododendron. Wetter slopes and riparian areas may support western redcedar, bigleaf maple, red alder, salmonberry, and <b>oxalis.</b> Grassy coastal headlands and mountaintop balds feature Roemer’s fescue, thin bentgrass, California oatgrass, and diverse forbs. This large but disjunct ecoregion covers [...] in Oregon and [...] in Washington, including parts of the Olympic and Siuslaw National Forests and the Cummins Creek and Rock Creek Wildernesses, as well as higher elevations in the Cape Meares National Wildlife Refuge. California has not been mapped yet.|$|E

60|$|Finally, as Hildebrand has remarked, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that any of the heterostyled species of <b>Oxalis</b> are tending towards a dioecious condition, as Zuccarini and Lindley inferred from the differences in the reproductive organs of the three forms, the meaning of which they did not understand.|$|E
6000|$|When, however, any {{one form}} of <b>Oxalis</b> is fertilised illegitimately with pollen from the same form, the {{seedlings}} appear to belong invariably to this form. Thus Hildebrand states that long-styled plants of O. rosea growing by themselves have been propagated in Germany year after year by seed, and have always produced long-styled plants. (5/6. 'Ueber den Trimorphismus in der Gattung Oxalis: Monatsberichte der Akad. der Wissen. zu Berlin' 21 June 1866 page 373 and 'Botanische Zeitung' 1871 page 435.) Again, 17 seedlings were raised from mid- styled plants of O. hedysaroides growing by themselves, and these were all mid- styled. So that the forms of <b>Oxalis,</b> when illegitimately fertilised with their own pollen, behave like the long-styled form of Lythrum salicaria, which when thus fertilised always produced with me long-styled offspring.] ...|$|E
60|$|Hildebrand, whilst searching various Herbaria, {{observed}} {{that many other}} species of <b>Oxalis</b> besides O. acetosella produce cleistogamic flowers (8/10. 'Monatsbericht der Akad. der Wiss. zu Berlin' 1866 page 369.); and I hear from him {{that this is the}} case with the heterostyled trimorphic O. incarnata from the Cape of Good Hope.|$|E
60|$|With {{those animals}} and plants which habitually produce several forms, as with certain {{butterflies}} described by Mr. Wallace, in which three female forms and one male form co-exist, or, as with the trimorphic species of Lythrum and <b>Oxalis,</b> gemmules capable of reproducing these different forms must be latent in each individual.|$|E
60|$|In the {{previous}} chapters various heterostyled dimorphic {{plants have been}} described, and now we come to heterostyled trimorphic plants, or those which present three forms. These have been observed in three families, and consist of species of Lythrum and of the allied genus Nesaea, of <b>Oxalis</b> and Pontederia. In their manner of fertilisation these plants offer a more remarkable case than {{can be found in}} any other plant or animal.|$|E
60|$|No one has {{compared}} the legitimate and illegitimate offspring of any trimorphic species in this genus. Hildebrand sowed illegitimately fertilised seeds of <b>Oxalis</b> Valdiviana, {{but they did}} not germinate (5/4. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1871 page 433 footnote.); and this fact, as he remarks, supports my view that an illegitimate union resembles a hybrid one between two distinct species, for the seeds in this latter case are often incapable of germination.|$|E
60|$|Considering these several facts, {{there can}} hardly be a doubt that both these species of Pontederia are heterostyled and trimorphic. This case is an {{interesting}} one, for no other Monocotyledonous plant {{is known to be}} heterostyled. Moreover, the flowers are irregular, and all other heterostyled plants have almost symmetrical flowers. The two forms differ somewhat in the colour of their corollas, that of the short-styled being of a darker blue, whilst that of the long-styled tends towards violet, and no other such case is known. Lastly, the three longer stamens alternate with the three shorter ones, whereas in Lythrum and <b>Oxalis</b> the long and short stamens belong to distinct whorls. With respect to the absence of the mid-styled form {{in the case of the}} Pontederia which grows wild in Southern Brazil, this would probably follow if only two forms had been originally introduced there; for, as we shall hereafter see from the observations of Hildebrand, Fritz Muller and myself, when one form of <b>Oxalis</b> is fertilised exclusively by either of the other two forms, the offspring generally belong to the two parent-forms.|$|E
6000|$|... 6. A perfect or pure flower, as a rose, <b>oxalis,</b> or campanula, {{is always}} {{composed}} of an unbroken whorl, or corolla, {{in the form}} of a disk, cup, bell, or, if it draw together again at the lips, a narrow-necked vase. This cup, bell, or vase, is divided into similar petals, (or segments, which are petals carefully joined,) varying in number from three to eight, and enclosed by a calyx whose sepals are symmetrical also.|$|E
60|$|Fritz Muller {{formerly}} {{believed that}} a species of <b>Oxalis,</b> which is so abundant in St. Catharina that it borders the roads for miles, was dimorphic instead of trimorphic. Although the pistils and stamens vary greatly in length, as was evident in some specimens sent to me, yet the plants {{can be divided into}} two sets, according to the lengths of these organs. A large proportion of the anthers are of a white colour and quite destitute of pollen; others which are pale yellow contain many bad with some good grains; and others again which are bright yellow have apparently sound pollen; but he has never succeeded in finding any fruit on this species. The stamens in some of the flowers are partially converted into petals. Fritz Muller after reading my description, hereafter to be given, of the illegitimate offspring of various heterostyled species, suspects that these plants of <b>Oxalis</b> may be the variable and sterile offspring of a single form of some trimorphic species, perhaps accidentally introduced into the district, which has since been propagated asexually. It is probable that this kind of propagation would be much aided by there being no expenditure in the production of seed.|$|E
