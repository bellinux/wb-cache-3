5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear}} of offending Adolf Hitler. By the time the invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A large portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E

5|$|Estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the Polish Legions also vary {{and it is}} {{believed}} that between 20,000 and 30,000 men served in the Legions' ranks at any one time over the course of their existence. The WIEM Encyklopedia estimate is 21,000 for the period up to 1803. Davies suggests 25,000 for the period of up to 1802–1803, as does Magosci et al. Bideleux and Jeffries offer an estimate of up to 30,000 for the period up to 1801. Most of the soldiers came from the ranks of the peasantry, with only about 10 percent being drawn from the nobility.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck.

Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
5|$|The {{complaints}} from the SS-FHA {{about the quality}} of Volksdeutsche recruits had no effect on Berger's approach. He concluded further agreements with Hungary and Romania, and imposed on the puppet regimes of the Independent State of Croatia and the Slovak State, to effectively authorise the unrestricted conscription of ethnic Germans in those territories. In the German-occupied territory of Serbia, the General Government (annexed Poland) and parts of the Soviet Union, ethnic Germans were conscripted into the Waffen-SS in the same arbitrary manner Reich Germans were conscripted by the Wehrmacht. By the end of 1943, a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the Waffen-SS was made up of Volksdeutsche.|$|E

5|$|The {{deterioration}} of the castle continued into the reign of Elizabeth I, who was advised {{that it no longer}} had any military utility. Robert Redhead, the tower keeper, became infamous at the time for taking parts of the castle to pieces and selling off the stonework for his own profit. Despite numerous attempts by local city and crown officials to halt this, Redhead continued to cause considerable damage before being forced to stop. Proposals were made to pull down Clifford's Tower altogether in 1596, but were turned down because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> local feeling.|$|E
5|$|As {{operations}} continued {{throughout the}} month, casualties amongst the Australian Corps became critical {{and the decision}} was made to disband some of the 3rd Division's battalions and use them to reinforce the remaining units. This decision saw the reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> division's infantry brigades from four battalions to three, bringing the Australians into line with the British, who had made a similar decision earlier in the war. Nevertheless, the decision was not popular amongst the soldiers and when the 42nd Battalion received the order to disband, the attempt was rejected by its personnel and the order disobeyed. As a result, the proposed reorganisation was postponed until after the division's final offensive actions were fought in early October 1918. These came around the St Quentin Canal when the division attacked the Beaurevoir Line in concert with American troops from the US 27th Division, who would lead the assault in. The attack went awry, however, when the lead assault units failed to adequately clear the forward positions and subsequently when the 3rd Division was committed they came under fire almost immediately and instead of passing through the American positions, they had to complete the mopping up process before they could advance. Nevertheless, by nightfall on 1 October, the division had captured the northern end of the tunnel that ran under the canal.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes, {{who was now}} {{confident}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> his position, began plotting {{against the}} ephors. He first recruited his stepfather, persuading him {{of the need to}} do away with the ephors. Cleomenes contended they could then make the ephors' property common to all citizens and work toward the achievement of Spartan supremacy in Greece. Having won over his stepfather, Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Employing the men he considered most likely to oppose him (probably in an attempt to get them killed), he captured Heraea and Asea. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus—which the Achaeans were besieging—before camping outside Mantinea. This campaign exhausted his opponents, who asked to remain in Arcadia so they could rest. Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to slay the ephors. Four of the five ephors were killed; the sole survivor was Agylaeus, who managed to escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.|$|E

5|$|Dance formed his ships into a line {{of battle}} and ordered {{three or four of}} them to raise blue ensigns and the others red, giving the {{impression}} of a heavy escort by implying that the ships with blue ensigns were warships. This ruse provoked a cautious response from Linois, who ordered his squadron to shadow the convoy without closing with them. During the night, Dance held position and Linois remained at a distance, unsure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the British convoy. At 09:00, Dance reformed his force into sailing formation to put distance between the two forces and Linois took the opportunity to attack, threatening to cut off the rearmost British ships. Dance tacked and his lead vessels came to the support of the rear, engaging Marengo at long range. Unnerved by the sudden British manoeuvere, Linois turned and retreated, convinced that the convoy was defended by an overwhelming force. Continuing the illusion that he was supported by warships, Dance ordered his ships to pursue Linois over the next two hours, eventually reforming and reaching the Straits of Malacca safely. There they were met several days later by two ships of the line sent from India.|$|E
5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the International System of Units (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July, {{to protect}} Cobra's flank {{and prevent the}} {{disengagement}} and relocation of further German forces, the British VIII Corps and XXX Corps launched Operation Bluecoat south from Caumont toward Vire and Mont Pinçon. Bluecoat kept German armoured units fixed on the British eastern front and continued the wearing down <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> German armoured formations in the area. The breakthrough in {{the centre of the}} Allied front surprised the Germans, when they were distracted by the Allied attacks {{at both ends of the}} Normandy bridgehead. By the time of the American breakout at Avranches, there was little to no reserve strength left for Unternehmen Lüttich (Operation Liège), the German counter-offensive, which had been defeated by 12 August, leaving the 7th Army with no choice but to retire rapidly east of the Orne river, with a rearguard of the remaining armoured and motorised units, to allow time for the surviving infantry to reach the Seine. After the first stage of the withdrawal beyond the Orne, the manoeuvre collapsed for a lack of fuel, Allied air attacks and the constant pressure of the Allied armies, culminating in the encirclement of German forces in the Falaise pocket.|$|E
