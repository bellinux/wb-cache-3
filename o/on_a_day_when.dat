He deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball, much to Bradman's displeasure, in a protest against the one-sided nature of the contest.|$|E
5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E

In October, Helen Taft returned from Europe on Kroonland and {{was met by}} her husband, Secretary of War William Howard Taft. The next August, Henry Yates Satterlee, the first Episcopal Bishop of Washington, returned on Kroonland from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted {{both good and bad}} design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the Washington National Cathedral. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral Charles Sperry and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General Robert O'Reilly, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army; all were American delegates to the Second Geneva Convention. It was not the first trip on Kroonland for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse; O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which Kroonland had been reported as sunk.|$|E

Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> Cobb went hitless, Cobb would turn red and sometimes {{walk out of the}} park with the game still on.

500|$|Hill {{became the}} fourth driver {{in nine years}} to win the World Drivers' Championship for Williams and not drive for the team the {{following}} season, as occurred with Nelson Piquet ( [...] champion – [...] driver for Lotus), Nigel Mansell ( [...] champion – 1993 driver in the US-based Indy Car World Series instead of F1) and Alain Prost (1993 champion – retired in 1994). As world champion, Hill was in high demand and had offers for a race seat from McLaren, Benetton and Ferrari but not adequately financially valued despite his status. As a consequence, he opted to sign for Arrows, a team which had never won a race in its 20-year history and had scored only a single point the previous year. Hill's title defence in 1997 proved unsuccessful, getting off to a poor start when he only narrowly qualified for the Australian Grand Prix and then retired on the parade lap. The Arrows car, which used tyres from series debutant Bridgestone and previously unproven Yamaha engines, was generally uncompetitive, and Hill did not score his first point for the team until the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in July. His best result for the year then came at the Hungarian Grand Prix. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> the Bridgestone tyres had a competitive edge over their Goodyear rivals, Hill qualified third in a car that had not previously placed higher than 9th on the grid. During the race, he passed his rival and new championship contender, Michael Schumacher, on the track and was leading late in the race, 35 seconds ahead of the eventual 1997 World Champion, Villeneuve, until a hydraulic problem drastically slowed the Arrows. Villeneuve thus passed Hill, who finished second and achieved the team's first podium since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. This new podium ultimately {{turned out to be}} Arrows' last ever podium finish.|$|E
500|$|Popular was {{uncertain}} {{of the sales}} potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint, which was used for lower-paying magazines. Astonishings first issue was dated February 1940; it was bimonthly, alternating monthly with Super Science Stories. [...] Pohl's budget for an issue was $405: in Pohl's memoirs he recalls Harry Steeger, {{one of the company}} owners, breaking down the budget for him: [...] "Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. [...] A hundred dollars for black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover." [...] Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. [...] At ten cents, the magazine was cheaper {{than any of the other}} sf magazines of the day, and it sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources. [...] It was certainly assisted by Popular's wide and effective distribution network, and the publisher soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. [...] Pohl later commented that he {{was uncertain}} whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. [...] Some of the additional money went to long-time writer Ray Cummings, who was sufficiently well known that the young Pohl felt unable to reject his stories, even though he disliked his work. [...] Cummings came to see Pohl in person to submit his work, and refused to sell for less than one cent a word; since the first visit came <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> Pohl had some extra money available, Pohl was never able to bring himself to tell Cummings that he could not really afford to pay that rate. [...] Pohl comments in his memoirs that [...] "for months he would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all." ...|$|E
