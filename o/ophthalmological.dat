25|$|An <b>ophthalmological</b> {{abnormality}} {{called a}} cherry-red spot, {{which can be}} identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of this disorder. This cherry-red spot is the same finding that Warren Tay first reported in 1881, when he identified a case of Tay-Sachs disease, {{and it has the}} same etiology.|$|E
25|$|Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology is an <b>Ophthalmological</b> {{hospital}} in Kathmandu. It pioneered {{the production of}} low cost intraocular lenses (IOLs), which are used in cataract surgery. The team of Dr. Sanduk Ruit in the same hospital pioneered sutureless small-incision cataract surgery (SICS), a technique which {{has been used to}} treat 4 million of the world's 20 million people with cataract blindness.|$|E
25|$|Another year later, the US-American {{ophthalmologist}} William Bates, perhaps motivated like Oliver, instilled adrenal extracts {{into the}} eye, found that ″the conjunctiva {{of the globe}} and lids whitened in a few minutes″, correctly explained the effect by vasoconstriction, and administered the extracts in various eye diseases. Later catecholamine literature has not done him justice. Even an <b>ophthalmological</b> review article of 1905 mentions him only in passing.|$|E
25|$|On 15 October 1941, Gregg {{delivered}} a paper, Congenital Cataract following German Measles in the Mother, to the <b>Ophthalmological</b> Society of Australia in Melbourne which published {{it in its}} journal, Transactions. Following press coverage of his paper, Gregg was contacted by two mothers who had contracted rubella, and whose children suffered from deafness, and he subsequently issued a further paper detailing Further Observations on Congenital Defects in Infants following Maternal Rubella.|$|E
500|$|Upon Morales' election, Bolivia's {{illiteracy}} {{rate was}} at 16%, {{the highest in}} South America. Attempting to rectify this {{with the aid of}} far left allies, Bolivia launched a literacy campaign with Cuban assistance, while Venezuela invited 5000 Bolivian high school graduates to study in Venezuela for free. By 2009, UNESCO declared Bolivia free from illiteracy, although the World Bank claimed that it had only declined by 5%. Cuba also aided Bolivia in the development of its medical care, opening <b>ophthalmological</b> centres in the country to treat 100,000 Bolivians for free per year, and offering 5000 free scholarships for Bolivian students to study medicine in Cuba. The government sought to expand state medical facilities, opening twenty hospitals by 2014, and increasing basic medical coverage up to the age of 25. Their approach sought to utilise and harmonise both mainstream Western medicine and Bolivia's traditional medicine.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was named}} to succeed Donders as the institute's {{director}} in 1884, a position he served until 1903. In 1877, he was appointed {{as a professor of}} ophthalmology at Utrecht University. He did research on astigmatism, glaucoma and other eye diseases as well as research on correction of visual acuity using eyeglasses and [...] <b>ophthalmological</b> surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Both Tay and Sachs {{reported}} their first cases among Ashkenazi Jewish families. Tay reported his observations in 1881 {{in the first}} volume of the proceedings of the British <b>Ophthalmological</b> Society, of which he was a founding member. By 1884, he had seen three cases in a single family. Years later, Bernard Sachs, an American neurologist, reported similar findings when he reported a case of [...] "arrested cerebral development" [...] to other New York Neurological Society members.|$|E
2500|$|The {{capacity}} of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences of melanin binding is unknown. [...] Clinical trials excluded subtle effects and optimal duration of treatment. [...] There are no specific recommendations for periodic <b>ophthalmological</b> monitoring. [...] Lamotrigine binds {{to the eye}} and melanin-containing tissues which can accumulate over time and may cause toxicity. [...] Prescribers {{should be aware of}} the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects and base treatment on [...] clinical response. [...] Patient compliance should be periodically reassessed with lab and medical testing of liver and kidney function to monitor progress or side effects.|$|E
2500|$|In 1855, Friedrich Gaedcke (18281890) {{became the}} first to {{chemically}} isolate cocaine, the most potent alkaloid of the coca plant. Gaedcke named the compound [...] "erythroxyline". In 1884, Austrian ophthalmologist Karl Koller (18571944) instilled a 2% solution of cocaine into his own eye and tested its effectiveness as a local anesthetic by pricking the eye with needles. His findings were presented {{a few weeks later}} at annual conference of the Heidelberg <b>Ophthalmological</b> Society. The following year, William Halsted (18521922) performed the first brachial plexus block. Using a surgical approach in the neck, Halsted applied cocaine to the brachial plexus. In January 1900, Harvey Cushing (18691939) — who was at that time one of Halsted's surgical residents — applied cocaine to the brachial plexus prior to dividing it, during a forequarter amputation for sarcoma.|$|E
2500|$|It is also {{sometimes}} claimed that glasses were first invented in India. In 1907 Professor Berthold Laufer stated in {{his history of}} glasses that [...] "the opinion that spectacles originated in India is of the greatest probability and that spectacles must have been known in India earlier than in Europe". However, Joseph Needham showed that the mention of glasses in the manuscript Laufer used to justify the prior invention of them in Asia {{did not exist in}} older versions of that manuscript, and the reference to them in later versions was added during the Ming dynasty. In an 1971 article in the British Journal of Ophthalmology it was argued that it: [...] "...is therefore most likely that the use of lenses reached Europe via the Arabs, as did Hindu mathematics and the <b>ophthalmological</b> works of the ancient Hindu surgeon Susruta", but all dates given are well after the existence of eyeglasses in Italy was established, and there had been significant shipments of eye glasses from Italy to the Middle East, with one shipment as large as 24,000 glasses.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, Rambo {{was elected}} President of the All-India <b>Ophthalmological</b> Society. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he still {{performed}} surgeries, but left {{many of his}} operations to other doctors. He spent time in Ludhiana, India {{in the fall and}} winter attending various conferences, seminars, and speaking engagements. [...] During this period, the eye camps that Dr. Rambo helped established treated more than five thousand patients. The teams at Vellore, Sompeta, Mungeli, and Ludhiana completed more than fourteen thousand eye operations, despite India's increased fighting with Pakistan in 1969. [...] Rambo wanted to bring eye camps even farther than India, stating, [...] "I want to have our science of sight restoration reach every single person with curable blindness in every needy nation." [...] In 1969, Rambo and Arin Chatterjee, a fellow physician, wrote a guide on mobile eye hospitals called The Curable Blind: A Guide for Establishing and Maintaining Mobile Eye Hospitals, a detailed book on the history, techniques, personnel, equipment, surgical procedures and care of patients in mobile eye hospitals.|$|E
