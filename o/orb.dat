5|$|In 1988, {{following}} his mother's death, a young Peter Quill is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, {{a group of}} space pirates led by Yondu Udonta. Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, Quill steals an <b>orb</b> but is attacked by Korath, a subordinate to the fanatical Kree, Ronan. Although Quill escapes with the <b>orb,</b> Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin Gamora after the <b>orb.</b>|$|E
5|$|Picard finds Bok {{waiting for}} him, who has another <b>orb.</b> Bok {{explains}} {{that it was}} his son in command of the Ferengi vessel at Maxia, and he came here seeking his revenge. He places the <b>orb</b> down and leaves Picard on the Stargazer bridge. The <b>orb</b> lights up once more, leaving Picard believing he is once again at the Battle of Maxia. On the Enterprise, Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) discover the <b>orb</b> brought over from the Stargazer in Picard's chest. They take it to Riker as the Stargazer powers up its weapon systems. Riker hails the Ferengi vessel and speaks to Kazago, who is suspicious {{at the sight of the}} <b>orb,</b> which is a banned device. He promises to investigate.|$|E
5|$|The <b>orb</b> {{itself was}} buried {{deep in the}} ground for {{millions}} of years, until it was discovered by Karnath, an evil sorcerer. Upon finding the <b>orb,</b> Karnath fused it into his own magical staff, and on doing so learned {{the history of the}} Sarnathians. He became obsessed with the <b>orb</b> and the task of releasing these beings from the Realm of Unreality. After years of isolation in his castle, as his own death was drawing near, Karnath was finally able to cast a powerful spell over his staff. This spell was designed such that upon contact with the <b>orb,</b> it would unleash its most powerful state and tear the fabric of reality once more.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Orizonia Corporation, <b>Orbest</b> was purchased by the Barceló Group. The group also created a new airline under the name Evelop Airlines for operations in Spain, which received airplanes from both <b>Orbest</b> and the former <b>Orbest</b> Orizonia Airlines, all aircraft owned by <b>Orbest</b> are now also operated by Evelop.|$|R
50|$|<b>Orbs</b> - <b>Orbs</b> are magical spheres which glow red, {{green or}} blue. Each gives a {{different}} effect in character development. For example, green spheres provide more spell slots. <b>Orbs</b> are gathered by destroying lairs (monster spawn bases).|$|R
50|$|<b>ORBs</b> are {{currently}} not in commercial use {{and are still}} under development. Theoretically, <b>ORBs</b> could replace Li-ion batteries as more environmentally friendly batteries of similar or higher charge capacity and similar or shorter charge time. An application of <b>ORBs</b> is, therefore, the area of handheld electronic devices.|$|R
5|$|Horizontal <b>orb</b> webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal <b>orb</b> webs.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several {{recording}} {{sessions at}} Cauty's studio, Trancentral. When offered an album deal by Big Life, the <b>Orb</b> found themselves at a crossroads: Cauty preferred that the <b>Orb</b> release their music through his KLF Communications label, whereas Paterson wanted {{to ensure that}} the group did not become a side-project of the KLF. Because of these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name the <b>Orb.</b> As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as Space on KLF Communications. Also out of these sessions came the KLF album Chill Out, on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 the <b>Orb</b> {{performed}} with the Kakatsisi drummers of Ghana on the West Holts stage at Glastonbury Festival.|$|E
50|$|While Gil {{prepares to}} try to rescue Ki, Callindra {{explains}} the Chronos <b>Orbs.</b> Gil resolves to destroy the <b>orbs</b> to save Ki.|$|R
50|$|Zenyatta, {{full name}} Tekhartha Zenyatta, is an omnic monk and wanderer. Rather than moving on foot, he floats {{above the ground}} in a meditative pose. He is {{surrounded}} by a circle of floating metal <b>orbs</b> named the <b>Orbs</b> of Destruction (resembling prayer beads), which he can use to launch a form of energy to damage foes, either one at a time or through a charged-shot. He can also cast these <b>orbs</b> onto teammates as <b>Orbs</b> of Harmony to regenerate health, or onto enemies as <b>Orbs</b> of Discord that lower their defenses. His ultimate ability is Transcendence, which makes him temporarily invulnerable and applies massive regenerative effects to his allies in a large radius around him.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is set in}} the (then) futuristic year of 2004, when Earth {{has been}} enslaved by a race of aliens known as the <b>Orbs.</b> The <b>Orbs,</b> who look like giant {{floating}} eyeballs, have implanted all humans with global tracking devices, forced them to wear nondescript robes and forbid them from speaking or communicating. The protagonist has been assigned by the <b>Orbs</b> to track down fellow humans who are believed to be forming an underground resistance. Over the course of the game, the player discovers that the <b>Orbs</b> are not the benevolent rulers they claim to be; they are actually harvesting humans as a food source. The player then [...] "switches sides" [...] and works to overthrow the <b>Orbs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the universe using a mysterious <b>orb</b> that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the <b>orb</b> became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Orb</b> {{released}} the Metallic Spheres album in October 2010, featuring David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. It {{was released by}} Columbia Records.|$|E
5|$|Uppland {{was granted}} arms created for Gustav Vasa's funeral in 1560, and the royal <b>orb</b> symbolises spiritual and worldly power. Historically, Uppland ranked as a duchy and the {{coat of arms}} was {{represented}} with a ducal coronet. Despite the fact that Uppsala län has a different name and a smaller territory, it was granted the same coat of arms in 1940, but with a royal crown {{in place of the}} ducal crown of the landskap arms. Blazon: Gules, a royal <b>orb</b> Or.|$|E
50|$|Carceri has six layers, {{contained}} {{inside each}} other in a similar manner to the shells of a matryoshka doll. Each layer consists of a series of <b>orbs</b> floating in an infinite black void. Light is provided by the <b>orbs</b> only; as one progresses through the layer, the light diminishes, and the <b>orbs</b> are separated by larger and larger distances.|$|R
50|$|The Shield Recharge <b>Orbs</b> are two small, green, {{floating}} <b>orbs</b> that spin in a circle. They {{have the}} ability to recharge an object's or person's shield instantly.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the game}} world, the player finds chests colored green, blue, or red, and each chest {{contains}} <b>orbs</b> of the corresponding color. Green <b>orbs</b> replenish the player's health, blue <b>orbs</b> replenish magic allowing further usage, and red <b>orbs</b> provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic—allowing new, more powerful attacks—and replenishing the Rage meter, which, if full, {{allows for the}} usage of the Rage of the Gods ability. Red <b>orbs</b> are also collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. The player can also find Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers in unmarked chests. The Eyes and Feathers increase {{the length of the}} Health and Magic Meters, respectively; finding eighteen of an item maximizes a meter and in turn, the player's power.|$|R
5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey that hit <b>orb</b> webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the prey (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but {{would make it easier}} for potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between <b>orb</b> webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night. In fact, there is no simple relationship between <b>orb</b> web design features and the prey they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue <b>orb</b> to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red <b>orb</b> to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{recognition}} {{on their}} albums and concerts; his unauthorised {{use of other}} artists' works has led to disputes with musicians, most notably with Rickie Lee Jones. During their live shows of the 1990s, the <b>Orb</b> performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the <b>Orb</b> maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intense performances prompted critics to compare the group to Pink Floyd.|$|E
50|$|For example, if {{the player}} uses an all-Shu {{combination}} of forces, he would possess, {{and is able}} to utilise, a maximum of 12 mana <b>orbs.</b> In contrast, a player using a mixture of forces from Shu and Wei can only utilise 9 mana <b>orbs,</b> and a player using a mix of forces from three or more factions/countries can only utilise 6 mana <b>orbs.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{practice}} {{it is often}} necessary {{to carry out the}} analysis of systems, where there are multilayer objects and each layer has which it’s own properties. In the article the deformations and pressure inside a system consisting of arbitrary final quantity of thick-walled <b>orbs</b> are investigated. The relations of pres-sure on the limits of <b>orbs,</b> stress tensors and deformations inside <b>orbs</b> are obtaine...|$|R
5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked chests (white chests in Ascension), increase {{the maximum amount of}} health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red <b>orbs.</b> Green <b>orbs</b> replenish the player's health, blue <b>orbs</b> replenish magic allowing further usage, and red <b>orbs</b> provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage meter in God of War. Gold <b>orbs</b> found in God of War II and Ascension, and white <b>orbs</b> in God of War III, replenish the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red <b>orbs</b> can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored <b>orbs</b> when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|R
5|$|Peter Quill / Star-Lord and a {{group of}} misfits, {{including}} Gamora, Rocket, Drax the Destroyer and Groot, fight to keep a powerful <b>orb</b> from the clutches of the villainous Ronan.|$|E
5|$|The second-place {{finish in}} the Belmont earned Oxbow $200,000 and pushed him over the $1million mark in career earnings, making him the third horse in 2013 to reach $1million in purse wins, behind <b>Orb</b> and a fellow Awesome Again son, the six-year-old gelding Game On Dude. Although the $1million bonus for the horse winning the highest {{combined}} Triple Crown points has long been discontinued, Oxbow would have won it over <b>Orb</b> owing to his win in the Preakness and second in the Belmont. Further, his placing in the Belmont put him at {{number one in the}} post-Belmont June 10 NTRA poll of top three-year-olds, and in the top ten for race horses of all ages.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consistent}} {{relationship between}} the classification of spiders {{and the types of}} web they build: species in the same genus may build very similar or significantly different webs. Nor is there much correspondence between spiders' classification and the chemical composition of their silks. Convergent evolution in web construction, in other words use of similar techniques by remotely related species, is rampant. <b>Orb</b> web designs and the spinning behaviors that produce them are the best understood. The basic radial-then-spiral sequence visible in <b>orb</b> webs and the sense of direction required to build them may have been inherited from the common ancestors of most spider groups. However, the majority of spiders build non-orb webs. It used to be thought that the sticky <b>orb</b> web was an evolutionary innovation resulting in the diversification of the Orbiculariae. Now, however, it appears that non-orb spiders are a sub-group that evolved from orb-web spiders, and non-orb spiders have over 40% more species and are four times as abundant as orb-web spiders. Their greater success may be because sphecid wasps, which are often the dominant predators of spiders, much prefer to attack spiders that have flat webs.|$|E
50|$|Larger <b>orbs</b> {{tend to be}} {{used for}} aspects {{involving}} major bodies, such as the sun or moon. Larger <b>orbs</b> also tend {{to be used for}} major aspects, such as conjunctions and oppositions.|$|R
50|$|On 14 July 2008 at E3 2008 lead {{designer}} Peter Molyneux demonstrated 'Albion Orbs'. These <b>orbs</b> {{show where}} other players {{are in their}} worlds and allows bringing them into their world to co-op with. Only <b>orbs</b> for friends are initially viewable, with all players viewable if an in-game setting is changed. Online chat is automatically enabled between players that can see each other's <b>orbs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This version also {{exclusively}} {{features a}} revival system where if the player's health depletes, {{he or she}} can spend one [...] "life point" [...] to attempt to revive the fallen Spider-Man by using the Touch Screen to draw health <b>orbs</b> to him, while poking at poison <b>orbs</b> to destroy them. The revival will be successful if he receives enough health <b>orbs</b> before a time limit is reached.|$|R
5|$|In 1669, the Jewels went {{on public}} {{display in the}} Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a {{cupboard}} {{and showed it to}} visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and, with the help of three accomplices, stole a crown, a sceptre and an <b>orb.</b> They were apprehended at the perimeter, and the items were recovered, though some had been damaged: the crown was flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the <b>orb.</b> Blood was not only pardoned, but also given land and a pension. It has been suggested that he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.|$|E
5|$|Ronan {{arrives and}} easily defeats Drax, {{while the others}} flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's {{followers}} and Gamora's adoptive sister Nebula. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the <b>orb.</b> Quill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the <b>orb</b> to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the Dark Aster, Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.|$|E
5|$|The Lost Chronicles trilogy is a {{companion}} to the original Chronicles. Each book of the trilogy fills in sections of the story previously left untold. It tells the story surrounding {{the recovery of the}} Hammer of Kharas, how the Companions retrieve the dragon <b>orb</b> from Ice Wall, how Kitiara Uth Matar and Lord Soth became allies, and how Raistlin Majere took the Black Robes in Neraka.|$|E
50|$|Defensive <b>orbs</b> - This upgrade {{provides}} the ship with orb-like objects {{that can take}} hits unharmed. With each pickup, the number of <b>orbs</b> increases and they will start to rotate instead of being stationary.|$|R
50|$|<b>ORBs</b> {{handle the}} {{transformation}} of in-process data structures {{to and from the}} raw byte sequence, which is transmitted over the network. This is called marshalling or serialization. In addition to marshalling data, <b>ORBs</b> often expose many more features, such as distributed transactions, directory services or real-time scheduling. Some <b>ORBs,</b> such as CORBA-compliant systems, use an Interface Description Language (IDL) to describe the data that is to be transmitted on remote calls.|$|R
5000|$|Similar to the Super Smash Bros. series, up to {{four players}} battle on one of 11 dynamic stages in battles based around free-roaming {{two-dimensional}} character movement. Unlike other fighting games, D.O.N uses a [...] "tug-of-war" [...] fighting system. Attacking opponents will knock glowing <b>orbs</b> out of them for players to collect, with a bar {{at the top of}} the screen indicating what percentage of the <b>orbs</b> in play each character possesses; the size and value of these <b>orbs</b> vary depending on the strength of the attack used. Players who collect a majority of the <b>orbs</b> will enter [...] "burst mode", dramatically increasing their speed and attack power. To win a fight, a player must either collect all of the <b>orbs</b> in play, leaving their opponents with none, or possess the highest percentage of <b>orbs</b> when time runs out. As such, a fight can potentially last indefinitely if no time limit is set. Characters have access to a host of special moves and abilities, with certain characters being able to use temporary transformations to increase their strength.|$|R
