In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA's 50–40–90 Club for players who shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better on three-pointers, and 90% or better on free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number <b>of</b> <b>makes</b> in each category.|$|E
25|$|On 25 September, {{the second}} British {{round of the}} World Championship <b>of</b> <b>Makes</b> arrived for the Brands Hatch Six-Hours; it was run in a deluge which caused it to be stopped {{for an hour and}} it was {{eventually}} run over 103 laps – 269 miles – which Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass won at 97.696mph driving a Porsche 935/2 Turbo. The race totally dominated by the Stuttgart marque, the first five places going to Porsche 935 Turbos – a 934 Turbo was sixth with a Carrera seventh. A little relief came with the eighth-place BMW 320i, two more Porsches rounded out the first ten. In November, Brands Hatch took over the running of the annual Formula Ford Festival (which it still holds to this day) from Snetterton. This was won by Irishman Derek Daly in a Hawke DL17.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the realm}} of the internet, the scene during which Jasmine kisses Jafar in order to {{distract}} him from Aladdin is oftentimes viewed as a point of contention among feminist writers and bloggers; Meredith Ancret of The Snark Who Hunts Back argued that both the Sultan and Genie are similarly enslaved by Jafar. Ancret continued to defend Jasmine for being of her own mind, bravely defying Jafar on numerous occasions, and praised her distraction of the villain for being instrumental to Aladdin's success. Also defending Jasmine's decision to kiss Jafar, feminist critic Mari Rogers explained to The Daily Dot that [...] "Jasmine was a strong character and I think in many ways the story's focus on Aladdin sort <b>of</b> <b>makes</b> us forget this", concluding, [...] "Even in her own movie, she was always the force behind her decisions.

[...] Myrddin Gwynedd of The New Zealand Herald felt that Gaga's penchant for eccentric and provocative imagery, was extreme in the video. Raphael Chestang from Entertainment Tonight praised the performance of Gaga and her dancers in the video, also complimenting the fashion. Monica Herrera from Billboard noticed that the video bore similarities to the music video of Madonna's [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Borderline" [...] (1984), while believing it to be [...] "more of a high-fashion short film than a conventional music video".

Benhamin finished his review, concluding, [...] "It all sort <b>of</b> <b>makes</b> us want to twerk and throw our hands to heavens at the same time." [...] Brownie Marie of Christian Today praised Williams' vocal performance during the song's hook, along with the [...] "well-controlled riffs". She also wrote that Beyoncé is [...] "vocally subdued on the track, and truly lets Williams' voice receive the attention". Hayen Manders from Refinery29 felt that the song was Williams' [...] "turn to shine". In a more mixed review, Vulture columnist Lindsey Weber wrote that the song is not [...] "a total mess" [...] and that listeners might sing the praises in the song along with it.

Robbie Daw wrote that the video gave him [...] "chills". He also commented on the use of product placement of Carey's perfume M and her own brand of champagne. Melinda Newman of HitFix thought that the video appeared to have a bigger production budget than that of the video for [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] with Minaj, but noted that it was still [...] "low-key" [...] for a Carey video. Newman further commented that while the singer appears to be wearing albeit little make-up, she looked more natural and [...] "beautiful" [...] than ever. Leonie Cooper thought that the video made the [...] "bland" [...] song more appealing: [...] "the video, with a moist Mariah mithering in the rain, preposterous sequinned gold boots, a puppy in the studio, and shameless pimping of her latest perfume, kind <b>of</b> <b>makes</b> up for it." ...|$|E

In three {{games against the}} Memphis Grizzlies, Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls, Calderón provided 37 assists while committing only three turnovers. 14 games into the season, he was also leading the league in assist-to-turnover ratio with 5.67 to 1, but even so, he said: [...] "But how I feel about the team {{right now is that}} we need T.J.

He shot at least 50% on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws, and is sometimes listed {{as a member of the}} NBA's 50–40–90 Club, even though he was sixteen free-throws shy of attaining the [...] number <b>of</b> <b>makes</b> in this category. By mid-season, he was touted as a possibility for making the All-Star reserve team. Even after Ford returned from injury for the final third of the campaign, Calderón was able to keep his place in the starting lineup. Ford had initially agreed to playing backup, but reportedly became frustrated at not being able to start. Calderón eventually asked the coaching staff to play Ford as starter instead, leading to widespread praise from the coaching staff, teammates, and fans. Given that he was going to become a free agent by the end of the campaign, there were even calls for Ford to be traded so that the team could be built around Calderón as point guard. By the end of the regular season, Calderón was fifth in the league for assists per game, and in the 2008 NBA Playoffs, Ford split the playing time with him about equally, with the two players combining for averages of 23.4 points and 13.6 assists per game. However, the Raptors were eliminated by the Orlando Magic in the first round four games to one.|$|E
