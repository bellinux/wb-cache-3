Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more {{members of the new}} race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} blast, the {{soldiers}} {{said they were}} targeted by sniper fire, coming from woods {{on the other side}} of the border. The soldiers began firing back across the water. An uninvolved civilian Englishman, William Hudson, was killed by the soldiers' gunfire and his cousin Barry Hudson wounded. They had been birdwatching on an island opposite the castle. According to Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) researchers, the soldiers may have mistaken the sound of ammunition going off for enemy gunfire. However, two IRA members arrested by the Gardaí and suspected of being behind the ambush, Brendan Burns and Joe Brennan, had traces of gunsmoke residue <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> the motorbike they were riding on.|$|E
500|$|Like all primates, lemurs {{have five}} {{divergent}} digits with nails (in most cases) <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet. Most lemurs possess a laterally compressed, elongated nail, called a toilet-claw, {{on the second}} toe and use it for scratching and grooming. In addition to the toilet-claw, lemurs share {{a variety of other}} traits with other strepsirrhine primates, which include a rhinarium (or [...] "wet nose"); a fully functional vomeronasal organ, which detects pheromones; a postorbital bar and the lack of postorbital closure (a wall of thin bone behind the eye); orbits (bony sockets that enclose the eye) that are not fully facing forward; left and right mandible (lower jaw) bones that are not fully fused; and a small brain-to-body mass ratio.|$|E

5000|$|Special pujas will be {{conducted}} at temple at Thirumalai. The ritual begin after the devotees taking a holy-dip in the Thamirabharani river at Munchirai, the first Sivalayam. The participants wear saffron robes, hold a palm-leaf fan <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> chant the mantra [...] "Govinda... Gopaala..." [...] all through the whole day of running. The pilgrims receive the holy ashes, [...] "Thiruneer" [...] from all the eleven temples. The purpose for the pilgrimage {{is believed to be}} fulfilled only by receiving the Sandal-paste from the final Sankaranarayanar Temple at Thirunattalam. The objective of the pilgrimage is to uphold that Siva and Vishnu are both the manifestations of one supreme being.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea of the}} Guidonian hand is {{that each}} portion of the hand {{represents}} a specific note within the hexachord system, which spans nearly three octaves from [...] "Γ ut" [...] (that is, [...] "Gamma ut") (the contraction of which is [...] "Gamut", which can refer to the entire span) to [...] "E la" [...] (in other words, from the G {{at the bottom of}} the modern bass clef to the E at the top of the treble clef). In teaching, an instructor would indicate a series of notes by pointing to them <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> the students would sing them. This is similar to the system of hand signals sometimes used in conjunction with solfege.|$|R
500|$|Ranging {{in weight}} from the [...] mouse lemur to the [...] indri, lemurs share many common, basal primate traits, such as {{divergent}} digits <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet and nails instead of claws (in most species). However, their brain-to-body size ratio {{is smaller than}} that of anthropoid primates, and among many other traits they share with other strepsirrhine primates, they have a [...] "wet nose" [...] (rhinarium). Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Many lemur adaptations are in response to Madagascar's highly seasonal environment. Lemurs have relatively low basal metabolic rates and may exhibit seasonal breeding, dormancy (such as hibernation or torpor), or female social dominance. Most eat {{a wide variety of}} fruits and leaves, while some are specialists. Although many share similar diets, different species of lemur share the same forests by differentiating niches.|$|E
500|$|The Nazi {{influence}} behind Heiter {{led to the}} use {{of classical}} music when the doctor is [...] "training" [...] his centipede. The music was deliberately played at low quality to simulate the music coming from a loudspeaker, {{in much the same way}} as music was sometimes played in Nazi concentration camps. Many of the sound effects in The Human Centipede were created by manipulating meat. For example, the sound of a nose being broken was made by snapping bones within cuts of raw meat. Due to the discomfort of spending long periods <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees, the actors playing the centipede were given massages at the end of each day of filming. Yennie stated that she and Williams experienced jaw pain from holding a bit in their mouths during filming, but overall she did not feel that the physical side of filming had been excessively difficult.|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} the Australians {{commenced}} their advance south towards the village of Finschhafen, about [...] south of the landing beach, with the 2/15th Infantry Battalion leading {{the way to the}} Bumi River. The Japanese had established strong defences along the river's southern bank, which the Australians attempted to outflank by sending a force to the west, climbing through steep terrain. Once they had located a suitable place to cross the river, they began wading across but were fired upon by a group of Japanese naval infantry who were positioned on a high feature overlooking the river. Despite taking casualties, the Australians were able to establish themselves south of the Bumi and at that point the 2/13th Infantry Battalion began to advance on Finschhafen from the west. Meanwhile, the 2/15th attacked the left flank of the Japanese that had opposed their crossing. After advancing up the steep slope under fire, sometimes <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees, the 2/15th took the position at the point of the bayonet, killing 52 Japanese in close combat.|$|E

500|$|Jim Harrison of SoundSpike {{affirmed that}} the Harajuku Lovers Tour lacked a strong musical setlist, and {{also felt that}} Stefani's stage {{presence}} was absent.

Harrison felt that Stefani seemed truly [...] "lost on stage without a band", ultimately describing her performance as [...] " [...] energy", [...] "lukewarm" [...] and seemingly [...] "on autopilot". Furthermore, the SoundSpike writer thought that her performance was akin to that of fellow American recording artist Britney Spears, which was [...] "utterly unsuitable for both the song selection and her style". However, he did praise the rendition of [...] "Hollaback Girl", calling it [...] "great" [...] and [...] "Gwen being all Gwen can be", and called the breakdancing [...] "pretty cool".|$|E
500|$|Detectives {{from the}} King County Sheriff's Office and the Seattle Police Department grew {{increasingly}} concerned. There {{was no significant}} physical evidence, and the missing women had little in common, apart from being young, attractive, white college students with long hair parted in the middle. On June 1, Brenda Carol Ball, 22, disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in Burien, Washington, near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. She was last seen {{in the parking lot}} talking to a brown-haired man with his arm in a sling. In the early hours of June 11, UW student Georgann [...] Hawkins vanished while walking down a brightly lit alley between her boyfriend's dormitory residence and her sorority house. The next morning, three Seattle homicide detectives and a criminalist combed the entire alleyway <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees, finding nothing. After Hawkins's disappearance was publicized, witnesses came forward to report seeing a man that night in an alley behind a nearby dormitory, on crutches with a leg cast, struggling to carry a briefcase. One woman recalled that the man asked her to help him carry the case to his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
