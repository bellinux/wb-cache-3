High optical quality can be achieved and guaranteed when the manufacturing process is continuously monitored and adjusted in its essential steps.

Forty-eight undergraduate participants described target objects form ambiguous and unambiguous displays to a matcher partner. In ambiguous trials the target <b>object</b> (<b>computer</b> mouse) {{was presented in}} a display with a foil object (mammal mouse) that caused lexical ambiguity as the display contained two potential referents. In unambiguous trials the foil object was replaced with a filler object (apple). In order to avoid ambiguous descriptions in ambiguous trials participants had to avoid bare homophone responses (mouse) and produce modified homophone responses (computer mouse) when the display contained two potential referents. Participants completed this task after direct experience (having completed a similar task as a matcher), indirect experience (having watched a video of two people completing the task), or no prior experience of the task, using a between-participants design. Responses were coded as bare homophones or modified homophones and analysed using a mixed-model ANOVA.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for the calibration of biplanar radiography that makes possible performing 3 D reconstructions {{of the spine}} using conventional radiological systems. A novel approach is proposed in which a measuring device is used for determining focal distance and have a rough estimation of translation parameters. Using these data, 3 D reconstructions of the spine with correct scale were successfully obtained without the need of calibration objects, something that was not previously achieved. For superior results, two optional steps may be executed that involve an optimisation of the geometrical parameters, followed by a scale adjustment with a very simple calibration <b>object.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations with in vivo CT data show RMS 3 D reconstruction errors of 1. 9 mm when under the maximum expected variation of the geometrical parameters of the radiological system. Simulations also show that the 3 D spinal length may be accurately calculated, but with superior results when using optimisation and adjusting scale (RMS error of 2. 09 mm). In vitro experiments with a dried spine composed by 17 vertebrae show mean 3 D reconstructions errors of 1. 7 mm. We conclude that the proposed method is suitable for use in clinical environment, and that it compares favourably with previous calibration techniques...|$|E

40|$|A 3 -D {{reconstruction}} of the texture distribution of the subsoil in the Brescia plan region is presented. The area is located between the morainic amphitheatres of Iseo westward and of Garda eastward. It is characterised by fluvial and fluvioglacial deposits in which the texture sizes decrease southward. The thickness of the sedimentary bodies southward. According to geomorphological and pedological considerations, {{the age of the}} deposits below the surface is Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Using a water well data base TANGRAM, developed in the IDPA-CNR Milano, 415 well data are stored, georeferenced and their stratigraphic logs are translated into alphanumeric codes. Textural well data can be translated and imported into GOCAD (Geological <b>Object</b> <b>Computer</b> Aided Design), where a set of 3 -D special virtual objects is easily constructed. Two surfaces, topography (DTM) and aquifer bottom in the subsoil, are imported into GOCAD from a GIS. Between these two surfaces a 3 -D grid (SGrid) is reconstructed with 3 -D cells (Voxel). The wells are located on a DTM and are defined by marker levels which correspond to different stratigraphic layers. The percent of texture size Gravel, Sand and Silt-Clay is assigned to each stratigraphic layers of the wells. Using the three dimensional grid, these values are assigned to the nodes of the 3 -D grid and then processed. In this way, the distribution of texture is calculated for each voxel on the whole 3 -D volume of the subsoil...|$|E

Every year {{around the}} world various types of {{automobile}} accidents occur, out of which side impact vehicular collisions are the most severe. Of these, side crashes into fixed narrow objects like trees, poles account for quarter percent of total deaths and serious injuries. Moreover these side impacts present a difficult problem for improving automotive crashworthiness because of the limited crushable zone between the vehicle occupant and the intruding door structure. To improve the automotive safety in side impacts a new pole test has been proposed under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 214 to make the existing regulation more comprehensive in addressing the critical head and neck injuries in addition to thoracic and pelvis injuries. In this thesis, a finite element model of the Ford Taurus and Moving Deformable Barrier (MDB) as developed by National Crash Analysis Center (NCAC) {{has been used for}} the impact analysis. The US DOT-SID side impact dummy taken from MADYMO dummy database has been used as the vehicle occupant and the rigid pole modeled in MSC.

This research proposes a similar approach to point-based representation while making use of current graphics hardware to compare the benefits and drawbacks of using point-based representations over polygon-based representations in interactive environments.

Media used in teaching learning process are varied. However, the teachers should thoroughly familiarize subject area in which student are interested in. Student will be encouraged during this development phase to seek and use a variety of media relevant to their studies. The purposes of this study were to provide adequate answers to the questions concerning with the research, they were: (1) To know the teaching media used by teacher to teach verbal intermediate autistic student. (2) To know the teacher’s reasons for using the media to teach verbal intermediate autistic students. The subject of the study was the teacher in verbal intermediate autistic student in “Laboratorium Sekolah Autis” State University of Malang. The data were collected through observation and interview. Therefore, this study was descriptive qualitative research. The finding shows that the media used by the teachers were those used for normal student.

Image and Vision Computing, vol. 27, no. 6, pp. 725 - 747, 2009. 3 D {{modelling}} finds a {{wide range}} of applications in robot vision and reverse engineering. However due to the presence of surface scanning noise, accumulative registration errors, and improper data fusion, the reconstructed surfaces from multiple registered range images are often non-smooth and distorted with thick patches, false connections and blurred features. These shortcomings will limit the wide applications of 3 D modelling using the latest laser scanning systems. In this paper, the clustering approach, surface segmentation and classification are employed to fuse registered range images to reduce the adverse effect of large accumulative registration errors and heavy scanning noise, minimize the dissimilarity of the fused surface with respect to the original overlapping surfaces, and produce smooth and detailed 3 D <b>object</b> <b>computer</b> models. For initialization of the clustering approach, an automatic method is developed, shifting possible corresponding points from different viewpoints toward each other and thus, making sure that the initialization of the cluster centroids are in between the two data sets so that more efficient and effective integration of data can be obtained. Then the principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to segment these centroids into different areas for the representation of the initially fused surface and then the tensor analysis is applied to classify these areas into featured and non-featured ones. In the integration process, the K means and fuzzy c means clustering approaches from the pattern recognition and machine learning literatures are employed to integrate non-featured areas for a smooth fused surface and featured areas for keeping the geometric details. By controlling a parameter, the final integrated surface can be traded off between smoothness and geometric details. Finally the fused point set is triangulated using an improved Delaunay method, guaranteeing a watertight surface. The new method is theoretically guaranteed to converge and minimize the dissimilarity between the final fused surface and original surfaces. A comparative study based on real images shows that the proposed algorithm desirably retains geometric details, produces smooth surface and minimizes the integration error. Peer reviewe...|$|E
