5|$|Past Route 23 and County Route 504, U.S. Route 202 heads {{north on}} Black Oak Ridge Road, a county {{maintained}} road that heads through residential neighborhoods. The road {{comes to an}} intersection with County Route 689 (Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike), where U.S. Route 202 merges <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> road, forming a concurrency. The Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike heads north past some businesses, running a short distance {{to the east of}} the Ramapo River, before coming to Terhune Drive, where U.S. Route 202 makes a right turn <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> road with County Route 689 continuing north on Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike. Terhune Drive carries U.S. Route 202 north through wooded neighborhoods, running in between Pines Lake to the east and Pompton Lake, {{which is part of the}} Ramapo River, to the west.|$|E
5|$|Route172 {{originated}} as {{alignment of}} State Highway Route S-28, which was assigned in the 1927 state highway renumbering. In the 1953 renumbering, State Highway Route S-28 was reassigned as Route18. However, {{just a few}} years after the designation of NJ 18 in New Brunswick along George Street, construction of a bypass around New Brunswick began. The highway was constructed along Burnet Street, which became state-maintained by the State Highway Department. The route was completed to Route27, and Route18 was moved <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> alignment. The former alignment of Route18 remained state-maintained up to the intersection with Commercial Avenue, which was eventually re-designated as Route172.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after CR 557 joins US 40, {{the road}} enters Buena, Atlantic County and {{continues}} southeast into inhabited areas. After {{running through the}} commercial center of town, the road comes to the southern terminus of Route 54 and {{the eastern end of}} CR 619 in a business area located on the outskirts. At this point, it enters Buena Vista Township, and CR 557 splits form US 40 by heading to the southeast on Buena-Tuckahoe Road. From this point, US 40 becomes concurrent with CR 557 Truck and enters dense woodland containing homes and businesses as well as occasional farms. The road reaches the residential community of Richland, where it encounters the eastern terminus of CR 540 and CR 622 and crosses a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line. Upon leaving Richland, the route crosses into Hamilton Township, where it runs through Mizpah before heading back into forested areas and a few residential sectors. US 40 intersects the eastern terminus of CR 552, briefly becoming a divided highway before turning east into denser inhabited areas. The highway intersects CR 559 Truck/CR 606, at which point it becomes concurrent with CR 559 Truck. The route meets Route 50, where CR 557 Truck splits to the south. Route 50 joins US 40 before the road crosses the Great Egg Harbor River. Upon crossing the river, the road enters Mays Landing and turns north into the downtown area. CR 559 Truck splits southbound to follow CR 617 to the east. A short distance later, the road meets CR 559 and US 40 splits from Route 50 by turning east <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> route. This intersection marks the beginning of CR 559 Truck northbound. The road passes more development before CR 559 splits from the road by heading southeast. US 40 heads east out of Mays Landing, where it continues through woodland and increasing residential development. The road widens into four lanes as it comes to US 322 (Black Horse Pike) near the Hamilton Mall. At this point, US 40 forms a concurrency with US 322, which lasts {{for the remainder of the}} route.|$|E

25|$|The former routing of Highway513 {{is today}} known as Scotch Bush Road and Hyndford Road. It {{travelled}} northeast {{from the middle}} of Dacre, meandering alongside Constant Creek until it crossed it at the hamlet of Balaclava. The route continued wandering north to the east of Constant Lake, eventually straightening out at Watson Road before encountering the hamlet of Scotch Bush. It continued straight until reaching what is now Renfrew County Road22 (Hyndford Road) at the hamlet of Hyndford. There, the designation turned east <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> road and followed it for several kilometres, ending inconspicuously at the boundary of the former townships of Gratton and Admaston, a few kilometres sotuhwest of Douglas.|$|E

The route passes more homes as it turns northwest and passes through the community of Amityville. Past Amityville, PA 662 enters more agricultural surroundings with a few residences. In Yellow House, the road crosses PA 562 and enters Oley Township, where the name of the road becomes Memorial Highway. The route heads north-northwest through farmland before reaching an intersection with PA 73 {{in the community of}} Oley. At this point, PA 662 forms a concurrency with PA 73 by turning northwest <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> road. The two routes pass a few businesses in Oley before heading into areas of farms and woods.|$|E

Just north of the interchange, MD 414 intersects Bedford Way, which is the western end of MD 967A, which includes a segment of Old Branch Avenue that parallels MD 5 to the southeast. The highway continues into Silver Hill, where the highway intersects MD 458 (Silver Hill Road). Just north of the intersection, MD 414 curves west as two-lane Old Silver Hill Road and passes the Paul E.

25|$|Marie de Romieu’s {{discourse}} is closely based {{on part of}} a 1554 work by Charles Estienne, titled Paradoxes, which are notions contrary to the common opinion. Estienne’s work, in turn, was itself based on Paradoxes, a work by Italian humanist author Ortensio Lando. Lando’s piece was mainly a list of “exemplary ladies”, while Estienne builds <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> by omitting some Italian names and adding some French ladies to it. De Romieu, however, took it further. She follows Estienne’s prose, adding women she thought were deserving of praise. She paid {{special attention to the}} role of educated women, especially her contemporary female poets, praising in her Discourse other French female writers, such as Catherine de Clermont, Marguerite de Navarre, and Madeleine and Catherine des Roches. Notably, she removed the names of women who were entirely devoted to serving their husbands, as well as women who attempted to hide their accomplishments from public view.|$|E
25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> show.|$|E
25|$|In total, {{around four}} hundred dummies were {{planned to be}} dropped {{as part of the}} operation. Titanic I {{simulated}} the drop of an airborne division north of the Seine river; near Yvetot, Yerville, Doudeville in the Seine-Maritime region and Fauville in the Eure region. Two hundred dummies and two SAS teams were parachuted in across these four Titanic I targets. Titanic II would have involved dropping fifty dummies east of the Dives River to draw German reserves <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> side of the river. However, this segment of the operation was cancelled just before 6 June. A further fifty dummies were dropped, under Titanic III, in the Calvados region near Maltot and the woods to the north of Baron-sur-Odon to draw German reserves away to the west of Caen. Finally, Titanic IV involved two hundred dummies dropped near Marigny in the Manche, as with Titanic I the intention was to simulate the dropping of an airborne division. Two SAS teams were also dropped near Saint-Lô. This group commanded by Captain Fowles and Lieutenant Poole landed at 00:20 on 6 June 1944, 10 minutes ahead of schedule. To deceive the Germans into thinking there was a large parachute landing in progress, the SAS teams played 30 minute pre-recorded sounds of men shouting and weapons fire including mortars.|$|E

25|$|San Pedro Cholula is a {{municipality}} in the Mexican {{state of}} Puebla {{and one of}} two municipalities which made up the city of Cholula. The city has been divided into two sections since the pre Hispanic era, when revolting Toltec-Chichimecas pushed the formerly dominant Olmec-Xicallanca to {{the eastern side of}} the city in the 13th century. The new lords called themselves Cholutecas and built a new temple to Quetzalcoatl on the San Pedro side, which eventually eclipsed the formerly prominent Great Pyramid of Cholula, now on the San Andrés side. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the city of Cholula was an important religious and economic center, but the center of power was on the San Pedro side, centered on what is now the main city plaza and the San Gabriel monastery. The division of the city persisted and San Pedro remained the more dominant, with Spanish families moving <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> side and the rest of the population quickly becoming mestizo. Today, San Pedro is still more commercial and less residential than neighboring San Andrés with most of its population employed in industry, commerce and services rather than agriculture. Although Cholula's main tourist attraction, the Pyramid, is in San Andrés, San Pedro has more tourism infrastructure such as hotels, restaurants and bars.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the Indiana Railroad {{was able}} to interchange passengers and considerable freight with the very busy Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban in Ohio, but the financially very weak Dayton and Western interurban was the essential rail link between the two companies. The 53 mile D tied into IR tracks at its west end at Richmond, Indiana, and into C tracks at its eastern end at Dayton, Ohio. The D connection allowed the IR to ship freight from Indiana to Dayton, and from there on the C north to Toledo and Cleveland, south to Cincinnati, and east to Columbus. Like many interurbans, the Dayton and Western struggled financially into the 1930s. Its track ran adjacent to the new U.S. Route 40 highway between Richmond and Dayton, and as the 1920s passed, the Dayton and Western crews apprehensively watched {{as more and more}} of their business moved <b>onto</b> <b>that</b> highway in the form of cars, trucks, and buses. From 1931 to 1933, the Cincinnati & Lake Erie leased the D to prop it up, and later in 1936, the IR took over the lease, but in May 1937 it had to drop the lease for lack of funds. Thus the D was forced to abandon operations. The resulting loss of revenue business to Ohio wounded the IR. In the good national economy of the early 1920s, the Terre Haute, Indianapolis, & Eastern (the predecessor to the IR on the Indianapolis to Richmond route) had combined with the D to run well-patronized express passenger interurbans and to interchange considerable freight the entire 108 miles between Dayton and Indianapolis, but those good days were over by the late 1920s.|$|E

500|$|When the new {{alignment}} for US27 {{was opened}} in early 1949, M-18 was re-extended north from Prudenville to Roscommon, where it turned northwesterly with M-76 to end at US27 south of Grayling.

The southern terminus was moved north about a mile (1.6km) to the new US10 freeway, and the northern terminus was also shifted north about a mile to the new I-75/US27 freeway.
