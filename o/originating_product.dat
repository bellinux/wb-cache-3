40|$|SummaryPhenazine-type {{metabolites}} {{arise from}} either phenazine- 1 -carboxylic acid (PCA) or phenazine- 1, 6 -dicarboxylic acid (PDC). Although the biosynthesis of PCA has been studied extensively, PDC assembly remains unclear. Esmeraldins and saphenamycin, the PDC <b>originated</b> <b>products,</b> are antimicrobial and antitumor metabolites isolated from Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 2706. Herein, the esmeraldin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified on a dispensable giant plasmid. Twenty-four putative esm genes {{were characterized by}} bioinformatics, mutagenesis, genetic complementation, and functional protein expressions. Unlike enzymes involved in PCA biosynthesis, EsmA 1 and EsmA 2 together decisively promoted the PDC yield. The resulting PDC underwent a series of conversions to give 6 -acetylphenazine- 1 -carboxylic acid, saphenic acid, and saphenamycin through a unique one-carbon extension by EsmB 1 –B 5, a keto reduction by EsmC, and an esterification by EsmD 1 –D 3, the atypical polyketide sythases, respectively. Two transcriptional regulators, EsmT 1 and EsmT 2, are required for esmeraldin production...|$|R

The wide segmentation that currently exists in the market will vary with the growth of production and consumption and price tendencies will correspond with it. Tilapia has been catalogued as the fish of the new millennium. Observers of this industry assert that <b>originated</b> <b>products</b> of this species will conduct the white fillet in the United States (US) market.

40|$|The present work {{evaluates the}} effect of drying {{treatments}} such as convective air drying and freeze-drying on the chemical properties (mois- ture contents, fi bre, ash, vitamin C and sugars), antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.). The trials in the convective chamber were done at 40 ºC and 60 ºC, in the drying tunnel were done at 60 ºC and in the freeze dryer were done at - 50 ºC. From the results obtained {{it was possible to}} verify that all drying treatments affected the chemical composition of pumpkin in terms of fi bre, ash, vitamin C and sugars. Furthermore, the freeze drying <b>originated</b> <b>products</b> with less reduction in sugars, but with a higher degree of degrada- tion of fi bre and vitamin C. With respect to antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds it is possible to conclude that the different dried products are quite similar and do not reveal important differences when compared to the fresh product...|$|R

40|$|In Hungary, {{organic food}} market has both demand and supply {{oriented}} aspects: several times not necessary products are distributed, while {{the selection and}} volume of certain products are not satisfactory. Thus, {{our aim was to}} develop a coordinated benchmark strategy to increase the trade of organic products. To get more details on the Hungarian organic milk market, we conducted professional deep interviews and simultaneously applied the “mystery shopping” method. Nowadays, the market of organic milk and dairy products is slowly increasing in Hungary, however, there is no available statistical data. In the selection there are mostly Hungarian <b>originated</b> <b>products,</b> but some yoghurt, milk, and butter assortments are imported. Partial responsibility belongs to small sale shops’ habit of risk-avoidance. Without a proper selection of products, stores are unable to satisfy consumers’ needs; thus they focus on pushing certain products to increase demand. According to our results, ‘low price category’, ‘local/regional product’, and ‘prestige product’ strategies with attached in-store marketing elements are able to reverse the effects of an unfavourable marketing process...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Surgical site {{infection}} {{remains a}} challenge for hospital infection control, especially when it relates to skin antisepsis in the surgical site. Objective. To analyze the antimicrobial activity in vivo of an antiseptic from ethanol crude extracts of P. granatum and E. uniflora against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Methods. Agar drilling and minimal inhibitory tests were conducted for in vitro evaluation. In the in vivo bioassay were used Wistar rats and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990). Statistical analysis was performed through variance analysis and Scott-Knott cluster test at 5 % probability and significance level. Results. In the in vitro, ethanolic extracts of Punica granatum and Eugenia uniflora and their combination showed the best antimicrobial potential against S. epidermidis and S. aureus. In the in vivo bioassay against S. epidermidis, there was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the tested product and the patterns used after five minutes of applying the product. Conclusion. The results indicate that the <b>originated</b> <b>product</b> is an antiseptic alternative source against S. epidermidis compared to chlorhexidine gluconate. It is suggested that further researches are to be conducted in different concentrations of the test product, evaluating its effectiveness and operational costs...|$|R
