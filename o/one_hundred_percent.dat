5|$|In Malaysia, {{large areas}} of {{rainforest}} were felled {{to make way for}} oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the barn owl population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished. The provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw almost <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>percent</b> occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest barn owl populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of barn owls in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although barn owl numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.|$|E

25|$|Efficiency, like resolution, can be {{expressed}} in absolute or relative terms. The same units are used (i.e., percentages); therefore, the spectroscopist must take care to determine which kind of efficiency is being given for the detector. Absolute efficiency values represent {{the probability that a}} gamma ray of a specified energy passing through the detector will interact and be detected. Relative efficiency values are often used for germanium detectors, and compare the efficiency of the detector at 1332keV to that of a 3in×3in NaI detector (i.e., 1.2×10 −3cps/Bq at 25cm). Relative efficiency values greater than <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>percent</b> can therefore be encountered when working with very large germanium detectors.|$|E
40|$|The less generous {{insurance}} coverage {{for mental health}} care has generated some controversy. The major unresolved question is how the demand for outpatient mental health care responds to cost sharing. We used data from a randomized trial of fee-for-service health insurance for the nonelderly to address this question. The study enrolled 5809 persons. The results are based on 19 819 person-years of data. <b>One</b> <b>hundred</b> thirty-three <b>percent</b> more is spent on outpatient psychotherapy when care is free to patients than when they pay 95 % of the fee, subject to an annual catastrophic limit. But, the absolute level of expenditure is low on all plans; $ 32 per person per year with free care. The response to psychotherapy services to cost sharing is insignificantly larger than that for outpatient general medical services. We {{found no evidence that}} more generous coverage for outpatient psychotherapy decreases total health expenditures...|$|R

40|$|Young {{children}} without {{the ability to}} speak may become easily frustrated, because {{they are unable to}} communicate their wants and needs. Sign language is one solution for {{children without}} a spoken language to be able to communicate by advancing their natural abilities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the use of sign language in early childhood classrooms (infants through pre-kindergarten) in west central Wisconsin. A cover letter and a 14 question survey was sent to 156 early childhood teachers in west central Wisconsin. The use of an online survey tool, Qualtrics, was deemed the most efficient and effective measure to reach the desired sample. The sample had three weeks to complete the survey. Of the 156 surveys sent, 48 responded, resulting in a 31 % response rate. Survey results showed that 75 % of teachers in west central Wisconsin use sign language in their classrooms and the number of signs that children know varied from 0 to 26 or more. <b>One</b> 3 <b>hundred</b> <b>percent</b> of the participants who answered felt that sign language has made a positive different in their classroom. Lastly, early childhood teachers would like to know more about sign language use within their classroom. Recommendations suggested by this researcher include adding more extensive demographic information as well as understanding different strategies for including sign language in classrooms such as Deaf or fluent signing teachers or using a naturalistic method. ...|$|R

Additionally the best ten finishes at the nationals plus the Grand Nationals (making it eleven races) would count toward the pros eligibility to contend for the Pro #1 plate. Purse money would be distributed not only among the racers who made the main, but also those who got to the semis or even didn't make it that far, so practically every one got something for racing, {{even if it was}} just a <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>percent</b> payback on their entrance fee.|$|E

40|$|Criminal law {{scholars}} regularly {{maintain that}} American prisons are overcrowded and that defendants in custody wait {{long periods of}} time before having their cases brought to trial. A similar refrain is made of the penal process in India – the world’s largest democracy, an ally of the United States, and a country with a judiciary that has drawn upon American criminal procedure law. In fact, the situation in India is thought to be much worse. Accounts of prisoners languishing behind bars for several years – and sometimes decades – awaiting their day in court are not uncommon. And many Indian prisons are <b>one</b> hundred-to-two <b>hundred</b> <b>percent</b> over-capacity, where conditions are squalid and weaker inmates face serious physical harm. In this study, we examine {{the current state of the}} Indian criminal justice system. Beginning in 1979, the Indian Supreme Court, referencing the American Constitution’s Sixth Amendment, held that defendants had a fundamental right to a speedy trial. We examine the evolution of the Indian jurisprudence on this matter, which has been quite favorable for defendants, but then move beyond this line of inquiry by empirically evaluating whether the positive court rulings have translated into tangible changes for the criminally-accused. As our findings suggest, there exists a major gap in India between these encouraging judicial pronouncements and how this right plays-out in reality, which we believe provides an important perspective for comparative and criminal law scholars...|$|R

500|$|Because of women's {{expanded}} {{roles in}} the workforce have generally not been accompanied by any relaxation of expectations for their family and domestic activities, many women today face the [...] "double burden" [...] of home and work responsibilities. Women take on the largest portion of the domestic obligations of the home, {{even when they are}} working full-time jobs. This breeds anger and frustration, as women know they do the majority of the housework on top of their careers. There have been said to be more reasons, other than gender roles, as to why there is a difference in the housework performed by men and women. Some theories have suggested that women's expectations for household cleanliness are higher than men's. Women feel like they must be responsible for the condition of the home in a way that men do not. Men do invest most of their time in their careers, but women spend double that time caring for the children, state of the home and taking care of the domestic responsibilities. In a graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2004, that compare the workload of married men and {{women between the ages of}} 25-54, women are displayed as performing <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>percent</b> more housework than men, and men are displayed as having more leisure time than women. As the double burden increased in 1980, women became more critical of their marriages than men and wanted the men to do more around the house to ease the burden of a second shift. The double burden of women who have jobs and still shoulder the majority of the housework at home leads to women filing or initiating divorce.|$|E
