The scalp {{is rarely}} {{affected}} by a condition known as lichen planopilaris, acuminatus, follicular lichen planus, and peripilaris, characterised by violaceous, adherent follicular scale with progressive scarring alopecia. While lichen planus and lichen planopilaris may occur together, aside from sharing the term ‘lichen’ and revealing inflammation on skin biopsy, there is neither established data on their co-occurrence nor data to suggest a common etiology. Lichen planopilaris is considered an <b>orphan</b> <b>disease</b> with no definitive prevalence data and no proven effective treatments.|$|E
25|$|ITP {{is usually}} chronic in adults and the {{probability}} of durable remission is 2040 percent. The male to female ratio in the adult group varies from 1:1.2 to 1.7 in most age ranges (childhood cases are roughly equal for both genders) and {{the median age of}} adults at the diagnosis is 5660. The ratio between male and female adult cases tends to widen with age. In the United States, the adult chronic population is thought to be approximately 60,000with women outnumbering men approximately 2 to 1, which has resulted in ITP being designated an <b>orphan</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

25|$|The best {{treatment}} for cutaneous leishmaniasis is not known. Treatments {{that work for}} one species of leishmania may not work for another; {{it is recommended that}} advice of a tropical medicine or geographical medicine specialist be sought. Ideally, every effort should be made to establish the species of leishmania by molecular techniques (PCR) prior to starting treatment. In the setting of a developing country, there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection. Unfortunately, leishmaniasis is an <b>orphan</b> <b>disease</b> in developed nations, and almost all the current treatment options are toxic with significant side effects. The most sound {{treatment for}} cutaneous leishmaniasis thus far is prevention.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>orphan</b> <b>diseases</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} that individually affect small numbers of patients but cumulatively affect ∼ 6 %– 10 % of the European and United States populations.

These included the low number of new medicines seen as innovative alongside increasing requested prices for their reimbursement, especially for oncology, <b>orphan</b> <b>diseases,</b> diabetes and HCV. Proposed models center on the three pillars of pre-, peri- and post-launch including critical drug evaluation, as well as multi-criteria models for valuing medicines for <b>orphan</b> <b>diseases</b> alongside potentially capping pharmaceutical expenditure.
