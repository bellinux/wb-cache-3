Preckwinkle has also been proactive in the effort to pursue compensation for victims <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> in the Jon Burge cases and sought hearings on the initial special prosecutor's report. She has been a critic of the decades-long delay in settling the case, and she was a proponent of the settlement.|$|E
5|$|Jerry McAfee {{served as}} {{president}} of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP until 2015, at which point Levy-Pounds decided to run. She won the election unopposed on the ballot but faced criticism from McAfee who contended that she was too focused on issues <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> to the neglect of concerns such as crime perpetrated against African Americans by African Americans. Levy-Pounds stated that she hoped to increase youth engagement with the NAACP during her term with the organization. She has been critical of racial disparities in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region, citing them as some of the nation's worst.|$|E
5|$|Mandela {{obtained}} work as {{an attorney}} for the firm Terblanche and Briggish, before moving to the liberal-run Helman and Michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney. In August 1953, Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg. The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality.</b> Disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate to a remote location after their office permit was removed under the Group Areas Act; as a result, their clientele dwindled. As a lawyer of aristocratic heritage, Mandela was part of Johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded much respect from the black community. Although a second daughter, Makaziwe Phumia, was born in May 1954, Mandela's relationship with Evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. He may have had affairs with ANC member Lillian Ngoyi and secretary Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to Mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child. Disgusted by her son's behaviour, Nosekeni returned to Transkei, while Evelyn embraced the Jehovah's Witnesses and rejected Mandela's preoccupation with politics.|$|E

25|$|On the whole, {{incidents}} <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> in Germany {{appear to}} be caused by racism and xenophobic attitudes towards foreign nationals, and occurs predominantly during arrests and in custody. Whilst Germany may be sensitive towards its history in implementing policing practices, this hasn't appeared to stop international bodies from identifying a clear pattern of police ill-treatment to foreigners and members of ethnic minorities. Every year, around 2,000 complaints <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> are reported, with the figure most likely being a less than accurate representation given that not every incident is reported. As high profile cases like the Cologne New Years Eve incident become more prevalent, racist and xenophobic attitudes have been reflected in instances <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality.</b> Whilst this incident occurred in 2014, high profile cases <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> have been reported to occur {{as far back as the}} 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Incidents <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> in Austria seem to {{be largely}} {{influenced}} and triggered by racism and prejudice against foreign nationals and ethnic minorities within the community. This underlying issue has continued to be present and relevant when examining cases <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> within Austria. For example, in Vienna there tends to be an association made between Vienna's drug problem and the city's African migrants. This {{has led to the}} existence of negative cultural stereotypes which have then led to the racial profiling of African migrants, due to the negative associations with their ethnicity.|$|E

25|$|There {{have also}} been {{suggestions}} of institutionalised racism within the Portuguese police force, with activists claiming that discrimination is the deep-rooted cause <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> in Portugal.

25|$|Incidents <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> seem {{to still}} be {{occurring}} at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>brutality.</b> Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do. On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E
25|$|This {{change can}} also been {{seen through the}} {{increased}} trust within the Polish police.
