40|$|Background: There are few data on co-occurring with bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} diseases {{but there is}} no single point of view on their mutual effect. Objective : Our aim was to learn the structure and frequency of extrapulmonary disease, concomitant of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, in children aged up to 3 years. Methods. A retrospective analysis of histories of 93 children with {{bronchopulmonary dysplasia}} with an analysis of the consequences of perinatal pathology structure was carried out. Results. On average, each patient with bronchopulmonary dysplasia accounted for 5 comorbidities. The most common (89; 96 %) were perinatal lesions of the nervous system and their consequences.  In children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia at the age of 3 years there was a relatively low incidence of hydrocephalus and, on the contrary, high — of infantile cerebral palsy. Violations <b>of</b> the <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> were found in 58 (62 %) children, malnutrition and other violations of physical development — in 58 (62 %) and 27 (29 %), respectively, and the cardiovascular system pathology — in 59 (63 %).
