40|$|Literature on {{optical and}} {{infrared}} microvariability in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) reflects {{a diversity of}} statistical tests and strategies to detect tiny variations in the lightcurves of these sources. Comparison between the results obtained using different methodologies is difficult, and {{the pros and cons}} of each statistical method are often badly understood or even ignored. Even worse, not properly tested methodologies are becoming more and more common, and biased results may be misleading to realize the origin of the AGN microvariability. This paper intends to point future research on AGN microvariability to the use of powerful and well tested statistical methodologies, providing a reference for choosing the best strategy to obtain unbiased results. Lightcurves monitoring have been simulated for quasars, reference and comparison stars. Changes for the quasar lightcurves include both Gaussian fluctuations and linear variations.

A total sample of 709 participants, 324 women and 385 men, aged 13 - 19 years participated in this study. A quantitative approach with a descriptive and transversal survey design was used. All the participants completed the Physical Self-Description Questionnaire.

However, in the body fat and appearance subscales statistically significant differences were not found because of the differences between men and women in their perception of their physical self-concept, these findings suggest that in order to design any intervention for improving the perceived physical self-concept of the students, the variable gender should be taken into account...|$|R
