5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, the only <b>option</b> <b>was</b> {{to record the}} music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the CRS {{proposed}} four options: Option 1 was {{to continue}} the VH-71 program with Increment I and II versions; the additional cost was estimated at $10billion and the entry into service date was 2019. Option 2 was to restructure the program to provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an additional cost of $6.4billion and would be operational by 2012. Option 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the additional cost for this <b>option</b> <b>was</b> estimated at $5.6billion and the entry into service by 2012. The last <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to upgrade and extend life of current fleet {{at a cost of}} $1.4billion; however this would not meet the standards required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.|$|E
5|$|The Watten bunker {{was to be}} {{built to}} a design based on the B.III-2a bunker, though {{substantially}} larger. The Germans had originally planned to build a separate LOX plant at Stenay but this <b>option</b> <b>was</b> abandoned in favour of installing a LOX production facility within the Watten bunker.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} spreads in which unequal number of <b>options</b> <b>are</b> {{simultaneously}} purchased and written. When more <b>options</b> <b>are</b> written than purchased, it is a ratio spread. When more <b>options</b> <b>are</b> purchased than written, it is a backspread.|$|R
50|$|A stock <b>option</b> <b>is</b> a {{class of}} option. Specifically, a call <b>option</b> <b>is</b> the right (not obligation) to buy stock in the future at a fixed price and a put <b>option</b> <b>is</b> the right (not obligation) to sell stock in the future at a fixed price. Thus, {{the value of a}} stock option changes in {{reaction}} to the underlying stock of which it is a derivative. The most popular method of valuing stock <b>options</b> <b>is</b> the Black Scholes model. Apart from call options granted to employees, most stock <b>options</b> <b>are</b> transferable.|$|R
50|$|An <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{the right}} to convey a piece of property.

5|$|The two-player <b>option</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} by then-current games Populous and Stunt Car Racer. DMA Design initially {{wanted to use}} a null-modem connection between two machines to allow competitive play, but ended up using {{the ability of the}} Amiga to have two mouse pointer devices usable {{at the same time and}} thus created the split-screen mode.|$|E
5|$|A last <b>option</b> <b>was</b> {{to attack}} fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were within range of escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories further north in daylight. Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|After the Finance Committee vote on October 15, {{negotiations}} {{turned to}} moderate Democrats. Majority leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying centrists. The holdouts {{came down to}} Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and conservative Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson. Lieberman's demand that the bill not include a public <b>option</b> <b>was</b> met, although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.|$|E

5|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to {{relocate}} to Anaheim, in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated {{they were willing to}} negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which would make the media market small and limit revenue.|$|E
5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force. The <b>option</b> <b>was</b> cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|BK Chicken Fries are breaded {{and fried}} chicken strips, and were {{available}} in three sizes during their initial availability period: six-, nine-, and twelve-piece servings. Three and thirty-six-piece sizes were available as limited time offers (LTO). The smaller size was sold à la carte, while larger portion could be purchased as a meal option. While its core audience was adults such as soccer moms or commuters, a children's meal <b>option</b> <b>was</b> at one time available U.S. that included a six-piece order of the product. The 2014 reissued product was only available in a nine-piece serving, at a recommended price point of USD $2.89.|$|E
40|$|The {{trouble with}} <b>options</b> <b>is</b> {{that too many}} <b>options</b> <b>are</b> granted to too many people. Most <b>options</b> <b>are</b> granted below the top-executive level, and <b>options</b> <b>are</b> often an inefficient way to attract, retain and motivate {{executives}} and (especially) lower-level employees. Why, then, <b>are</b> <b>options</b> so prevalent? We discuss several explanations including changes in corporate governance, reporting requirements, taxes, the bull market and managerial rent-seeking. We also offer an alternative hypothesis that we believe explains the over-use of options and several apparent puzzles: boards and managers falsely perceive stock <b>options</b> to <b>be</b> inexpensive because of accounting and cash-flow considerations. ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>options</b> <b>are</b> often {{considered}} a correlation trade since {{the value of}} the <b>option</b> <b>is</b> sensitive to the correlation between the various basket components.|$|R
30|$|A {{currency}} <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{a contract}} that gives the holder {{the right to buy}} or sell a certain amount of foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate (exercise price) upon exercise of the <b>option.</b> American <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>options</b> that can <b>be</b> exercised at any time before they expire. European <b>options</b> can <b>be</b> exercised only during a specified period immediately before expiration.|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked his {{officers}} whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the backroads to attack Princeton. Although the idea had already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton was indeed possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, they agreed that the best <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to attack Princeton.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} {{there was no immediate}} prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War but there was an immediate need for new vehicles. In the longer term, the army was expected to need at least 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the only <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E

50|$|<b>Options</b> {{contracts}} have <b>been</b> {{known for}} many centuries. However, both trading activity and academic interest increased when, as from 1973, <b>options</b> <b>were</b> issued with standardized terms and traded through a guaranteed clearing {{house at the}} Chicago Board Options Exchange. Today, many <b>options</b> <b>are</b> created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated options exchanges, while other over-the-counter <b>options</b> <b>are</b> written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, {{one or both of}} which may be a dealer or market-maker. <b>Options</b> <b>are</b> part of a larger class of financial instruments known as derivative products or simply derivatives.|$|R

5|$|In 1992, RIDOT {{reviewed}} {{plans for}} an eastern extension of Route 37. The department conducted planning studies on two proposed freeway alignments that would extend Route 37 into Downtown Warwick. The first proposal continued the freeway southeast from US 1 to Airport Road for , while the second proposal extended the freeway east for , intersecting Route 117 and Route 117A {{in the village of}} Hoxsie before terminating at Route 117 (West Shore Road). The first <b>option</b> <b>was</b> ultimately dropped by RIDOT after studies indicated the routing would interfere with aviation traffic at T. F. Green Airport. The freeway extension to Route 117, however, remains on RIDOT's long-term plans.|$|E
5|$|In late 1990 {{consideration}} {{was given}} to deploying a squadron of F/A-18s to the Middle East {{as part of an}} expanded Australian contribution to the Gulf War. The Department of Defence opposed dispatching the aircraft on the grounds that doing so would greatly strain the fighter force in Australia, and this <b>option</b> <b>was</b> not adopted by the government. As a result, the Hornets' only role in the war was to support the training of the Royal Australian Navy warships which were sent to the Gulf by conducting mock attacks on the vessels as they sailed from Sydney to Perth.|$|E
