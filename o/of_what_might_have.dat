5|$|In 1990 Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon {{published}} his long poem Madoc: a Mystery, inspired by Southey's {{work and the}} events surrounding it. Muldoon's work takes as its premise the idea that Southey and Coleridge actually came to America to found their ideal state, and offers a multi-layered poetic exploration <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> happened. It won the 1992 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize.|$|E
25|$|Shaffer was {{inspired}} to write Equus when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses {{in a small town}} near Suffolk. He set out to construct a fictional account <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime. The play's action is something of a detective story, involving the attempts of the child psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart to understand the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his own sense of purpose.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 Corvette chief {{engineer}} Zora Arkus-Duntov initiated {{a program to}} produce a lightweight version based on a prototype that mirrored the new 1963 Corvette. Concerned about Ford {{and what they were}} doing with the Shelby Cobra, Duntov's program included plans to build 125 examples of the Corvette Grand Sport to allow the model to be homologated for international Grand Touring races. After the GM executives learned of the secret project, the program was stopped, and only five cars were built. All five cars have survived and are in private collections. They are among the most coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built, not because of what they accomplished, but because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been.|$|E

25|$|Regarding Sophoniba, {{her story}} {{provides}} {{a perspective on}} the rivalry between the two kings, Syphax of Masaesyli (west Numidia) and Masinissa of Massyli (east Numidia). Her story also sheds light {{on the relationship between}} Carthage and the Berbers, with particular reference to Rome. Livy (59 BC–AD 17), the Roman historian, presents a rather detailed portrait of these circumstances, especially events following the defeat of her husband Syphax. Such details may shed light on the personality of Masinissa, or at least on the world in which he lived. Yet ancient historians were not unfamiliar with propaganda and their readers expected them to recreate scenes, giving memorable, probable versions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> happened.|$|E
500|$|... "I Could Fall in Love" [...] {{received}} a generally positive response from music critics, who commented on its similarities to songs recorded by other artists. Ed Morales of Vibe magazine felt that, {{because of its}} syncopated drums, [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] had a [...] "Jon Secada-like feel", and it reminded Tarradell of songs recorded by American singer Brandy Norwood and by the trio TLC. An editor from the Star-News thought the song had [...] "a whiff of" [...] Celine Dion. James Hunter, also from Vibe, praised Selena's astute interpretation, calling it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and commenting that Selena's death made the track more difficult to listen to. Larry Flick of Billboard described [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] as an [...] "optimistic love song" [...] that left [...] "melancholy thoughts <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been" [...] {{in the mind of}} the listener. John Lannert, also from Billboard, conceived [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] as a [...] "sensuous narrative" [...] recording and a [...] "seductive romantic confessional". Tarradell, writing in The Beaver County Times, called it a [...] "crossover staple".|$|E

The lych gate is a memorial to those who fell in World WarI and is inscribed [...] "Ye who live on, mid-English pastures green.

Dockworkers were using an oxyacetylene torch to perform routine maintenance work when sparks ignited 26,365 pounds of ground foam rubber scrap.

2500|$|Volcanism 22to 21million {{years ago}} {{constructed}} the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex about [...] northeast of Hope. It comprises volcanic and intrusive rocks that are calc-alkaline felsic to intermediate in composition. Coquihalla Mountain, the highest {{summit of the}} Bedded Range with an elevation of , is a major preserved stratovolcano and {{represents one of the}} few remaining Miocene volcanoes in southwestern British Columbia. As a result, the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex has been a subject of geological studies to annunciate the remains <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been an extensive cover of volcanic rocks during the early Miocene epoch. The Coquihalla Complex also has a different igneous composition than Canadian Cascade Arc volcanoes that formed in the last two million years. Rhyolite tuffs are the primary igneous rocks comprising the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex, with small amounts of basalt or andesite present. This contrasts with modern Canadian Cascade volcanoes in that they are mainly composed of volcanic rocks in the basalt to andesite composition range, with few rocks of more felsic composition than dacite. Changes in magma composition have also occurred in the American portion of the Cascade Arc.|$|E
2500|$|The only account <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{happened}} during the pogrom belongs to a document written by 22-year-old Menachem Finkielsztejn {{who had lived in}} the region with his parents under Polish protection during the Holocaust, before his subsequent emigration to Israel with his family and siblings. The paper, deposited in June 1945 at the Jewish Committee in Białystok, was a rough and unsigned translation from Yiddish, with original, attributed to Finkielsztejn. His own estimation of the number of Jews burned alive in a barn in nearby Jedwabne was over ten times higher than what has been established by the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) as a fact. Exaggerated stories such as the one written by Finkielsztejn, were encouraged by CKŻP as possible backup for exit visas. They weren't utilized by CKŻP because of the free-passage decree issued by Gen. Spychalski. According to Finkielsztejn, the advancing German troops soon moved on leaving behind Nazi police presence. In the second week of the German occupation, a Polish militia was formed on the order of German gendarmerie. It consisted of [...] "local thugs", wrote Finkielsztejn. On 5 July 1941 this unit surrounded Wąsosz to prevent Jews from escaping, and a house to house pogrom began. The actual description of the pogrom remains unverified to this day and, as noted by Polish and American scholars, it might have been rewritten by Jewish custodians of the original document.|$|E

He further stated that [...] "the book is without plot", showing [...] "little evidence of literary skill". He suggested that the time and effort put into writing it [...] "might well have been diverted to another channel". The Examiner suggested that its shortcomings meant {{that it would have been}} better if the novel had never been published, as [...] "it is so very suggestive <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> done, and has not done; <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> avoided, and has not avoided".|$|R
