40|$|Despite the {{proliferation}} of e-business adoption by organisations and the world-wide growth of the e-business phenomenon, there is a paucity of empirical studies that examine the adoption of e-business in the Middle East. The aim of our study is to provide insights into the salient e-business adoption issues by focusing on Saudi Arabian businesses. We developed a conceptual model for electronic business (e-business) adoption incorporating nine factors. Survey data from 550 businesses were {{used to test the}} model and hypotheses. The findings of the study suggest that firm's technological readiness, top management Support, technology orientation, consumer readiness, trading partner readiness and regulatory support are important facilitators of e-business adoption. In addition, the study finds that, competitive pressure and <b>organisational</b> <b>customer</b> and competitor orientation is not a predictor for e-business adoption. The implications of the findings are discussed and suggestions for future inquiry are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{benefits}} of customer relationship management system to a company {{in the context of}} customer centric age, using a case study of CRM implementation in a local telecom service company in Vietnam. The findings suggest that after a long time leading the telecom market, at the moment, the company was facing stiff competition from new service providers. This competition would be even stiffer after Vietnam joined WTO and the Vietnamese telecom market will be open to competition in 2012. In such circumstance, CRM played a very important role in offering many potential benefits to the company. The findings confirm the existing literature in depicting {{the benefits of}} CRM system: ameliorating the quality of sales, marketing and customer service. In addition, the findings emphasise the important values of CRM towards strategy planning at strategic level and the implementation of this strategy at both tactical level and management level. Moreover, the research findings also explore the opportunities for the establishment and development of <b>organisational</b> <b>customer</b> culture from the implementation of a CRM system...|$|E

The national sphere of government create the policies and legislations in regard to risk management for protection of assets and how the local government should render the service to community and most probably gives a mandate which services and responsibility rest on local sphere. The primary objective of this research is to investigate various kinds and sources of risks that local municipality and the community are exposed to, as well as the measures and methods available to manage these risks. Evaluation of risks report by municipality, ability of municipality to detect risks and community schedules of meeting for risks with accountable people is assessed. The research revealed that there are loopholes when it comes to Nketoane municipality to protect environmental, human, heritage, financial, <b>organisational,</b> <b>customer</b> and physical assets that are always exposed to daily risks. From the research it was evident that Nketoane Local Municipality normally fail to protect the above asset at the same time without compromising one of them. To ensure the implementation of effective risk management system, the municipality should adhere to policies created by national sphere, risk management framework should be developed by each municipality to assess, identify, mitigate, review, transfer and monitor risks where it is applicable on continuous basis.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is to investigate, within a {{franchise}} system, relationships between <b>organisational</b> climate, <b>customer</b> satisfaction (measured directly and indirectly) and two measures of <b>organisational</b> performance (<b>customer</b> post purchase behavioural intentions and net sales). Design/methodology/approach – Nineteen units of a coffee franchise system were investigated. Data were collected from employees and customers via respondentcompletion surveys. Net sales data were provided by the master franchisee. Hypotheses were tested using multiple linear regression and correlation analyses. Findings - Significant relationships were found between <b>organisational</b> climate, <b>customer</b> satisfaction and customer post purchase behavioural intentions. Net sales, however, were not related to customer satisfaction. In contrast to previous studies no correlation was found between direct and indirect measures of customer satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - This study was limited to one coffee franchise group’s activities in one culturally homogeneous country. Further research involving a variety of franchised operations across a range of geographic/cultural contexts would provide more generalisable results...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper investigates {{the influence of}} industry, <b>organisational,</b> and <b>customer</b> context on customer relationship management (CRM) projects. Organisations go through four phases in their CRM projects (assessment, design, implementation, and evaluation), yet the impact of industry norms, <b>organisational</b> contexts, and <b>customer</b> expectations on each phase are rarely examined. A longitudinal case study approach with six cases was used to investigate {{the potential impact of}} contextual factors on CRM projects. The cases covered a range of industries, <b>organisational</b> structures, and <b>customer</b> types. We found that current industry conditions and customer expectations influence the reasons for undertaking CRM and the assessment stage of the project.

40|$|A {{generation}} {{has passed since}} the term relationship marketing was first defined, yet this concept remains illusive, fragmented, and dominated by isolated theoretical frameworks. As this paradigm moves uneasily into its second generation, it is now increasingly characterised by a polarization of opinion and {{would be better served}} by focusing on resolving two fundamental issues. Firstly, there needs to be some form of consensus and convergence in thinking regarding the actual nature of the paradigm in order to direct future research activities toward common ground and replication among its various conceptualisations. Secondly, this convergent position in the paradigm needs to be communicated to the practitioner more coherently in an attempt to move it from being an academic discipline and into the jurisdiction of the practitioner and implementable validity. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to articulate a new, but more importantly, convergent conceptual framework for relationship marketing. It draws on a range of traditional and contemporary theory, and importantly, considers how this theoretical base was used in a practitioner environment when developing a relationship marketing strategy. The convergent framework presented in this paper comprises of three fundamental elements, from which past and future research can be (re) focused, developed and extended to produce a paradigm that can be subjected to more rigorous and extensive interrogation. This paper takes a strategic, reflective and organisational look at relationship marketing and contributes to existing knowledge by proposing three fundamental elements, (<b>Organisational</b> <b>Customer</b> Focus, Customer Management Focus and Customer Knowledge Focus) which if successfully integrated by organisations, will converge to produce an effective relationship marketing strategy...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work in the}} {{reputation}} management literature has focused mainly on commercial organisations and the views of external stakeholders. However, important outcomes of reputation, such as {{both internal and external}} stakeholder satisfaction, are also important in public sector organisations. It is surprising therefore that little work in the literature thus far has focused on {{the reputation}} of public sector organisations. The notion of customer orientation is of particular relevance {{in the context of a}} hospital‟s reputation, as the interactions and experiences that external stakeholders such as patients and visitors have with customer-facing public service employees will influence their perceptions towards the organisation. To understand better the issues of reputation and customer orientation, and moreover how they interact, the aims of this study are to (1) investigate the reputation of a public hospital, and importantly, the drivers and outcomes of such reputation among different stakeholders, and (2) to explore the links between reputation and customer orientation in a public service context. This study adopts a mixed methodology approach. Phase one involved a qualitative study of three focus groups (n= 32) with the main stakeholders of a public sector hospital: patients and visitors, clinical staff and non-clinical staff. The overall aim of the focus groups was to explore the main drivers and outcomes of a public hospital‟s reputation. The second phase was a quantitative survey based study (N= 650) which investigated the relationships between the perceived corporate reputation of the hospital as measured by the Corporate Character Scale, perceived employee and <b>organisational</b> <b>customer</b> orientation and; internal and external stakeholder satisfaction. Findings from phase one of this study identified different drivers and outcomes of public sector organisation‟s reputation from those previously found in mainstream commercial literature. In line with previous published studies, the empirical findings from phase two of the study highlight that employee customer orientation (ECO) impacts external satisfaction. In contrast to previous work however, ECO was found to have an insignificant effect on employee satisfaction. Most importantly, this study finds that for both employees and external stakeholders, corporate brand personality mediates the relationship between ECO and satisfaction, that is, ECO influences perceived brand personality, which in turn influences satisfaction. This study concludes by providing an outline of the study‟s contribution to the literature together with a discussion of managerial implications and research limitations. Finally recommendations for future research are proposed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract “Customer Satisfaction” {{has many}} dimensions. The {{purpose of this}} {{research}} is to explore these dimensions briefly (using the Service Value Chain concept) and to determine the fundamental drivers of success in customer satisfaction {{from the perspective of a}} service organisation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between costing systems and performance management systems and their combined effect on performance under alternative competitive strategies across a number of industry sectors in Australia. A structured questionnaire approach to data gathering is utilised.

In addition, cost leader firms that use a combination of ABC and the BSC have improved their innovation and financial performance more than those who use ABC without BSC or those who use BSC without ABC. Furthermore, differentiator firms that use BSC without ABC have improved customer performance when compared with those that use a combination of ABC and BSC. The study also revealed that the use of ABC and the BSC is contingent on the strategy a firm pursues. Hence, this component is included as an independent factor. Wendy James, Abdalla Elmezugh...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} to advance current thinking around Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) and Management Information Systems (MIS) by proposing integration into a holistic information system - Knowledge-based Management Information System (KBMIS). The aim of launching this KBMIS {{is to build}} an effective, time-saving and change adapting management information system for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). This KBMIS is relevant in the current business environment as knowledge and information management has become a key issue in the business practice of SMEs. It is argued that information and knowledge flows must be effectively managed in all their business activities. In particular, this research focuses on <b>organisational</b> management and <b>customer</b> knowledge management for SMEs. This is because many SMEs lack resources and knowledge of strategic thinking, prerequisites for information and knowledge management. Therefore, this study proposes a dynamic model to evaluate the degree to which SMEs current MIS and KMS correspond with their <b>organisational</b> management and <b>customer</b> management needs. To develop this model, the critical characteristics of MIS, KMS, and SMEs are integrated. This model shows how information and knowledge may flow; and how these may be stored and managed in the SMEs' business process.

40|$|Reaching service {{excellence}} {{through a}} focus on the customer, demands more than just measuring customer satisfaction by means of questionnaire surveys. Nowadays, it is not sufficient anymore to have service excellence in services, processes and relationships. Now is the time to create excellence in customer experiences, as the only way to create competitive advantage in the market. Organisational change should then be driven by a broader focus on customers’ expectations and multiple ways of measuring customers’ satisfaction. The case of a service company in The Netherlands (a temporary employment agency) illustrates the way to service excellence as an organisational change process. The case supports the need for a broad focus on measurements {{in order to be able}} to monitor and to direct <b>organisational</b> changes. <b>Customer</b> satisfaction data based on surveys are needed, however, they will not be sufficient for continuing the change process over time.

40|$|The {{customer}} care or service approach {{is designed to}} improve relationships with and ways of handling customers, that is to realign organisational strategies and processes towards satisfying customers’ needs. The best {{customer care}} programmes go further than a simple concentration on the (external) customer and recognise the fact that, especially in large organisations, intermediate departments or sections involved in the supply of a service are themselves customers of one another. There is a front line in which staff have {{direct contact with the}} final receivers of the service, and then a series of interfaces within the organisation where one member of staff (or a team) provides an internal service to another. There is thus a customer chain which stretches back from the end (external) customer to the point at which a product or service is designed and specified. Genuine customer care is thus a by-product of internal relationships and culture, which renders it a leadership issue that should be part of an overall <b>organisational</b> strategy. <b>Customer</b> care has to start at the top, with leadership, as the way customers are treated is closely allied to the way staff feel about their jobs and the situation in which they do them.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest {{in the field of}} customer retention in the last two decades. Much of that interest has focused on the economics of customer retention and developing plans and strategies for companies to follow to improve customer retention. There has been little research into what determines customer retention, particularly from the perspective of organisational climate. The purpose of this study, therefore, is {{to examine the relationship between}} employees' perceptions of <b>organisational</b> climate and <b>customer</b> retention in a specific service setting. The methodology adopted for this study is a 'within method' triangulation approach, which uses predominantly qualitative research techniques, supported by quantitative research methods. The foundation of the research design is a set of six case studies of bank branches selected from the network of a major UK retail bank. The branches are similar to each other in every respect, except that three have high customer retention rates and three have low retention rates. The main source of data is semi-structured interviews with a representative sample of six employees from each bank branch. This data is supported by survey data from a questionnaire that was completed by an the staff in all six branches. This questionnaire was also used as a platform from which to conduct the semi-structured interviews. Cross-case analysis between the two sets of branches is undertaken using the 'stacking comparable cases' approach, in order to systematically compare and contrast the differences between the high and low retairuing branches. The findings from the study show that there is a relationship between employees' perceptions of <b>organisational</b> climate and <b>customer</b> retention at a micro-organisational level. It shows that organisational climate can be sub-divided into five climate themes and that within each climate theme there are dimensions which are critical to customer retention and others which are less critical or irrelevant. Finally, the study highlights that it is the climate themes and dimensions taken together that form the climate for 6 customer care' and not the individual themes and dimensions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The social {{relationship}} between sales assistants and customers {{has often been}} described as relatively one-sided one in which sales assistants are subordinate to customers. One {{of the ways in}} which the subordination of sales assistants is manifested is when customers treat them badly, for instance in the form of verbal and physical abuse. We suggest that these power relations are not one-sided, but consist of both of the normative subordination that has been described in much of the previous research and of <b>organisational</b> superordination over <b>customers.</b> We also suggest that in many instances, difficult customer behaviour is triggered by this inherent contradiction in the role of sales assistants. When sales assistants perform superordinate actions, customers can respond by attempting to undermine the sales assistants’ superordination and restore normative subordination. The empirical data consist of observations and interviews with employees of a large supermarket and two filling stations in southern Sweden...|$|R

There is plenty of recognition of the need for more innovation in the construction sector. Increasing levels of competition, rapid technological and regulatory change, the current economic climate and environmental concern all accentuate this requirement. In response, many construction firms are seeking ways to manage innovation more actively and conscientiously in order to remain competitive. However, there is little practical guidance for construction professionals on how to make innovation flourish in their teams. Those who aspire to improve the management of innovation will need to understand how innovation happens, what are the driving forces and how can they be influenced. This paper reports on an empirical investigation that was undertaken to explore some of these questions, specifically the role of <b>organisational</b> climate, <b>customers,</b> risk and complexity on the levels of innovation in teams and the various modes of innovation that prevail - with the aim of providing practitioners with clearer guidance on where efforts should be focused. The findings suggest that there are a limited number of fundamental factors that significantly influence innovation magnitude and mode. For industry professionals it is hoped that this stimulates debate and assists in establishing a much needed foundation for improved innovation management in construction...|$|R
40|$|The Organisation Engagement Survey (OES) was {{designed}} to measure engagement and its predictors (drivers) within a large retail travel organisation in Australia. It includes a specially-developed 5 -item engagement scale (ES) and a forty-item 8 -factor drivers-of-engagement scale (the eight factors are: senior leadership, team leadership, continuance, work support, work demands, employee empowerment, customer focus, financial rewards). This paper reports findings in this case study of the organisation on what were the drivers or predictors of engagement within the organisation (of over 4000 people, as obtained from over 400 responses reasonably representative of the overall organisation). It also provides some insights into how the OES and its parts are related to external selected common European and US scales {{that are used to}} assess engagement (specifically, The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale- short form of 9 items; the Cook and Wall Organisational Commitment Scale of 9 items; and the Three Component Model of Commitment- Revised Scale- 18 items). Confirmatory factor analysis validated the relationship of the drivers in the organisation in predicting engagement; and there were strong relationships found between the ES and the selected external scales. The OES differs from the other available scales in its integration of several thrusts as exemplified in part separately by the common engagement scales- no other available full engagement scale at the time of writing appears to have integrated and examined under research conditions the measures involved in the OES including aspects related to emotional commitment, <b>organisational</b> loyalty, <b>customer</b> focus, workplace support, and workplace leadership.
