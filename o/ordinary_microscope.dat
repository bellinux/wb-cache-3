60|$|But leaving these Discoveries {{to future}} Industries, we shall proceed {{to add one}} Observation more of a point {{commonly}} so call'd, that is, {{the mark of a}} full stop, or period. And for this purpose I observed many both printed ones and written; and among multitudes I found few of them more round or regular then this which I have delineated in the third figure of the second Scheme, but very many abundantly more disfigur'd; {{and for the most part}} if they seem'd equally round to the eye, I found those points that had been made by a Copper-plate, and Roll-press, to be as misshapen as those which had been made with Types, the most curious and smothly engraven strokes and points, looking but as so many furrows and holes, and their printed impressions, but like smutty daubings on a matt or uneven floor with a blunt extinguisht brand or stick's end. And as for points made with a pen they were much more ragged and deformed. Nay, having view'd certain pieces of exceeding curious writing of the kind (one of which in the bredth of a two-pence compris'd the Lords prayer, the Apostles Creed, the ten Commandments, and about half a dozen verses besides of the Bible, whose lines were so small and near together, that I was unable to number them with my naked eye,) a very <b>ordinary</b> <b>Microscope,</b> I had then about me, inabled me to see that what the Writer of it had asserted was true, but withall discover'd of what pitifull bungling scribbles and scrawls it was compos'd, Arabian and China characters being almost as well shap'd, yet thus much I must say for the Man, that it was for the most part legible enough, though in some places there wanted a good fantsy well preposest to help one through. If this manner of small writing were made easie and practicable (and I think I know such a one, but have never yet made tryal of it, whereby one might be inabled to write a great deale with much ease, and accurately enough in a very little roome) it might be of very good use to convey secret Intelligence without any danger of Discovery or mistrusting. But to come again to the point. The Irregularities of it are caused by three or four coadjutors, one of which is, the uneven surface of the paper, which at best appears no smother then a very course piece of shag'd cloth, next the irregularity of the Type or Ingraving, and a third is the rough Daubing of the Printing-Ink that lies upon the instrument that makes the impression, to all which, add the variation made by the Different lights and shadows, and you may have sufficient reason to guess that a point may appear much more ugly then this, which I have here presented, which though it appear'd through the Microscope gray, like a great splatch of London dirt, about three inches over; yet to the naked eye it was black and no bigger then that in the midst of the Circle A.

40|$|Microscopy has {{facilitated}} {{the discovery of}} many biological insights by optically magnifying small structures in cells and tissues. However, the resolution of optical microscopy {{is limited by the}} diffraction of light to ~ 200 - 300 nm, comparable or larger to the size of many subcellular structures. In this thesis, we describe a suite of tools based on a novel super-resolution microscopy approach called Expansion microscopy. Expansion microscopy (ExM) physically expands tissues so that the resolution of <b>ordinary</b> <b>microscopes</b> is increased - 5 times by leveraging the swelling properties of polyelectrolyte hydrogels. <b>Ordinary</b> <b>microscopes</b> used with ExM are more accessible and faster than the specialized optical systems designed to image beyond the diffraction limit (e. g., STORM/PALM, STED, SIM), while yielding similar performance. Expanded tissues are also optically clear, allowing for unprecedented super-resolution imaging in thick tissues and facile reagent diffusion into the sample. We have since developed a variant of ExM, called protein retention ExM, in which proteins are directly anchored to the swellable gel using a commercially available cross-linking molecule. This strategy enables ExM of genetically encoded fluorescent proteins and commercial fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. With these advancements, ExM can be carried out with purely commercial reagents and represents a simple extension of standard histological methods used to prepare samples for imaging. Furthermore, we have developed a variant of the ExM technology that enables RNA molecules to be directly linked to the ExM gel network via a small molecule linker and isotropic expansion. This technology, termed ExFISH, enables visualization of RNAs with nanoscale precision and single molecule resolution. We have demonstrated that the covalent anchoring of RNA also enables robust repeated washing and probe hybridization steps, opening the door to combinatorial multiplexing strategies. By leveraging these benefits, we have further developed in situ analysis tools which allow for highly multiplexed imaging of RNA identity and location with nanoscale precision in intact tissues. Taken together, these tools allow for spatially mapping molecular information onto cell types and tissue structures which could be invaluable for spatially complex biological processes such as brain function, cancer heterogeneity and organismal development. by Fei Chen.

50|$|A {{polarizing}} microscope {{is similar to}} an <b>ordinary</b> <b>microscope,</b> but it has two plane-polarized filters, a (polarizer) below the sample and an analyzer above it, polarized perpendicular to each other.

However, an anisotropic sample will generally change the polarization so some of the light can pass through. Thin sections and powders can be used as samples.|$|E

They then turned off the entrapment lasers and directly measured atom velocities of 7 mm per second in order to calculate their temperature.

5000|$|In the system, the {{particles}} {{to be observed}} are dispersed in a liquid or gas colloid (or less often in a coarser suspension). The colloid is placed in a light-absorbing, dark enclosure, and illuminated with a convergent beam of intense light entering from one side. Light hitting the colloid particles will be scattered. In discussions about light scattering, the converging beam is called a [...] "Tyndall cone". The scene is viewed through an <b>ordinary</b> <b>microscope</b> placed {{at right angles to}} the direction of the lightbeam. Under the microscope, the individual particles will appear as small fuzzy spots of light moving irregularly. The spots are inherently fuzzy because light scattering produces fuzzier images than light reflection.

5000|$|A further {{refinement}} of microscopic methods {{consists of the}} use of strongly convergent polarized light (konoscopic methods). This is obtained by a wide angled achromatic condenser above the polarizer, and a high power microscopic objective. Those sections are most useful which are perpendicular to an optic axis, and consequently remain dark on rotation. If they belong to uniaxial crystals they show a dark cross or convergent light between crossed nicols, the bars of which remain parallel to the wires in the field of the eyepiece. Sections perpendicular to an optic axis of a biaxial mineral under the same conditions show a dark bar which on rotation becomes curved to a hyperbolic shape. If the section is perpendicular to a [...] "bisectrix" [...] (see Crystallography) a black cross is seen which on rotation opens out to form two hyperbolas, the apices of which are turned towards one another. The optic axes emerge at the apices of the hyperbolas and may be surrounded by colored rings, though owing to the thinness of minerals in rock sections these are only seen when the double refraction of the mineral is strong. The distance between the axes as seen in the field of the microscope depends partly on the axial angle of the crystal and partly on the numerical aperture of the objective. If it is measured by means of eye-piece micrometer, the optic axial angle of the mineral can be found by a simple calculation. The quartz wedge, quarter mica plate or selenite plate permit the determination of the positive or negative character of the crystal by the changes in the color or shape of the figures observed in the field. These operations are precisely similar to those employed by the mineralogist in the examination of plates cut from crystals. It is sufficient {{to point out that the}} petrological microscope in its modern development is an optical instrument of great precision, enabling us to determine physical constants of crystallized substances as well as serving to produce magnified images like the <b>ordinary</b> <b>microscope.</b> A great variety of accessory apparatus has been devised to fit it for these special uses.|$|E
