5|$|In the Eastern empire, {{laws and}} {{official}} documents were regularly translated into Greek from Latin. Both languages were in active use {{by government officials}} and the Church during the 5th century. From the 6th century, Greek culture was studied in the West almost exclusively through Latin translation. Latin loanwords appear liberally in Greek texts <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> topics from late antiquity and the Byzantine period.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo wrote {{several other}} books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet {{much of the}} writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was {{preserved}} in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> and scientific issues, he {{had an interest in}} divination and the supernatural, the latter including his vivid description of unidentified flying objects from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts.|$|E
5|$|The Technical University of Denmark {{is located}} in Lyngby in the {{northern}} outskirts of Copenhagen. In 2013, it was ranked {{as one of the}} leading technical universities in Northern Europe. The IT University is Denmark's youngest university, a mono-faculty institution focusing <b>on</b> <b>technical,</b> societal and business aspects of information technology.|$|E

5|$|The {{faculty and}} student body place {{a high value}} on {{meritocracy}} and <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> proficiency. MIT has never awarded an honorary degree, nor does it award athletic scholarships, ad eundem degrees, or Latin honors upon graduation. However, MIT has twice awarded honorary professorships: to Winston Churchill in 1949 and Salman Rushdie in 1993.|$|E
5|$|This {{still left}} the {{question}} of relations between the U.S. and the League. Hughes' State Department initially ignored communications from the League, or tried to bypass it through direct communications with member nations. By 1922, though, the U.S., through its consul in Geneva, was dealing with the League, and though the U.S. refused to participate in any meeting with political implications, it sent observers to sessions <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> and humanitarian matters.|$|E
5|$|Weber's ideal {{bureaucracy}} is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated {{lines of}} authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) {{on the basis of}} written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Hurcomb {{put forward}} at a ministerial meeting a {{solution}} whereby {{the members of}} the inquiry would inform NESCo that on purely technical grounds they would have approved the scheme, but due to the opposition of Morrison, they had decided not to proceed to a decision. Although NESCo were initially hostile, in June 1945 they agreed to drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> grounds, thus entitling them to compenstation. The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections, and even if the scheme had proceeded past the inquiry stage, they would have refused consent anyway.|$|E
5|$|From 12 to 14 September 2013, {{details of}} the Framework were {{negotiated}} at the InterContinental Hotel in Geneva, Switzerland. High-level negotiations were held between Kerry and Lavrov, with large teams of experts simultaneously working <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> details. A key breakthrough was reported to occur when the U.S. and Russia agreed on their approximations of the Syrian chemical weapon stockpile (estimated at 1,000 tons of sarin, mustard agent and VX nerve agent). On 14 September 2013 the Framework was agreed and signed.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, in a {{district}} court case, Deady {{ruled in favor of}} Marcus Neff in a lawsuit against Sylvester Pennoyer concerning unpaid legal fees to John H. Mitchell and a sheriff's auction of Neff's land to Pennoyer. The case would become the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of Pennoyer v. Neff that helped define the law of personal jurisdiction. In 1885, Deady admitted Mary Leonard to the federal bar, the first woman admitted to practice in Oregon, though the Oregon Supreme Court at first denied her admittance to the state bar <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> grounds. Later that year the Oregon legislature resolved the technical issue in the statute and the state high court admitted Leonard into the state bar.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, {{while working}} long hours on his {{definitive}} book on gear cutting machinery, his energy gave {{out and he}} suffered a “nervous breakdown.” He had {{to take time off}} to recover. In 1910, he accepted a job offer to work in a machine tool company in Vermont. He continued to write <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> and other matters throughout his life and would develop a broader philosophy of the role of industry in society. In 1938, he received a Worcester Reed Warner Medal in recognition of his technical writing.|$|E
5|$|Mercury-Atlas 8 (MA-8) was {{the fifth}} United States manned space mission, part of NASA's Mercury program. Astronaut Walter M. Schirra Jr., orbited the Earth six times in the Sigma 7 {{spacecraft}} on October 3, 1962, in a nine-hour flight focused mainly <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> evaluation rather than on scientific experimentation. This was the longest U.S. manned orbital flight yet achieved in the Space Race, though well behind the several-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 3 earlier in the year. It confirmed the Mercury spacecraft's durability ahead of the one-day Mercury-Atlas 9 mission that followed in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Much of Redemption's {{criticism}} focused <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> {{problems when}} it was released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted issues with the initial lack of a function to save game progress at any point, which meant that dying or technical issues with the game could necessitate them to reload a previous save, and then repeat up to 30 minutes of gameplay. CGW added that the repetitive gameplay meant that losing progress and having to repeat it was a particular downside. Next Generation, who provided {{the game with a}} score of 3 out of 5, said that Redemption was potentially only a few patches away from being a 5 out of 5 game, if not for technical issues. PC Gamers review even included recommended instructions for cheats that worked around the technical flaws.|$|E

5|$|The two {{contractor}} teams submitted evaluation {{results with}} their proposals in December 1990, and on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice {{announced that the}} YF-22 was the winner. The Air Force selected the YF119 engine to power the F-22 production version. The Lockheed and Pratt & Whitney designs were rated higher <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> aspects, were considered lower risks, and were considered to have more effective program management. It has been speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more adaptable to the Navy's NATF, but by 1992 the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E
5|$|Wackett was {{appointed}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1941 New Year Honours. In June, {{he became the}} RAAF's representative on the federal Aircraft Advisory Committee, set up to assist the Director-General of Aircraft Production. As well as members from governmental and scientific bodies, the committee included delegates from aircraft manufacturers such as de Havilland Australia and CAC, with Lawrence Wackett acting as Chief Technical Advisor. Later that year, the two brothers joined various academics on the newly formed Australian Council for Aeronautics, established by Prime Minister John Curtin to advise government, educational and scientific organisations <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> developments in the aircraft industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Johns became commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. The wartime Engineer School was {{responsible}} for the training of officers. Some were engineers in civilian life who were trained as officers; other were officers transferred from other arms who were given training in engineering subjects. The Officer Candidate School (OCS) prepared enlisted men for commissioning as officers. There had been strong criticism of the content of training courses from SWPA, where it was the norm for machinery to be operated around the clock and for engineer officers to supervise all manner of construction tasks. The commanders there felt that the training courses taught by the Engineer School were concentrating too much on leadership in combat, and not enough <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> matters, such the operation and maintenance of construction equipment. Johns reformed the curriculum, but by this time {{it was too late for}} the changes to have much effect in the overseas theaters of operations. For his work at Fort Belvoir, Johns was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E

5|$|In November 1861, the , {{commanded}} by Union Captain Charles Wilkes, intercepted the British mail ship RMS Trent and removed two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell. They {{were held in}} Boston amid jubilation in the North and outrage in Britain. The British minister in Washington, Lord Lyons, demanded their release, as the U.S. {{had no right to}} stop a British-flagged ship traveling between neutral ports. The British drew up war plans to attack New York and sent reinforcements to Canada. Seward worked to defuse the situation. He persuaded Lyons to postpone delivering an ultimatum, and told Lincoln that the prisoners would have to be released. Lincoln did let them go, reluctantly, <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> grounds. Relations between the U.S. and Britain soon improved; in April 1862, Seward and Lyons signed a treaty they had negotiated allowing each nation to inspect the other's ships for contraband slaves. In November 1862, with America's image in Britain improved by the issuance of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, the British cabinet decided against recognition of the Confederacy as a nation.|$|E
5|$|In November 1949, {{following}} the death of Jimmy Dunne, Paddy Coad reluctantly accepted the position of player-manager having played with the club for almost eight years, in which time he had established himself {{as one of the best}} players in the League of Ireland. Coad opted for a radical youth policy and over the course of his first three years in charge, signed virtually the entire schoolboy international side to Rovers. He employed revolutionary training methods with extra emphasis <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> skill and possession which resulted in a fast, passing style of football that contributed significantly to the development of the game in Ireland. In 1954, the club won the League of Ireland for the first time in fifteen years, while Paddy Ambrose finished the season as the team's leading scorer. Led by players like Liam Tuohy and Coad himself, the team known as Coad's Colts proceeded to win two more League titles and two FAI Cups, concluding the golden era of Irish football as one of its most successful teams.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Xu Xiake, who focused <b>on</b> <b>technical</b> aspects in his travel literature, the Chinese poet and official Yuan Hongdao (1568–1610) used travel literature {{to express his}} desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with Confucian court politics. Yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholar-official. This anti-official sentiment in Yuan's travel literature and poetry was actually following {{in the tradition of}} the Song dynasty poet and official Su Shi (1037–1101). Yuan Hongdao and his two brothers, Yuan Zongdao (1560–1600) and Yuan Zhongdao (1570–1623), were the founders of the Gong'an School of letters. This highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the Confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism, which was also apparent in Ming vernacular novels such as the Jin Ping Mei. Yet even gentry and scholar-officials were affected by the new popular romantic literature, seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate.|$|E
