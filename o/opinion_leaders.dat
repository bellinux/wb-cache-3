Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. American secretary of state Richard Olney in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat Julian Pauncefote. President William McKinley supported the treaty, as did most <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders,</b> academics, and leading newspapers. The main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of its treatment of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence of English comes from such factors as <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.|$|E

Writing in 1913, Ignotus, Nyugat editor and leading cultural critic, defended the political participation of non-Hungarian communities, commending both Isac and the traditionalist Romanian poet Octavian Goga for their resistance to Magyarization.|$|E
25|$|From a more {{academic}} {{point of}} view, Barak Libai, Eitan Muller and Renana Peres constructed a {{research in the}} subject which is {{among the first to}} shed light on the actual value created by word of mouth programs and explore issues such as how targeting <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> creates more value than targeting random customers. In seeding programs, word-of-mouth can gain customers who would not otherwise have bought the product, this is called expansion. However, word-of-mouth can also accelerate the purchase process of customers who would have purchased anyway, the faster the adoption, the greater the profits. These processes of expansion and acceleration integrate to create social value in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. Furthermore, when deciding upon an optimal seeding program, the researchers conclude that “Influencer Seeding Programs” yield higher customer equity than “random Seeding Programs”. Of course, the decision about which program type to adopt depends on how much the company is willing to invest in discovering their influencers.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the role of}} an <b>opinion</b> <b>leader</b> on Sina Weibo (a microblog) in mobilising the countercampaign against nationwide anti-Japan demonstrations in 2012. Specifically, the chapter focuses on those online practices by the <b>opinion</b> <b>leader</b> and his followers which facilitated the process of remaking Guangzhou, the southern Chinese city near Hong Kong and Macau. Using data collected from Sina Weibo during the anti-Japan demonstrations, the chapter argues that the countercampaign in Guangzhou was successful due to the <b>opinion</b> <b>leader's</b> ability to manipulate the technological affordances of Weibo and the socialites of the city, to construct himself as a spatial subject of Guangzhou, and to construct a geopublic that contested and questioned the legitimacy of a state-imposed notion of nationalism. The online practices of posting, reposting, commenting, and uploading visual audio materials mapped Guangzhou city during the nationalistic movements. The mapping constructs an alternative sense of Chinese nationalism which encapsulates both local values and the national agenda of border sovereignty.

25|$|Faith Ryan Whittlesey (born 1939) is {{a former}} Pennsylvania Republican {{politician}} and White House Senior Staff member notable for her effort to communicate Reagan's entire policy agenda to U.S. <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> and for bringing {{together for the first}} time in the Reagan White House evangelical, Catholic, and other conservative religious groups who opposed legalized abortion and were concerned about moral and cultural decline and the break-up of the family. These groups became a significant component of the Reagan coalition as they grew more politically self-conscious in the 1980s. Whittlesey also organized the White House Central American Outreach Group at the direction of Chief of Staff James Baker to provide information about Reagan's anti-communist policies in the region and was an active supporter of Reagan's defense buildup and the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Whittlesey served twice for a total of nearly 5 years as U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland and also served for 2 years on the Reagan White House Senior Staff as Assistant to the President for Public Liaison.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 the Austrian {{government}} under the SPÖ chancellor Fred Sinowatz had given approval {{to a series}} of plans from Österreichische Donaukraftwerke AG to construct a hydroelectric power plant near Hainburg. Deemed as a project of particular and special interest to the public, the government bypassed and shortened normal regulatory processes to secure quick approval. The plans were deposited and formal planning began in late 1983, with clearing and earthworks beginning early in 1984. However, the plant was to be located in the middle of what is now the Donau-Auen Nationalpark (Danube Meadows National Park) - a large and environmentally sensitive flood plain {{that is one of the}} last of its size in Europe. By mid-1984 a number of environmental <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders,</b> among them Freda Meissner-Blau, started a campaign which sought to overturn the decision. A Volksbegehren (citizen's petition) was launched and a media campaign began to attempt to inform the public of the environmental risks posed by the project. As a leading figure in the campaign, Meissner-Blau took part in the organization of mass protests during the latter half of 1984, culminating in almost over 8000 staging a sit-in at the worksite on December 8, 1984. The government attempted to restart work at the site by using federal police to clear the protesters on December 19, however the events escalated into violence and hundreds of protesters were injured. That evening, Meissner-Blau and fellow environmental leaders took part in a mass protest in Vienna, where 40,000 marched against the government. As a result, the government bowed to public pressure, and Meissner-Blau and her husband were part of the opposition representation that negotiated a 'Christmas truce' with the government. Over the Christmas period thousands made a point of holidaying in the Hainburg area. By March 1985, a citizen's petition with 353,906 signatures against the plant was submitted to the parliament by Austrian Nobel laureate Konrad Lorenz. The petition was successful, and the government was obliged to back down from the plan.|$|E
