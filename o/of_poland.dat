5|$|Jogaila {{created a}} {{significant}} new {{alliance with the}} Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> when he secured an agreement, known as the Union of Krewo (August 1385), to marry the twelve-year-old King <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> Jadwiga <b>of</b> <b>Poland.</b> He married Jadwiga and was crowned jure uxoris king <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> in February 1386. As a condition to the marriage and coronation, Jogaila agreed to renounce paganism himself and Christianize his subjects, and establish a personal union between Poland and Lithuania. The Union was an unwelcome development for the Teutonic Knights, as it united Poland and Lithuania, two states hostile to the Order, and a Christianized Lithuania deprived the Knights of their ideological justification for waging the Lithuanian Crusade. Thus the Order sought opportunities to undo the Polish–Lithuanian union; they demanded Samogitia, a section of western Lithuania that bordered the Baltic Sea, and refused to recognize Jogaila's baptism in 1386.|$|E

5|$|Partitions <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> {{at the end}} of the 18th century {{brought an}} end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna {{established}} a semi-independent Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> (known as Congress Kingdom) under control of and in personal union with the Russian Empire. The King (Tsar) <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> at that time used a white royal banner emblazoned with the arms of the Congress Kingdoma black double-headed Russian eagle with the Polish White Eagle in an inescutcheon.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{crisis of}} his early reign, the War of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772), led to the First Partition <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> (1772). The latter part of his reign saw reforms wrought by the Great Sejm (1788–1792) and the Constitution of 3 May 1791. These reforms were overthrown by the 1792 Targowica Confederation and by the War in Defense of the Constitution, leading directly to the Second Partition <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> (1793), the Kościuszko Uprising (1794) and the final Third Partition <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> (1795), marking {{the end of the}} Commonwealth. Stripped of all meaningful power, Poniatowski abdicated in November 1795 and spent the last years of his life in semi-captivity in Saint Petersburg.|$|E

5|$|The new Queen of Hungary {{subjected}} herself {{entirely to}} her controlling mother-in-law, Elizabeth <b>of</b> <b>Poland.</b> The {{fact that the}} young queen's retinue consisted of the same individuals who had served the queen mother indicates that Elizabeth of Bosnia may not even have had her own court. Her mother-in-law's influence prevailed until 1370, when Louis succeeded his maternal uncle, CasimirIII, as King <b>of</b> <b>Poland.</b> Elizabeth's maternal uncle, Vladislaus the White, had also been {{a candidate for the}} Polish throne. Following his coronation in Poland, Louis brought Casimir's underage daughters, Anne and Hedwig, to be raised by Elizabeth. Elizabeth, though Queen <b>of</b> <b>Poland,</b> was never crowned as such.|$|E
5|$|The war {{was still}} ongoing, and since {{transporting}} masses of {{people into a}} combat zone was impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews currently living in the General Government (the German-occupied area <b>of</b> <b>Poland)</b> would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas <b>of</b> <b>Poland,</b> as would Jews {{from the rest of}} Europe.|$|E
5|$|Throughout most of {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>Poland,</b> the banner <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> {{was one of the}} main symbols of the Polish State, {{normally}} reserved for use by the head of state. Although its design changed with time, it was generally a heraldic banner, i.e., one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle on a red field (Gules an eagle Argent crowned Or). The banner should not be confused with the flag <b>of</b> <b>Poland,</b> a white and red , officially adopted in 1919.|$|E

He was rehabilitated after the end of the Stalinist period in 1956 and became active in the official veterans' organization Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (ZBoWiD).

5|$|As the {{disadvantages}} of national division were becoming increasingly apparent in various {{segments of the}} society, some of the Piast dukes began to make serious efforts aimed at the reunification of the Polish state. Important among the earlier attempts were {{the activities of the}} Silesian dukes Henry I the Bearded, his son Henry II the Pious, who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the Battle of Legnica, and Henry IV Probus. In 1295, Przemysł II of Greater Poland became the first Piast duke crowned as King <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> since Bolesław II, but he ruled over only a part of the territory <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> (including Gdańsk Pomerania from 1294) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, Václav II of Bohemia of the Přemyslid dynasty, who married Przemysł's daughter Richeza and became King <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> in 1300. Václav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305.|$|E

5|$|Born about 1339, Elizabeth was the {{daughter}} of Ban StephenII of Bosnia, the head of the House of Kotromanić.

After her daughter-in-law Margaret succumbed to the Black Death in 1349, Queen Elizabeth expressed interest in her young kinswoman, having in mind a future match for her widowed and childless son, King LouisI of Hungary. She insisted on immediately bringing the girl to her court in Visegrád for fostering. Despite her father's initial reluctance, Elizabeth was sent to the dowager's court.|$|E

However, the Polish prelates and lords were opposed to the disintegration <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> and Casimir III's testament was declared void. Louis visited Gniezno and made his Polish mother, Elizabeth, regent before returning to Hungary in December. His uncle's two surviving daughters (Anna and Hedwig) accompanied him, and the Polish Crown Jewels were transferred to Buda, which raised discontent among Louis's new subjects. Louis's wife {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Catherine, in 1370, seventeen years after their marriage; a second daughter, Mary, was born in 1371.
