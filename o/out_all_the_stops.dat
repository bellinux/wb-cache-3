25|$|When an 8-year-old {{girl was}} raped in March 1998, the police {{initially}} described two black males as the culprits. Lee {{was criticized for}} declaring every black man in the subdivision a suspect. He apologized for any offense but insisted the practice was not racist. In fact, friends said the sheriff was so personally shaken by the vicious attack on the girl, who was also black, that he pulled <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> to solve the case.|$|E
500|$|Critics have praised Williams' score, {{comparing}} it favorably to the original. Williams [...] "uses {{a few basic}} elements of the original—the obligatory shark motif, for one—and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions." [...] The score is [...] "more disturbing in places" [...] than the original, and [...] "Williams [...] some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music." [...] Because Jaws 2 [...] "isn't a film that requires subtlety ... Williams pulls <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> {{to make it as}} exciting and hair raising as possible." ...|$|E

50|$|The weather of the 1996 {{winter was}} not kind to the {{contractors}} but extra urgency {{was provided by}} the news that the stadium was to be opened by the Queen. This news - the first time the Queen had opened a new football stadium - ensured that the workers, at one point behind schedule, had to pull <b>out</b> <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> to get <b>the</b> stadium completed in time. The pitch stood at 105 metres long and 68 metres wide, meeting the requirements for an international venue, and measured five yards longer and four yards wider than the pitch at the Baseball Ground. It also came with a three-metre grass margin.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a brutal}} scene, in which Christ's {{tormentors}} twist the crown onto {{his head with}} their canes, but the violence is relieved and Christ's suffering exalted by {{the beauty of the}} colours, which especially in the blue and green to the right are colder than usual in deference to Titian's Roman sources. In Christ's foot extended on the steps, however, Titian pulls <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Venetian <b>stops</b> and one can sense the blood flowing through the veins under the flesh. The pattern of the canes slices through the massed figures like the strokes of a knife, forming a Trinitarian triangle to the right of Christ's head. An inimitable Titian touch is the cane lying unused on the foremost step, still, shadowless and deadly, like a snake.|$|R
500|$|Several of Donna's pivotal episodes were {{selected}} as recommended viewing by critics. [...] "Myself, Coming Back", the series ten episode {{in which she}} goes on a road-trip and discovers the existence of her niece, Mia, was named a televisual highlight by the Daily Mirror, Birmingham Post, and Liverpool Daily Echo, with the latter publication deeming it [...] "refreshingly different" [...] following the [...] "doom and gloom" [...] of preceding episodes. Many regional newspapers named [...] "Promises", in which she decides to adopt Mia, a [...] "pick of the day", and Sarah Morgan of the Daily Record cited Jacobs' appearance as Donna in the premiere episode of Casualty twenty-fifth series as a positive example of the BBC [...] "pull <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> {{to make sure the}} first edition in this latest run is something of a cracker." ...|$|E
500|$|A Junior Vasquez remix of {{the song}} was {{performed}} at the 1995 Brit Awards. Madonna wore a white Versace dress and had long blonde extensions, her look being similar to the Versace advertisement campaign she was promoting at the time. She even invited Björk to feature in the performance; the singer turned it down, saying [...] "I {{was supposed to get}} [...] personal number and call her up, but it just didn't feel right. I'd love to meet her accidentally, really drunk in a bar. It's just all that formality that confuses me". The performance was ranked number four on Marie Claires [...] "30 Best Brit Award Moments" [...] list. It was described by the magazine as the [...] "best opening performance" [...] at the Brits. A writer described that [...] " [...] pulled <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops,</b> treating the audience to a light show and trio of satin-clad male dancers".|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{received}} orders on 8 June 1945, {{to report}} to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. At a 13 June San Antonio homecoming parade held for returning Texas veterans, {{a quarter of a}} million people cheered Murphy, Charles P. Cabell, Lucian Truscott, Harold L. Clark and others. He was then assigned to the Army Ground & Services Redistribution Station at the base and given 30 days leave. Murphy was the home grown hero, and on a visit to Dallas, the media followed his every move, interviewing and photographing him. Farmersville pulled <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops,</b> giving him an escort caravan, and five thousand local citizens showed up to hear a band concert and speeches in his honor. He was the star attraction at the 2 to 4 July McKinney rodeo where he opened the event every night. The 16 July issue of Life magazine brought Murphy national attention when its cover story proclaimed him [...] "most decorated" [...] next to a smiling image of him in full dress uniform. Photographers for the magazine followed him to a birthday party in his honor, to his first civilian haircut since 1942, and around to visit friends and relatives.|$|E

500|$|During 1957 Gielgud {{directed}} Berlioz's The Trojans at Covent Garden {{and played}} Prospero at Drury Lane, but the production {{central to his}} career over the late 1950s and into the 1960s was his one-man show The Ages of Man. He first appeared in this in 1956 and revived it every year until 1967. It was an anthology of Shakespearean speeches and sonnets, compiled by George Rylands, in which, wearing modern evening clothes on a plain stage, Gielgud recited the verses, with his own linking commentary. He performed it all over Britain, mainland Europe, Australasia and the US, including a performance at the White House in 1965. He found there were advantages to performing solo: [...] "You've {{no idea how much}} easier it is without a Juliet. When there's a beautiful girl above you on a balcony, or lying on a tomb with candles round her, naturally the audience look at her the whole time, and Romeo has to pull <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> to get any attention." [...] His performance on Broadway won him a Special Tony Award in 1959, and an audio recording in 1979 received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. He made many other recordings, both before and after this, including ten Shakespeare plays.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the 6000th episode of Neighbours would see Paul pushed from the mezzanine of Lassiter's Hotel. This then kicks off a whodunit storyline with Diana being one of six suspects. Susan Bower said that as the Neighbours team was developing the storyline, they decided to add to the story that Paul's financial situation leads to him embezzling, which in turn leads to Diana arriving. Badler said it was [...] "great" [...] {{to be involved in the}} storyline and said she was largely featured in the 6000th episode. [...] Diana becomes a suspect in the attempt on Paul's life because he jilts her [...] "in the boardroom and the bedroom". Paul then humiliates Diana and sends her packing from Lassiter's. On Diana's reason to kill Paul, Badler said [...] "Seeing her name splashed across the Erinsborough News prompts Diana to pull <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> in order to bring Paul down. And she still has friends in high places!" [...] Diana is seen placing a call asking for something to be taken care of and she hands money over to a stranger just before Paul is pushed. Following the attempt on Paul's life, Diana's earring is found at the scene and the police manage to catch her at the airport before she returns to America. Diana diverts the police attention to Rebecca by telling them that she revealed Paul's affair to her.|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{dealing with}} [...] "one {{of the most}} {{divisive}} issues in American society" [...] according to The New York Times, became a subject of controversy after its broadcast. The authors of The Marriage and Family Experience called it [...] "one of the more controversial episodes of a frequently controversial cartoon." [...] Several conservative groups and American Christian conservatives thought it was promoting same-sex marriage. Parents Television Council president L. Brent Bozell III criticized [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] for bringing up the issue. Even though {{he had not seen}} the episode himself, he commented that [...] "at a time when the public mood is overwhelmingly against gay marriage, any show that promotes gay marriage is deliberately bucking the public mood." [...] A researcher for the American Family Association, named Ed Vitagliano, claimed the presentation of same-sex marriage in the episode was [...] "very one-sided". He said that this episode proved [...] "Hollywood's blatant pro-homosexual bias" [...] because despite The Simpsons being [...] "generally kind of a wacky animated program" [...] it was not neutral on the issue. Bozell also worried about the influence the episode would have on children, despite the parental discretion advisory at the beginning, commenting: [...] "You've got a show watched by millions of children. Do children need to have gay marriage thrust in their faces as an issue? Why can't we just entertain them?" [...] Similarly, Vitagliano said that many children watch The Simpsons and Hollywood [...] "will pull <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> to promote same-sex marriage — and children will be influenced by it." ...|$|E

Furthermore, if the government could not take the steps necessary to win the war, then the public would elect an opposition who could. He claimed, amongst other things, that 80% of the population wanted conscription, and that the opposition that had emerged would be carried for the proposal by the end of the campaign. He ended his argument with the statement: [...] "Don't leave the boys in the trenches. Don't see them butchered. Don't leave them below their strength or you cover Australia with shame".|$|E

On why Toadie could be the culprit, a Holy Soap reporter wrote that he had [...] "already proved himself a man of questionable morals". Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) had not recovered from her heartbreak at being dumped by Paul hours after their wedding in 2006. Paul also destroyed her daughter, Steph's life by exposing her secret. Lyn was heard commenting that the world would be better off without Paul around. Diana Marshall became a suspect after Paul jilted her [...] "in the boardroom and the bedroom". Paul also humiliated Diana when he sent her packing from Lassiter's.

2500|$|The Cougars went to Des Moines to face {{surprising}} MVC co-leader Drake. The tenacious Bulldogs offense pulled <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> in {{the first}} half, outshooting SIUE 7–1, including six shots on goal and with Edel getting one past Dal Santo in the 24th minute to give Drake a 1–0 lead that they took into halftime. In the second half, the Cougars' offense moved to the fore, outshooting the Bulldogs 10–6 for the half. In the 55th minute, Bilyeu fired a cross through the box, and Danzy headed it in for his 3rd goal of the season. In the 71st minute, Wypych headed Edel's crossing pass in to put Drake back in the lead. Less than 2 1/2 minutes later, a Danzy shot [...] was saved, but the keeper could not corral the ball, and Danzy tapped the rebound into the net to again tie the score. In the first overtime period, the Bulldogs offense again rose up, outshooting SIUE 4–1, but the Cougars defense met the challenge to maintain the tie. Nearly halfway through the second extra period, Awad took possession and passed to Bilyeu. Bilyeu passed ahead to Gutierrez, who loosed a screamer from 35 yards out that went just past the diving Drake keeper to give SIUE the golden goal victory. Although Drake scored two goals, Dal Santo tied his career high with eight saves, while his teammates added three more. With their fifth consecutive win, the Cougars tied Drake for second in the MVC standings, with conference leader Bradley next up on the schedule.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one.

[...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E
