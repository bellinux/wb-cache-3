25|$|Barfly, {{released}} in 1987, is a semi-autobiographical film written by Bukowski and starring Mickey Rourke as Henry Chinaski, who represents Bukowski, and Faye Dunaway as his lover Wanda Wilcox.

25|$|Originally {{designed}} by Consolidated Aircraft as a patrol bomber {{with a long}} operational range, the PBY was soon adapted to fill a multitude of roles. With war planners becoming increasingly conscious {{to the possibility of}} a future conflict in the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. Navy invested millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s into developing flying boats. Flying boats had the advantage of not requiring runways, in effect leaving the entire ocean available for landing if weather conditions permitted. Several designs for flying boats were considered, with some being developed in small numbers, but the PBY was the most widely used and produced.|$|E
25|$|In September 2015, President Bachelet's {{approval}} rating was 24 percent, compared to 72 percent disapproval.

The couple's company (Caval) used the money to purchase land and resell it at a $5 million profit after repaying the loan.

He and his nemesis, Muhammad Ali, alternated over the years between public apologies and public insults. In 1996, when Ali lit the Olympic flame in Atlanta, Frazier told a reporter {{that he would like}} to throw Ali into the fire. Frazier made millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, but the article cited mismanagement of real-estate holdings as a partial explanation for his economic woes. Frazier stated repeatedly that he no longer had any bitter feelings towards Ali.

In 2013, the gym was named to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Hariri donated $12 {{million to}} Lebanese {{victims of the}} 1978 South Lebanon {{conflict}} and helped clean up Beirut's streets with his company's money and contributed to early reconstruction efforts during lulls in the Lebanon war. Said to have heavily financed opposing militias during the war, his former deputy Najah Wakim later accused him of helping to destroy downtown Beirut in order to rebuild it again and make billions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. After the conflict, he acted as an envoy of the Saudi royal family to Lebanon. He laid the groundwork {{that led to the}} 1989 Taif Accord, which Saudi Arabia organised to bring the warring factions together. Taif {{put an end to the}} civil war, building goodwill for Hariri politically. While acting as the Saudi envoy to Lebanon, he spent more time in Damascus than in Beirut where he ingratiated himself with the Assad regime; he had a new presidential palace built in Damascus as a gift to the Syrian dictator but Assad didn't use it personally.|$|E

Meanwhile, the character's business enterprises {{were said to have}} gained him millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dot-com bubble. The character's combat abilities were described as having progressed remarkably, and to have included training in multiple styles which he [...] "integrated" [...] into a hybrid fighting style.

5|$|The {{silver dollar}} {{had never been}} a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating <b>dollar</b> made <b>of</b> silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter century after that, the bullion value <b>of</b> a silver <b>dollar</b> did not exceed 70 cents. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks <b>of</b> silver <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates.

500|$|In early 1974, Kristofer Almås, Deputy Member of Parliament Carl I. Hagen, {{along with}} some others, broke away and formed the {{short-lived}} Reform Party. The background for this was a criticism of ALPs [...] "undemocratic organisation" [...] and lack of a real party program. However, in the same year, Anders Lange died; consequently Hagen stepped in as a regular Member of Parliament in Lange's place. As a result, the Reform Party merged back into ALP already the following year. The party adopted its current name, the Progress Party, on 29 January 1977, inspired by the great success of the Danish Progress Party. The Progress Party performed poorly in the 1977 parliamentary election, and was left without parliamentary representation. In the 1978 party convention, Carl I. Hagen was elected as party chairman. Hagen soon started to expand the political program of the party, and built a conventional party organisation, a step which Lange {{and some of his}} followers had opposed. The party's youth organisation, the Progress Party's Youth, was also established in 1978. Hagen succeeded in sharpening the image of the party as an anti-tax movement. His criticism of the wisdom of hoarding billions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Oil Fund" [...] hit a nerve owing to perceived declines in infrastructure, schools, and social services and long queues at hospitals.|$|E
500|$|The deal ended a {{diplomatic}} deadlock that brought US {{relations with the}} nuclear-armed South Asian nation to a near standstill and hindered counter-terrorism operations against Pakistan-based militants. Because of the supply lines closure the United States has spent at least an additional $100 million a month because it was instead forced to move supplies by air, rail or truck through Russia and other countries north of Afghanistan at much longer and more expensive routes. The closure of the supply lines complicated the American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, cost the United States more than $1 billion in extra shipping fees {{as a result of}} having to use the alternative routes through Central Asia and also held up delivery of thousands of armoured vehicles and other equipment meant for the fledgling Afghan army and police, slowing US efforts to build Afghan forces that can stand up to the Taliban insurgency as foreign troops withdraw. The reopening of the supply lines means that the US will save hundreds of millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> run-up to the withdrawal of NATO forces from the Afghanistan and also that it would help the US and NATO to complete its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan [...] "at a much lower cost" [...] according to Clinton. Despite the reopening of critical supply routes from Pakistan, the US military confronts a giant logistical challenge to wind down the war in Afghanistan because it must withdraw till the end of 2014 nearly 90,000 troops and enormous depots of military equipment accumulated over a decade of war which includes 100,000 shipping containers stuffed with materiel and 50,000 wheeled vehicles.|$|E
