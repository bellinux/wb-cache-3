40|$|International audienceSuccessive disease {{outbreaks}} in oyster (Crassostrea gigas) beds in France {{have resulted in}} dramatic losses in production, and subsequent decline in the <b>oyster-farming</b> industry. Deaths of juvenile oysters {{have been associated with}} the presence of a herpes virus (OsHV- 1 μvar) and bacterial populations of the genus Vibrio. Although the pathogenicity of OsHV- 1 μvar, as well as several strains of Vibrio has been demonstrated by experimental infections, our understanding of the complexity of infections occurring in the natural environment remains limited. In the present study, we use specific-pathogen-free (SPF) oysters infected in an estuarine environment to study the diversity and dynamics of cultured microbial populations during disease expression. We observe that rapid Vibrio colonization followed by viral replication precedes oyster death. No correlation was found between the vibrio concentration and viral load in co-infected animals. We show that the quantity of viral DNA is a predictor of mortality, however, in the absence of bacteria, a high load of herpes virus is not sufficient to induce the full expression of the disease. In addition, we demonstrate that juvenile mortalities can occur in the absence of herpes virus, indicating that the herpes virus appears neither essential nor sufficient to cause juvenile deaths; whereas bacteria are necessary for the disease. Finally, we demonstrate that oysters are a reservoir of putative pathogens, and that the geographic origin, age, and cultivation method of oysters influence disease expression...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntertidal flats of the estuarine macro-intertidal Baie des Veys (France) were {{investigated}} to identify spatial features of sediment and microphytobenthos (MPB) in April 2003. Gradients occurred within the domain, and patches were identified close to vegetated areas or within the <b>oyster-farming</b> areas where calm physical conditions and biodeposition altered the sediment and MPB landscapes. Spatial patterns of chl a content were explained {{primarily by the}} influence of sediment features, while bed elevation and compaction brought only minor insights into MPB distribution regulation. The smaller size of MPB patches compared to silt patches revealed the interplay between physical structure defining the sediment landscape, the biotic patches that they contain, and that median grain-size {{is the most important}} parameter in explaining the spatial pattern of MPB. Small-scale temporal dynamics of sediment chl a content and grain-size distribution were surveyed in parallel during 2 periods of 14 d to detect tidal and seasonal variations. Our results showed a weak relationship between mud fraction and MPB biomass in March, and this relationship fully disappeared in July. Tidal exposure was the most important parameter in explaining the summer temporal dynamics of MPB. This study reveals the general importance of bed elevation and tidal exposure in muddy habitats and that silt content was a prime governing physical factor in winter. Biostabilisation processes seemed to behave only as secondary factors that could only amplify the initial silt accumulation in summer rather than primary factors explaining spatial or long-term trends of sediment changes...|$|E
40|$|Dans le but de contribuer aux réflexions {{relatives}} à l’élargissement de la notion de performance, nous entendons traiter la question de la performance d’une filière économique dans une perspective située, à la fois dans l’espace et dans le temps, en mettant en lumière la variété des éléments constitutifs de la performance d’une part et l’existence de tensions, voire de contradictions entre ces éléments d’autre part. Dès lors, nous soutenons l’idée d’une diversité de modèles de production performants et insistons sur la nécessité d’identifier des indicateurs adaptés à cette diversité. Nous nous appuyons pour cela sur les outils conceptuels développés {{dans le cadre de}} l’économie patrimoniale. Nous illustrons notre propos en nous appuyant sur le cas de la filière ostréicole dans le Bassin d’Arcachon. This article {{deals with}} the question of the performance of an industry, viewed in its relations with the space and with the time. The purpose, which contributes to the literature relating to the broadening of the performance, is to insist on the variety of constituent elements of the performance {{on the one hand and}} on the existence of contradictions between these elements on the other hand. Thus, we assume the diversity of performing production models and we stress the importance to define indicators which take into account this diversity. To this end, the tools developed within the framework of the heritage economy are used. We refer to the case study of <b>oyster-farming</b> industry in the Arcachon Bay (France) to illustrate these points...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} bioturbation by macrofauna on the vertical distribution of living (stained) benthic foraminifera in marine intertidal sediments. We {{investigated the}} links between macrofaunal bioturbation and foraminiferal distribution, by sampling from stations situated on a gradient of perturbation by <b>oyster-farming,</b> which has a major effect on benthic faunal assemblages. Sediment cores were collected on the French Atlantic coast, from three intertidal stations: an oyster farm, an area without oysters but affected by oyster biodeposits, and a control station. Axial tomodensitometry (CT-scan) was used for three-dimensional visualization and two-dimensional analysis of the cores. Biogenic structure volumes were quantified and compared between cores. We collected the macrofauna, living foraminifera, shells and gravel from the cores after scanning, to validate image analysis. We did not investigate differences in the biogenic structure volume between cores. However, biogenic structure volume is not necessarily proportional {{to the extent of}} bioturbation in a core, given that many biodiffusive activities cannot be detected on CT-scans. Biodiffusors and larger gallery-diffusors were abundant in macrofaunal assemblage at the control station. By contrast, macrofaunal assemblages consisted principally of downward-conveyors at the two stations affected by oyster farming. At the control station, the vertical distribution of biogenic structures mainly built by the biodiffusor Scorbicularia piano and the large gallery-diffusor Hediste diversicolor was significantly correlated with the vertical profiles of living foraminifera in the sediment, whereas vertical distributions of foraminifera and downward-conveyors were not correlated at the station affected by oyster farming. This relationship was probably responsible for the collection of foraminifera in deep sediment layers (> 6 cm below the sediment surface) at the control station. As previously suggested for other species, oxygen diffusion may occur via the burrows built by S. piano and H. diversicolor, potentially increasing oxygen penetration and providing a favorable microhabitat for foraminifera in terms of oxygen levels. By contrast, the absence of living foraminifera below 6 cm at the stations affected by oyster farming was probably associated with a lack of biodiffusor and large gallery-diffusor bioturbation. Our findings suggest that the effect of macrofaunal bioturbation on the vertical distribution of foraminiferal assemblages in sediments depends on the effects of the macrofauna on bioirrigation and sediment oxidation, as deduced by Eh values, rather than on the biogenic structure volume produced by macrofauna. The loss of bioturbator functional diversity due to oyster farming may thus indirectly affect infaunal communities by suppressing favorable microhabitats produced by bioturbation...|$|E
