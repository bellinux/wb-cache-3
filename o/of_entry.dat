5000|$|A similar game, {{referred}} to as a [...] "Luring Lottery", was actually played by the editors of Scientific American in the 1980s. To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number [...] "1" [...] written on it. They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a single postcard bearing the number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> they wished to submit. The prize was one million dollars divided by the total number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry. Thus a reader who submitted a large number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> increased his or her chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize. It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one's average winnings in this game by submitting a number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> equal to the total number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>of</b> others. Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> being submitted.|$|R

5|$|Galveston {{became a}} major port <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> for illegal liquor from Mexico and Canada, shipped through the Caribbean and {{distributed}} from the island throughout Texas and to other destinations.

5|$|The Aurigids had a {{spectacular}} outburst in 1994, when many grazing meteors—those {{that have a}} shallow angle <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> and seem {{to rise from the}} horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though {{there were only a few}} visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by Peter Jenniskens and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.|$|E

5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E
