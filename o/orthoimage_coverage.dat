30|$|The mosaicElement {{association}} {{relationship in}} the OI theme serves to provide information describing the orthoimage mosaic, composed of a contiguous set of possibly irregular image areas (delimited by seamlines) whose range sets come from different orthorectified scenes, all having the same grid and the same range type. Each of these scenes {{is the result of}} orthorectifying an image (which is often in a conic projection) captured by means of an airborne sensor, at a specific date of acquisition. Such source images partially overlap each other, providing, for example, stereoscopic capabilities in the overlapping areas between two contiguous scenes. Therefore, the <b>orthoimage</b> <b>coverage</b> constitutes a mosaic composed of selected areas from the orthorectified scenes used for producing it.|$|E
