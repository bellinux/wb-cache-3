40|$|The {{alternative}} <b>outcome</b> {{refers to}} the <b>outcome</b> of the unselected option in decision-making tasks, which has significant influence on the chosen <b>outcome</b> evaluation. Most paradigms have presented the alternative <b>outcome</b> either after or simultaneous with the chosen <b>outcome,</b> which complicates the observation on the brain activity associated with the alternative <b>outcome.</b> To circumvent this perceived shortcoming, we modified the classic paradigm designed by Yeung and Sanfey (2004) such that the alternative <b>outcome</b> was presented before the chosen <b>outcome</b> in each trial while an electroencephalogram was recorded. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) elicited by the positive alternative <b>outcome</b> was larger than that elicited by the negative alternative <b>outcome,</b> suggesting that the participants evaluated the positive alternative <b>outcome</b> as negative feedback. Moreover, the FRN and the P 3 elicited by the chosen <b>outcome</b> were influenced by the valence of the alternative <b>outcome.</b> The current study reveals that the alternative <b>outcome</b> is treated as important information {{even though it is}} economically neutral...|$|R

This research tested the empirical foundation of these assumptions by conducting a meta-analytic review of the justice literature (N = 89 studies). This review revealed that <b>outcome</b> fairness is empirically distinguishable from <b>outcome</b> favorability. Specifically: (a) there is weaker evidence of the fair process effect when the criterion is <b>outcome</b> fairness than when it is <b>outcome</b> favorability, (b) <b>outcome</b> fairness has stronger effects than <b>outcome</b> favorability, and equally strong or stronger effects as procedural fairness {{on a host of}} variables, such as job turnover and organizational commitment, and (c) manipulations of <b>outcome</b> fairness and favorability have stronger effects on perceptions of procedural fairness than the converse...|$|R

On an individual level, institutions can look at what <b>outcomes</b> a student has achieved to decide what level the student would be at within a new institution.

The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease.

40|$|<b>Outcome</b> {{evaluation}} is a cognitive process that {{plays an important}} role in our daily lives. In most paradigms utilized in the field of experimental psychology, <b>outcome</b> valence and <b>outcome</b> magnitude are the two major features investigated. The classical "independent coding model" suggests that <b>outcome</b> valence and <b>outcome</b> magnitude are evaluated by separate neural mechanisms that may be mapped onto discrete event-related potential (ERP) components: feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P 3, respectively. To examine this model, we presented <b>outcome</b> valence and magnitude sequentially rather than simultaneously. The results reveal that when only <b>outcome</b> valence or magnitude is known, both the FRN and the P 3 encode that <b>outcome</b> feature; when both aspects of <b>outcome</b> are known, the cognitive functions of the two components dissociate: the FRN responds to the information available in the current context, while the P 3 pattern depends on <b>outcome</b> presentation sequence. The current study indicates that the human evaluative system, indexed in part by the FRN and the P 3, is more flexible than previous theories suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
