25|$|An {{experimental}} {{treatment was}} given to a Northern Irish teenager, Jonathan Simms, beginning in January 2003. The medication, called pentosan polysulphate (PPS) and used to treat interstitial cystitis, is infused into the patient's lateral ventricle within the brain.

The CJD Therapy Advisory Group to the UK Health Departments advises that data are not sufficient to support claims that pentosan polysulphate is an effective treatment and suggests that further research in animal models is appropriate. A 2007 review of the treatment of 26 patients with PPS finds no proof of efficacy because of the lack of accepted <b>objective</b> <b>criteria.</b>|$|E
25|$|Critics of the BCS National Championship {{argued against}} the {{internal}} validity of a so-called national championship being {{awarded to the}} winner of a single postseason game. Critics lamented that the participants were selected based upon polls, computer rankings, popularity and human biases, and not by on-field competition, as in other major sports and all other levels of college football, which employed tournament-format championships. Often, the BCS system led to controversies in which multiple teams finished the season with identical records, and voters distinguished the worthiness of {{their participation in the}} BCS National Championship with no set of formal criteria or standards. The end of the 2010 season {{was one of the best}} examples of this. Without any <b>objective</b> <b>criteria</b> for evaluation of the teams, the BCS forced voters to impose their own standards and tiebreakers. Critics noted that the system inherently fostered selection bias, and therefore lacked both internal validity and external validity.|$|E

25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree <b>objective</b> <b>criteria</b> (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E

Physically, this <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> identifies vortices as material tubes in which material elements do not align with directions suggested by the strain eigenvectors.

40|$|Most {{traditional}} clustering work {{assumes that}} the data is provided without measurement error. Often, however, real world data sets have such errors. Often one can obtain estimate of these errors. In the presence of such errors, popular clustering methods like k-means and hierarchical clustering may produce un-intuitive results. The fundamental question that this paper addresses is: “What is an appropriate clustering method {{in the presence of}} measurement errors associated with data? ” In {{the first half of the}} paper we propose using maximum likelihood principle to obtain an <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> for clustering that incorporates information about the errors associated with data. The <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> provides a basis for several clustering algorithms that are generalizations of the k-means algorithm and Ward’s hierarchical clustering. The <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> has scale-invariance property so that the clustering results are independent of units of measuring data. We also provide a heuristic solution to obtain the correct number of clusters which in itself is a challenging problem. In the second half, we focus on two applications of error-based clustering: (a) regression coefficients clustering and (b) seasonality estimation in retail merchandizing, where it outperforms the k-means and Ward’s hierarchical clustering...|$|R

2500|$|Criticisms {{directed}} against Esperanto and other early auxiliary languages {{in the late}} 19th century included the idea that different races have sufficiently different speech organs that an international language might work locally in Europe, but hardly worldwide, and the prediction that if adopted, such an auxlang would rapidly break up into local dialects. Advances in linguistics have done away with the first of these, and the limited but significant use of Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua on an international scale, without breakup into unintelligible dialects, has shown that either a rapid break-up into dialects shall not happen too soon in the future, or that there is enough constant 'standardisation' to reduce {{the diversity of the}} language. Subsequently, much criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of these auxlangs, or on the argumentativeness of auxlang proponents and their failure to agree on one auxlang, or even on <b>objective</b> <b>criteria</b> by which to judge auxlangs. [...] However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs and work well enough for that purpose.|$|E
