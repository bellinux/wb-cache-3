40|$|Çetin, E. T. (Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey). Hemolysin-inhibiting {{substance}} in Staphylococcus aureus strains. J. Bacteriol. 86 : 407 – 413. 1963. —Of 144 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from pathological specimens, 3. 4 % {{did not cause}} hemolysis on sheep blood agar; the remainder produced hemolytic and semihemolytic zones, {{most of which were}} surrounded by a dense <b>red</b> <b>band.</b> Most of the strains causing pronounced hemolysis and a large dense <b>red</b> <b>band</b> on sheep blood agar also produced a dense <b>red</b> <b>band</b> on human blood agar after incubation at 37 C for about 1 week. In the dense <b>red</b> <b>band</b> on human blood agar, circles of hemolysis were observed when petri dishes were kept at room temperature for approximately 1 more week. The dense <b>red</b> <b>band</b> inhibited delta hemolysis of some of the S. aureus strains growing nearby. Certain strains failing to produce the dense <b>red</b> <b>band</b> on human blood agar inhibited delta hemolysis of other strains grown near them. A hemolysis-inhibiting substance (HIS) was produced in broth and agar media, and could be extracted from agar cultures. HIS was stable for 1 hr at 56 C and for 15 min at 100 C. It lost 75 % of its effect when heated for 30 min at 100 C and became ineffective when heated at the same temperature for 45 min. Conditioned hemolysis occurred when some saprophytic gram-positive bacteria grew near or within the dense <b>red</b> <b>band.</b> These organisms also produced conditioned hemolysis without the presence of a visible dense <b>red</b> <b>band,</b> when growing near the strains inhibiting delta hemolysis. When such strains were grown on human blood agar, a conditioned hemolysis also occurred after the border of the medium was flamed...|$|R

50|$|In the UK during 2004, {{following}} {{complaints from}} the public about postal carriers creating litter by discarding the rubber bands which they used to keep their mail together, the Royal Mail introduced <b>red</b> <b>bands</b> for their workers to use: it was hoped that, as the bands were easier to spot than the traditional brown ones and since only the Royal Mail used them, employees would see (and feel compelled to pick up) any <b>red</b> <b>bands</b> which they had inadvertently dropped.
