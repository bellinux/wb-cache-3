5000|$|SKiPPER is {{a domain}} {{specific}} skeleton library for vision applications [...] which provides skeletons in CAML, and thus relies on CAML for type safety. Skeletons {{are presented in}} two ways: declarative and operational. Declarative skeletons are directly used by programmers, while their operational versions provide an architecture specific target implementation. From the runtime environment, CAML skeleton specifications, and application specific functions (provided in C by the programmer), new C code is generated and compiled to run the application on the target architecture. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> about SKiPPER is that the skeleton program can be executed sequentially for debugging.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Richard {{has worked}} closely {{with a large number}} of Ministers and took the {{impartiality}} and professionalism of the civil service very seriously. His efforts to communicate the nature of this relationship were not, however, always successful. In his oral evidence to the House of Commons Public Administration Committee on 7 March 2002 (Q346), he said [...] "... <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> about the Civil Service, which I do not think Ministers understand sufficiently clearly, despite our efforts constantly to tell them, {{is that it is a}} fantastically loyal institution to Ministers. What the Civil Service wants, and I always compare it to a rather stupid dog, it wants to do what its master wants and it wants to be loyal to its master and above all it wants to be loved for doing that and I am not sure Ministers understand that. When I said [...] "stupid dog", of course I meant a superbly well-educated dog, particularly those brought up in Nissen huts." [...] He later said that he realised that this analogy was a [...] "tremendous mistake" [...] (Note by Witness, same report).|$|E
50|$|I wish we hadn't {{used all}} the keys on the keyboard. I think <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> is that vi {{is really a}} mode-based editor. I think as mode-based editors go, it's pretty good. One {{of the good things}} about EMACS, though, is its {{programmability}} and the modelessness. Those are two ideas which never occurred to me. I also wasn't very good at optimizing code when I wrote vi. I think the redisplay module of the editor is almost intractable. It does a really good job for what it does, but when you're writing programs as you're learning... That's why I stopped working on it.What actually happened was that I {{was in the process of}} adding multiwindows to vi when we installed our VAX, which would have been in December of '78. We didn't have any backups and the tape drive broke. I continued to work even without being able to do backups. And then the source code got scrunched and I didn't have a complete listing. I had almost rewritten all of the display code for windows, and that was when I gave up. After that, I went back to the previous version and just documented the code, finished the manual and closed it off. If that scrunch had not happened, vi would have multiple windows, and I might have put in some programmability—but I don't know.The fundamental problem with vi is that it doesn't have a mouse and therefore you've got all these commands. In some sense, its backwards from the kind of thing you'd get from a mouse-oriented thing. I think multiple levels of undo would be wonderful, too. But fundamentally, vi is still ed inside. You can't really fool it.It's like one of those pinatas—things that have candy inside but has layer after layer of paper mache on top. It doesn't really have a unified concept. I think if I were going to go back—I wouldn't go back, but start over again.|$|E

40|$|Cultures {{around the}} world have used plants as medi-cine since before humans evolved from their an-cestor species. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> about the way that {{traditional}} cultures use plants for medicine is that cultures in very distant locations use the same plant for the same ailment. For example, plantain (Plantago major and other species) grows everywhere in the world, and it is used for the same ailments by the people in whose homeland it grows. That is, they use it primarily for skin problems—eruptions, boils, burns, cuts, insect bites, and so forth. Primitive peoples didn’t need laboratory studies and analyses to know which healing properties the plants around them contained or how to use them. All of our ancestors were herbalists! What does differ from culture to culture are the methods of preparing various plants as medicine—there are many methods of preparing plan...|$|E

40|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> {{about drug}} trials {{is that you}} often {{discover}} that your drug does something you never expected. This is usually bad, of course, and severe side effects have derailed more than one promising new compound. But sometimes, the side effect is more interesting, and may be more promising, than the original reason you tested the drug in the first place. This scenario is not as uncommon as you might imagine, and has {{played out in the}} diabetes world on several occasions that I am aware of. For example, sulfonylurea drugs, long the mainstay of oral diabetes drugs in this country, were originally investigated as antibiotics. Thiazolidinediones (such as Avandia™ and Actos™) were created as lipid-lowering drugs, but were found to have more potent effects on blood sugar than on cholesterol levels. There are now two new reports on anti-obesity agents that were originally developed to treat brain disorders like epilepsy and ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). When tested for their original indications they were found to cause significant weight loss, even in non-obese patients. Recognizing that ther...|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{behavior}} in the health marketplace is an interesting subject. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> about studying medical care is that different people experience different results after having the same health care. For example, in the Massachusetts presidential primary that took place some time ago, one of the voting machines somehow got hooked up to an X-ray device, and, as a result, three voters were exposed to doses of radiation. One of the exposed was a conservative, one was a liberal, and one was an independent.

However, it can mislead the implied meaning of the movie itself. Therefore, the writer is interested in finding out {{the right way to}} get the implied meaning of conversation in a movie, especially the conversation that flouted the maxims. In this research, the writer used the theory of conversational implicature and flouting of maxims by Grice (1975). In addition, the context of situation by Hymes (1964) is used to get the implied meaning more easily. Furthermore, the data is the conversations among the main characters, that is, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger in ?Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire? movie which provide many examples of responding utterances that flouted the maxims. In analyzing the data, first, the writer found the conversation that flouted the maxims based on the context and the scene. Second, the writer classified the types of the maxims. Then, the writer analyzed the implied meaning based on the context of situation. The result of the analysis shows that the context of situation gave contribution in analyzing the implied meaning...|$|E
40|$|With {{a little}} bit of imagination, the Periodic Table of Elements {{can be seen as a}} rather strange and inelegant crossword puzzle, which is {{asymmetrical}} in form and contains such bizarre words like 2 ̆ 2 RbSrYZrNbMoTcRuRhPd 2 ̆ 2 and HLiNaKCuRbAgCaAuFr 2 ̆ 2. After major readjustments, here is a crossword puzzle that solves some of those problems. Each square of the solution contains an element, which, when combined, completes a real word. Some elements are used more often than others, of course, and some are not used at all. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> about this crossword is that it is not always clear from the boxes how many letters are in any given word, since most elements contain two letters.

40|$|I am a great {{devotee of}} cross country skiing, so tuning in on these events during the Winter Olympics {{is one of}} my {{favorite}} pastimes. In the 2010 Olympics, the final of the women’s 30 K Classic Race was a real cliff hanger and a joy to behold. It had been forecast (and this certainly is a forecast in the sense that it would be readily verifiable on a short timescale) that the battle for the Gold would be between one of the Norwegian and one of the Polish competitors. This turned out to be a very accurate forecast. They were neck-and-neck (or ski tip-to-ski tip) for the last 200 m, with the lead switching back and forth by centimeters. In the end the Polish contestant inched (or “centimetered”) out the Norwegian, and it was declared a photo finish. This event brought to mind some of the issues surrounding the topic of uncertainty and how people cope with it in relation to decision making. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> about uncertainty is its absolute necessity for the entertainment value of competitive sporting events.
