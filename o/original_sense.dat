Several historians have proposed instead that in early times, and certainly as late as the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Laithlinn refers to the Norse and Norse-Gael lands in the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of mainland Scotland.

5|$|The {{specific}} epithet of the Sind sparrow, pyrrhonotus, {{comes from}} the Greek purrhos ("flame-coloured"), and -nōtos ("-backed"). E. C. Stuart Baker suggested the English name rufous-backed sparrow, but as this name might cause confusion with other species, Ticehurst suggested the name Sind jungle-sparrow, which became the accepted name for the species. This name refers to Sindh, a province now in Pakistan which makes up {{a large part of}} the Sind sparrow's range, and the jungle habitat of the bird (in the word's <b>original</b> <b>sense</b> of tangled dry thicket). This name is shortened to jungle sparrow or Sind sparrow, of which the first was used in the IOC World Bird List, until Sind sparrow was adopted in 2009.|$|E

40|$|Data {{credibility}} {{is a crucial}} issue in mobile crowd sensing (MCS) and, more generally, people-centric Internet of Things (IoT). Prior work takes approaches such as incentive mechanism design and data mining to address this issue, while overlooking the power of crowds itself, which we exploit in this paper. In particular, we propose a cross validation approach which seeks a validating crowd to verify the data credibility of the <b>original</b> <b>sensing</b> crowd, and uses the verification result to reshape the <b>original</b> <b>sensing</b> dataset into a more credible posterior belief of the ground truth. Following this approach, we design a specific cross validation mechanism, which integrates four sampling techniques with a privacy-aware competency-adaptive push (PACAP) algorithm and is applicable to time-sensitive and quality-critical MCS applications. It does not require redesigning a new MCS system but rather functions as a lightweight "plug-in", {{making it easier for}} practical adoption. Our results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism substantially improves data credibility in terms of both reinforcing obscure truths and scavenging hidden truths.

25|$|Historian J.M. Andre {{concludes that}} the <b>original</b> <b>sense</b> of otium was related to {{military}} service and the idleness {{that happened in the}} winter, as opposed to the business (negotium) {{of the rest of the}} year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium. Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E

This resulted in a sensor that started sooner and responded faster.|$|R

500|$|During the 7th century, {{most of the}} Balkans were {{overrun by}} Slavic invasions, which left only the {{fortified}} towns and the coasts {{in the hands of}} the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire. [...] "Macedonia" [...] was then used for a new theme in the late 8th century under Irene of Athens. Geographically however it was located in Thrace and not in Macedonia, which was under the themes of Thessalonica, Strymon and other smaller commands such as Boleron or Drougoubiteia. Themes were not named geographically and the <b>original</b> <b>sense</b> was [...] "army". They became districts during the military and fiscal crisis of the seventh century, when the Byzantine armies were instructed to find their supplies from the locals, wherever they happened to be. Thus the Armeniac theme was considerably west of Armenia; the Thracesian Theme was in Asia Minor, not in Thrace. The Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, Basil I the Macedonian, an Armenian by descent, who was born in the theme of Macedonia.|$|E

At the same time, the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a related, similarly venerable tradition: [...] "nudie" [...] films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like Bettie Page had simply been the softcore pornography of previous decades. As far back as 1933, This Nude World was [...] "Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced!" [...] In the late 1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters devoted themselves specifically to [...] "adult" [...] product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with greater attention to plot. Best known was Russ Meyer, who released his first successful narrative nudie, the comic Immoral Mr. Teas, in 1959. Five years later, Meyer came out with his breakthrough film, Lorna, which combined sex, violence, and a dramatic storyline. Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965), made for about $45,000, would ultimately become {{the most famous of}} Meyer's sexploitation pictures. Crafted for constant titillation but containing no nudity, it was aimed at the same [...] "passion pit" [...] drive-in circuit that screened AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (1966), starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Roger Corman's The Trip (1967) for American International, written by veteran AIP/Corman actor Jack Nicholson, never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, but flirts with nudity throughout.

500|$|According to Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe, a U.S. {{literary}} journal, the film's {{audiences are}} likely to have the preconception that human trafficking is not slavery in the same sense that the Atlantic slave trade was, and many people believe that slavery was abolished a long time ago with such instruments as the U.S. Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. Rhodes writes that society now uses the word [...] "slavery" [...] in modern contexts only as a metaphor, so that references to actual contemporary slavery can be dismissed as hyperbole, and she describes the film's goal as to [...] "reclaim the original term [...] and convince us that what is happening now is what happened then: highly organized and pervasive, intentional, highly profitable and... fully as coercive and wantonly cruel." [...] Rhodes says that the word [...] "slavery" [...] has started to be used in its <b>original</b> <b>sense</b> again in recent years, but that audiences' views on contemporary slavery are nonetheless influenced by the slave-like imagery in such films as Hustle & Flow (2005) and Black Snake Moan (2007). The Academy Award-winning Hustle & Flow portrays a pimp as the hero, while Black Snake Moan features Christina Ricci as a young nymphomaniac; the marketing for Black Snake Moan centered on evocative, sexualized slave imagery, including a scantily-clad Ricci in chains. According to Rhodes, Bilheimer [...] "rescue modern slaves from representation as exotic creatures, to restore their humanity" [...] and allow audiences to relate to them. For this purpose, Bilheimer tells stories of individuals {{in the context of their}} communities and families. While Bilheimer had previously done extensive social justice work with religious organizations, he did not proselytize in the film, despite the many opportunities the film afforded him to do so.|$|E

Many advocate using the more recent and nuanced alternate terms when describing criminals and others who negatively take advantage of security flaws in software and hardware. Others prefer to follow common popular usage, arguing that the positive form is confusing and unlikely to become widespread in the general public.

40|$|International audienceWireless {{sensor network}} {{consists}} {{of a large number}} of low-power, short-lived, unreliable sensors. One fundamental issue in this kind of networks is the textbf{coverage} problem, that reflects how well the target area is monitored by sensors. According to the coverage concept, many works have introduced nodes-scheduling methods to increase the system lifetime, as well as to maintain sufficient coverage and reliability. Node-scheduling allows to turn off redundant sensors. In this paper, we propose a node-scheduling algorithm, that reduces system overall energy consumption, therefore increasing system lifetime, by turning off redundant nodes. The proposed scheduling method is based on one-hop remaining energy neighbouring knowledge. This algorithm gives an optimal node-schedul that maintains the <b>original</b> <b>sensing</b> coverage after turning off redundant nodes...|$|R

Modifying this coupling strength from a weak to a strong regime controls the helicity of the scattered field. Finally, we introduce an <b>original</b> <b>sensing</b> approach that relies on the rotation of the incident polarization and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0. 23 deg·nm− 1 or 33 deg·RIU− 1, related to changes of mechanical dimensions and the refractive index, respectively...|$|R
