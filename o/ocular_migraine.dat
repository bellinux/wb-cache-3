50|$|Retinal {{migraine}} (also {{known as}} ophthalmic migraine, and <b>ocular</b> <b>migraine)</b> is a retinal disease {{often accompanied by}} migraine headache and typically affects only one eye. It is caused by ischaemia or vascular spasm in or behind the affected eye.|$|E
50|$|Scintillating scotoma, {{also called}} visual migraine, {{is the most}} common visual aura {{preceding}} migraine and was first described by 19th-century physician Hubert Airy (1838-1903). It may precede a migraine headache, but can also occur acephalgically (without headache). It is often confused with <b>ocular</b> <b>migraine,</b> which originates in the eyeball or socket.|$|E
50|$|Acephalgic {{migraine}} is {{a neurological}} syndrome. It is {{a variant of}} migraine in which the patient may experience aura symptoms such as scintillating scotoma, nausea, photophobia, hemiparesis and other migraine symptoms but does not experience headache. Acephalgic migraine is {{also referred to as}} amigrainous migraine, <b>ocular</b> <b>migraine,</b> ophthalmic migraine or optical migraine, last three being misnomers.|$|E
50|$|These {{symptoms}} {{may indicate}} an underlying disease state and necessitate seeing a medical practitioner. Etiologies associated with pathological visual illusions include multiple types of <b>ocular</b> disease, <b>migraines,</b> hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, head trauma, and prescription drugs. If a medical work-up does not reveal {{a cause of}} the pathological visual illusions, the idiopathic visual disturbances could be analogous to the altered excitability state seen in visual aura with no migraine headache. If the visual illusions are diffuse and persistent, they often affect the patient's quality of life. These symptoms are often refractory to treatment and {{may be caused by}} any of the aforementioned etiologes, but are often idiopathic. There is no standard treatment for these visual disturbances.|$|R

We describe an unusual complication of a common disease: stroke presenting in a man recently diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica. Initial inflammatory markers were misleading. We discuss pitfalls in diagnosis, and approach to management. 1. Case History A 63 -year-old businessman presented to the emergency department (ED) with transient left arm weakness, expressive dysphasia, left facial droop, and muscle aches. He had attended his general practitioner (GP) one month previously with aches and pains: his GP diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and commenced steroid treatment with significant improvement. Before starting steroids, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was mildly elevated at 22 mm/hr; C-reactive protein (CRP) had been modestly elevated (46 mg/L). The patient had stopped steroids two days prior to admission, with relapse of symptoms. His medical history was significant for <b>ocular</b> <b>migraines,</b> angina, an upper limb deep venous thrombosis 25 years ago, and a pulmonary emoblism post-angiogram 9 months ago. On examination, reduced power was noted {{in his left hand}} with normal speech, no visual field abnormalities, and no facial droop. Investigations included a normal ESR and CRP. Computed tomography of brain was normal, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and C-spine (Figure 1) showed a subacute right posterior parietal infarct with C 3 -C 4 posterior disc bulge. His left upper limb weakness was not attributed to cervical myelopathy. Ultrasound of carotids showed no significant stenosis. Antinuclear antibody assay was negative, as were antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and rheumatoid factor. A thrombophilia screen was negative...|$|R
5000|$|The terms [...] "retinal migraine" [...] and [...] "ocular migraine" [...] {{are often}} {{confused}} with [...] "visual migraine", {{which is a}} far-more-common symptom of vision loss, resulting from the aura phase of the common migraine. The aura phase of migraine can occur {{with or without a}} headache. <b>Ocular</b> or retinal <b>migraines</b> happen in the eye, so only affect the vision in that eye, while visual migraines occur in the brain, so affect the vision in both eyes together. Visual migraines result from cortical spreading depression and are also commonly termed scintillating scotoma.|$|R
50|$|Acephalgic {{migraine}} (also called acephalalgic migraine, migraine aura without headache, amigrainous migraine, isolated visual migraine, {{and optical}} migraine) is a neurological syndrome. It {{is a relatively}} uncommon variant of migraine in which the patient may experience aura, nausea, photophobia, hemiparesis, and other migraine symptoms, but does not experience headache. It is generally classified as an event fulfilling the conditions of migraine with aura with no (or minimal) headache. It is sometimes distinguished from visual-only migraine aura without headache, also called <b>ocular</b> <b>migraine.</b>|$|E
40|$|A case of {{bilateral}} cilio-retinal artery occlusion {{in a patient}} with classic migraine is described.

This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and workup of patients presenting with transient vision loss, focusing on several key areas: the relationship to thromboembolic vascular disease, hypercoagulable testing, retinal migraine, and bilateral vision loss. The objective is to provide the ophthalmologist with {{information on how to}} best manage these patients. Thromboembolic etiologies for transient vision loss are sometimes managed with medications, but when carotid surgery is indicated, earlier intervention may prevent future stroke. This need for early treatment places the ophthalmologist in the important role of expediting the management process. Hospital admission is recommended in patients presenting with transient symptoms within 72 hours who meet certain high-risk criteria. When the cause is giant cell arteritis, ocular ischemic syndrome, or a cardioembolic source, early management of the underlying condition is equally important. For nonthromboembolic causes of transient vision loss such as retinal migraine or retinal vasospasm, the ophthalmologist can provide reassurance as well as potentially give medications to decrease the frequency of vision loss episodes.

40|$|Migraine {{has never}} been {{reported}} as a complication of transseptal puncture for ablation of atrial fibrillation. We studied its incidence before and after such procedures after observing some striking new migraine in several patients. A total of 8 % of procedures for pulmonary vein isolation with a 15 Fr sheath used for transseptal puncture were associated with new headache with <b>ocular</b> symptoms or <b>migraine</b> within three months. Exacerbation of pre-existing migraine was reported in another 7 % of procedures. More complaints were seen in redo procedures. The questionnaires were performed at {{three months after the}} intervention and there was no more evidence of persisting flow over the atrial septum at that time, when most complaints had already disappeared. This has important implications for follow-up after ablation for atrial fibrillation. (Neth Heart J 2010; 18 : 374 – 5. ...|$|R
40|$|A esp?cie Goupia glabra Aublet (Goupiaceae), denominada popularmente como cupi?ba, ? utilizada na {{medicina}} popular contra diversas doen?as. Suas cascas s?o utilizadas como analg?sico dent?rio, como verm?fugo, no tratamento de mal?ria, catapora e eczema. As folhas s?o utilizadas contra s?filis, doen?as oculares, enxaqueca, var?ola e como cicatrizante. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo quantificar compostos fen?licos e avaliar as atividades antioxidante, inibidora de acetilcolinesterase, toxicidade em Artemia salina, antitumoral e antimicrobiana de extratos de folhas, galhos finos e galhos grossos de cupi?ba. O material seco foi triturado e submetido ? extra??o em aparelho de Soxhlet com solventes de polaridade crescente (Hexano, AcOEt e MeOH). A prospec??o fitoqu?mica foi realizada para diferentes classes de metab?litos, sendo observados resultados positivos para ester?is em todos os extratos, triterpen?ides e algumas classes de flavon?ides nos extratos obtidos em acetato de etila e metanol. O fracionamento do extrato em hexano de folhas (EHF) resultou no isolamento de uma mistura de ?-sitosterol e estigmasterol. Do extrato em AcOEt de folhas (EAF) foi isolado o catecol, um fenol simples de distribui??o restrita na natureza. O conte?do de fen?licos totais dos extratos foi determinado utilizando o reagente de Folin-Ciocalteau e o resultado foi expresso em equivalentes de ?cido g?lico (EAG). A atividade antioxidante foi avaliada atrav?s da capacidade seq?estrante do radical est?vel 2, 2 -difenil- 1 -picrilhidrazil (DPPH), utilizando quercetina como padr?o externo, expressos como valores de Concentra??o eficiente (CE 50). Foi observada uma correla??o positiva entre os fen?licos totais e a CE 50, ou seja, quanto maior a quantidade de fen?licos, menor a CE 50. O extrato em AcOEt das folhas (EAF) foi o que apresentou maior potencial antioxidante [CE 50 = 9, 76 ? 0, 42 ?g/mL (cubeta) e CE 50 = 19, 87 ? 0, 31 ?g/mL (microplaca) ]. A toxicidade dos extratos foi verificada atrav?s de bioensaios com microcrust?ceo A. salina e expressa em % de mortalidade das larvas. A an?lise qualitativa da atividade anticolinesterase foi realizada de acordo com o m?todo de Ellman (modificado), com resultados negativos para inibi??o da enzima acetilcolinesterase. A atividade antitumoral foi avaliada contra quatro linhagens de c?lulas (leucemia, mama, c?lon e glioblastoma) utilizando m?todo de an?lise colorim?trica baseada na convers?o do sal 3 -(4, 5 -dimetil- 2 -tiazol) - 2, 5 -difenil- 2 -H-brometo de tetrazonium (MTT) em azul de formazam segundo o m?todo de Mossman. Os melhores resultados foram observados para os extratos obtidos em AcOEt, principalmente para c?lulas HCT- 8 (c?lon) que variaram de 58, 35 a 77, 12 %. O extrato obtido em AcOEt dos galhos grossos (EAGg) apresentou valor de CI 50 = 13, 73 ?g/mL para a linhagem HL- 60 (leucemia). Esse extrato foi fracionado e a fra??o EAGg 5 apresentou percentual de inibi??o de crescimento celular de 85, 37 e 101, 37 % para as linhagens SF- 295 (glioblastoma) e MDAMB- 435 (mama), respectivamente. A avalia??o da atividade antimicrobiana foi realizada pelo m?todo da concentra??o inibit?ria m?nima (MIC) que foi determinada pela t?cnica da microdilui??o em caldo M?eller-Hinton para bact?rias (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli e Pseudomonas aeruginosa) e em meio l?quido Sabouraud para fungos (Candida albicans, C. tropicalis e C. parapsilosis). Todos os extratos demonstraram algum grau de atividade bacteriana e fungicida, com destaque para os extratos obtidos em AcOEt que apresentaram inibi??o moderada de crescimento microbiano. Para avaliar o efeito dos extratos no crescimento dos protozo?rios foi realizado estudo {{in vitro}} com formas promastigotas de Leishmania amazonensis e epimastigotas de Trypanosoma cruzi. O extrato EAGg mostrou atividade antiproliferativa, tanto contra L. amazonensis quanto para T. cruzi, com valores de IC 50 de 86 e 40 ?g/mL, respectivamente. A significativa atividade antioxidante, antitumoral e antimicrobiana observada nos extratos de cupi?ba destaca seu elevado potencial para a obten??o de produtos biotecnol?gicos. The species Goupia glabra Aublet (Goupiaceae), {{popularly known as}} cupi?ba is used in popular medicine against several diseases. Their barks are used as dental analgesic, as a vermifuge, to treat malaria, chickenpox and eczema. The leaves are used against syphilis, <b>ocular</b> disorders, <b>migraine,</b> smallpox and as healing. This study aimed to quantify the phenolic compounds and evaluate the antioxidant, inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, brine shrimp toxicity, antitumor and antimicrobial activities of extracts of leaves, thin and thick branches of cupi?ba. The dry material was crushed and subjected to Soxhlet extraction using solvents in increasing order of polarity (hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol). The phytochemical screening was performed for different classes of metabolites, observed positive results for sterols in all extracts and terpenoids and some classes of flavonoids in the extracts obtained in ethyl acetate and methanol. The fractionation of the hexane extract of leaves (EHF) resulted in the isolation of a mixture composed by ?-sitosterol and stigmasterol. From ethyl acetate extract of leaves (EAF) was isolated catechol, a simple phenol with restricted distribution in nature. The total phenolic content of extracts was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau {{and the result was}} expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The antioxidant activity was assessed by the ability of capturing the stable radical 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), using quercetin as external standard, expressed as value of the effective concentration (EC 50). We observed a positive correlation between total phenolics and EC 50, ie as greater the amount of phenolics smaller is the EC 50. The ethyl acetate extract of the leaves (EAF) presented the highest antioxidant potential [EC 50 = 9. 76 ? 0. 42 ?g/mL (quartz cuvette) and EC 50 = 19. 87 ? 0. 31 ?g/mL (microplate) ]. The toxicity of the extracts was verified by bioassays with microcrustacea A. salina and expressed in percentual mortality of nauplius. Qualitative analysis of anticholinesterase activity was performed according to the method of Ellman (modified), presenting negative results. The antitumor activity was evaluated against four cell lines (leukemia, breast, colon and glioblastoma) using colorimetric analysis method based on conversion of salt 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thiazole) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 -H-tetrazonium bromide (MTT) into blue formazam by the method of Mossman. The best results were observed for the ethyl acetate extracts, especially for cells HCT- 8 (colon) that ranged from 58. 35 to 77. 12 %. The ethyl acetate extract obtained from thick branches (EAGg) showed values of IC 50 = 13. 73 ?g/mL for strain HL- 60 (leukemia). This extract was fractionated and the fraction EAGg 5 showed the percentage of cell growth inhibition of 85. 37 and 101. 37 % for the lines SF- 295 (glioblastoma) and MDAMB- 435 (breast), respectively. The antimicrobial activity was conducted using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) that was determined by microdilution in Mueller-Hinton broth for bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and in liquid Sabouraud for fungi (Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis). All extracts showed some degree of bacterial and fungicidal activity, especially the ethyl acetate extracts which showed moderate inhibition of microbial growth. The effect of extracts on growth of protozoa in vitro study was evaluated with promastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis and epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi. EAGg extract showed antiproliferative activity against both L. amazonensis and T. cruzi, with IC 50 values of 86 and 40 ?g/mL, respectively. The significant antioxidant, antitumor and antimicrobial activities observed in the extracts of cupiuba detaches its high potential for obtaining of biotechnological products...|$|R
