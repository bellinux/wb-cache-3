25|$|Dr Oliver, I was told, … had a liking and a ′flair′ for the {{invention}} of simple appliances, with which observations and experiments could {{be made on the}} human subject. Dr Oliver had invented a small instrument with which he claimed to be able to measure, through the unbroken skin, the diameter of a living artery, such as the radial artery at the wrist. He appears to have used his family in his experiments, and a young son {{was the subject of a}} series, in which Dr Oliver measured the diameter of the radial artery, and observed the effect upon it of injecting extracts of various animal glands under the skin. … We may picture, then, Professor Schafer, in the old physiological laboratory at University College, … finishing an experiment of some kind, in which he was recording the arterial blood pressure of an anaesthetised dog. … To him enters Dr Oliver, with the story of the experiments on his boy, and, in particular, with the statement that injection under the skin of a glycerin extract from calf’s suprarenal gland was followed by a definite narrowing of the radial artery. Professor Schafer is said to have been entirely sceptical, and to have attributed the observation to self-delusion. … He can hardly be blamed, I think; knowing even what we now know about the action of this extract, which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> be prepared to believe that injecting it under a boy’s skin would cause his radial artery to become measurably more slender? Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket. So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ′like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,′ watching the mercury rise in the manometer with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E

500|$|In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger {{forces were}} assembled. Bernard Shaw, {{in his role}} as a music critic, commented, [...] "The stale wonderment which the great chorus never fails to elicit has already been exhausted"; he later wrote, [...] "Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous {{dullness}} of a Handel Festival does not somebody set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James's Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists? Most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die." [...] The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts. Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions, had [...] the appropriate instruments been available in his day. Shaw argued, largely unheeded, that [...] "the composer may be spared from his friends, and the function of writing or selecting 'additional orchestral accompaniments' exercised with due discretion." ...|$|E

500|$|Both Jim Uttley of Indian Life Newspaper and Pastor Jamie Bagley of The News of Cumberland County called Nefarious [...] "hard-hitting". Uttley further {{asserted}} that Nefarious [...] "is {{not an easy}} film to watch because it deals with a subject that most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> rather ignore", {{and he went on}} to highly recommend the film. Jimmy Stewart of Charisma reported that the film gives a human face to trafficking statistics and instils a desire in the viewer {{to put an end to}} such criminal activity. Ted Baehr of Movieguide, a Christian magazine, called the film [...] "a powerful, compelling and transformational documentary about human trafficking and sex slavery" [...] and wrote that it was amazing that the film covered an inherently sexual topic both honestly and without nudity. Baehr praised the cinematography, editing, and filmmaking, but criticized some portions of the film as being repetitive and uncompelling. The Movieguide review ends by comparing the film's opposition to modern slavery to the death of Saint Telemachus, which put an end to gladiatorial games in ancient Rome. Erica Yunghans of Star News Daily called the film [...] "controversial".|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} off their Alive 2006/2007 tour, Daft Punk {{began working on}} new material in 2008.

[...] Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition, but were dissatisfied with the production aspect, as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances: [...] "We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [...] for four minutes straight." [...] Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the [...] film soundtrack later in 2008. As Bangalter mentioned after the film's release in 2010: [...] "Making music for a movie is very humbling. We’ve been working on some of our music concurrently." [...] Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become Random Access Memories: [...] "We wanted to do what we used to do with machines and samplers, but with people." [...] They avoided the use of samples on the album, {{with the exception of the}} closing track [...] "Contact".|$|E

[...] "Where My Mouth Is" [...] was the last song {{recorded}} for New Again. According to Lazzara, the lyrics were [...] "the most blatant that I've ever been in a song". The demo for the song was originally acoustic with an organ, mostly instrumental, and ran for 6–7 minutes. Fazzi praised the track, as did Rubano. The song subsequently went through various arrangement changes. The riff for [...] "Cut Me Up Jenny" [...] came from Lazzara: [...] "I was so bored and so lazy, I picked up the guitar and then the [...] That's where it came from and we made a song out of it." [...] Lazzara described it as [...] "a little choppy" [...] with [...] "a nice groove to it". Fazzi said the track has a [...] "crazy 80s vibe, it's a very different song for Taking Back Sunday", while Rubano said it contained hints of Phoenix and Bloc Party. When [...] "Catholic Knees" [...] existed as a rough idea, Fazzi suggested that the group change the time signature to 7/4. Lazzara cited it as an example of Fazzi's influence on the band: [...] "Cause none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> have thought to [...]" [...] Reyes compared the track to Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighters.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, rated [...] "Max" [...] an A−. VanDerWerff was unconvinced that the episode, along with [...] "Tempus Fugit", merited being stretched over two parts; however, {{he felt that}} the character of Fenig was [...] "a simultaneous paean to the many, many lives lost in this fictional war and a very real story about someone who could very well live on the edges of our society, driven mad by visions that are only real to himself, visions the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> immediately disregard as unbelievable and surreal". Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Max" [...] one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's visual effects; however, s{{he felt that the}} two parts of the story would have better served as [...] "a taut one-hour episode". Vitaris also felt that the episode's final act, featuring Mulder on an airplane, saw Mulder uncharacteristically putting civilians at risk and was an example of [...] "out and out bad writing". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, describing it as [...] "tighty, satisfying, witty and touching". Shearman noted that the second half of two-part episodes in the series tended to [...] "drop the ball", but felt that the story arc of [...] "Tempus Fugit" [...] and [...] "Max" [...] was [...] "very solid", calling them [...] "the most satisfying [...] "event" [...] multiparter that The X-Files has ever done".|$|E

500|$|Michael Westmore was {{responsible}} for taking Probert's designs for the Ferengi and creating the make-up for the actors to meet that design. In Probert's original concept, the Ferengi had ears which were pointed like a bat. There were concerns from the producers that these would appear simply to be larger versions of the already known Vulcan ears, and so Westmore was told to round off the ears {{when it came to}} producing the make-up. Other elements which were changed at the make-up stage included modifications to the nose to increase the volume of wrinkles and dropping the idea of an extended chin as Westmore thought it would save time in applying the make-up. A set of false upper teeth were also created, which were added to a single head piece and a nose piece which comprised the prosthetics for the Ferengi. Westmore was not pleased when a shot of an actor in costume was leaked without the teeth, he said [...] "I was annoyed about that photo because the make-up was incomplete. After all the work that went into it, we would have wanted our design in proper form. The photo was like a pirated version of our make-up, because none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> ever approved it under those circumstances." [...] Michael Okuda designed a rank designation tattoo which Westmore applied to the right part of each Ferengi forehead. The symbol means [...] "Dog eat dog" [...] and was painted green as that is the colour of American dollar bills. Each bar (referred to by the production crew as a [...] "rocker") {{to the side of the}} symbol designated a rank, with more bars meaning a higher rank.|$|E
500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations.

In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the poem}} was defended {{by a few}} critics, E. C. Pettet {{returned}} to {{the argument that the}} poem lacked a structure and emphasized the word [...] "forlorn" [...] as evidence of his view. In his 1957 work, Pettet did praise the poem as he declared, [...] "The Ode to a Nightingale has a special interest in that most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> probably regard it as the most richly representative of all Keats’s poems. Two reasons for this quality are immediately apparent: there is its matchless evocation of that late spring and early summer season [...] and there is its exceptional degree of 'distillation', of concentrated recollection". David Perkins felt the need to defend {{the use of the word}} [...] "forlorn" [...] and claimed that it described the feeling from the impossibility of not being able to live in the world of the imagination. When praising the poem in 1959, Perkins claimed, [...] "Although the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] ranges more widely than the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn," [...] the poem can also be regarded as the exploration or testing out of a symbol, and, compared with the urn as a symbol, the nightingale would seem to have both limitations and advantages." [...] Walter Jackson Bate also made a similar defense of the word [...] "forlorn" [...] by claiming that the world described by describing the impossibility of reaching that land. When describing the poem compared to the rest of English poetry, Bate argued in 1963, [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is among [...] "the greatest lyrics in English" [...] and the only one written with such speed: [...] "We are free to doubt whether any poem in English of comparable length and quality has been composed so quickly." [...] In 1968, Robert Gittins stated, [...] "It may not be wrong to regard [...] as Keats's earlier essays in this [...] form, and the great Nightingale and Grecian Urn as his more finished and later works." ...|$|E
