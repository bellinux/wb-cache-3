The bodies of foreigners (regardless of where they die) can be cremated in Singapore, but their ashes have to be placed in private columbaria.

25|$|Frontman Justin Pierre {{composed}} the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, {{and learning to}} live in the moment.

Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation.

Angel's life this season is complicated by the increasingly blurred line between good and evil, the deaths <b>of</b> <b>loved</b> ones Cordelia and Fred (Amy Acker), and the possibility that the Shanshu prophecy may in fact be referring to Spike (who is now also a vampire with a soul) and not Angel.

25|$|Prior to the First World War, the British (as well as {{continental}} European) {{tradition was}} to bury officers {{who died on}} the battlefield in individual graves and common soldiers in mass graves. The Great War changed this sentiment, {{as it was a}} total war, one in which nations engaged in the complete mobilization of all available resources, modes of production, and population in order to fight. Subsequently, as the war continued, there was a growing expectation among the people of the United Kingdom that foot soldiers as well as officers should not only be buried singly but commemorated. Many British families had already tried to visit the graves <b>of</b> <b>loved</b> ones, and could not locate them. Numerous letters appeared in newspapers decrying the problem, and Ware realized the British war effort was heading toward a public relations disaster. Ware, too, felt that the experience of war in the trenches was reducing socio-economic and class barriers. He firmly believed that British policy should be to treat all war dead alike, regardless of class or ability to pay. Wealthy families should not be able to repatriate their dead, inter remains privately in France, nor erect ornate memorials over their loved ones.|$|E
