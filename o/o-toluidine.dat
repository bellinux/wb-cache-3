The reaction using a nitrenium ion is not regionselective and multiple structural isomers will {{be present in the}} product. Figure 2 shows a very general synthesis reaction of <b>o-toluidine</b> and the other products (p-toluidine and m-toluidine). To obtain pure <b>o-toluidine,</b> the isomers need to be separated.|$|E
50|$|The main excretion-pathway is {{revealed}} to be through urine where up to one-third of the administered compound was recovered unchanged. <b>o-toluidine</b> and metabolites are known to bind to hemoglobin. The <b>o-toluidine</b> metabolite o-nitrosotoluene, is proven to cause bladder cancer in rats and is thought to bind to hemoglobin in humans. <b>o-Toluidine</b> exposure has been researched {{in a number of}} different degrees in animals.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>o-Toluidine</b> {{was first}} {{listed in the}} Third Annual Report on Carcinogens as ‘reasonably {{anticipated}} {{to be a human}} carcinogen’ in 1983, based on sufficient evidence from studies in experimental animals. The Report on Carcinogens (RoC) is a U.S. congressionally-mandated, science-based public health report that identifies agents, substances, mixtures, or exposures in the environment that pose a hazard to people residing in the United States Since then, other cancer related studies have been published and the listing of <b>o-toluidine</b> was changed to ‘known to be a human carcinogen’. <b>o-toluidine</b> was especially linked to bladder cancer. This was done 31 years later in the Thirteenth Report on Carcinogens (2014). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified <b>o-toluidine</b> as ‘carcinogenic to humans (group 1)’.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>o-Toluidine</b> is used or {{applied in}} {{different}} circumstances. It is used the most for dye, especially for coloring hair. The other usages of <b>o-toluidine</b> are specific determination of glucose {{in blood and}} the most recent one, the separation of toxic metal ions, which is still in the research phase.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>o-Toluidine</b> {{can also}} be used for {{measuring}} serum glucose concentration, in the form of acetic acid-o-toluidine. The <b>o-toluidine</b> reaction for the estimation of glucose concentration in the serum gained massive popularity in the 1970s. This method was mostly used by clinical laboratories. Because of the potential health hazard, the laboratories now have a modified method by using alternative compounds.|$|E
50|$|Acute human {{exposure}} to <b>o-toluidine</b> can cause painful hematuria (presence of {{red blood cells}} in the urine) (Goldbarb and Finelli, 1974). Chronic exposure to <b>o-toluidine</b> in humans was also observed in multiple retrospective cohort studies in the dyestuff industry. The results include increased death incidences and increased incidences of bladder cancer. It proved difficult however to definitively link these to <b>o-toluidine</b> in due to the exposure to other expected carcinogenic compounds in the dyestuff industry. One study assessed the increased incidences of mortality and bladder cancer in 906 employers of a dyestuff factory in northern Italy over a mean latent period of 25 years. Mortality from bladder cancer was significantly higher in the employers than the people only exposed to the particular chemicals present in the factory, in use or intermittent contact. <b>o-Toluidine</b> was concluded to be almost certainly capable of causing bladder cancer in men.|$|E

[...] In fact, safranine is a 2,8-dimethyl phenazinium salt, whereas the parasafranine produced by Perkin is presumed to be the 1,8-(or 2,9) dimethyl isomer.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} {{established between}} exposure to <b>o-toluidine</b> and bladder cancer in humans {{was based on}} the evaluation of cohort studies of dye workers and rubber-chemical workers, and a population-based case-control study. The cohort study on rubber-chemical workers in the U.S. was the most informative, because it provided the best assessment of <b>o-toluidine</b> exposure and coexposure. However, an increased risk of bladder cancer was observed in all the named studies with adequate latency (time since exposure) that used statistical or other methods capable of detecting or proving a (likely) association. The risk of bladder cancer increased with increasing level of duration of exposure to <b>o-toluidine</b> and time since the first exposure; this supported a causal relationship.|$|E
50|$|Through {{biological}} monitoring {{it was discovered}} that <b>o-toluidine</b> may be absorbed through inhalation and dermal contact. Extensive absorption (at least 92% of the administered oral dose) of <b>o-toluidine</b> from the gastrointestinal tract was observed. Studies show that the absorption of <b>o-toluidine</b> from the gastrointestinal tract in rats is rapid with peak values at 1 hour; the blood values were near zero in 24 hours. It is expected of aromatic amines, like <b>o-toluidine,</b> to be absorbable through the skin due to their lipid solubility. 48 hours following subcutaneous injection of labeled <b>o-toluidine</b> hydrochloride into rats, detected radioactivity in decreasing range: liver > kidney > spleen, colon > lung, bladder. In another study, 72 hours after oral application to rats, radioactivity was detected in decreasing range: blood > spleen > kidney > liver > subcutaneous abdominal fat > lung > heart > abdominal skin > bladder > gastrointestinal tract > bone marrow > brain > muscle > testes. The main excretion pathway is through the urine where up to one-third of the administered compound was recovered unchanged. Major metabolites were determined to be 4-amino-m-cresol and to a lesser extent, N-acetyl-4-amino-m-cresol, azoxytoluene, o-nitrosotoluene, N-acetyl-o-toluidine, N-acetyl-o-aminobenzyl alcohol, anthranilic acid, N-acetyl-anthranilic acid, 2-amino-m-cresol, p-hydroxy-o-toluidine and other unidentified substances. Conjugates that were formed were predominated by sulfate conjugates over glucuronide conjugates by a ratio of 6:1.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>o-Toluidine</b> {{has been}} used as a dye {{precursor}} since the 19th century, when synthetic dye was produced. In the years that followed, the aromatic amine functioned as a precursor of many dyes and pigments for consumer goods. But when the carcinogenicity of <b>o-toluidine</b> for animals was recognized, and that it potentiality could be carcinogenic for humans, the production of <b>o-toluidine</b> and its use in dye manufacturing has been largely banned in the Western world and in many parts of the East. But there are still a few dyes that are based on this compound. The most known compounds are petroleum products and yellow organic pigments. It is also an essential compound in the production of 4-chloro-o-toluidine and 4-amino-2′,3-dimethylazobenzene, which are also dyes.|$|E
50|$|In some {{patients}} <b>o-toluidine</b> is a metabolite of prilocaine, which may cause methemoglobinemia. This is then treated with methylene blue.|$|E
50|$|Binding of <b>o-toluidine</b> {{metabolites}} to hemoglobin {{has also}} been observed in rats. Hemoglobin adducts {{are thought to be}} formed from the <b>o-toluidine</b> metabolite o-nitrosotoluene, which also causes urinary-bladder cancer in rats. Studies of other aromatic amines that cause bladder cancer have shown that during transport of the N-hydroxyarylamines to the bladder, bioreactive metabolites (nitroso compounds) can form and bind to hemoglobin in the blood. The metabolites hereby oxidize the hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen. Methemoglobinemia (higher presence of methemoglobin, the inactive ferric form of red blood cell heme) results in decreased supply of oxygen to peripheral tissues. Evidence suggesting that this pathway is relevant to humans comes from numerous studies that detected <b>o-toluidine</b> hemoglobin adducts in humans (following both occupational and non-occupational exposures), consistent with observations in experimental animals.|$|E
50|$|In the salol reaction, phenyl {{salicylate}} reacts with <b>o-toluidine</b> in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at elevated temperatures to the corresponding amide o-Salicylotoluide. Salicylamides are {{one type of}} drug.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>o-Toluidine</b> (ortho-toluidine) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula C7H9N. This arylamine is a colorless to pale-yellow liquid with a poor solubility in water.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} {{mechanisms of}} carcinogenicity of <b>o-toluidine</b> {{are not completely}} understood, but they {{are known to be}} complex and to involve metabolic activation, which results in formation of reactive metabolites. The earlier mentioned o-nitrosotoluene, which causes cancer in rats, is an example of these reactive metabolites. Research has indicated that <b>o-toluidine</b> is a mutagen and causes oxidative DNA damage and chromosomal damage (Skipper et al. 2010). Multiple {{studies have shown that the}} compound induces oxidative DNA damage and strand breaks in cultured human cells (Watanabe et al. 2010; Ohkuma et al. 1999, Watanabe et al. 2010). DNA damage was also observed in rats and mice exposed in vivo to <b>o-toluidine</b> (Robbiano et al. 2002, Sekihashi et al. 2002) and even large scale chromosomal damage was observed in yeast and mammalian cells exposed to <b>o-toluidine</b> in vitro. More generally, chromosomal instability is known to be induced by aromatic amines in urinary bladder cells. Chromosomal instability may lead to both aneuploidy (presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell), which is observed in cancer cells, and loss of heterozygosity (loss of the entire gene and the surrounding chromosomal region), which can result in the absence of a tumor suppressor gene (Höglund et al. 2001, Sandberg 2002, Phillips and Richardson 2006).|$|E
50|$|The {{findings}} increased bladder {{cancer risk}} in different cohorts with different exposure conditions and different coexposures strongly supported {{the conclusion that}} <b>o-toluidine</b> was the common causal risk factor.|$|E
50|$|Another study {{recorder}} {{expected and}} observed cases of bladder cancer at a rubber factory in upstate New York (Ward et al., 1991). The study assessed 1,749 {{male and female}} employers {{over a period of}} 15 years. Exposure was primarily to <b>o-toluidine</b> and aniline and a significant increase in incidences of bladder cancer was observed. However, the carcinogenicity could not be attributed to <b>o-toluidine</b> definitively. Other studies include Vigliani & Barsotti (1961), Khlebnikova et al. (1970), Zavon et al. (1973), Conso & Pontal (1982), and Rubino et al. (1982).|$|E
50|$|The {{results from}} {{metabolism}} studies in rats show that, like other monocyclic aromatic amines, the metabolism of <b>o-toluidine</b> involves many competing activating and deactivating pathways, including N-acetylation, N-oxidation and N-hydroxylation, and ring oxidation. 4-Hydroxylation and N-acetylation of toluidine {{are the major}} metabolic pathways in rats. The primary metabolism of <b>o-toluidine</b> {{takes place in the}} endoplasmic reticulum. Exposure to <b>o-toluidine</b> enhances the microsomal activity of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (particularly in the kidney), NAPDH-cytochrome c reductase and the content of cytochrome P-450. Cytochrome P450-mediated N-hydroxylation to N-hydroxy-o-toluidine, a carcinogenic metabolite, occurs in the liver. N-Hydroxy-o-toluidine can be either metabolized to o-nitrosotoluene or conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate and transported to the urinary bladder via the blood. Once in the bladder, N-hydroxy-o-toluidine can be released from the conjugates in an acidic urine environment to either react directly with DNA or be bio-activated via sulfation or acetylation by cytosolic sulfotransferases or N-acetyltransferases (presumably NAT1). The postulated activated form (based on comparison with other aromatic amines), N-acetoxy-o-toluidine, is a reactive ester that forms electrophilic arylnitrenium ions that can bind to DNA. Other activation pathways (ring-oxidation pathways) for aromatic amines include peroxidase-catalyzed reactions that form reactive metabolites (quinone-imines formed from nonconjugated phenolic metabolites) in the bladder. These metabolites can produce reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative cellular damage and compensatory cell proliferation. Support for this mechanism comes from studies of oxidative DNA damage induced by <b>o-toluidine</b> metabolites in cultured human cells (HL-60), calf thymus DNA, and DNA fragments from key genes thought to be involved in carcinogenesis (the c-Ha-ras oncogene and the p53 tumor-suppressor gene). Also supporting this mechanism are observations of o-toluidine-induced DNA damage (strand breaks) in cultured human bladder cells and bladder cells from rats and mice exposed in vivo to <b>o-toluidine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} weight and molecular formula {{are the same}} as <b>o-toluidine.</b> It has a boiling point of 200.4 °C and a melting point of 43.6 °C. It has an aromatic, wine-like odor.|$|E
50|$|Studies using {{experimental}} {{animals were}} performed. The statistically significant increase of incidences of malignant tumors or benign and malignant tumors combined at several different tissue sites in rat and mice {{was related to}} exposure to <b>o-toluidine.</b> Dietary exposure (NTP 1996) to the compound caused tumors in the urinary bladder and other connective tissue in rats of both sexes. The most important outcome of these studies was that rats developed tumors at the same tissue sites as observed in humans. The observation of tumors at tissue sites {{in addition to the}} urinary bladder supported the conclusion that <b>o-toluidine</b> was a carcinogen.|$|E
50|$|Mauveine is {{a mixture}} of four related {{aromatic}} compounds differing in number and placement of methyl groups. Its organic synthesis involves dissolving aniline, p-toluidine, and <b>o-toluidine</b> in sulfuric acid and water in a roughly 1:1:2 ratio, then adding potassium dichromate.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{mechanisms}} of carcinogenicity of <b>o-toluidine</b> are not completely understood, the available evidence suggests that they are complex and involve several key modes of action, including metabolic activation that results in binding of reactive metabolites to DNA and proteins, mutagenicity, oxidative DNA damage, chromosomal damage, and cytotoxicity.|$|E

50|$|Chronic oral {{exposure}} to <b>o-toluidine</b> hydrochloride has induced increased incidences of tumors (benign and malignant) in rats and mice. In one study, rats were given doses of approximately 150 and 300 mg/kg bodyweight (low dose and high dose), a control-group was also present (NCI, 1979; Goodman et al., 1984). The exposure {{was associated with}} dose-related decrease in bodyweight gain, decrease in survival and with increased incidences of numerous types of cancer (sarcomas, angiosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, osteosarcomas, fibromas, fibroadenomas and mesothelioma). Non-neoplastic effects were also observed. These included hyperplasia (abnormal increase in volume of tissue), fibrosis (formation of excess fibrous connective tissue) and liver necrosis (premature death of cells in living tissue). Multiple other studies where rats or mice were given <b>o-toluidine</b> over a prolonged period of time had similar results, including {{but not limited to}} a decrease in survivability and increased incidences of different types of cancer (Hecht et al., 1982; Weisburger et al., 1978; NCI, 1979; Weisburger et al., 1978).|$|E
5000|$|... <b>o-Toluidine</b> {{was found}} to be harmful to rats {{following}} acute oral exposure with LD50 of 900 and 940 mg/kg bodyweight. The compound was also found to be of low toxicity in rabbits following acute dermal exposure with an LD50 of 3235 mg/kg bodyweight. Toxicity following inhalation was not identified. Symptoms following acute exposure include cyanosis (blue or purple coloration of the skin due to low oxygen saturation in the tissue), increased methemoglobin levels and moderate skin irritation and severe eye irritation in rabbits.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} isomers of toluidine, which are organic compounds. These isomers are <b>o-toluidine,</b> m-toluidine, and p-toluidine.

50|$|Only oral {{short-term}} {{exposure in}} rats was researched of <b>o-toluidine.</b> Dermal exposure affected the ovarian cycle, ovary morphostructure, {{the ability to}} reproduce and the progeny in female rats when administered for four months (Malysheva and Zaitseva, 1982). Male rats treated similarly showed stimulated spermatogenesis (production of sperm cells) (Malysheva et al., 1983). Inhalation exposure was not identified. Rats were administered with the compound with a dose of 1125 mg/kg bodyweight over five days (225 mg/kg bodyweight per day). Observed symptoms included increased methemoglobin levels, congestion, hemosiderosis (iron overload disorder), hematopoiesis (formation of blood cellular components) in the spleen and a 1.5 to 3.0 times increase in spleen weight.|$|E

Included were 48 FOBT specimens in 48 consecutive admission cases of upper GI bleeding (endoscopy confirmed). We excluded those fecal specimens with an obvious tarry and bloody appearance. The QCOB test revealed the highest positive rates of 33 / 48 (68. 8 %), and significantly higher positive rates than that of the OC-Hemodia test and <b>o-toluidine</b> test (p< 0. 025 and < 0. 01, respectively).
