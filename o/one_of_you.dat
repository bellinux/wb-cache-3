25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E

The masked gunman shouted [...] "Which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> is Malala? Speak up, {{otherwise}} I will shoot you all", and, on her being identified, shot at her.

500|$|Soon afterwards, Gore {{also had}} to contend with the Lewinsky scandal, {{involving}} an affair between President Clinton and an intern, Monica Lewinsky. Gore initially defended Clinton, whom he believed to be innocent, stating, [...] "He {{is the president of the}} country! He is my friend [...] I want to ask you now, every single <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> to join me in supporting him." [...] After Clinton was impeached, Gore continued to defend him stating, [...] "I've defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now [...] to do everything I can to help him be the best president possible." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Persians arrived off {{the coast}} of Lade and learned the number of Ionian ships, they began to worry {{that they would not be}} able to defeat the Greeks, and feared Darius's wrath should they fail. The Ionian tyrants who had been {{expelled}} at the beginning of the revolt were present, and according to Herodotus, they were now given instructions by the Persians: [...] "Men of Ionia, let each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> now show that he has done good service to the king's house; let each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power. Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before. But if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in battle, they will be enslaved; we will make eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to Bactra, and hand over their land to others." [...] The tyrants thus sent messages to their own kinsman, but the Ionians refused the offers. Critically, each group thought that only they had been approached—there does not seem to have been any discussion of this offer between the different contingents, and the possibility for treachery does not seem to have been realised.|$|E

[...] On 30 June, Del Piero wrote an open letter to the Juventus fans thanking them for almost two decades of support, stating, [...] "Above all what remains is the fans, you who are Juventus. That jersey that I loved and will always love, that I desired and respected... From {{tomorrow}} I will no longer be a Juventus player, but I will always be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> Now a new adventure begins and I am as fired up as I was 19 summers ago." ...|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{maintains}} that {{the core of the}} strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. [...] "I think that if any <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," [...] she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, [...] "you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak about something that had just entered your mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence {{is probably one of the}} most powerful spiritual forces." [...] Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.|$|E
500|$|Although Lennon {{often made}} sarcastic {{comments}} about Epstein's homosexuality {{to friends and}} to Epstein personally, no one outside the group's inner circle was allowed to comment. Ian Sharp, one of Lennon's art school friends, once made a sarcastic remark about Epstein, saying, [...] "Which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> [...] does he fancy?" [...] Sharp was sent a letter by Epstein's office within 48 hours that demanded a complete apology. Sharp apologised, but was then completely ostracised. McCartney sent him a letter directing him to have no contact {{with any of them}} in the future. Epstein went on holiday to places such as Amsterdam, Torremolinos and Barcelona or Manchester at weekends, as the attitude to homosexuals there was more tolerant than Liverpool, even though Liverpool did have several gay bars.|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics in [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] {{were aimed}} {{primarily}} at Biggie and Puffy. Shakur viciously insults Biggie throughout, {{the first line}} by Shakur is [...] "That's why I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker", and threatens retaliation in [...] "Hit 'Em Up", saying [...] "Now you're about to feel the wrath of a menace." [...] He also used the song as a platform to express his belief that Biggie was guilty of stealing his style of rapping, and was merely imitating his lifestyle. This notion is addressed in the verse in [...] "Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style." [...] He also touches topically on their early friendship with the line [...] "Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch?" [...] and their subsequent fallout. Towards {{the end of the}} song Tupac disses Mobb Deep, saying [...] "Don't <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> niggas got sickle cell or something? You fucking with me, nigga you fuck around and get a seizure or a heart attack", referring to Prodigy, a member of Mobb Deep, suffering from sickle cell disease.
