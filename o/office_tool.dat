40|$|In {{step with}} {{introduction}} of ICT in Educational system and equipping schools with computers and training teachers to use it, {{there is a}} question of why ICT application in schools is just inching ahead? It seems that the role of high school principles, their attitude as well as regulations pertinent to ICT implementation could be very effective in using computers at schools. The present investigation intends to study this. A Survey was carried using a 37 member sample randomly drawn from principles of high schools situated in the city of Isfahan that had an ICT lab. Findings indicate that principles use computer more as an <b>office</b> <b>tool</b> than a learning facilitator. Moreover, due to paucity of clear and explicit regulations governing ICT use, computer usage in schools has stumbled. This is especially so in schools where {{in the absence of a}} full time computer administrator, the existing facilities are under used.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the complex Richards-Plane is a {{transformed}} domain of Laplace-Plane which is obtained under a tangent hyperbolic mapping. Network functions generated in terms of Richards's frequency are periodic in actual frequencies with periodicity of pi. Once a low-pass prototype network function is designed in Richards's domain, then its periodic feature makes the corresponding periodic band-pass network function to appear at the certain bands repetitively in the frequency axis. Depend on the application requirements, designer can choose the interested band among these repetitive bands. In this work, a filter is built with microstrip commensurate transmission lines in GSM operation pass-band (0. 8 <= f <= 2. 4 GHz). This network can be used in communication applications which are designed to operate in the range of GHz as well as the application in a microstrip patch antenna. In the proposed design, Simplified Real Frequency Technique (SRFT) is employed in the frequency detection network, and the simulation result of microwave <b>office</b> <b>tool</b> (AWR) confirms the theoretical result obtained by MATLAB.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the costs and}} benefits associated with introducing CAD. It is shown that by suitably defining the terms involved, all the so-called 'intangible benefits' can be quantified and used within a rigorous financial evaluation. Because 45 specific factors must be considered if a genuine investment appraisal of CAD is to be performed, a computer program has been specifically written to overcome the difficulties normally associated with the DCF evaluation of major projects. The results from the program demonstrate that not only are the benefits of CAD company-wide, but that when these benefits are quantified, the economic case for CAD is greatly strengthened. The problem of CAD systems being regarded as nothing more than a'drawing <b>office</b> <b>tool</b> to make draftsmen redundant'is overcome. In particular, the use of the program within a number of major companies reveals that CAD systems not only give a much greater potential return on investment than has been suggested by previous authors, but that the greatest benefits accrue in areas outside the drawing office.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the Royal Society via the DOI in this record. Warnings for natural hazards improve {{societal}} resilience and are a good example of decision-making under uncertainty. A warning system is only useful if well defined and thus understood by stakeholders. However, most operational warning systems are heuristic: not formally or transparently defined. Bayesian decision theory provides a framework for issuing warnings under uncertainty but has not been fully exploited. Here, a decision theoretic framework is proposed for hazard warnings. The framework allows any number of warning levels and future states of nature, and a mathematical model for constructing the necessary loss functions for both generic and specific end-users is described. The approach is illustrated using one-day ahead warnings of daily severe precipitation over the UK, and compared to the current decision tool used by the UK Met Office. A probability model is proposed to predict precipitation, given ensemble forecast information, and loss functions are constructed for two generic stakeholders: an end-user and a forecaster. Results show that the Met <b>Office</b> <b>tool</b> issues fewer high-level warnings compared with our system for the generic end-user, suggesting the former may not be suitable for risk averse end-users. In addition, raw ensemble forecasts are shown to be unreliable and result in higher losses from warnings.

40|$|The {{educational}} environment contains multiple reasons {{to make use}} of the new possibilities that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as an educational resource offer. The educational experience presented here has been realized in the subject of New Technologies applied to Education, which forms part of the study plans for primary school teachers in the University of Burgos (UBU), and which has as its main goal to facilitate the acquisition of generic competences of ICT to work online. To reach this proposed goal, we have cultivated active learning of the students, from individual to collective learning. At first, they were given a text to work individually, to read and review. After that, groups were created to work on the document cooperatively, online, through the use of the <b>office</b> <b>tool</b> Google Docs. After sharing and editing the document, every group made a multimedia presentation in which all of their contributions are bundled. Finally, all of the presentations made by every one of the groups were made public. When the practical part of the course was done, the students answered a short questionnaire in which they were asked about their initial knowledge, and the level of dominion and didactic usefulness of the tool Google Docs. It is worth noting that 75 % of the class did not know the application before the course and that, after using it, 92 % say they would use it in the educational and professional future.
