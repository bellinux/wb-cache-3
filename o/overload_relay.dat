The characteristics of the heaters can be matched to the motor so that the motor is protected against overload.

Presently {{there are two types of}} <b>overload</b> <b>relays</b> which depend on the temperature characteristics of metals to provide protection by tripping the circuit. These relays lack accuracy as they do not activate the trip circuit at any exact specified temperature. In this paper we introduce a new form of thermal over-load relay actuated by ferrofluid. The ferrofluid has a very accurate transition temperature known as curie temperature. It acts as a ferromagnetic material below the curie temperature and loses the property of ferromagnetism above this temperature.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of thermal <b>overload</b> <b>relay.</b> In one type, a {{bi-metallic}} strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} case is {{a switch}} to connect a motor to a power source, such as in small appliances or power tools. The switch may be manually operated or may be a relay or contactor connected {{to some form of}} sensor to automatically start and stop the motor. The switch may have several positions to select different connections of the motor. This may allow reduced-voltage starting of the motor, reversing control or selection of multiple speeds. Overload and over current protection may be omitted in very small motor controllers, which rely on the supplying circuit to have over current protection. Small motors may have built-in overload devices to automatically open the circuit on overload. Larger motors have a protective <b>overload</b> <b>relay</b> or temperature sensing relay included in the controller and fuses or circuit breakers for over current protection. An automatic motor controller may also include limit switches or other devices to protect the driven machinery.|$|E
50|$|Protection of {{traction}} motors from short circuits {{is accomplished by}} means of a fast-acting circuit breaker, which disconnects the traction circuit within 2-5 milliseconds if the current exceeds 575±25 amps. In case of a short to ground where the current does not exceed this level, protection is accomplished by a differential relay which compares current {{at both ends of the}} circuit and opens the circuit breaker if the difference in current exceeds 40 amps. The {{traction motors}} are also protected by a wheelslip relay which trips if the angular velocity of one of the traction motors significantly differs from the others (wheelslip, skidding, stripped gears, etc.) and an <b>overload</b> <b>relay</b> which trips if the current in a traction motor's circuit exceeds 265 amps; tripping of these relays automatically reduces the train's acceleration. The engineer's instrument panel has warning lights which illuminate when any of these relays trip (except for the differential relay—its action can be deduced from certain peculiarities in the tripping of the circuit breaker), and the tripping of the wheelslip relay also activates a warning bell.|$|E

50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal <b>overload</b> <b>relays.</b> Bi-metal thermal <b>overload</b> protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R

40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor networks deployed {{for collecting}} data related to environmental monitoring a challenging issue is to distribute relaying traffic evenly among the networks nodes to avoid overloads with consequent fast battery depletion of nodes located near base stations. In this paper we address the issue by considering the use of mobile base stations and energy-aware multi-hop geographic forwarding of data packets. Geographic forwarding is able to adaptively build a route for each packet in a dynamic scenario where base stations move, channel fluctuates due to fading, and sensor nodes periodically sleep and wake up to spare energy. More precisely, here we provide a model for offline estimation of traffic load distribution in the network when single multiple base station move along a trajectory. Moreover, we propose and investigate forwarding strategies which try to trade off energy-efficiency of single packet collection with <b>overload</b> balancing among <b>relays...</b>|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 37). The project aims at the design {{and the construction of}} a laboratory replica for a commercial numerical over current relay using microcontroller and micro CT. It will acquire, sample and covert into digital form the analog current signals from a power system in real time. Then it simulates the working principles of a conventional electromechanical over current relay in through a numerical (mathematical) model. Appropriate equations and algorithm have been used. When a current in a part of a power system exceeds a pre-set value either due to a fault or a large <b>overload</b> the <b>relay</b> will isolate the part through sending trip signal to a circuit breaker. In the developed laboratory model, the system is assembled by a lamp board and the circuit breaker is simulated by a hardware solid state (MOSFET) switch. The constructed relay has been tested extensively for various values of load current and two different tripping characteristics (Inverse Definite Minimum Time: IDMT and Definite Time Lag: DTL) have been verified. The project is expected to help students acquire skills in digital logic circuits design and implementation, and applying it in a power system for isolating the faulty part. As commercial numerical relay is expensive, so we have developed for lab demonstration a prototype using cheap and off-the-shelf components to show the working procedures of a numerical over current relay in a power system. The project will also help students develop hands-on skill on numerical relay and enrich their knowledge on the working principle of a relay-breaker combination circuit. Md Rayhanul Amin RumiS. M.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of Tor as an anonymity system {{has made it}} a popular target {{for a variety of}} attacks including block-ing, denial of service, and timing attacks. In this paper, we focus on timing attacks which are no longer solely in the realm of academic research with recent revelations about the NSA and GCHQ actively working to implement them in practice. We specifically focus on recently exposed timing attacks that leverage asymmetric routing and information gained on reverse network paths (e. g., via TCP ACK num-bers) to deanonymize Tor users. First, we present an empirical study which leverages scal-able algorithmic simulations of routing policies on an up-to-date map of the Internet’s topology, including complex AS relationships and sibling ASes. Our approach allows us to gain a high fidelity snapshot of the threat of timing corre-lation attacks in the wild. In our experiments we find that 58 % of all circuits created by Tor are vulnerable to attacks by timing correlation and colluding sibling ASes. In addi-tion, we find that in some regions (notably, China) there exist a number of cases where it is not possible for Tor to construct a circuit that is safe from these correlation attacks. To mitigate the threat of such attacks, we build Astoria– an AS-aware Tor client. Astoria uses leverages recent developments in network measurement to perform path-prediction and intelligent relay selection. Astoria not only reduces the number of vulnerable circuits to 5. 8 %, but also considers how circuits should be created when there are no safe possibilities. Astoria also performs load balancing across the Tor network, so as to not <b>overload</b> low capacity <b>relays.</b> In addition, Astoria provides reasonable performance even in its most secure configuration. 1...|$|R
