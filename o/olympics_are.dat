5|$|Ian Thorpe is {{the most}} {{decorated}} Australian Olympian of all time, in terms of gold medals. His three gold and two silver at the 2000 Summer <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> the largest in a single Olympics by an Australian.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the {{decision}} is made at an IOC Session approximately seven {{years prior to the}} games; for example, the 2016 Summer <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> awarded to Rio de Janeiro on 2 October 2009, the 2018 Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> awarded to Pyeongchang on 6 July 2011, the 2020 Summer <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> awarded to Tokyo on 7 September 2013, and the 2022 Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> awarded to Beijing on 31 July 2015.|$|R
50|$|The 2005 Pig <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> held in China and the 2006 {{games were}} held in Moscow, Russia. The last Pig <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> in 2009 in St. Louis.|$|R
50|$|For {{the only}} time, {{the results of}} the Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> {{included}} in the season standings. Future Olympic results were not included as World Cup races, nor were World Championship results after 1970. However, the inclusion of the <b>Olympics</b> <b>was</b> irrelevant to the final outcome, as both Killy and Greene would have won the season titles had the <b>Olympics</b> <b>been</b> excluded.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the Summer Olympics, the {{cancelled}} 1940 Winter Olympics and 1944 Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> {{not included}} in the official Roman numeral counts for the Winter Games. While the official titles of the Summer Games count Olympiads, the titles of the Winter Games only count the Games themselves.|$|E
5|$|As is customary, the men's {{marathon}} medals (at the Summer Olympics) or the men's 50km and woman´s 30km {{cross-country skiing}} medals (at the Winter <b>Olympics)</b> <b>are</b> presented {{as part of}} the Closing Ceremony, which take place on the penultimate and the last days, in the Olympic Stadium, and are thus the last medal presentation of the Games.|$|E
5|$|Many of Canada's {{top players}} were NHL {{professional}}s, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) {{pushed for the}} ability to use professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games held after 1988. The NHL was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> held {{in the middle of the}} NHL season. An agreement was later reached and NHL players began competing in 1998.|$|E
50|$|The McKeesport <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> a {{professional}} football team from McKeesport, Pennsylvania from 1896 until around 1940. The <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> {{considered one of}} the top football teams in Pennsylvania from 1910 until 1919.|$|R
5000|$|The Dutch {{best finish}} in an <b>Olympics</b> <b>is</b> fifth place, {{which they did}} in both 1996 & 2000. The first time the Netherlands participated in the {{baseball}} tournament at the Summer <b>Olympics</b> <b>was</b> in [...] Netherlands finished with a 1-2 record, with its only victory coming against Chinese Taipei. There was no official placing as Baseball at the 1988 Summer <b>Olympics</b> <b>was</b> a demonstration sport.|$|R
5000|$|The first Indian man in Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>is</b> Jeremy Bujakowski [...] at Innsbruck in 1964 in Alpine Skiing/Men's Downhill and {{the first}} Indian woman in Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>is</b> Shailaja Kumar at Calgary in 1988 in Alpine Skiing/Women's Slalom.|$|R
5|$|In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{voted to}} allow {{professional}} athletes {{to compete in}} Olympic Games starting in 1988. The National Hockey League (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> held {{in the middle of}} the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. However, NHL players were allowed to compete starting in 1998. The format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams—Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States—followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.|$|E
5|$|The luge {{track records}} shown were {{set at the}} men's singles start house and women's singles/men's doubles start houses during the World Cup {{competition}} in February 2009. After Kumaritashvili's death on 12 February 2010, the competition for men's singles {{was moved to the}} women's singles/men's doubles start house while the competition for women's singles/ men's doubles was moved to the junior start house. The fastest runs set during the 2010 Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> not on this list until an issue between the Whistler 2010 Sports Legacies and the FIL is resolved.|$|E
5|$|Where ambitious {{construction}} for the 1976 {{games in}} Montreal and 1980 games in Moscow had saddled organisers with expenses greatly {{in excess of}} revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for by corporate sponsors. The Olympic Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics.|$|E
50|$|Samples {{taken during}} the 2012 <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> retested in 2016. On October 27, 2016 it was {{announced}} that Starodubtsev tested positive for dehydrochlormethyltestosterone (turinabol) and his results from the 2012 <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> disqualified. He was given a two-year ban.|$|R
5000|$|The 1972 Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> held [...] in Sapporo, and Mount Teine {{hosted the}} alpine skiing (giant slalom and slalom only), {{bobsleigh}}, and luge events (Note: The bobsleigh and luge tracks used for these Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> separate tracks.).|$|R
50|$|Also at WVHS, Special <b>Olympics</b> <b>is</b> another {{highly valued}} and {{appreciated}} athletic program. It allows {{students with special}} needs to participate in sports such as basketball, swimming, track & field, as well as bowling. Special <b>Olympics</b> <b>is</b> an important aspect of the athletics department.|$|R
5|$|In the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, both Spanish and Catalan were {{official}} {{languages of}} the games, {{but due to}} the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in French alphabetical order. For unknown reasons, all three games taking place in Japan had the nations enter in English alphabetical order instead of Japanese characters. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, teams were ordered {{by the number of}} strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name. In the 2010 Winter Olympics, teams entered in English alphabetical order, although the languages of the <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of the two in Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia. In the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 2014 Winter Olympics, the countries entered in the Cyrillic alphabetical order, which is the Russian language's official script.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic Cauldron (also {{known as}} the Olympic Torch) was built for the stadium's two Olympic Games. It is still lit during {{the fourth quarter of}} USC {{football}} games, at the beginning of Los Angeles Rams games, and other special occasions (e.g., when the <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> being held in another city).|$|E
25|$|The 100m {{requires}} {{a high level}} of athleticism and as a result most {{of the participants in the}} <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> aged between 18 and 35 – which is roughly contiguous with the period of peak physical fitness in humans. Consequently, the vast majority of participants in the Olympic 100m fall within this age range.|$|E
50|$|Farah’s {{initiative}} in competing at the London <b>Olympics</b> <b>was</b> not about winning but delivering {{a message to}} the world that regardless what is happening in Somalia it is still alive.

50|$|Ice hockey at the 2016 Winter Youth <b>Olympics</b> <b>was</b> held at Kristins Hall in Lillehammer, Norway from 12 to 21 February. The {{difference}} between the Youth Olympic program for ice hockey and the Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>was</b> {{the addition of a}} skill challenge for each gender.|$|R
25|$|The IOC organises {{the modern}} Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games, held {{in summer and}} winter, every four years. The first Summer Olympics {{organised}} by the IOC was held in Athens, Greece, in 1896; the first Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>was</b> in Chamonix, France, in 1924. Until 1992, both Summer and Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> held in the same year. After that year, however, the IOC shifted the Winter Olympics to the even years between Summer Games, to help space the planning of the two events from one another, and improve the financial balance of the IOC, which receives greater income on Olympic years. The first Summer Youth <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> in Singapore in 2010 and the first Winter Youth <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> held in Innsbruck in 2012.|$|R
25|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and location}} of the Sochi <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> particularly inflaming, and even insulting, to Circassians. They {{will take place at}} the site of one of the largest post Russo-Circassian war massacres of Circassians, and on the official anniversary of Circassian Genocide. As a result, it has become a rallying point to the Circassian activist organizations.|$|E
25|$|Other {{countries}} that have hosted the Summer <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> Belgium, Brazil, China, Canada, Finland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, the Soviet Union, and Sweden. Asia has hosted the Summer Olympics three times and will host again in 2020. In 2016, Rio de Janeiro hosted the first Summer Olympics in South America. Three cities have hosted two Summer Olympic Games: Los Angeles, Paris, and Athens.|$|E
25|$|At {{the upper}} levels, tests for {{international}} competitions, including the <b>Olympics,</b> <b>are</b> issued {{under the auspices}} of the FEI. At the lower levels, and as part of dressage training each country authorizes its own set of tests. For example, in the US it is the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Dressage Federation. In Great Britain, dressage is overseen by British Dressage. Pony Clubs also produce their own tests, including basic walk/trot tests which cater for child riders.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 it was {{reported}} that most of the Olympic venues had fallen into disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or {{are in a state of}} dereliction, with several squatter camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by vandalism, graffiti or strewn with rubbish. These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the Athens <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> either in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use. The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector, while other facilities are still in use just as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports. Concerts and theatrical shows, such as those by the troupe Cirque du Soleil, have recently been held in the complex.|$|E
500|$|The modern Olympic Games or <b>Olympics</b> (...) <b>are</b> leading {{international}} {{sporting events}} featuring {{summer and winter}} sports competitions in which thousands of athletes {{from around the world}} participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.|$|E
500|$|CBC Sports head of {{programming}} Trevor Pilling {{explained that the}} large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that [...] "I do think we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> a different event than these Pan Am Games. But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task." ...|$|E
