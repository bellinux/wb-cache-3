5|$|During the {{construction}} of the James Bay transmission system, the cross-rope suspension tower was invented. This type of tower features two guyed-tower legs similar to the V-guyed tower, but the two legs don't converge at the tower base. In the case of the cross-rope suspension tower, the tower legs are spread apart <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> foundations. In addition, the crossbar is replaced by a series of suspension cables with three vertical insulator strings to support the three bundles, which allows this design to consume only 6.3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. The design is also known as the Chainette (little necklace).|$|E

5|$|In the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, {{children}} are shown cards {{and asked to}} sort them based <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> dimensions (e.g. by color, such as yellow and blue, and object type, such as animals and food) simultaneously into four piles within a matrix (e.g. yellow animals, yellow foods, blue animals and blue foods). This task {{appears to be more}} difficult as research has shown that seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the two dimensions simultaneously. These children focused on the two dimensions separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based on these two dimensions simultaneously. This demonstrates an increase in cognitive flexibility between the ages of seven and eleven.|$|E

Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> road trips across the route to research the film. In 2001, the movie's working title was Route 66 (after U.S. Route 66), but in 2002, the title was changed to prevent people from thinking it was related to the 1960 television show with the same name. In addition, Lightning McQueen's number was originally going to be 57 (Lasseter's birth year), but was changed to 95 (the year Toy Story was released).|$|E

5|$|Su-25SM weapon suite {{has been}} {{expanded}} {{with the addition}} of the Vympel R-73 highly agile air-to-air missile (albeit without helmet mounted cuing and only the traditional longitudinal seeker mode) and the S-13T 130mm rockets (carried in five-round B-13 pods) with blast-fragmentation and armour-piercing warheads. Further, the Kh-25ML and Kh-29L Weapon Employment Profiles have been significantly improved, permitting some complex missile launch scenarios to be executed, such as: firing two consecutive missiles <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> targets in a single attack pass. The GSh-30-2 cannon (250-round magazine) has received three new reduced rate-of-fire modes: 750, 375 and 188 Rounds per Minute. The Su-25SM was also given new BD3-25 under-wing pylons.|$|E

After the uncertainty of a release date for a month, it was announced that the film would be released on 5 September (Teacher's Day), clashing with Daawat-e-Ishq, which starred Chopra's cousin, Parineeti. Yash Raj Films requested that Bhansali shift the release date, which he refused due to previous release date changes of the film and the ongoing promotional activities. Later, Yash Raj Films postponed the Daawat-e-Ishq release date by two weeks.|$|E

Although army Black Hawks had been operating {{for almost two years}} in the TAOR while squawking a wrong code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever told them that they were using a wrong code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV).

5|$|Natalya {{accompanied}} Phoenix to her Divas Championship {{match at}} the SummerSlam pay-per-view against Kelly Kelly, who {{was accompanied by}} Eve Torres, but she failed to win the match. On the September 19 episode of Raw, the Divas of Doom lost a tag team match to Kelly and Torres after Eve pinned Natalya for the win. On the September 26 episode of Raw, Phoenix pinned Kelly Kelly in a tag team match and granted her a new match for Kelly's WWE Divas Championship. Four days later on SmackDown, Natalya lost a match to Kelly. Post match, Phoenix jumped into the ring and delivered a 'Glam Slam' on Kelly, then Natalya applied and debuted their new submission manoeuvre the 'Pin-Up Strong'. Phoenix received her title match against Kelly on October 2 at Hell in a Cell, which she won, with Natalya's help, to become a one–time WWE Divas Champion.

5|$|Peter drowned while {{crossing}} the English Channel {{on the way}} to Gaul, at a place called Ambleteuse, near Boulogne. At first he was buried hastily nearby, but Bede reports that after a light illuminated the grave every night, the locals realised Peter was a saint and exhumed him and re-interred him in Boulogne. The actual date of death is unknown, and since his feast day was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> days, 30 December or 6 January, that information does not clear up the mystery. The date of his death is reported to have been 1 year, 7 months and 3 weeks after Augustine's, by Thomas of Elmham, a 15th-century chronicler. If this is true, this would give a year of death between 605 and 611. This information, however, is contradicted by the fact that Peter was present at the Council of Paris in 614, convened by Chlothar II. It is possible that he died during his return from the Council of Paris.|$|E

5|$|Producer Orrin Keepnews {{attempted}} {{to record the}} quartet live at the Five Spot Café <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> occasions in 1958. His first recording of the ensemble was of two sets during their July 9 show. Monk was disappointed with the recording and did not allow his label Riverside Records to release it, although it was released later after his death. Keepnews returned to the venue on August 7 when Monk performed an evening show in the club's overcrowded room set up with recording equipment. This yielded both Misterioso and Thelonious in Action, which was released first in 1958. The show {{was believed to be}} the first successful live recording of Monk's music, until the recording of his 1957 concert with Coltrane at Carnegie Hall was discovered and released in 2005.

5|$|South-pointing chariot: Although {{the claim}} of Wei Dynasty {{mechanical}} engineer and statesman Ma Jun (fl. 220–265) that the south-pointing chariot was first invented by the mythological Yellow Emperor are dubious, his south-pointing chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this device was a wheeled vehicle with differential gears that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction {{no matter how the}} vehicle turned, in essence a non-magnetic compass. The Book of Song written in the 6th century states that the device was successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). The Japanese historical text Nihon Shoki, compiled by 720, states that the device was crafted and presented as a gift to Emperor Tenji (661–672) <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> occasions (658 and 666) by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. The wheeled vehicle device was described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the Song Dynasty (960–1279), i.e. the Song Shi (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number of gear teeth on each mechanical gear wheel, the diameter of each gear wheel, and how these gear wheels were properly positioned.|$|E
5|$|The M-120 {{designation}} {{was originally}} used <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> roadways in the state. In 1930, a road from US16 {{for about a}} mile at {{the northwest corner of}} Lansing was numbered M-120. In early 1939, the M-174 designation replaced the M-120 moniker on the road. Later that year, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) used the number for a road along the Michigan-Ohio state line. This highway connected to State Route 120 on its east end at the state line and ran west to US127 at Meridian Road along the Hillsdale–Lenawee county line. By the end of 1940, M-120 was extended through Hillsdale County to connect to State Road 120 along the short north–south Michigan–Indiana border. By the middle of 1961, the M-120 designation was retired by the MSHD again. The Ohio and Indiana SR120 highways are still in place today with only the county road in Michigan connecting them.|$|E
