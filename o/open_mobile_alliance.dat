25|$|The <b>Open</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Alliance</b> {{created a}} {{standard}} for interoperable DRM on mobile devices. The first version of OMA DRM consisted of a simple rights management language and was widely used to protect mobile phone ringtones from being copied from the phone to other devices. Later versions expanded the rights management language to similar expressiveness as Fairplay, but did not become widely used.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a model for sharing multimedia based on the notion of an acquaintance domain whose members will have access to the domain owner’s multimedia. Membership of an acquaintance domain is determined by the closeness of a relationship – where “closeness” can be defined by factors such as the frequency of visits – and membership of the domain deteriorates as the relationship becomes more distant. We have made an implementation of the proposal based on the <b>Open</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Alliance’s</b> specification for an authorised domain...|$|R

40|$|As {{mobile phones}} get {{increasingly}} complicated {{the demands for}} an effective firmware update service increase. A proposed solution is Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) and the <b>Open</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Alliance’s</b> Device Management where mobile phones can be updated and managed via the mobile phone network. However, before these operations can be carried out, all FOTA capable mobile phones that should be served must be discovered and registered with a distributor of updates. The information provided must be sufficient to uniquely identify devices, initiate a Device Management session, and determine if a firmware update is needed. This thesis addresses the problems that a solution in automatically collecting this information. Several solutions are presented and their suitability evaluated {{on the basis of}} defined and analyzed requirements. The solutions most thoroughly examined are various manual solutions, retrieval of information from core network nodes, and utilizing the Short Message Service (SMS) or Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD).

40|$|Sharing of {{multimedia}} content {{is a common}} practice that, combined with appropriate business models, need not be detrimental {{to the interests of}} content providers. Existing digital rights management systems, however, support only relatively limited sharing of content between multimedia terminals, resulting in inconvenience and frustration for end-users of rights-managed content. In this paper, we propose to combine the notion of an "authorised domain " with an "environment role " to permit end-users to share access to multimedia content within the constraints expressed in a domain licence. We describe how a variety of different business models can be supported using domain licences, and propose a preliminary domain expression language in which licences can be written. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our model by outlining how it could be implemented using the <b>Open</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Alliance's</b> specification for authorised domains together with a ubiquitous computing network. Our proposal provides greater expressive power than the base OMA DR...|$|R

40|$|A Publish/Subscribe {{mechanism}} {{based on}} the <b>Open</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Alliance's</b> (OMA) Next Generation Services Interface (NGSI) open standard, allows interfacing the information available from many publishers with heterogeneous customers. Pervasive devices (including mobile smartphones) publish {{a huge amount of}} real world information, which afterwards is accessed through web browsers and applications. The adoption of an open standard interface between information publishers and consumers allows to reduce the gap in the technologies used on both sides, therefore, include new actors into the services, increase the service offers and increment the world-wide and cross-domain usage of services {{based on the}} Publish/Subscribe paradigm. Major European Industrial Entities supported by the EU Research Program are deriving a cross-domain Future Internet open standard technology to be adopted and used in any application domain by any customer for any needs.
