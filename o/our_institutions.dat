25|$|I defend {{absolutely}} Mr Farage's {{right to}} disagree about the policy or {{institutions of the}} Union, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility– in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of <b>our</b> <b>institutions.</b> I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore– {{as an expression of}} the seriousness of the matter– rescinded his right to ten days' daily allowance as a Member.|$|E

500|$|At {{the heart}} of New Age Politics is a {{critique}} of the consciousness we all supposedly share, a [...] "six-sided prison" [...] that has kept us all trapped for hundreds of years. [...] The six sides of the [...] "prison" [...] are said to be: patriarchal attitudes, egocentricity, scientific single vision, the bureaucratic mentality, nationalism (xenophobia), and the [...] "big city outlook" [...] (fear of nature). [...] Since consciousness, according to Satin, ultimately determines <b>our</b> <b>institutions,</b> prison consciousness is said to be ultimately responsible for [...] "monolithic" [...] institutions that offer us {{little in the way of}} freedom of choice or connection with others. [...] Some representative monolithic institutions are: bureaucratic government, automobile-centered transportation systems, attorney-centered law, doctor-centered health care, and church-centered spirituality.|$|E

500|$|Observers {{agree that}} Pandey's ordeal {{has brought a}} change to public conversations about women's issues, with men joining in the discussions as well. A young woman who had taken part in the protests {{at the time of}} the rape said a year later, [...] "A welcome change is that the taboo on {{discussing}} rape and sexual violence has been broken. The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes." [...] She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw [...] "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [...] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant." [...] She added, [...] "I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, <b>our</b> <b>institutions</b> and in our laws. The police may be a little more receptive, but it is not out of a sense of duty but out of the fear of censure".|$|E

40|$|BackgroundSurgical site infections (SSIs) {{result in}} {{significant}} patient morbidity following immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction (ITEBR). This study determined a single institution's 30 -day SSI rate and benchmarked it against that among national institutions {{participating in the}} American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). MethodsWomen who underwent ITEBR with/without acellular dermal matrix (ADM) were identified using the ACS-NSQIP database between 2005 and 2011. Patient characteristics associated with the 30 -day SSI rate were determined, and differences in rates between <b>our</b> <b>institution</b> and the national database were assessed. Results 12, 163 patients underwent ITEBR, including 263 at <b>our</b> <b>institution.</b> SSIs occurred in 416 (3. 4 %) patients nationwide excluding <b>our</b> <b>institution,</b> with lower rates observed at <b>our</b> <b>institution</b> (1. 9 %). Nationwide, SSIs were significantly more common in ITEBR patients with ADM (4. 5 %) compared to non-ADM patients (3. 2 %, P= 0. 005), and this trend was observed at <b>our</b> <b>institution</b> (2. 1 % vs. 1. 6 %, P= 1. 00). A multivariable analysis of all institutions identified age ≥ 50 years (odds ratio [OR], 1. 4; confidence interval [CI], 1. 1 - 1. 7), body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 vs. 4. 25 hours (OR, 1. 9; CI, 1. 5 - 2. 4) as risk factors for SSIs. Our institutional SSI rate was lower than the nationwide rate (OR, 0. 4; CI, 0. 2 - 1. 1), although this difference {{was not statistically significant}} (P= 0. 07). ConclusionsThe 30 -day SSI rate at <b>our</b> <b>institution</b> in patients who underwent ITEBR was lower than the nation. SSIs occurred more frequently in procedures involving ADM both nationally and at <b>our</b> <b>institution...</b>|$|R

Rounding on common objectives and shared missions, Anglophones, Francophones, Lusophones and Arabic-speakers will better enrich discussions on how to develop higher educational system.

2500|$|There {{has also}} been {{criticism}} of the government's labelling the shooting as a terrorist attack. James Baxter, editor-in-chief of ipolitics.ca, an Ottawa political 'zine, said [...] "the government is exploiting two isolated murders to push through sweeping new surveillance powers" [...] and pointed out [...] "the would-be ‘terrorists’ involved were armed only with a car and a vintage hunting rifle". Linda McQuaig, an award-winning journalist and former NDP candidate, said [...] "lots of hype about Canada and <b>our</b> <b>institutions</b> being under attack — even as it got harder to explain {{the difference between the}} ‘terrorist’ murders of two soldiers and the ‘non-terrorist’ murders of three RCMP officers in Moncton. The main difference appeared to be that the shooter in Moncton was not a follower of Islam".|$|E
2500|$|This section {{bears the}} title of Townsend Hoopes' best-known book. In 2004, of a seminar that brought a group of Muslim {{students}} to the US, he observed [...] "A vital {{point here is that}} the realities of modernity (technical, social, political) are inexorable. They cannot be wished away, which means that traditional societies are faced with a crucial choice: to adjust, to adapt or to risk steady decline and perhaps ultimate disappearance. Given this daunting paradigm, the genuine enthusiasm for America shown by our 21 Muslim guests was a heartening sign. They seemed impressed with the depth of our national commitment to human freedom and individual opportunity, and the stability of <b>our</b> <b>institutions,</b> both governmental and private. Several declared that exposure to America had reinforced their determination to work for social change in their own countries. Two Pakistani women, both law students, said they planned to devote their lives to fighting for broader women's rights at home. One young man said it was his ambition to become his country's prime minister.|$|E

2500|$|The Scottish {{government}} and pro-independence campaigners {{said that a}} democratic deficit existed in Scotland because the UK was a unitary state {{that did not have}} a codified constitution. The SNP also described the unelected House of Lords as an [...] "affront to democracy". The [...] "democratic deficit" [...] label has sometimes been used to refer to the period between the 1979 and 1997 UK general elections, during which the Labour Party held a majority of Scottish seats but the Conservative Party governed the whole of the UK. Alex Salmond said in September 2013 that instances such as this amounted to a lack of democracy, and that [...] "the people who live and work in Scotland are the people most likely to make the right choices for Scotland". In January 2012, Patrick Harvie said: [...] "Greens have a vision of a more radical democracy in Scotland, with far greater levels of discussion and decision making at community level." [...] The Scottish Government intended that an independent Scotland should have a written constitution which [...] "expresses our values, embeds the rights of our citizens and sets out clearly how <b>our</b> <b>institutions</b> of state interact with each other and serve the people".|$|E
2500|$|The wave metaphor {{has been}} {{described}} as misleading and even dangerous because it not only renders the periods of time in-between waves as silent and irrelevant, but it also contributes to the faulty conceptualization of a particular brand hegemonic feminism as the ultimate understanding of what feminism is. [...] These critiques advocate for the recognition of periods of mass social organizing rather than ‘waves’. [...] It is argued that the wave metaphor weakens the strength and relevance of feminist arguments, since waves necessarily must peak and then retreat, which is not an accurate picture of feminist progress in the United States or elsewhere. [...] Feminism does not retreat or disappear in-between ‘waves'. [...] For example, after the explosion of mass social organizing in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, feminism was being worked into <b>our</b> <b>institutions</b> – a much less glamorous but just as important job that did not require such large-scale attention. [...] As a result, we have seen more and more women in more areas of the job force, higher education, and the installation and success of Women’s and Gender Studies programs across the United States, {{to name just a few}} examples of feminism’s continuous and very relevant presence in this time between the ‘waves’.|$|E
