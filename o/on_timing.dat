5|$|A {{role-playing}} game, it {{centers on}} a battle system {{different from that of}} traditional games of the genre, with emphasis <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> and more elaborate attacks. The game is whimsical in tone, with various in-game jokes and comical references to the heritage of the Mario series. Superstar Saga was critically acclaimed, and IGN named it the twelfth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in their feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's lifespan. A remake of the game for Nintendo 3DS, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, was released on October 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Although the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, the game's plot is {{completely}} unrelated {{to that of}} its predecessor with more emphasis on the time-traveling theme, which involves the protagonists traveling in between {{the past and present}} of the Mushroom Kingdom. The adventure follows Mario, Baby Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi while they search for Princess Peach, who has been abducted by an alien species only known as the Shroobs. The gameplay centers on the co-operation between the quartet, who must use their specific qualities and skills to solve puzzles to progress through and features multiple role-playing game elements, but with a turn-based battle system focused <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> accuracy. The game is considerably darker in tone than its predecessor, especially in its plot and themes.|$|E
5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results from a comparative analysis {{of the effects of}} premarital cohabitation <b>on</b> the <b>timing</b> of family formation in Asia and Europe, applying proportional hazard models to microdata from the 2009 (Japan, South Korea and Singapore) and 2005 (Japan, South Korea, France, Sweden and the U. S.) surveys on family policy, which were conducted by the Cabinet Office (Japanese Government). The results reveal that premarital cohabitation tends to have positive (hastening) effects <b>on</b> the <b>timing</b> of marriage and childbearing among Japanese men and women as well as Singaporean women, but negative effects <b>on</b> the <b>timing</b> of childbearing among Korean men and women. While premarital cohabitation tends to have negative (delaying) effects <b>on</b> the <b>timing</b> of childbearing among male and female college graduates in Japan and female college graduates in Singapore, it tends to have positive effects among male college graduates in South Korea. Premarital cohabitation has positive effects <b>on</b> the <b>timing</b> of marriage and childbearing among French men and Swedish men and women. It also has a positive effect <b>on</b> the <b>timing</b> of marriage among French women including college graduates and a negative effect <b>on</b> the <b>timing</b> of marriage among Swedish male college graduates...|$|R

25|$|Although {{available}} dietary energy (simple calories) is {{the most}} important dietary influence <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> of puberty, quality of the diet plays a role as well. Lower protein intakes and higher dietary fiber intakes, as occur with typical vegetarian diets, are associated with later onset and slower progression of female puberty.|$|E
25|$|According to Welch and Warren (1980), the Modality Appropriateness Hypothesis {{states that}} the {{influence}} of perception in each modality in multisensory integration depends on that modality's appropriateness for the given task. Thus, vision has a greater influence on integrated localization than hearing, and hearing and touch have a greater bearing <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> estimates than vision.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the least}} {{understood}} environmental influences <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> of puberty are social and psychological. In comparison {{with the effects of}} genetics, nutrition, and general health, social influences are small, shifting timing by a few months rather than years. Mechanisms of these social effects are unknown, though a variety of physiological processes, including pheromones, have been suggested based on animal research.|$|E

25|$|Other {{research}} has focused on the effect of childhood stress <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> of puberty, especially female. Stress is a vague term and studies have examined conditions ranging from family tensions or conflict to wartime refugee status with threat to physical survival. The more dire social conditions {{have been found to be}} associated with delay of maturation, an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy. There is more uncertainty and mixed evidence as to whether milder degrees of stress or early-life under-nutrition can accelerate puberty in girls as would be predicted by life history theory and demonstrated in many other mammals.|$|E
25|$|Even Michael Steinhardt, {{who made}} his fortune trading in time horizons ranging from 30 minutes to 30 days, claimed to take a {{long-term}} perspective on his investment decisions. From an economic perspective, many professional money managers and financial advisors shy away from day trading, arguing that the reward simply does not justify the risk. Attempting {{to make a profit}} is the reason investors invest, and buy low and sell high is the general goal of most investors (although short-selling and arbitrage take a different approach, {{the success or failure of}} these strategies still depends <b>on</b> <b>timing).</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2003, an {{independent}} researcher named Michael O'Dell reported {{that both the}} National Academy and Dr. Thomas had used incorrect timelines because they assumed the Dictabelt ran continuously. When corrected, these showed the impulses happened too late {{to be the real}} shots even with Thomas's alternative synchronization. In addition, he pointed out that the 95% or higher probability of a shot from the grassy knoll referred only to random noise (which all earlier research acknowledges), while the impulse could have been something else. He identifies it as speech, ignoring that the analysis that the impulse is from a shot is based <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> of echos.|$|E

500|$|GameSpot {{highlighted}} positively the prompted choices during certain {{points in}} the game as they encourage replay value, but also admitted that the game length is too short compared to Resident Evil 2 because it only features one disc with one protagonist. IGN praised the live action choice feature, stating that it [...] "speeds up the pace, increases the tension, and forces a decision that varies the following scene." [...] Writing for GameCritics, Dale Weir felt {{that the fact that}} players can mix different types of gunpowder to create ammunition adds a new layer of strategy and customizability to the game. Both the 180 degree turn and dodge move were seen by IGN as welcome and necessary additions. In contrast, Official US PlayStation Magazine criticized the dodge feature for being impractical and for relying too much <b>on</b> <b>timing,</b> resulting in doing more harm to the player than against opponents. Other aspects of the game were not positively received: Official US PlayStation Magazine criticized the story of the game for being lacking, while Game Revolution pointed out that the voice acting was poor. The game was a runner up for GameSpot's 1999 Adventure Game of the Year.|$|E
500|$|On March 18, 2013, NASA {{reported}} evidence from instruments on the Curiosity rover of mineral hydration, likely hydrated calcium sulfate, in several rock samples including the broken fragments of [...] "Tintina" [...] rock and [...] "Sutton Inlier" [...] rock {{as well as}} in veins and nodules in other rocks like [...] "Knorr" [...] rock and [...] "Wernicke" [...] rock. Analysis using the rover's DAN instrument provided evidence of subsurface water, amounting to as much as 4% water content, down to a depth of , during the rover's traverse from the Bradbury Landing site to the Yellowknife Bay area in the Glenelg terrain. In September 2015, NASA announced that they had found conclusive evidence of hydrated brine flows on recurring slope lineae, based on spectrometer readings of the darkened areas of slopes. These observations provided confirmation of earlier hypotheses based <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> of formation and their rate of growth, that these dark streaks resulted from water flowing in the very shallow subsurface. The streaks contain hydrated salts, perchlorates, which have water molecules in their crystal structure. The streaks flow downhill in Martian summer, when the temperature is above −23 degrees Celsius, and freeze at lower temperatures.|$|E

500|$|Night Trap was {{developed}} over {{six months and}} was part movie shoot, and part programming. The film was shot on 35 mm film in Culver City, CA across 16 days in 1987, with editing taking another few months. The film was directed by James Riley. The director of photography was Don Burgess, who later went on to shoot the award-winning Forrest Gump (1994). Originally the set {{was going to be}} darker, but it was made brighter for fear the footage would pixelate in-game. The script was unusual because it was built around the multi-linear gameplay. Riley was focused <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> the shoots correctly to sync the movement of actors among the rooms. There were four scenes occurring simultaneously at any given time, although there were eight rooms (the other four being still images). Dana Plato was the most famous actor involved, known for her work on the American sitcom Diff'rent Strokes (1978–86). Plato's career was spiraling downward at the time, partially due to her personal problems with drugs and alcohol. At first, she was eager to work on Night Trap, but later she became more problematic. She reportedly made little effort {{to hide the fact that}} doing this project was a huge step down from her previous popularity. The Augers were played by stuntmen. They developed a hobbling walk so that they would always be prepared to fall when the traps dropped under their feet. The software {{was developed}} concurrently with the filming and editing. Through developing Night Trap, Fulop and his team came to realize their old-fashioned development methods did not always work with interactive movies. The team could not go back and [...] "tweak" [...] on-screen elements and other assets, such as inserting new scenes or changing the time an actor comes into view. They had to work with the video footage they were handed over.|$|E
2500|$|This {{inaccuracy}} in GPS {{is mostly}} due to large [...] "billows" [...] in the ionosphere, which slow the radio {{signal from the}} satellites by a random amount. Since GPS relies <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> the signals to measure distances, this slowing of the signal makes the satellite appear farther away. The billows move slowly, and can be characterized {{using a variety of}} methods from the ground, or by examining the GPS signals themselves. By broadcasting this information to GPS receivers every minute or so, this source of error can be significantly reduced.|$|E
