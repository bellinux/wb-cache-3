5|$|While {{there are}} {{characteristics}} of each building that are distinctly English, these cathedrals {{are marked by}} their architectural diversity, both from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> and also within each individual building. This is much more the case than in the medieval cathedrals of Northern France, for example, where the cathedrals and large abbeys form a relatively homogenous group and the architectural development can easily be traced from building to building.|$|E
5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of the neighborhoods varies significantly from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods {{away from the city}} center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are {{the focal point of the}} neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of the extra weight of each car on a Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary vertical drop, a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} both Colla Ciotach and the Macfie chief lived on Colonsay, with Colla Ciotach {{residing}} at Kiloran and Macfie at Dùn Eibhinn. During {{this time the}} two feuded. Judging by the many hiding places which bear his name, such as leab' fhalaich Mhic a Phì ("MacPhee's Hiding Place"), Macfie was chased from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> for quite sometime. Finally, in 1623, Malcolm Macfie was chased from Colonsay and pursued to Eilean nan Ròn (south-west of Oronsay). There, on the south-western corner of Eilean nan Ròn, called an t Eilean Iarach, he was spotted and taken by the MacDonalds. Popular lore {{has it that the}} Macfie chief was finally discovered when his hiding place amongst the seaweed was given away by a gull. As it hovered over Macfie's position, Colla Ciotach's men were alerted by its cry and spotted the clan chief on a ledge of rock {{at the edge of the}} sea. After being apprehended, the chief was then tied to a stone and summarily shot. Colla Ciotach, and several of his followers, appear in the Council Records in 1623 as being accused of killing the Macfie chief. Because of the death of their chief the Macfies finally lost control of Colonsay. The island then passed to the Macdonalds, as Colla Ciotach took the island for himself, and held it peacefully for many years.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 July the {{combined}} French and Spanish squadron put to sea, followed closely by the British squadron. Both sides took {{most of the day}} to assemble, hampered by light winds and damaged warships, but at 19:00 Moreno gave orders for his squadron to make all sail westwards towards the open ocean and Cadiz. Saumarez followed, but at 20:40, with night drawing in and the wind picking up, he instructed Keats to take Superb, the fastest ship in his squadron, ahead and engage the rearguard of Moreno's force. At 23:20, Keats discovered the Real Carlos and pulled alongside, firing three broadsides into the Spanish ship that started a severe fire. Superb then pushed on towards Saint Antoine while Real Carlos drifted in darkness and confusion, encountering San Hermenegildo, the Spanish ships mistaking one another for an enemy and opening fire. Real Carlos then drifted into San Hermenegildo, the huge ships tangling together and the fire spreading from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> until both were blazing wrecks in the darkness. They both exploded at 00:15 on 13 July, killing more than 1,700 men. At some stage during the night, the independently sailing Spanish frigate Perla sailed through the battle and was fatally damaged in the crossfire, sinking the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The Exchequer {{stood on}} an equal footing with the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> although there were problems {{in the case of the}} Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E

25|$|Turing's {{solution}} to {{working out the}} stecker values (plugboard connections) was to note that, even though the values for, say, A or W, were unknown, the crib still provided known relationships amongst these values; that is, the values after the plugboard transformation. Using these relationships, a cryptanalyst could reason from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> and, potentially, derive a logical contradiction, {{in which case the}} rotor setting under consideration could be ruled out.|$|E

25|$|Athena {{instructed}} Perseus to {{find the}} Hesperides, who were entrusted with weapons needed to defeat the Gorgon. Following Athena's guidance, Perseus sought the Graeae, sisters of the Gorgons, to demand the whereabouts of the Hesperides, the nymphs tending Hera's orchard. The Graeae were three perpetually old women, who had to share a single eye. As the women passed the eye from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> Perseus snatched it from them, holding it for ransom {{in return for the}} location of the nymphs.

25|$|Although {{procedures}} {{vary from}} one field of inquiry to another, they are frequently {{the same from}} <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, {{or it might be}} broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying {{that it is possible to}} identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.|$|E
