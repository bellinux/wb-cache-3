5|$|In Austria, Kepler {{left behind}} such a {{historical}} legacy {{that he was}} one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the 10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin, minted on September 10, 2002. The reverse side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle (the motif of the obverse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin).</b> In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> The symbols could not be identified as the upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a striking resemblance to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Counterfeits and {{spurious}} {{reproductions of}} the 1804 dollar {{have been created}} since numismatists {{became aware of the}} coins' high value. James A. Bolen, a medallist and coin collector who created copies of valuable coins between 1862 and 1869, fabricated an 1804 dollar by altering the last digit in the date of a genuine 1803 example. Although Bolen added his name to the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> other forgers created altered date coins with the intent to deceive. Nineteenth-century stage actor John T. Raymond purchased a specimen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> which was later revealed to be a forgery, for $300. All silver dollars dated between 1800 and 1803 were subject to alteration to 1804 dollars, but 1801 was the date most commonly used for that purpose.|$|E
50|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> {{are easily}} {{identified}} as coinage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Moroccan period by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> either <b>the</b> legend “Empire Cherifien” or the legend “Maroc.” All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> {{will have one}} or the other legend, and often both. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> will also have either a five-pointed star or a Star of David featured prominently in the devices, and sometimes both.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>coins</b> {{are still}} {{separated}} in two sets: one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> is identical from New Caledonia to French Polynesia, while <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> is inscribed {{with the name}} Nouvelle-Calédonie in New Caledonia and in Wallis and Futuna, and with the name Polynésie française in French Polynesia. Both sets of coins {{can be used in}} all three French territories. <b>The</b> situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CFP <b>coins</b> is thus quite similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro <b>coins,</b> which have a national side but can be used in all countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eurozone.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} use was {{probably}} in the early 5th century, possibly as early as between 395 and 408 on <b>the</b> reverse side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Arcadius, but most certainly by 423 on <b>the</b> reverse side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Theodosius II.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{relative}} failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> issue, {{the statue of}} Sacagawea was duly erected in a Portland park, financed by coin sales. In 2000, Sacagawea joined Lewis and Clark in appearing on a gold-colored dollar coin, with the issuance of a circulating coin depicting her and her son.|$|E
5|$|A {{commemorative}} half {{dollar for}} {{the battle was}} produced in 1936. As was typical for the period, mintage for the coin was very low, just 26,928. On January 24, 2011, the America the Beautiful quarters released a 25-cent coin commemorating Gettysburg National Military Park and the Battle of Gettysburg. The reverse side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> depicts the monument on Cemetery Ridge to the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} {{the major}} iguana {{concentrations}} are either partially or fully protected by the Cuban government. Although no captive-breeding program exists within Cuba, the Centro Nacional de Areas Protegidas (the National Center for Protected Areas) has suggested it will explore this route in the future. In 1985 the Cuban government issued a commemorative peso depicting a Cuban iguana on the head side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> in an attempt to raise awareness for this animal.|$|E
50|$|According to Helen Brown, a {{total of}} 64 coins were {{discovered}} in the years 1983, 1986, 1987, and 1988. Horton mentions that three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were found by Dr. Richard Wilding in 1977. <b>The</b> bit <b>of</b> writing that is legible on most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> displays Arabic script. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> highlight <b>the</b> strong ties Shanga held with the Islamic world {{despite the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> themselves were never used in any other known Islamic community outside of Shanga. Horton mentions that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> are made <b>of</b> silver rather than bronze. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> found in Shanga have different dates that can range anywhere from 800-1100. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> themselves support <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> commerce in Shanga.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> obverse designs <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> {{featured}} Arnold Machin's {{portrait of}} Elizabeth II, with the legend ELIZABETH II NEW ZEALAND [...] The initial designs for <b>the</b> reverse sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> introduced in 1967 were {{rejected by the}} Royal Mint. Several more designs were produced, followed by a vigorous public debate. James Berry's designs were eventually accepted for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins,</b> although {{he was asked to}} rework his design for <b>the</b> 5c <b>coin</b> and Francis Shurrock's design for <b>the</b> 10c <b>coin.</b>|$|R
50|$|Six {{hundred and}} fifty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{excavated}} <b>coins</b> were silver. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> had a name {{on one side and}} a religious motto on the reverse. This pattern is similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> from Kilwa, an island off <b>the</b> coast <b>of</b> modern day Tanzania. The names on <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> are <b>the</b> same as those of rulers found in the Kilwa Chronicle as well. These similarities and <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> similar <b>coins</b> to <b>the</b> Mtambwe series in Kilwa link the two economies.|$|R
5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Although {{archaeology}} {{shows that}} the myth reflects an actual custom, the placement of coins with the dead was neither pervasive nor confined to a single coin in the deceased's mouth. In many burials, inscribed metal-leaf tablets or Exonumia take the place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> or gold-foil crosses during the early Christian period. The presence of coins or a coin-hoard in Germanic ship-burials suggests an analogous concept.|$|E
5|$|Commemorative coins with €2 {{face value}} {{have been issued}} with changes {{to the design of}} the {{national}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.|$|E
2500|$|On 11September 2012, the Swedish National Bank {{announced}} a new series <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> to replace <b>the</b> 1 and 5 kronor coins which came into circulation in October 2016. <b>The</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> will follow <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> Gärdestad's song, [...] "Sol, vind och vatten" [...] with the designs depicting the elements on <b>the</b> reverse side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins.</b> This included <b>the</b> reintroduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2 kronor <b>coin.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>coins</b> also have a new portrait <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king.|$|R

5|$|In {{creating}} the half dollar, Mora used motifs evoking California {{at the time}} of statehood in 1850. The obverse depicts a Gold Rush-era prospector, kneeling. He washes material with his pan, seeking bits of placer gold. The reverse adapts the Flag of California, known as the Bear Flag, showing a grizzly bear. Mora left the fields, or background, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> unpolished, giving the piece a textured look.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the bill}} passed, Bureau of the Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber took {{personal}} {{charge of the}} project, seeking to avoid the delays and disputes that had marked the two previous commemoratives, the Columbian half dollar and the Isabella quarter. On March 24, 1899, Mint Director George E. Roberts {{wrote in a letter}} that the Lafayette Memorial Commission was contemplating having, on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> a representation of the new monument. Barber responded the following day to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Henry Boyer, referencing that letter and asking for a sketch of the monument.|$|E
5|$|The obverse of {{the dime}} depicts President Roosevelt, with the {{inscriptions}} LIBERTY and IN GOD WE TRUST. Sinnock's initials, JS, are {{found by the}} cutoff of the bust, {{to the left of}} the date. The reverse shows a torch in the center, representing liberty, flanked by an olive sprig representing peace, and one of oak symbolizing strength and independence. The inscription E PLURIBUS UNUM (out of many, one) stretches across the field. The name of the country and the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> are the legends that surround the reverse design, which is symbolic of the victorious end of World War II.|$|E

25|$|On <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> <b>of</b> Gondophares, <b>the</b> royal {{names are}} Iranian, but <b>the</b> other legends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> are in Greek and Kharoṣṭhī.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{design for the}} smaller dollar coin depicted an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse but organizations and individuals in Congress called for the coin to depict a real woman. Several proposals were submitted, and social reformer Susan B. Anthony {{was selected as the}} design subject. The reverse design of the Eisenhower dollar was retained. Both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> were designed by Frank Gasparro, the Chief Engraver of the United States Mint.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{designer}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> is unknown, artist Gilbert Stuart is widely acknowledged {{to have been}} its creator; Mint Director James Ross Snowden began researching {{the early history of}} the United States Mint and its coinage in the 1850s, during which time he interviewed descendants of Stuart who claimed that their ancestor was {{the designer}}. It has been suggested that Philadelphia socialite Ann Willing Bingham posed as the model for the coin. Several sketches were approved by Mint engraver Robert Scot and de Saussure and sent to President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson to gain their approval.|$|E
5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{like the}} {{previous}} Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave legitimacy to his dynasty {{in the eyes}} of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture of Iran, and was proud of his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions in the city for him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, and carried the traditional Sasanian inscription; Shahanshah, may his glory increase. While the reverse side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> said: May Shah Fanna Khusraw live long.|$|E

5000|$|The present hoard from Akki Alur is {{of great}} importance, as <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> belonging sic to the Byzantine rulers. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> have <b>the</b> bust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king on the obverse, with his name, while the reverse has among other things, <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mint. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> have all been struck at Constantinople, the modern Istanbul.|$|R
50|$|In 1863, <b>the</b> Bank <b>of</b> Upper Canada {{complained to}} the Canadian {{government}} {{that it had a}} hard time trying to issue their final coinage because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> change to decimal currency. The government bought <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> and stored them in a warehouse as copper bullion. After Canadian Confederation, a proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> managed to reach circulation, but <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were melted in 1873 under government supervision.|$|R
5|$|In Kushan era {{representations}} {{between the}} first and third centuries CE, she is depicted as two-armed and six-headed like Skanda. A significant number of Kushan and Yaudheya coins, sculptures and inscriptions produced from 500 BCE to 1200 CE picture the six-headed Shashthi, often on the reverse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> with the six-headed Skanda on the observe. Shashthi is also pictured in a Kushan-era Vrishni triad from the Mathura region, surrounded by Skanda and Vishakha. In Yaudheya images, she is shown to have two arms and six heads that are arranged in two tiers of three heads each, while in Kushan images, the central head is surrounded by five female heads, sometimes attached to female torsos. Terracotta Gupta era (320–550 CE) figures from Ahichchhatra show the goddess with three heads on the front and three on the back.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of the success of}} the legislation, most of the 333,456 large cents struck in 1857 never left the Philadelphia Mint, and were later melted. Snowden purchased a new set of rollers and other equipment so that the Mint could produce its own cent planchets, the first time it had done so in over 50 years. Although the legislation was still a day from final passage, Snowden recommended Longacre's designs to Guthrie on February 20. Guthrie approved them on the 24th, though he requested that the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> be made less sharp; Snowden promised to comply. Flying Eagle cents were struck beginning in April 1857 and were held pending official release. The Mint stored the pieces pending accumulation of a sufficient supply; in mid-May, Snowden notified Philadelphia newspapers that distribution would begin on May 25.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} sequel, Devil May Cry 2, Dante {{is shown to}} have a habit of {{flipping}} a coin to make his decisions, although it is revealed {{at the end of}} the game that both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> are heads. Set some time after the first game, Devil May Cry 2 focuses on aiding the character Lucia in defeating Arius, an international businessman who uses demonic power and seeks to conquer the world. At the end of the game, Dante must go into the demon world to stop a demon lord from escaping, but the gate closes behind him and he is trapped. With no way back to the human world, Dante heads even deeper into the demon world on his motorcycle.|$|E
