The title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of the technique. Binaural was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members [...] "were ready for a change."

[...] The album is lyrically darker than the band's previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as [...] "pretty sombre."
