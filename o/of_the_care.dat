5|$|Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation is a 1986 Canadian-American {{animated}} fantasy film {{produced by}} LBS Communications, Inc. and Nelvana. The third animated feature from Nelvana, it {{was directed by}} Dale Schott, written by Peter Sauder and produced by Nelvana's three founders (Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith). It stars the voices of Alyson Court, Cree Summer, Maxine Miller and Hadley Kay. In the second film based on the Care Bears franchise, a character called The Great Wishing Star (voiced by Chris Wiggins) tells the origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Care</b> Bears, {{and the story of}} their first Caring Mission. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse lead the other Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins, as they {{come to the aid of}} Christy, a young camper who is tempted by an evil shape-shifting figure named Dark Heart. This is also the first appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Care</b> Bear Cubs, who also had their own line of toys.|$|E
5|$|Dark Heart {{becomes a}} real boy, and {{everyone}} is overjoyed. After a swim in the lake, the campers say goodbye to the Bears and Cousins; the former Dark Heart {{promises to be a}} better person at camp. The film ends with a message from its narrator, the Great Wishing Star, and flashbacks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Care</b> Bear Family's childhood.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> {{for a young}} bat {{comes from}} the mother. However, in monogamous species, the father plays a role. In addition, allo-suckling, where a female suckles young that is not hers, occurs in several species. This may serve to {{increase}} colony size in species where females return to their natal colony to breed. A young bat's ability to fly coincides {{with the development of}} an adult body and forelimb length. For the little brown bat, this occurs about eighteen days after birth. Weaning of young for most species takes place in under eighty days. The common vampire bat nurses its offspring beyond that and young vampire bats achieve independence later in life than other species. This is likely due to the species' blood-based diet which is difficult to obtain on a nightly basis.|$|E

5|$|The Dummi Bears are parodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Care</b> Bears franchise, and {{the film}} they are {{featured}} in, The Land Without Smiles, is a parody of the feature length 1985 film The Care Bears Movie based on the franchise, while {{the title of the}} film is a reference to the Care Bears' first TV special from 1983, The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings. The Dummi Bears' name is a reference to the TV series Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears.

40|$|The current {{political}} economy imposes cost-saving rationalisation within home care work. In this context, {{a key question}} is whether home care aides act with indifference to clients or whether home care aides continue to espouse and act out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>caring</b> self, which centres on the desire to give meaningful care to clients. This article assesses <b>the</b> thesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>caring</b> self within a context of rationalisation in relation to home care aides in three organisations. The article brings qualitative and quantitative research to bear on this question. It finds that despite <b>the</b> processes <b>of</b> rationalisation occurring in home care work, home care aides’ overall satisfaction with client relations, {{and their ability to}} satisfy clients continue to have significant links to their job satisfaction, and discretionary effort.

25|$|In general terms, {{the nursing}} {{process is the}} method used to assess and {{diagnose}} needs, plan outcomes and interventions, implement interventions, and evaluate the outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> provided.

25|$|However, in 1996, the Health Authority {{decided to}} close Mardon and to {{transfer}} the long-term general nursing care of the applicant to the local authority.

Where an PCP and ACP may run 40–50 medical codes per year a CCP may run 1–2 in an entire career. IV/IO starts are nearly non-existent {{in the field and}} for this reason CCPs are required to attend nearly double the amount of time in classroom situations or in hospital to keep current. In addition to this they are trained for other skills such as medication infusion pumps, mechanical ventilation and arterial line monitoring.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations has {{identified}} {{the enhancement of}} women's involvement as way to achieve gender equality {{in the realm of}} education, work, and health. This is because women play critical roles as caregivers, formally and informally, in both the household and the larger community. Within the United States, an estimated 66% of all caregivers are female, with one-third of all female caregivers taking care of two or more people According to the World Health Organization, it is important that approaches and frameworks that are being implemented to address gender disparities in health acknowledge the fact that majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> work is provided by women. A meta-analysis of 40 different women's empowerment projects found that increased female participation have led to a broad range of quality of life improvements. These improvements include increases in women's advocacy demands and organization strengths, women-centered policy and governmental changes, and improved economic conditions for lower class women.|$|E
40|$|Description: This account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>caring</b> {{relationship}} in nursing practice breaks new ground. Interviews with practicing nurses and hospitalized patients were structured and analyzed {{using a combination}} of personal construct theory, repertory grid technique and phenomenological psychology. The substantive findings show how experienced nurses construe <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> in a professional context in broad psychological terms. It emerges that the nurses have a very clear picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundaries which limit their helping. The later interpretive work brings out with great sensitivity many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detailed aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nurses' and patients' experiences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>caring</b> relationship. <b>Of</b> particular interest is the different experiences which characterize <b>the</b> powerful position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nurse compared with <b>the</b> vulnerable position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient in hospital...|$|R

25|$|People {{residing}} {{in a long-term}} care facility, such as a hospice or nursing home, experience health benefits from pets. Pets help them {{to cope with the}} emotional issues related to their illness. They also offer physical contact with another living creature, something that is often missing in an elder's life. Pets for nursing homes are chosen based {{on the size of the}} pet, the amount of care that the breed needs, and the population and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> institution. Appropriate pets go through a screening process and, if it is a dog, additional training programs to become a therapy dog. There are three types of therapy dogs: facility therapy dogs, animal-assisted therapy dogs, and therapeutic visitation dogs. The most common therapy dogs are therapeutic visitation dogs. These dogs are household pets whose handlers take time to visit hospitals, nursing homes, detention facilities, and rehabilitation facilities. Different pets require varying amounts of attention and care; for example, cats may have lower maintenance requirements than dogs.|$|E
25|$|For black-tailed prairie dogs, the {{resident}} male {{of the family}} group fathers all the offspring. Multiple paternity in litters {{seems to be more}} common in Utah and Gunnison’s prairie dogs. Mother prairie dogs do most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> for the young. In addition to nursing the young, the mother also defends the nursery chamber and collects grass for the nest. Males play their part by defending the territories and maintaining the burrows. The young spend their first six weeks below the ground being nursed. They are then weaned and begin to surface from the burrow. By five months, they are fully grown. The subject of cooperative breeding in prairie dogs has been debated among biologists. Some argue prairie dogs will defend and feed young that are not theirs, and it seems young will sleep in a nursery chamber with other mothers; since most nursing occurs at night, this may be a case of communal nursing. In the case of the latter, others suggest communal nursing occurs only when mothers mistake another female's young for their own.|$|E
25|$|The University of St Andrews {{was at a}} {{low point}} in its {{fortunes}} {{in the early part}} of the century. It was restructured by commissioners appointed under the 1858 act and began a revival. It pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities, creating the Lady Literate in Arts (LLA) in 1882, which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could all admit and graduate women, with St Andrews the first to do so, and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased from this point until the early twentieth century. A new college of St Andrews was opened in the thriving burgh of Dundee in 1883, allowing the university to teach sciences and open a medical school. The University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes. It moved from the city centre to a new set of grand neo-Gothic buildings, paid for largely by public subscription, at Gilmorehill in 1870. The two colleges at Aberdeen were considered too small to be viable and they were restructured as the University of Aberdeen in 1860. Marischal College was rebuilt in the Gothic style from 1900. Unlike the other Medieval and ecclesiastical foundations, because the University of Edinburgh was a civic college it was relatively poor. In 1858 it was taken out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of the city and established on a similar basis to the other ancient universities.|$|E
