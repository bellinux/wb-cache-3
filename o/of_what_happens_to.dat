5|$|In {{the ensuing}} story, Nagisa is {{introduced}} {{to other students}} {{from each of the}} three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of Strawberry Panic! are the lesbian relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of astronomical star imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.|$|E

You count how many fish you have caught and then you go home regardless of how many fish you have caught. Each fish has a probability of getting into the net that is proportional to its weight but independent <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> the other fish.|$|E
25|$|Groups {{such as the}} Tolpuddle Martyrs {{would often}} use a {{skeleton}} painting {{as part of their}} initiation process.

This was to warn them of their own mortality but also to remind them <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> those who break their promises. An example of this skeleton painting is on display at the People's History Museum, Manchester.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} may {{be illustrated}} by the following urn model. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that the}} odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking balls randomly {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball is proportional to its weight, but independent <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> the other balls. The number of balls taken of a particular color follows the binomial distribution. If the total number n of balls taken is known then the conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given n is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. To generate this distribution experimentally, we have to repeat the experiment until it happens to give n balls.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it." ...|$|E

[...] He felt that a viewer couldn't help but feel déjà vu, but that the work shows greater [...] "dimension". Dana Stevens at Slate magazine believed that the film was an [...] "absolutely unnecessary" [...] retelling of the origin story, although it avoided [...] "the common comic-book adaptation trap of gloomy self-seriousness". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also opined that the [...] "unnecessary" [...] reboot pulled stellar performances from Garfield and Stone and touches the heart.|$|E

During brain death all brain function permanently ceases, according to the current neuroscientific view which sees these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called [...] "eternal oblivion". The belief that some spiritual or incorporeal component (soul) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term [...] "afterlife".|$|E
2500|$|On January 13, 2010, Glover {{compared}} {{the scale and}} devastation of the 2010 Haiti earthquake to the predicament other island nations may face {{as a result of}} the failed Copenhagen summit the previous year. Glover said: [...] "...the threat <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> Haiti is a threat that can happen anywhere in the Caribbean to these island nations... they're all in peril because of global warming... because of climate change... when we did what we did at the climate summit in Copenhagen, this is the response, this is what happens..." [...] In the same statement, he called for a new form of international partnership with Haiti and other Caribbean nations and praised Venezuela, Brazil, and Cuba, for already accepting this partnership.|$|E
2500|$|In the Fisher model, {{the fates}} of the balls are {{independent}} {{and there is}} no dependence between draws. We may as well take all n balls at the same time. Each ball has no [...] "knowledge" [...] <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> the other balls. For the same reason, {{it is impossible to know}} the value of n before the experiment. If we tried to fix the value of n then we would have no way of preventing ball number n+1 from being taken without violating the principle of independence between balls. n is therefore a random variable, and the Fisher distribution is a conditional distribution which can only be determined after the experiment when n is observed. The unconditional distribution is two independent binomials, one for each color.|$|E
