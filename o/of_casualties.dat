5|$|A {{little before}} 16:00, Ney noted an {{apparent}} exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook the movement <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> {{to the rear}} for {{the beginnings of a}} retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> will hopefully be decreased.|$|E
5|$|In the sparsely {{populated}} area where Item moved ashore, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall. Newspaper reports considered it the worst storm to hit Mexico in ten years, with damage in Veracruz totaling around $1.5million (1950USD, $ USD).

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{bombardment}} caused {{a large number}} <b>of</b> <b>casualties.</b> Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge.

5|$|The Bulgarian {{high command}} {{did not attempt}} to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number <b>of</b> <b>casualties</b> but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I propose a 'mechanism' for the {{explanation}} of power-law characteristics <b>of</b> <b>casualty</b> dynamics in inter-state wars, intra-state wars and terrorist attacks: the scale-free physical organization of social systems. Other explanations - self-organized criticality (Cederman, 2003) and the redistribution of total attack capabilities (Johnson et al. 2006) - do not provide a consistent framework for the power-law characteristics <b>of</b> <b>casualty</b> dynamics. The development in time of the power-law characteristics <b>of</b> <b>casualty</b> dynamics during wars and conflicts provides clues for the 'functioning' of social systems which are targeted, and/or for the (in) effectiveness and strategies of actors using force (violence) against these social systems.
