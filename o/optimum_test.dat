40|$|Maximization {{of mutual}} {{information}} (MMI) {{has been applied}} successfully for many remote sensing applications. To fully automate the registration process based on the MMI criterion, a robust global optimizer is indispensable. In this paper, we present a fully automated image registration system based on a hybrid global optimizer designed specifically for image registration problem. The proposed hybrid global optimizer consists of three major modules: a local optimizer, a global <b>optimum</b> <b>test,</b> and an initial search point generator. The global <b>optimum</b> <b>test,</b> which {{is the core of}} the proposed system, is a heuristic procedure to distinguish the global optimum of the MI registration function from the local ones. Based on this global <b>optimum</b> <b>test,</b> a simple robust yet efficient hybrid global optimizer can be designed to maximize the mutual information measure Our experimental results show that, when the size of the search space is moderate, the proposed global optimizer is both robust and efficient. In the case that the search space is large, the proposed system still remains quite robust. 1...|$|E

Here a two-sensor known-signal detection problem is considered where additive impulsive noise, which is dependent from sensor to sensor, corrupts the observations.

The stress distribution between the inner-rollers in a specimen under four-point bend, that is the nominal pure-bending section length, was analysed with respect to various load-span/specimen-thickness ratios (t/h) and support-span/load-span ratios (Wt) using a finite element method. It {{was found that the}} stress distribution could vary with both t/h and L/t. It was found that values of t/h and L/t between 1. 2 and 1. 5 and between 4 and 5, respectively, were the <b>optimum</b> <b>testing</b> geometry which led to a relatively uniform stress distribution consistent with the value calculated by beam theory. Fatigue tests (R= 0. 1 and frequency= 20 Hz) were carried out on samples with different thickness in a peak-aged 8090 AI-Li alloy using the rig. The results appear to support the finite element results.

40|$|Accelerated {{destructive}} degradation tests (ADDTs) {{are widely}} used in manufacturing industries to obtain timely product reliability information, especially in applications where few or no failures are expected under use conditions in tests of practical length. An ADDT plan specifies the test conditions of accelerating variables, running time, and the corresponding allocation of test units to each condition. Usually, variables such as temperature, voltage, or pressure {{can be used as}} accelerating variables to accelerate degradation of a product. For some applications, however, tests at high-stress test conditions would result in more than one type of failure for test units, called competing risk problems. Careful test planning is important for efficient use of limited resources: test time, test units, and test facilities. This paper describes methods to find unconstrained and constrained <b>optimum</b> <b>test</b> plans for competing risk applications under a given test optimization criterion, such as minimizing the large-sample approximate variance of a failure-time distribution quantile at use conditions. A modified general equivalence theorem (GET) is used to verify the optimality of a given ADDT plan.

40|$|Abstract- Concurrently, a {{symbolic}} approach for analog system-level fault diagnosis and a systematic approach {{to maximize the}} fault location capability are proposed. This unified approach is realized {{as a result of}} combining the simulation before test (SBT) fault dictionary diagnosis method with {{a symbolic}} approach. The traditional SBT fault dictionary method is often costly and inefficient because of a high number of simulations, but it can become very efficient when a symbolic approach is employed. This symbolic approach only requires one analysis for circuit topology to generate the network transfer function and a parameter substitution to obtain the frequency response (or time response) of the system. An efficient program is developed to deal with the frequency responses of the system to provide the <b>optimum</b> <b>testing</b> point set, and to automatidy generate the fault dictionary. The “distance” between the measurement data and the frequency responses from the fault dictionary is evaluated to determine the diagnosis results.
