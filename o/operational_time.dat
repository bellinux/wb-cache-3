25|$|Unlike some {{cars and}} motorcycles, a Wankel aero-engine will be {{sufficiently}} warm before full power is asked {{of it because}} of the time taken for pre-flight checks. A Wankel aero-engine spends most of its <b>operational</b> <b>time</b> at high power outputs, with little idling. This makes ideal the use of peripheral ports. An advantage is that modular engines with more than two rotors are feasible. If icing of any intake tracts is an issue, there is plenty of waste engine heat available to prevent icing.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers began in the mid-1980s when the Finnish National Board of Navigation launched a project to find secondary uses for the new vessels it was planning to build {{as a replacement for}} some of the oldest icebreakers. Until then the Finnish icebreakers had been designed solely for escort operations in ice-infested waters and their specialized hull form was not suitable for open water. As a result the existing icebreakers had an effective <b>operational</b> <b>time</b> of only three to five months per year and spent the summer season moored at Katajanokka in Helsinki. A multipurpose application of the new icebreakers would thus result in a better utilization of the vessels and, assuming they were chartered by a commercial third party during the summer, improve the economics of the state-owned fleet.|$|E
500|$|By early 1941, the Luftwaffe rarely {{appeared}} in daylight and Finucane {{spent most of}} his <b>operational</b> <b>time</b> patrolling the Channel coast. On 4 January 1941 at 09:50 off Selsey Bill, he caught and shot down a Bf 110 at [...] It took 15 minutes and four attacks to bring it down. The Bf 110 crashed into the Channel. Off St. Catherine's Point on 19 January, Finucane was one of two Spitfires that intercepted a Junkers Ju 88 at [...] They chased the Ju 88 to within [...] of Cherbourg and broke off for lack of fuel. They left the Ju 88 on fire in both engines and flying at 50 feet. The pilot had proven a skilful opponent. The Ju 88 flew low-level skidding turns and into the sun where the glare prevented the British pilots from gaining a clear view. The rear gunner was also firing accurately, hitting Finucane's fighter with a few well placed rounds. The Ju 88 was credited as shared destroyed. The share was with Sergeant H. Orchard.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1948, Major Russell E. Cheever {{took over}} as {{squadron}} commander. In August, the unit was redesignated the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Night Photo). In addition, under the new U.S. Air Force designation system the name F-15A (F designating Photo under AAF classifications) became the RF-61A (R for reconnaissance and F for fighter). This immediately caused confusion, both because the F-15A was unarmed and was never considered a fighter, and because the F-15A was now reclassified as the P-61A both by the USAF and in squadron records (the P-61A already existing as the earliest variant of the original [...] "Black Widow"). The designation of RF-61C was applied later, but by this point the unit had unofficially returned to calling the aircraft the F-15A, and would {{continue to do so}} for most of their <b>operational</b> <b>time</b> with the machine.|$|E

50|$|The Games {{directly}} involved over 1,600 people in venue site operating services. Sixty-five {{percent of them}} were non-management in various capacities such as building mechanical personnel (electrician, plumbing, HVAC), 20% were construction foreman and unskilled personnel, and 5% were sound and light technicians. They chiefly worked in continuous shifts during the games and were on-call at all other <b>operational</b> <b>times.</b> Waste operation at the venues during those games involved 52 paid staff, 45 volunteers, and 2,800 contractors.|$|R
40|$|An <b>operational</b> stop <b>time</b> is a {{condition}} where heavy equipment is not working as usual. It is important to avoid this condition since excessive idling wastes {{an enormous amount of}} fuel and money. However, the <b>operational</b> stop <b>time</b> of a dump truck Hauller HD 465 - 7 is 2. 83 minutes, which is far above the normal standard. This project aims to optimize the improvement of an <b>operational</b> stop <b>time</b> by using a Six Sigma method with optimize plan selection. This will return the <b>operational</b> stop <b>time</b> to the standard range within 1. 25 to 1. 65 minutes. These steps of define, measure, analyze, improve, and control are applied to the standardization process according to the rules and criteria established by the Six Sigma. The result found that the Six Sigma’s approach which was applied in PT X has reduced the cost from US$ 1, 105, 300 to US$ 963, 000 every month. An improvement have been made to matching fleet by combining six fleet of dump trucks at driving speed of 22 km per hour and the average simulated haul distance was 2, 000 meters. </p...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown by}} [23], the {{rescheduling}} process consists in two successive steps. The initial phase concerns identification of potential conflicts {{on the basis}} of the current state of the infrastructure, the characteristics of <b>operational</b> <b>times,</b> the availability of rolling stock and the position and travel speed of each convoy. This is followed by a problem-solving phase which, according to the results of the previous step and the delays actually occurring, identifies the most appropriate strategies for re-establishing normal operating conditions.|$|R
40|$|We present {{two models}} for {{studying}} a system maintained {{by means of}} imperfect repairs before a replacement or a perfect repair is allowed. The <b>operational</b> and repair <b>times</b> follow phase-type distributions. Imperfect repair means that successive <b>operational</b> <b>times</b> decrease and successive repair times increase. Under these assumptions, models that govern the systems are Markov processes, whose structures are determined, and several performance measures are calculated in transient and stationary regime. These models extend other previously studied in the literature. The incorporation of phase-type distributions allows to apply the model to many other distributions. A numerical example illustrates the calculations and allows {{a comparison of the}} results.

40|$|Presently, the {{evaluation}} of the health of space propulsion systems includes obtaining and analyzing limited flight data and extensive post flight performance, operational and inspection data. This approach is not practical for deep-space missions due to longer <b>operational</b> <b>times,</b> lack of in-space inspection facility, absence of timely ground commands and very long repair intervals. This paper identifies the on-board health- management/inspection needs of deep-space propulsion and thermodynamic power-conversion systems. It also describes technologies that could provide on-board inspection and more comprehensive health management for more successful missions...|$|R

40|$|The dissolution, {{accompanied}} by chemical reaction, of monodisperse solid particles has been analysed. The resulting model, {{which accounts for}} the variation of mass transfer coefficient {{with the size of}} the dissolving particles, yields an approximate analytical form of a kinetic function. Rigorous numerical and approximate analytical solutions have been obtained for the governing system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The transient nature of the dissolution process as well as the accuracy of the analytical solution is brought out by the rigorous numerical solution. The analytical solution is fairly accurate for the major part of the range of <b>operational</b> <b>times</b> encountered in practice...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine current {{patterns}} of deployment {{and use of}} emergency ambulance crews in Nottinghamshire, with particular reference to crew status (technician or paramedic), case mix, interventions performed, and <b>operational</b> <b>times.</b> METHODS: A retrospective survey of routinely collected computerised ambulance service despatch data, and patient treatment forms for 242 randomly selected emergency callouts in Nottinghamshire, during September 1994. Data were collected on patient demography, broad diagnostic group, crew status and <b>operational</b> <b>times,</b> and paramedic interventions performed. RESULTS: 170 of 242 callouts (70 %) involved a paramedic crew; extended skills were used on 31 of these occasions (18 %), predominantly for medical emergencies. Paramedic crews recorded significantly longer on-scene times (median time: 14. 0 v 11. 5 min, P = 0. 04). An examination {{of the difference between}} paramedics who performed interventions {{and those who did not}} revealed that "intervening" paramedics recorded significantly longer onscene times (median time: 23 v 12 min, P < 0. 001), turnaround times (median time: 28 v 18 min, P < 0. 001), and total out-of-service times (median time 73 v 51 min, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The additional time taken by paramedics at the scene of an emergency incident relates to their performance of an intervention, rather than time spent assessing the patient to decide whether stabilisation or immediate evacuation would be most appropriate. Paramedic interventions were most often performed for medical emergencies. The performance of paramedic interventions also extended turnaround times and total out-of-service times...|$|R

30|$|As {{regards the}} energy domain, the paper {{focuses on the}} {{analysis}} of energy-saving policies which are put in place for reducing energy consumption in railway systems. It {{is worth noting that}} this is closely linked to what has so far been described. Indeed, in order to implement proper energy-saving strategies, it is, above all, necessary to obtain a reliable estimate of the <b>operational</b> <b>times</b> involved (e.g. recovery times, inversion times, buffer times). Moreover, as the adoption of eco-driving strategies generates an increase in train running times and hence in passenger travel times, it is important to investigate the trade-off between energy efficiency and increases in user generalised costs.|$|R
