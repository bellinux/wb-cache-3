5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one side <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E

5|$|Spicer took {{written and}} oral {{testimony}} {{from a number}} of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory. Those loyal to one side <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E
5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E

5|$|Another {{question}} of contention was the Progress Party's policy on Norwegian {{membership in the}} European Union. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone a decision on European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June. Others were {{not in favor of}} this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> He stated an indifference towards EU membership, and that if accessing the Union, Norway could always use a veto against EU policies when needed. Central board member Terje Sæbø submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to one side <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle {{and the amount of}} trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, {{but once he}} took office, {{he had to come}} down on one side <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind {{is a group of}} independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E

They are last seen in the series standing together on the roof of a building, enjoying the warm feelings being spread by Mew Berry.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to one side <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E

5|$|Grunge fuses {{elements}} of punk rock and heavy metal, {{such as the}} distorted electric guitar used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, concerns about confinement, and a desire for freedom.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} {{conflict}} between commemorations (for example, November 11 with St. Martin of Tours and Søren Kierkegaard), there is no order of precedence, and individual worship planners need to choose which commemoration, if any, to highlight. In some cases, several individuals are listed together (June 14 with St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory the Theologian, and St. Gregory of Nyssa) because of their close association with each other, and they are thus designed to be commemorated jointly, not as a choice between one <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E
