5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them.

Fragments <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> law codes have been found. However David P.

5|$|A {{new article}} about the Turk did not turn up until 1899, when The American Chess Magazine {{published}} {{an account of the}} Turk's match with Napoleon Bonaparte. The story was basically a review <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> accounts, and a substantive published account would not appear until 1947, when Chess Review published articles by Kenneth Harkness and Jack Straley Battell that amounted to a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new diagrams that synthesized information from previous publications.

5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} lambing {{interval}} (LI) in Improved Jezersko-Solčava (IJS) breed were studied. Due to {{the reason that}} IJS breed originates from Jezersko-Solčava (JS) breed, both breeds were included into the analysis. The data {{were obtained from the}} Republic Data Base for Selection of Small Ruminants, between 1993 and 2008. The analysis included 66, 755 lambings from 280 breeders. The statistical model included breed, parity, litter size at <b>previous</b> lambing, month <b>of</b> the <b>previous</b> lambing, year <b>of</b> the <b>previous</b> lambing, breed <b>of</b> the ram, geographical location of the flock, interaction between month <b>of</b> the <b>previous</b> lambing and breed of the ram, interaction between parity and month <b>of</b> the <b>previous</b> lambing, interaction between breed of the ewe and month <b>of</b> the <b>previous</b> lambing, and interaction between breed of the ewe and litter size at previous lambing as fixed effects. Flock and interaction between year <b>of</b> the <b>previous</b> lambing and flock were treated randomly. Month <b>of</b> the <b>previous</b> lambing affects LI, which is gradually shortening from February to August, and prolonging from August to February. The number of live born lambs significantly affected LI. LI between the first and the second parity and between the second and the third parity was longer than between higher parities. From 1993 to 1999, the LI was decreasing, and increasing thereafter. Ewes mated with JS ram had longer lambing interval than ewes mated with IJS ram.

5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events.

For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
