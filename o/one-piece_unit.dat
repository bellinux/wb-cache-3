2500|$|The [...] span wooden {{wings are}} a <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit.</b> They were built by Jan Tobek, an {{ultralight}} aircraft manufacturer. The wing {{is the largest}} wooden wing built in the Czech Republic {{since the end of}} World War II. The aircraft was assembled at Kunovice Airport in a hangar owned by Evektor-Aerotechnik and Let Kunovice. The aircraft was completed on 29 September 2008. Following ground testing, a series of flight tests was commenced in October 2009, resulting in the issue of a Certificate of Airworthiness on 1 December 2009. The replica aircraft was given msn 02.|$|E
2500|$|The 1949 {{model was}} {{equipped}} with an ignition key and a starter push-button to engage the starter. Pushing the starter button would engage the starter, but if the ignition key was not inserted, unlocking the ignition, the car would not start. The car {{was equipped with}} an oil bath air cleaner. At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said [...] "Futuramic" [...] which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, {{and the presence of}} an automatic transmission. [...] Styling changes for the 1950 model include the replacement of a two-piece windshield with a <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit</b> and the addition of the Holiday hardtop coupe to the line. Also a three-speed manual transmission with column shift became available as a [...] "delete for credit" [...] option to the Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup, which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year. It had a 40ft. turning circle. [...] The 1950 model won the 1950 Carrera Panamericana.|$|E
5000|$|A major {{restyling}} of the GM A-body {{car line}} for 1968 replaced the split skylight with a <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit,</b> and stretched the wheelbase 1" [...] to 121 in.|$|E
50|$|The S3 was facelifted in 2002, {{where it}} was given <b>one-piece</b> headlights/indicator <b>units,</b> {{different}} front wings, rear lights clusters, and some minor upgrades to interior trim.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} aftermarket alarms are <b>one-piece</b> <b>units</b> with a siren {{and control}} module. The {{most common type}} of sensor is a shock sensor and two wires (12-volt constant power and ground) which are connected to the car's battery. This type of alarm is triggered by vibration transferred to the shock sensor, or by voltage changes on the input (the alarm assumes that a sudden change in voltage is due to a door or trunk being opened, or the ignition being turned on); however it is very prone to false triggers on late-model vehicles with many electronic control modules, which can draw current with the ignition off.|$|R
5000|$|The Duster was {{not changed}} {{significantly}} for 1972. New surface-mount sidemarker lights replaced the previous flush-mount items, the taillamps became larger, <b>one-piece</b> <b>units.</b> The power {{rating of the}} 340 V8 was reduced from [...] to [...] {{due in part to}} a reduction in compression ratio from 10.2:1 to 8.5:1, as well as changing the intake valves from 2.02 in to 1.88 in. All horsepower rating numbers, even on unchanged engines, decreased for 1972 due to a new rating protocol. Chrysler's electronic ignition became standard on the 340 models in 1972. Also, there was a 1 year only air cleaner that had a vacuum operated door at the bottom to allow for additional air flow when the throttle is depressed.|$|R
50|$|Another unpopular {{change was}} {{the removal of}} the voltage converter. While the {{built-in}} power supply made the IIc Plus a more integrated <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit</b> for desktop use, the negative aspect was the loss of the ability to operate the machine from a battery source. This, in turn, eroded the portability aspect of the IIc series, rooting it further to a desktop-only environment. The removal of the audio-out jack used for headphones or a speaker was another feature users missed.|$|E

50|$|Designer Eugene Bordinat {{envisioned a}} {{low-cost}} sports car that would combine roadability, performance, and appearance in a radical layout. Ford designer Philip T. Clark {{had been working}} on the low-slung Mustang design in varied forms for years. Bordinat coordinated the development of the styling and oversaw the first drawings into a clay model in three weeks. A 90 in wheelbase, 48 in front and a 49 in rear track were the working dimensions. The body skin was a <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit</b> that was riveted to a space frame. To increase rigidity, the seats were part of the body. The driver could adjust the steering column and clutch/brake/accelerator pedals.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} whether and in which respect self-repairs can provide information on how non-native speakers of Spanish acquire regular and irregular past tense verb forms. According to Pinker and Prince's (1988, 1992) 'Dual Mechanism model' regular and irregular forms are not represented {{the same way in}} the speakers' mind: regular forms are computational, i. e. they respond to rule-governed mechanisms (as in look-ed, walk-ed). On the other hand, irregular forms are vocabulary items which are concatenated in the lexicon as <b>one-piece</b> <b>units</b> (as in the case of went, spoke). In this thesis we investigate whether this proposal is also valid in the case of Spanish past tense verb forms. Spanish verbs, unlike English verbs, are highly inflected and irregular forms not only have an irregular stem but they also have person, number, tense and aspect morphemes. By analysing the oral production of Spanish learners with different ages and from different learning environments, we have tried to contribute to the debate around the so-called 'Dual Mechanism' model...|$|R
5000|$|The XK140 was {{introduced}} in late 1954 and sold as a 1955 model. Exterior changes that distinguished it from the XK120 included more substantial front and rear bumpers with overriders, and flashing turn signals (operated by a switch on the dash) above the front bumper.The grille remained the same size but became a <b>one-piece</b> cast <b>unit</b> with fewer, and broader, vertical bars. The Jaguar badge was incorporated into the grille surround. A chrome trim strip ran along {{the centre of the}} bonnet (hood) and boot (trunk) lid. An emblem on the boot lid contained the words [...] "Winner Le Mans 1951-3".|$|R
2500|$|The 1975 {{model was}} advertised as [...] "a more {{efficient}} Corvette," [...] as service intervals were extended and electronic ignition and the federally mandated catalytic converter were introduced with [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] warnings on the fuel gauge and filler door. Dual exhaust pipes were routed {{to a single}} converter, then split again leading to dual mufflers and tailpipes. Starting this year, tachometers were electronically driven. The Corvette began {{to be influenced by}} the metric system as speedometers now displayed small subfaces indicating kilometers-per-hour. 75's featured revised inner bumper systems with molded front and rear simulated bumper guards. The urethane rear bumper, now in its second year, reappeared as a <b>one-piece</b> seamless <b>unit.</b> This was the final year for Astro Ventilation. Power bottomed out this year — the base engine produced only [...] and the only remaining optional motor, the L-82, dropped an astonishing , managing to deliver [...] With no larger engine available, L-82 hood emblems began to appear on cars so equipped. Unchanged was the standard rear axle ratio for the base engine, which remained at 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. This was the last convertible for the 1968-82 third-generation and only 12% of the cars were ordered as such. As in previous years, a folding top came standard with roadsters and a body color or vinyl covered hardtop was optional at additional cost. Anticipating further federal safety restrictions, Chevrolet believed it would be Corvette's last soft-top model ever but the convertible returned in 1986. Due to the state’s strict emissions standards, this was the last year Chevrolet installed the L-82 engine in a Corvette destined for California.|$|R
50|$|Six {{were built}} in 1914 and {{numbered}} 80-85 by the S&DJR. In 1925 an additional 5 were ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company in Darlington and built with the larger G9BS boilers, becoming numbers 86-90. Two locomotives, 9679 (ex-89) and 9680 (ex-90) received the smaller G9AS boiler in 1930, while the remaining three retained the larger boiler until it was replaced in the 1950s - 53808 in 1953; 53807 in 1954; and 53806 in 1955. These locomotives gained a packing piece between the smaller boiler and original smokebox saddle. The exception was 53807, the smokebox saddle being rotten and replaced with a <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit</b> like the 1914-built locomotives. This locomotive was therefore unique, as only left-hand drive locomotive with a one piece smokebox saddle.|$|E
50|$|More {{recently}} in 2011/12 was {{the addition of}} a Picatinny rail to the frame under the barrel as standard on all models whose number ends in R. The major difference in slide design, between the older model SIG pistols and the current production, is that the older model slides were stamped whereas the current production models are milled on a CNC machine. The stamped models have an end piece at the muzzle end which is welded in place, to complete the slide. Additionally, the older stamped slides feature a removable breech block. This breech block is pinned to the slide with two hollow roll pins, one pressed inside the other, with their split ends opposed. The newer milled slides are a <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit</b> and do not have a removable breech block.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} {{providing}} a rigid structure to an open-topped sports car was resolved by Barry Bilbie, Healey's chassis designer, who adapted the idea provided by the Jaguar D-type, with rear suspension forces routed through the bodyshell's floor pan. The Sprite's chassis design was the world's first volume-production sports car to use unitary construction, where the sheet metal body panels (apart from the bonnet) take many of the structural stresses. The original metal gauge (thickness of steel) of the rear structure specified by Bilbie was reduced by the Austin Design Office during prototype build, however during testing at MIRA (Motor Industry Research Association) distortion and deformation of the rear structure occurred and the original specification was reinstated. The two front chassis legs projecting forward from the passenger compartment mean the shell is not a full monocoque. The front sheet-metal assembly, including the bonnet (hood) and wings, was a <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit,</b> hinged from the back, that swung up to allow access to the engine compartment.|$|E

5000|$|Designed by Carl [...] "CAM" [...] Cameron, the Dodge Charger {{introduced}} a fastback roofline and a pot-metal [...] "electric shaver" [...] grille. The grille used fully rotating headlights (180 degree) that when opened or closed made the grille look like <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit.</b> Hidden headlamps were a feature not {{seen on a}} Chrysler product since the 1942 DeSoto. In {{the rear of the}} new Dodge, the fastback design ended over a full-width six-lamp taillight that featured chromed [...] "CHARGER" [...] lettering.Inside, the standard Charger featured a simulated wood-grain steering wheel, four individual bucket seats with a full length console from front to rear. The rear seats and rear center armrest pad also folded forward while the trunk divider dropped back, which allowed for generous cargo room. Numerous interior features were exclusive to the Charger including door panels, courtesy lights, as well as premium trim and vinyl upholstery. The instrument panel did not use regular bulbs to light the gauges, but rather electroluminescence lit the four chrome-ringed circular dash pods, needles, radio, shifter-position indicator in the console, as well as clock and air conditioning controls if equipped. The dash housed a 0 to 6000 rpm tachometer, a 0 to 150 mph speedometer, as well as alternator, fuel, and temperature gauges as standard equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of blind rivets, installation of a solid rivet typically required access to both sides of the assembly: a rivet hammer {{on one side and a}} bucking bar on the other side. In 1916, Royal Navy reservist and engineer Hamilton Neil Wylie filed a patent for an [...] "improved means of closing tubular rivets" [...] (granted May 1917). In 1922 Wylie joined the British aircraft manufacturer Armstrong-Whitworth Ltd to advise on metal construction techniques; here he continued to develop his rivet design with a further 1927 patent that incorporated the pull-through mandrel, and allowed the rivet to be used blind. By 1928, the George Tucker Eyelet company produced a [...] "cup" [...] rivet based on the design. It required a separate GKN mandrel and the rivet body to be hand assembled prior to use for the building of the Siskin III aircraft. Together with Armstrong-Whitworth, the Geo. Tucker Co. further modified the rivet design to produce a <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit</b> incorporating mandrel and rivet. This product was later developed in aluminium and trademarked as the [...] "POP" [...] rivet. The United Shoe Machinery Co. produced the design in the U.S. as inventors such as Carl Cherry and Lou Huck experimented with other techniques for expanding solid rivets.|$|E

40|$|NASA Glenn Research Center's Engineering Development Division {{has been}} working in support of {{innovative}} gas turbine engine systems under development by Glenn's Combustion Branch. These one-of-a-kind components require operation under extreme conditions. High-temperature ceramics were chosen for fabrication {{was because of the}} hostile operating environment. During the designing process, it became apparent that traditional machining techniques would not be adequate to produce the small, intricate features for the conceptual design, which was to be produced by stacking over a dozen thin layers with many small features that would then be aligned and bonded together into a <b>one-piece</b> <b>unit.</b> Instead of using traditional machining, we produced computer models in Pro/ENGINEER (Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC), Needham, MA) to the specifications of the research engineer. The computer models were exported in stereolithography standard (STL) format and used to produce full-size rapid prototype polymer models. These semi-opaque plastic models were used for visualization and design verification. The computer models also were exported in International Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) format and sent to Glenn's Thermal/Fluids Design & Analysis Branch and Applied Structural Mechanics Branch for profiling heat transfer and mechanical strength analysis...|$|E
