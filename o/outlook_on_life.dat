5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his <b>outlook</b> <b>on</b> <b>life</b> and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Train Heartnet, once {{an assassin}} for Chronos, an {{organization}} bent on world peace that rules {{one third of}} the world's economy, is now an easygoing Sweeper (licensed bounty hunter) traveling with his partner Sven Vollfied.

Rinslet is kidnapped by Creed Diskenth, a former Chronos assassin that killed Train's friend Saya Minatsuki for changing Train's <b>outlook</b> <b>on</b> <b>life</b> and which contributed to him leaving Chronos, to persuade Train to join his group the Apostles of the Stars in order to overthrow Chronos and start a world revolution. The duel ends as a draw, with both Creed and Train injured.|$|E

Though most historians have found little indication of his religious leanings after he left college, some scholars indicate he leaned toward deism. Others maintain that Madison accepted Christian tenets and formed his <b>outlook</b> <b>on</b> <b>life</b> with a Christian world view.|$|E

25|$|Aging has a {{significant}} impact on society. People of different ages tend to differ in many aspects, such as legal and social responsibilities, <b>outlook</b> <b>on</b> <b>life,</b> and self-perception. Young people tend to have fewer legal privileges (if they are below the age of majority), {{they are more likely to}} push for political and social change, to develop and adopt new technologies, and to need education. Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older people are also more likely to vote, and in many countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence.|$|E
25|$|Julie Simonson's {{reaction}} to her father's new appearance would be mirrored in X-Man Kitty Pryde's heartbroken rejection of Storm's new look. In the story, Storm's <b>outlook</b> <b>on</b> <b>life</b> darkens after her {{struggles with the}} Brood. These changes alienate her from Kitty for a time. Storm is influenced in this by Yukio, a friend of Wolverine, and the two become fast friends. Claremont wrote an arc in which fellow mutant Forge develops a mutant power neutralizing gun. The intended target is another X-Man, Rogue, but Storm is hit instead, taking away her powers. Forge takes her {{back to his home}} in Dallas, Texas to recover. They fall in love, but when she learns that Forge built the weapon that took her powers, she is heartbroken and leaves him.|$|E
25|$|In Fleming's novels, many Bond {{girls have}} some sort of {{independent}} job or even career, often one that was considered inappropriate for women in the 1950s. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, and Mary Goodnight are in intelligence or law-enforcement work. Those who are criminals, such as Tiffany Case and Pussy Galore, tend to be similarly independent-minded in how they approach their work—the latter even running her own syndicate. Even those Bond girls who have more conventional or glamorous jobs show themselves to be invested in having an independent <b>outlook</b> <b>on</b> <b>life.</b> While the Bond girls are clearly intended as sex objects, they are nevertheless portrayed in the novels as having a high degree of independence; this is also frequently (but not always) the case in the films, especially from 1981 onward.|$|E
50|$|Chicago Sun-Times film {{reviewer}} Roger Ebert {{argued that}} The Shawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when {{placed in a}} hopeless position. Andy Dufresne's integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking. Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or unfree, even in freedom, based <b>on</b> their <b>outlooks</b> <b>on</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R

25|$|Bipolar disorder, {{previously}} {{known as}} manic depression, is a mental disorder that causes periods {{of depression and}} periods of elevated mood. The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative <b>outlook</b> <b>on</b> <b>life,</b> and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 3040 percent. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated.|$|E

Hopkins stated that his role as Burt Munro, whom he portrayed in his 2005 film The World's Fastest Indian, was his favourite. He also asserted that Munro was the easiest role that he had played because both men have a similar <b>outlook</b> <b>on</b> <b>life.</b> In 2006, Hopkins was {{the recipient of the}} Golden Globe Cecil B.

25|$|Finding himself disoriented, {{he sought}} shelter and solace in his {{friendship}} with the Tagore brothers. There he overcame his crisis and started moving towards a religious rather than social and political <b>outlook</b> <b>on</b> <b>life.</b> Along with Dvijendranath Tagore, Kedarnath started studying Sanskrit and theological writings of such authors as Kant, Goethe, Hegel, Swedenborg, Hume, Voltaire, and Schopenhauer, {{as well as the}} books of Brahmo Samaj that rekindled his interest in Hinduism. At the same time, Kedarnath daily met with Charles Dall, a Unitarian minister from the American Unitarian Association of Boston posted to Calcutta for propagating Unitarian ideas among the educated Bengalis. Under Dall's guidance, Kedarnath studied the Bible and the Unitarian writings of Channing, Emerson, Parker and others. While developing a fascination for the liberalism of Unitarian religious teachings, the young Kedarnath also studied the Qur'an.|$|E

40|$|Loneliness is {{a complex}} set of {{feelings}} encompassing reactions to unful®lled intimate and social needs. Although transient for some individuals, loneliness can be a chronic state for others. Prior research has shown that loneliness is a major risk factor for psychological disturbances and for broad-based morbidity and mortality. We examined differences between lonely and socially embedded individuals that might explain differences in health outcomes. Satisfying social relationships were associated with more positive <b>outlooks</b> <b>on</b> <b>life,</b> more secure attachments and interactions with others, more autonomic activation when confronting acute psychological challenges, and more ef®cient restorative behaviors.

40|$|Socio-economic status {{describes}} the position a person occupies within society {{on grounds of}} wealth, educational level and occupational prestige. It is associated with opportunities, resources, and <b>outlooks</b> <b>on</b> <b>life.</b> It therefore {{comes as no surprise}} that live-courses differ with socio-economic status. Interestingly, social inequalities accumulate over the life-course: people who are in a disadvantaged situation often experience more disadvantages throughout their lives, while people who are in an advantageous situation often experiences more advantages. Therefore, socieconomic status has more time to unfold its effects the further the live-courses progress. This chapter explores the connection between socio-economic status and live-courses in Poland, a post-socialist country with an ageing population...|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the maternal bond, paternal bonds tend to vary over the span of a child's development {{in terms of both}} strength and stability. In fact, many children now grow up in fatherless households and do not experience a paternal bond at all. In general, paternal bonding is more dominant later in a child's life after language develops. Fathers may be more influential in play interactions as opposed to nurturance interactions. Father-child bonds also tend to develop with respect to topics such as political views or money, whereas mother-child bonds tend to develop in relation to topics such as religious views or general <b>outlooks</b> <b>on</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R
