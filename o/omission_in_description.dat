40|$|The {{theory of}} Petzinger and Scalapino (1973) was {{thoroughly}} reviewed, {{and all of}} the basic equations for paramagnetic para to ortho hydrogen catalysis re-derived. There are only a few minor phase errors and errors of <b>omission</b> <b>in</b> the <b>description</b> of the theory. Three models (described by Petzinger and Scalapino) for the rate of para to ortho H 2 catalysis were worked out, and uniform agreement obtained to within a constant factor of 2 pi. The analytical methods developed {{in the course of this}} study were then extended to two new models, which more adequately describe the process of surface catalysis including transfer of hydrogen molecules onto and off of the surface. All five equations for the para to ortho catalytic rate of conversion are described. The two new equations describe the catalytic rate for these models: H 2 on the surface is a 2 -D gas with lifetime tau; and H 2 on the surface is a 2 -D liquid undergoing Brownian motion (diffusion) with surface lifetime tau...|$|R
30|$|Another {{difficulty}} in {{identification of the}} species is the description of T. campanula provided by Clarkson and Owen (1960). While {{this is the only}} description of T. campanula with a finger-like vulvar projection, this <b>description</b> was instrumental <b>in</b> distinguishing the parasites by size. The discrepancy created by Clarkson and Owen might be due to the projection not being seen in the originally identified T. campanula (i.e., both species have it), an <b>omission</b> <b>in</b> the first <b>description</b> of T. campanula since it was described after T. serrata or the archived specimen used might have been mislabeled. The drawings provided by Clarkson and Owen almost perfectly match those of Cameron’s T. serrata and the description provided by von Linstow of T. serrata.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} a concise {{overview of the}} main feature evolution of Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) designs, in particular on the evapora-tor/compensation chamber, based on experimental studies published between 1998 and 2010. It presents a synthesis of results on LHP performances at steady-state, and observations related to the LHP dynamic behaviours, as start-up or oscillating behaviours. The objective of this review is to gather as much information from the LHP experimental studies so as to provide a database, and thus promote the development of tools for understanding and predicting the LHP behaviors. The review shows some <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> the LHP <b>description</b> and <b>in</b> the results presentation that makes these data difficult to use for further studies. This review should promote some coordination for future experimental works on LHP...|$|R
40|$|For Anglican {{travellers}} in Italy, Rome had {{an ambiguous}} status. It was the seat both of high culture and of ‘superstitious’ Roman Catholic practices, including art and architecture. These extremes culminated in church buildings. This article studies the perception and reaction of English travellers in Rome towards {{architecture of the}} Roman Catholic Church and its influence on English church architecture. It will reveal the church building as an aesthetic object, in addition to possessing religious qualities, through the analysis of printed travelogues and engravings that circulated amongst the English Grand Tour travellers. By analysing the travelogue discourse — with particular attention to descriptions of specific church buildings and any intentional <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> these <b>descriptions</b> — and examining {{the relationship between these}} discourses and contemporary English aesthetic theories, I will demonstrate how a certain appreciation for Roman Baroque church architecture was made acceptable and could even inspire the design of English church architecture. As will become clear, the process of travel included the separation of moral and artistic values in aesthetic appreciation. This separation made the cultural transfer between Italy and England possible in the 17 th and early 18 th centuries. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The general historiography of Stuart {{diplomacy}} has, by and large, {{argued that}} those who were tasked with carrying out foreign policy were ineffective, amateurish and, in some cases, incompetent. This harsh view {{is in need of}} reassessment in the light of a number of incidents, which suggest that much effective foreign policy and general diplomatic work was carried out by lower-ranking diplomats, who were titled agents. These agents have attracted little historical comment or study. This thesis sets out to redress this by considering the agents employed from 1603 to 1688, when the title disappeared due to rank inflation, duties transferred to consuls, and other factors. The texts of the period on the perfect ambassador leave clear <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> <b>descriptions</b> of diplomatic work, which therefore suggests a role for another type of diplomat, the agent. The initial chapter looks at background and education and offers a portrait of an average agent as typically a well-educated member of the lower gentry. The terms under which agents served are compared with other professional groups of comparable social rank and those in other government positions. Agents’ work in information gathering, including where and from what sources they obtained material and how it was transmitted, is investigated. The existence of an efficient international network is uncovered. Agents’ role in negotiations, unconstrained by protocol, allowed them a greater degree of freedom than ambassadors. This and the element of deniability are key to understanding their importance to Stuart diplomacy. The task of protecting merchants’ rights is demonstrated by a case study in France which shows all the usual stages involved in resolving a dispute. Involvement in buying naval supplies and cultural transfer are also discussed in chapters concerned with agents’ practical activities. Finally, the careers pursued after their agencies are outlined, showing how some, such as Cottington, used their skills and knowledge to their advantage. Having demonstrated the differences amongst, and the utility of, agents it is possible to suggest that some of the criticism of Stuart diplomacy comes from a misunderstanding of the use of both agents and ambassadors, and how, when and why each could be employed for a specific task. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{try to explain}} a strange <b>omission</b> <b>in</b> Hume’s methodological <b>descriptions</b> <b>in</b> his first Enquiry. In {{the course of this}} {{explanation}} I reveal a kind of rationalistic tendency of the latter work. It seems to contrast with “experimental method” of his early Treatise of Human Nature, but, as I show that there is no discrepancy between the actual methods of both works, I make an attempt to explain the change in Hume’s characterization of his own methods. This attempt leads to the question about his interpretation of the science of human nature. I argue that his view on this science was not a constant one and that initially he identified this science with his account of passions. As this presupposes the primacy of Book 2 of his Treatise I try to find new confirmations of the old hypothesis that this Book had been written before the Book 1, dealing with understanding. Finally, I show that this discussion of Hume’s methodology may be of some interest to proponents of conceptual analysis...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine a}} {{specialty}} of colloquial Russian – the omis- sion of verbs – {{and compare it}} to the possibilities of verb <b>omission</b> <b>in</b> Czech, where this phenomenon is rather rare. The <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> question are to be separated from compulsory ellipses, which will not be taken into account in this paper. They are also not to be regarded as zero lexemes, which are elusive to attempts of reconstruction. The nature of this third kind of omis- sion itself presents a frame for the comparison, since these omissions can be placed along two scales, that of ambiguous/vague vs. unequivocally re- coverable and free formation vs. phraseologically bound phrase. The comparison of verb <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> the two languages along these scales em- phasizes the restrictions of <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> Czech and the high degree of free- dom in Russian. Moreover, verb <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> Russian can lead to changes in the meaning of a sentence, whereas they seem to be merely a stylistic device in Czech...|$|R

40|$|<b>Omission</b> <b>in</b> interpreting, {{understood}} as an incomplete rendition of the information present in the source language, {{has long been a}} contentious issue. Altman (1994), Barik (1994), Gile (1995; 1999) as well as Setton (1999) have perceived <b>omission</b> <b>in</b> simultaneous interpreting either as a mistake or as a technique that interpreters may use only in extremely difficult conditions, when experiencing cognitive overload. Nevertheless, Viaggio (2002), Visson (2005) and Pym (2008) draw attention to the pragmatic approach to omission, treating it as a conscious decision made by the interpreter rather than a mistake resulting from miscomprehension. The main purpose of the study is to check whether both interpreting trainees and professional interpreters are sensitive to the pragmatic aspect of omissions. We ask whether they tend to use deliberate <b>omission</b> <b>in</b> a real interpreting task in order to eliminate message redundancy or whether they stick to the original, despite repetitions, digressions and unnecessary information contained in the text. The results of the study may shed new light on the issue of <b>omission</b> <b>in</b> simultaneous interpreting...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to demonstrate the existence of unconstitutionality by legislative <b>omission</b> <b>in</b> Mexico. We also compare the models of <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> other countries —comparative law—. Due to the above it is necessary to make clear that we do not judge either for or against the unconstitutionality by legislative omission. We analyze this mechanism in the models incorporated into constitutions as constitutionality control, and the jurisprudential model, which are examined through interpretative judgments. As a starting point to study legislative <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> Mexico, we relied primarily on two studies. The first dating from 1970, is a seductive article published by Walter FRISCHI PHILIPP, and Sergio TORRES EYRAS, entitled "Unconstitutional legislative <b>omissions</b> <b>in</b> West Germany and Mexico". In this essay the main goal pursued was to draw attention of the mexican jurists to issues relating to legislative omissions, as well to stimulate discussion about this interesting field. As a second historical study of this technique, in 1978, Professor German BIDART CAMPOS presented a paper entitled "Constitutional justice and unconstitutionality by omission" at the II Mexican Conference of Constitutional Law [...] ...|$|R
