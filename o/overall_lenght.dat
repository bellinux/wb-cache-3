Overall height of the structure is 9 meters and <b>overall</b> <b>lenght</b> is 35 meters. Cross link is formed with arched welded truss that. Columns and truss form the steel frame. Load is composed of self weight, additonal imposed load and climate load caused by wind and snow that is reached for given locality.

40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis {{deals with}} the static analysis and design of five story office building with focus on sesmic resistance. The main structure consist of four moment resisting frames with 10 m span between the columns, with <b>overall</b> <b>lenght</b> and width of 30, 0 m and height of 18, 8 m. The longitudinal stiffes is provided through moment resisting frames {{in one direction and}} concentric bracings in the other direction. Floors are designed as composite slabs that are supported by secondary beams which are connected to primary beams and columns of moment frames. The second order analysis with initial global imperfections was performed to determine internal fores in the structural elements. Analysis were made using SCIA Engineer software. All loads were determined according to Slovenian standard SIST EN 1991. Seismic analysis was made using simplified horizontal forces method. The structure is designed according to rules for high ductility class...|$|E
