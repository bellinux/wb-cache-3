500|$|Spins Joe Levy {{named the}} song the only [...] "great" [...] dance record <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Prayer, and also {{observed}} that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] was a [...] "girly-disco" [...] song that drew influences from Sister Sledge's [...] "We Are Family" [...] and Madonna's own [...] "Into the Groove". Stephen Holden from The New York Times {{believed that the}} song brought the pop-funk style and hippie happiness of Sly and the Family Stone. Journalist J. D. Considine, while reviewing Like a Prayer for Rolling Stone, felt that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] portrayed [...] "an impressive invocation {{of the importance of}} family". Considine was concerned that since the confessional nature of the songs <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Prayer evoked strong emotions from the listener, [...] "Keep It Together" [...] would probably seem almost trivial by comparison to them. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic believed that the song constituted of deep funk music. Louis Virtel of The Backlot gave the song a positive review, calling it a [...] "rollicking family reunion" [...] that is the [...] "sunny side of “Oh Father’s” grim familial reckoning." [...] Kenneth Partridge from Billboard described the song as a mid-tempo synth-funk tune with a [...] "tense" [...] groove, on which Madonna offers an olive branch to her estranged father and siblings.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna went {{to record}} [...] "Oh Father", her troubled role in Speed-the-Plow {{was on her}} mind, with the result being that she vented her {{emotions}} in the recording of the song.

The actual version was made available on March 6, 2015, whilst its precedent mix was predominantly influenced by disco and house music before being reworked in the album cut. Lyrically, [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] portrays Madonna addressing her insecurities and the release that follows, in addition to her questioning her career's longevity. The recording was generally well received by music critics, with the majority of them comparing it to the singer's previous work <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Prayer (1989), Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005).|$|E
500|$|... "Dress You Up" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Madonna {{from her}} second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). It was {{released}} on July 31, 1985 as the album's final single, by Sire Records. The song was the last track {{to be added to}} the album as it was submitted late by songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale. Madonna pushed for the song's inclusion <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Virgin as she particularly liked its lyrics. Musically, the song is a drum beat driven dance track featuring instrumentation from guitars and vocals from a choir and a guitar solo played by Nile Rodgers, who also produced the song. The lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex, comparing dressing up with passion. A live performance from Madonna's first tour was used as the music video.|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single from her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, on May 9, 1989, with [...] "The Look of Love", from the 1987 film soundtrack Who's That Girl, on its B-side. When Madonna started work <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Prayer, she considered many options, {{and thought about the}} musical direction for it. She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with her ex-husband Sean Penn, her family, her lost mother and even her belief in God. Madonna thought about lyrical ideas for the songs on topics that, until then, were personal mediation never to be shared with her public so openly and pointedly. She came to the realization that as she and her fans were growing up, and it was time for her {{to move away from the}} teen appeal to wider audiences, and en-cash on the longevity of the album market. Madonna wanted her new sound to be calculative and indicative of what was fashionable, and ride the changing trend of music.|$|E

500|$|... "Dress You Up" [...] was {{the last}} song to be {{included}} on the Like a Virgin album. Producer Nile Rodgers had initially asked songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale to write a song for Madonna {{in the style of}} Rodgers' band Chic. However, the writing took time, since both LaRusso and Stanziale were busy with other projects. When the lyrics of the song was submitted, Rodgers rejected it as {{there was no time to}} compose a melody and record it for the album. But Madonna liked the lyrics of the song, and persuaded Rodgers to include it <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Virgin. In Britain, the song was released as a limited-edition shaped picture disc. In this case, it was star-shaped to tie in with the Christmas release date for the single. The song is one of several of Madonna's hit singles not included on The Immaculate Collection compilation, released in 1990. [...] "Dress You Up" [...] was, however, later included on Madonna's 2009 compilation album Celebration. Although no music video was separately made for the song, a live performance of [...] "Dress You Up" [...] from The Virgin Tour, filmed in Detroit was used as the video.|$|E

Music Review |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=December 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 8, 2011}} Matthew Horton of BBC Music called it a [...] "lovely single", while Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe called it [...] "swaggering".

[...] Kyle Anderson of MTV Newsroom praised Hilson's [...] "confidence and sweetness" [...] on the song, and described the beat as [...] "funky and sick." [...] Editors of DesiHits described [...] "Pretty Girl Rock" [...] as an [...] "upbeat and catchy track...and we have to say the beat really rocks!." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides singing, Madonna has {{the ability}} to play several musical instruments. She learned to play drum and guitar from her then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy in the late 1970s, before joining the Breakfast Club line-up as the drummer. This helped her to form the band Emmy, where she {{performed}} as the guitarist and lead vocalist. Madonna later played guitar on her demo recordings. On the liner notes of Pre-Madonna, Stephen Bray wrote: [...] "I've always thought she passed up a brilliant career as a rhythm guitarist." [...] After her career breakthrough, Madonna focused mainly in singing but was also credited for playing cowbell on Madonna (1983) and synthesizer <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Prayer (1989). In 1999, Madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart, before eventually leaving the project. After two decades, Madonna decided to perform with guitar again during the promotion of Music (2000). She took further lessons from guitarist Monte Pittman to improve her guitar skill. Since then, Madonna has played guitar on every tour, as well as her studio albums. At the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards, she received nomination for Les Paul Horizon Award, which honors the most promising up-and-coming guitarist.|$|E

The song is a drum beat-driven dance track featuring instrumentation of guitars and vocals from a choir. The lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex, comparing dressing up with passion. [...] "Shoo-Bee-Doo" [...] contains homage to Motown music. Beginning with a slow introduction, the song is in the doo-wop genre and resembles the songs of early Sixties girl groups like The Shirelles or The Crystals. The saxophone breakdown is played by Lenny Pickett. The lyrics discuss relationship problems, and are phrased as clichés in the coda. [...] "Pretender" [...] starts with the chorus and then moves to the verse. It talks about seduction and the insecurity felt by a woman who feels that things are moving too quickly for her with her man. [...] "Stay" [...] is the final track on the album. Using triple-rhythms and double-tracked vocals, the song includes a noise resembling someone slapping a microphone and a spoken sequence which fades away in the end.|$|E
500|$|Epaminondas {{then gave}} the order to advance, {{catching}} the enemy off guard, and causing a furious scramble in the Mantinean camp to prepare for battle. The battle unfolded as Epaminondas had planned.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 516518 The cavalry forces on the wings drove back the Athenian and Mantinean cavalry opposite them. Diodorus says that the Athenian cavalry on the Mantinean right wing, although not inferior in quality, could not withstand the missiles from the light-troops that Epaminondas had placed among the Theban cavalry. Meanwhile, the Theban infantry advanced. Xenophon evocatively describes Epaminondas's thinking: [...] " [...] led forward his army prow <b>on,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> trireme, believing {{that if he could}} strike and cut through anywhere, he would destroy the entire army of his adversaries." [...] As at Leuctra, the weakened right wing was ordered to hold back and avoid fighting. In the clash of infantry, the issue briefly hung in the balance, but then the Theban left-wing broke through the Spartan line, and the entire enemy phalanx was put to flight. However, {{at the height of the}} battle, Epaminondas was mortally wounded by a Spartan, and died shortly thereafter. Following his death, the Thebes and allies made no effort to pursue the fleeing enemy; a testament to Epaminondas's centrality to the war effort.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 518519; Tritle, The Greek World in the Fourth Century, 94 ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{garnered}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} felt the song's message was too deep for an artist like Beyoncé to sing, and criticized its placement on the track list of 4. Georgette Cline of The Boombox gave the song a positive review stating that, although the lyrics are {{a bit on the}} morbid side, it works in Beyoncé's favor, [...] "proving she can tackle a myriad of subjects". Matthew Horton of BBC criticized the song's order of placement on the track list of 4, stating that [...] "'Run the World (Girls)' is tagged <b>on</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bonus track following 'I Was Here', which sounds like the perfect ending for the album." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also had the same view, saying it [...] "disrupts the flow of up-tempo songs on the second half 4". Perpetua however calls it a [...] "showstopper" [...] and added that it [...] "work well as a bittersweet emotional climax for the album". Perpetua finished his review by saying that [...] "'I Was Here' is the blustery ballad one would expect by a Beyoncé/Warren team-up, and stands off as flat and generic when compared to the rest of 4." [...] Another reviewer of the same magazine, Jody Rosen complimented Beyoncé's vocals stating that she sings with authority; however, he coined [...] "I Was Here" [...] as a low point on the album and added that it is [...] "swamped in 'My Way'-style self-mythologizing." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Into the Groove" [...] is {{the sixth}} track on the 1985 {{worldwide}} reissue of Like a VIrgin; {{it has never}} been part of Like a Virgin on any North American release. Madonna's inspiration behind the song was the dance floor, and she wrote it while watching a handsome Puerto Rican man across her balcony. Initially written for her friend Mark Kamins, Madonna later decided to use it in the soundtrack of her 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan. Unlike the other songs <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>A</b> Virgin, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios, and produced by Madonna and Steve Bray. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process. In Andrew Morton's Madonna biography, she noted that at one point of the recording, Bray was facing difficulties with the bridge of the song, as the melody thought by him was not syncing {{with the rest of the}} composition. Undeterred by his obvious difficulties, Madonna stepped up to the microphone and sang the words [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me". Bray's problem was solved; Belle remembered the experience as: [...] " [...] seemed to come out of her, I was awestruck." [...] The song consists of instrumentation from drums, percussion, congas and whistles. Madonna's voice is double-tracked in the chorus. The lyrics are simple, and written as an invitation to dance with the singer, with sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning.|$|E
500|$|Lennox Samuels from The Dallas Morning News {{felt that}} the [...] "great sense of being hurt that is present in 'Oh Father' is far more {{relatable}} than any other Madonna song." [...] Kevin Phinney from the Austin American-Statesman called it the strongest and the most shocking song <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Prayer. Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote that the orchestration of the song was [...] "grandiloquent", while describing Madonna's delivery of the lines as an [...] "angry triumph". Stewart Mason from Allmusic shared Holden's opinion, and described [...] "Oh Father" [...] as [...] " [...] finest ballad performance ever". He added that the [...] "upward modulation of the chorus, accompanied by some overdubbed self-harmonies that feature a very controlled and effective use of Madonna's highest register, is sheer brilliance, giving the song a steely resolve that removes any taint of self-pity from the verses." [...] Music journalist J. D. Considine, while reviewing Like a Prayer for Rolling Stone, believed that despite the song's [...] "lush" [...] string arrangement, some of the lyrics contain a disquieting degree of pain. Hadley Freeman from The Guardian commented that the confessional nature of the lyrics of [...] "Oh Father" [...] was what appealed to her {{the most in the}} song. Negative reception for the song was given by Mark Browning, author of David Fincher: Films That Scar, who called it one of Madonna's weakest efforts, due to the verses sounding more like musical theater than a pop song.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{controversial}} period of her career, Madonna said, [...] "I feel I've been misunderstood. I {{tried to make}} a statement about feeling good about yourself and exploring your sexuality, but people took it to mean that everyone should go out and have sex with everyone, and that I {{was going to be the}} leader of that. So I decided to leave it alone because that's what everyone ended up concentrating on. Sex is such a taboo subject and it's such a distraction that I'd rather not even offer it up." [...] During 1994, Madonna started recording her sixth studio album. She collaborated with R producers such as Dallas Austin, Dave [...] "Jam" [...] Hall, and Babyface, and also enlisting British producer Nellee Hooper to the project. It became one of the very few occasions where she collaborated with well-known producers, the first since Nile Rodgers <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Virgin (1984). When asked about the record, Madonna said she wanted people to concentrate on the musical aspects of it, and would like the songs to speak for themselves. She also commented that it was because she was not interested in giving many interviews and being on the cover of magazines. She described the album as [...] "a combination of pop, R, hip-hop and a Madonna record. It's very, very romantic". In an interview with The Face magazine, Madonna explained her inspirations behind Bedtime Stories as well as the reason for teaming up with R song producers.|$|E

500|$|On October 8 1976, Bryant and Scott {{delivered}} a twenty-page treatment entitled , which executives Barry Diller and Michael Eisner liked. In the treatment, Kirk {{and his crew}} encounter beings {{they believe to be}} the mythical Titans and travel back millions of years in time, accidentally teaching early man to make fire. Planet of the Titans also explored the concept of the third eye. With the studio's acceptance of this treatment Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and Isenberg were swamped with grateful fan mail. Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators. Key amongst these were famed production designer Ken Adam, who said that [...] "I was approached by Gene Roddenberry and we got <b>on</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> house on fire", and thus he was employed to design the film. In turn Adam employed artist Ralph McQuarrie fresh off the yet to be released Star Wars. They worked on designs for planets, planetary and asteroid bases, a black hole [...] "shroud", a crystalline [...] "super brain", and new concepts for the Enterprise, including interior concepts which Adam later revisited for the film Moonraker and a flat-hulled starship design (frequently credited to McQuarrie, but which McQuarrie's own art of book identifies as an Adam design). McQuarrie wrote that [...] "there was no script" [...] thus much of the work was [...] "winging it". When that film folded after three months for Adam and [...] "a month and a half" [...] for McQuarrie, their concepts were shelved, although a handful of them were revisited in later productions.|$|E
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and released {{as the third}} single from Like a Prayer (1989). The song is built around the themes of love and relationships, with William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet one of its major inspirations. Madonna was reading Romeo and Juliet during the breaks during rehearsals for Speed the Plow, a Broadway show {{in which she was}} starring in 1988. On the third day of the Like a Prayer recording sessions, she presented Leonard with the lyrics of [...] "Cherish", and explained that she had written the song [...] "one sunny afternoon by the beach", but later confessed that it was actually written in her make-up room. [...] "I wrote it in a superhyper-positive state of mind that I knew was not going to last", the singer recalled. Leonard introduced one line from the similar titled song by the 1960s band The Association, [...] "Cherish is the word I use", after which Madonna decided to include it <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Prayer. The B-side of the single release of [...] "Cherish" [...] was a previously unreleased track called [...] "Supernatural", initially composed during the recording sessions of her third studio album, True Blue and later completed in 1989. In 2009, during an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna confessed that she {{had never been able to}} predict if her songs would be successful, irrespective of her personal opinion of them. As an example, she cited [...] "Cherish" [...] as one of the most [...] "retarded" [...] songs she had written, but noted it became a commercial success. The song was also included on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and the two-disc edition of her 2009 compilation Celebration.|$|E
500|$|Freya Jarman-Ivens, one of {{the authors}} of Madonna's Drowned Worlds, felt that the song was {{one of the}} last works on pure romanticism by Madonna. [...] "She should come back to the formula from time to time, but I guess she has moved beyond all of that", Jarman-Ivens added. Carol Clerk, author of Madonnastyle noted that the [...] "refreshing" [...] nature of the song was {{particularly}} noticeable if one follows Madonna's catalog chronologically, especially embedded between the anthem like nature of the previous release, [...] "Express Yourself", and the lament of the succeeding release, [...] "Oh Father". Scholar Maria Raha wrote in her book Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground that the song was full of [...] "trite" [...] lyrics. Andy Goldberg from The Jerusalem Post said that [...] "Cherish" [...] took [...] "Madonna back to her old stomping grounds, the lively bass line and lilting melodies of hit albums past." [...] Kevin Phinney from Austin American-Statesman was surprised by Madonna's contribution to the song and confessed that he [...] " [...] it difficult to be believe that she even wrote this?" [...] Phinney continued that he wanted Madonna to go in a more mature direction and compose songs musically similar to [...] "Cherish". Writing for The Washington Post, Richard Harrington explained that [...] "while songs <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Prayer dealt with matters opening her heart, with 'Cherish' Madonna dealt with matters which were close to her heart." [...] This view was also shared by Ian Blair from Chicago Tribune who categorized the song as being sung for the [...] "happy-go-lucky lovers and dreamers". The Dallas Morning News Lennox Samuels appreciated the light-hearted theme of the song and complimented Madonna and Leonard for not sticking with personal subject matters only on the album. Dale Anderson from The Buffalo News opined that the song would become one of Madonna's most forgettable releases, but was also hopeful that it would not. This opinion was shared by Don McCleese of Chicago Sun-Times, who added that [...] "Cherish" [...] was not something expected from Madonna at that point of time. McCleese was disappointed that Madonna went back to the [...] "happy-go-lucky, lovey-dovey" [...] kind of songs, which did not match her self-image. Dan DeLuca from The Philadelphia Inquirer, while reviewing Madonna's Drowned World Tour in 2001, compared [...] "Cherish" [...] with songs by Chris Robinson, humorously adding that [...] "only if he was gay he would sing something like that." ...|$|E
