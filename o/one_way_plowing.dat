40|$|In 2013, Farid and Vasiliev [arXiv:quant-ph/ 1310. 4922] for {{the first}} time {{proposed}} a way to construct a protocol for the realisation of "Classical to Quantum" <b>one</b> <b>way</b> hash function, a derivative of the Quantum <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function as defined by Gottesman and Chuang [Technical Report arXiv:quant-ph/ 0105032] and used for constructing quantum digital signatures. We, on the other hand, {{for the first}} time, propose the idea of a different kind of <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function which is "quantum-classical" in nature, that is, it takes an n-qubit quantum state of a definite class as its input and produces a classical output. We formally define such a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function and propose a way to construct and realise it. The proposed <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function turns out to be very useful in authenticating a quantum state in any quantum money scheme and so we can construct many quantum money schemes based on such a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function. Later in the paper, we also give explicit construction of quantum money schemes like quantum bitcoins and quantum currency schemes, solely based on the proposed <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function. The security of such schemes can be explained {{on the basis of the}} security of the underlying <b>one</b> <b>way</b> functions...|$|R

A comparison of the images produced by the regular <b>one</b> <b>way</b> algorithm, RTM, and the new method, shows that this new method can significantly improve the image in regions of interest, and in certain situations may even provide more useful information than RTM.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the distribution property of <b>one</b> <b>way</b> discord in multipartite system by introducing {{the concept of}} polygamy deficit for <b>one</b> <b>way</b> discord.

For tripartite pure states, two kinds of polygamy deficits are presented with the equivalent expressions and physical interpretations regardless of measurement. For four-partite pure states, we provide a condition which makes <b>one</b> <b>way</b> discord polygamy being satisfied.
