50|$|Currently, the macroelectronics {{industry}} is dramatically {{growing in the}} similar way as the microelectronics was in early ’90s. The most visible example of macroelectronics at present is flat-panel displays, which have been rapidly replacing <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> as the monitors of choice for computers and televisions since 2000. The flat-panel displays have enabled applications unimaginable for <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b> For example, the Dolphins Stadium in Miami will soon have the world's largest high definition video display, about 15 m high and 42 m wide, comprising more than 4.6 million light-emitting diodes, showing image of more than 1.5 million pixels.|$|R

5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and one year after a similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature an electronic screen they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than through light bulbs.|$|R
