In this paper, the impact of the surface chemistry of silica NPs on their hydro- and oleo-phobic properties as well as their transport properties are investigated in water or decane using molecular dynamics simulation. Trifluoromethyl or pentafluoroethyl groups as water and <b>oil</b> <b>repellents</b> are placed on the NPs. It is found that the density and residence time of liquid molecules around the NPs are modulated considerably with the existence of the functional groups on the NPs’ surfaces. Also, much larger density fluctuations for liquids close {{to the surface of the}} NPs are observed when the number of the groups on the NPs increases, indicating increased hydrophobicity. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of the NPs in either water or decane increases with increasing the number or length of the fluorocarbon chains, demonstrating non-Brownian behavior for the NPs. The surface chemistry imparts a considerable contribution on the diffusion coefficient of the NPs. Finally, potential of mean force calculations are undertaken. It is observed that the free energy of adsorption of the NPs on a mineral surface is more favorable than that of the aggregation of the NPs, which suggests the NPs adsorb preferably on the mineral surface...|$|R

40|$|The {{additives}} and contaminants which {{occur in}} textile fibers vary widely, {{depending on the}} type of fiber and the pretreatment which it has received. Synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester contain trace amounts of contaminants such as catalysts and catalyst deactivators which remain after the synthesis of the basic polymers. In addition, there are frequently a number of materials which are added to perform specific functions in almost all man-made fibers. Examples of these would include traces of metals or metal salts used as tracers for identification of specific lots of fiber, TiO 2 or similar materials added as delustrants, and a host of organic species added for such special purposes as antistatic agents or flame retardants. There may also be considerable quantities of residual monomer or small oligomers dissolved in the polymer matrix. The situation becomes even more complex after the fibers are converted into fabric form. Numerous materials are applied at various stages of fabric preparation to act as lubricants, sizing agents, antistats, bleaches, and wetting agents to facilitate the processing, but these are normally removed before the fabric reaches the cutters of the ultimate consumers and therefore usually do not constitute potential hazards. However, there are many other chemical agents which are frequently added during the later stages of fabric preparation and which are not designed to be removed. Aside from dyes and printing pigments, the most common additive for apparel fabrics is a durable press treatment. This generally involves the use of materials capable of crosslinking cellulosics by reacting through such functions as N-methylolated amides or related compounds such as ureas and carbamates. These materials pose some potential hazards due to both the nitrogenous bases and the formaldehyde which they usually release. There is usually also some residual catalyst in fabrics which have received such treatments. Other types of chemical treatments which are often applied to fabrics to achieve special effects include flame retardants, soil release agents, antistatic agents, softeners, water and/or <b>oil</b> <b>repellents,</b> ultraviolet absorbers, bacteriostats, and fungistats...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDemands of ultra-precision {{machining}} {{systems have}} recently increased for machining three dimensional nano-geometries. Such systems require not only horizontal positioning systems but also vertical positioning systems with a nanometer positioning accuracy. However, the gravity load of moving mass negatively affects the positioning accuracy {{especially in a}} vertical positioning system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} compensate the influence of the gravity load for vertical ultra-precision positioning. Although the gravity compensation method using a non-contact vacuum cylinder has been proposed, it is difficult to improve the sealing performance of the non-contact seal. Thus, this study proposes the magnetic fluid seal for linear motion system with a gravity compensator. In general, magnetic fluid seals have been applied to rotary motion systems, however there are few studies on linear motion systems so far. When a magnetic fluid seal is applied to linear motion systems, the magnetic fluid leaks out of the seal clearance due to the movement, and it cannot keep the performance as a seal. In this study, it is possible to prevent leaking the magnetic fluid from the seal clearance and also to maintain the performance of the seal by holding a magnetic fluid by the two pole pieces shaped tapered tip and putting it near the piston made of non-magnetic material and coated with <b>oil</b> <b>repellent</b> layer. The proposed magnetic fluid seal performance has been evaluated. As a result, the result confirmed that the proposed magnetic fluid seal is useful as a linear motion seal, and the <b>oil</b> <b>repellent</b> layer on the piston surface can largely improve the sealing performance...|$|E

This study aims to explore chemical and water protective surface on cotton fabric by pad-knife-pad coating of waterborne polyurethane (WPU), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and trimethylated silica (TMS). The chemical structure of the coated cotton fabrics was characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Surface wettability and liquid protective properties of the coated cotton fabrics were analyzed by water contact angle, water repellency, hydrostatic pressure, and oil and aqueous liquid repellency.

The method applied at laboratory scale to cotton, polyester and polyamide fibers was already studied in previous works [1 - 3]: the optimization of process parameters, followed by a deep characterization of treated samples, revealed the effectiveness of the treatment. In the present study, a great number of larger fabric samples were impregnated by padding with commercial finishing agents and then were irradiated with an high power, semi industrial UV lamp, in air. Samples add-on was significantly reduced in order to hold down the finishing cost. White and dyed samples of different textile composition were treated and evaluated in terms of conferred repellency, yellowing or color changes. Most relevant process parameters were investigated, considering the thermal process normally adopted at industrial level as reference.

40|$|Perfluorinated {{compounds}} (PFCs) are {{a family}} of chemicals used widely as surfactants, anti-staining products, impregnation agents and fire fighting foams. The wide possible uses for these compounds are due to their unique water- and <b>oil</b> <b>repellent</b> properties. Notable PFCs, like perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) {{and others have been}} found in the (mainly aquatic) environment as well as animals and humans. Several studies have investigated the effects of these chemicals, mainly PFOS and PFOA, since the first observation in human serum. The literature available on PFC exposure and potential harmful effects in humans will be discussed. PFC exposure occurs through different routes. Indoor and outdoor air {{has been found to be}} contaminated with some degree of PFCs, from which inhalation is a form of exposure. Inhalation of contaminated house dust has been mentioned as a source of exposure as well. Most abundant route of exposure was found to be dietary, mainly through directly contaminated fish or food contaminated by PFCs through migration from the packaging. Ingestion of house dust by toddlers contributes to total exposure as well. Furthermore, occupational exposure may occur in PFC factories as well as occupations using PFC products, like ski-wax. Occupational levels of PFC exposure have been found to be several orders of magnitude higher than general population levels. Many effects have been found to be associated with PFC exposure, mainly PFOS and PFOA, for the most part investigated in rodents. Only few effects have been observed at exposure levels comparable to the general population. Immunotoxic effects were found in relevant concentrations in rodents, causing a reduction in immune response. Epidemiological effects in the general population include reprotoxic effects, like reduced sperm count, and a recent study observed a positive correlation between PFC levels in serum and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) in children. Higher perceived adverse effects, like carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity, have been observed in rodents, but in higher concentrations and these have not been found in the general population or the occupationally exposed. In conclusion, epidemiological data provides the most convincing evidence of adverse effects due to PFC exposure. More toxic effects found in rodents increase the potential risk of these compounds in humans as well. Further investigation of PFOS and PFOA, but also other PFCs less abundant in humans, is needed to completely assess the risks of PFCs for humans. It is evident that the unrest caused by these compounds is substantiated, and deserves more attention...|$|E

Other oils such as strawberry and d-limonene were attractive to both larvae and moths. Some of the <b>repellent</b> <b>oils</b> were, therefore, tested for {{their effect on}} certain biological aspects of the insects. Eugenol and peppermint oils, each at the 0. 01 % conc., caused a significant depression in the fecundity of moth and decreased the percentage of egg hatchability. Eugenol oil was much more effective than peppermint oil at 1 %. Dried (leaves, fruits or seeds) powder of 14 different plants species were tested in different concentrations with talcum powder (carrier material) against egg deposition. The results indicated that dried powders of Allium cepa, Curcuma longa, Colocasia antiqurum, Ocimum basilicum. Dodonaea viscose and Thuja orientalis played a highly significant role in reducing egg deposition. The most impressive effect was displayed by powders of D. viscose and A. cepa, which caused the highest depression in egg deposition {{as well as in}} the emerging offsprings.

Mosquito repellence {{with the use of}} textiles is a promising area of functionality. Many species of mosquitoes are the vectors of numerous fatal diseases, with no effective vaccines against the ailments caused by them. Personal protection is one of the approaches to prevent mosquito bites. The only way to avoid the disorders is to keep away from the mosquito bites. Mosquito repellent textiles are one of the revolutionary ways to advance the textile field by providing immensely needed features of driving away the mosquitoes. It protects the human beings from the bite of mosquitoes, and thereby promising safety from the mosquito borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, chicken guinea and filarial (Prabha and Vasugi 2012). Both natural as well as synthetic repellents are exploited against mosquitoes. But natural <b>repellents</b> as essential <b>oils</b> are the upcoming genre of scientific interest due to their non-toxic, non-sticky, non-irritating and eco-friendly nature; however, essential <b>oil</b> <b>repellents</b> tend to being short-lived in their effectiveness due to their high volatility and requirement of frequent re-application. This problem has been tried to be overcome with the controlled release of oils from the textiles using monomolecular inclusion complexes with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) in native form (Songkro et al. 2012), β-CD with crosslinking agents as polycarboxylic acids namely citric acid, BTCA, acrylic acid (Martel et al. 2002 a, b; Voncina and Marechal 2005; El-Tahlawy et al. 2007; Specos et al. 2013), MCT β-CD (Hebeish et al. 2008; Romi et al. 2005; Abdel-Mohdy et al. 2008, 2009; Shahba et al. 2011; Hebeish et al. 2009, 2010) on varied substrates. The use of citric acid as crosslinking agent for β-CD had been extensively reported for cotton for diversified functionalities (Aly et al. 2004; Fahmy 2004; Martel et al. 2002 b; Ramchandran 2009; Dehbadi et al. 2014; Kasprzyk et al. 2010; Fouda and Fahmy 2011) but the use of β-CD CA as a host for mosquito repellent finishing has been worked and cited scarcely (Samanta et al. 2016). Also, the process parameters for attachment of β-CD CA on textile substrates as individual parameters during reaction has been reported, that too rarely without any emphasis on their interactions (Martel et al. 2002 b; El-Tahlawy et al. 2006; Ramchandran 2009). As the reactivity of citric acid towards cellulose is higher than that towards β-CD, results in different desired reaction conditions of citric acid towards cellulose and β-CD, necessitated the requirement of a two-step procedure.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to study the influence of mineral oil on landing and permanence; oviposition; and mortality of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) on citrus plants. For all experiments, mineral oil (Argenfrut®) was sprayed on sweet orange plants at 1 % concentration. Landing-permanence and oviposition were assessed using choice and non-choice tests. For the first parameter, 50 adult psyllids were released {{in the center of}} the screen house (5 mx 2. 5 mx 2 m) (n = 10) and the number of psyllids/plant at different time intervals were counted. For the oviposition trial, which was conducted under laboratory conditions, 20 psyllids were confined in a cage to oviposit (n = 10) and after three days the number of eggs/plant were counted. The effect of mineral oil on psyllid mortality was assessed by confining 10 adult psyllids per plant (n= 4) with fully expanded mature leaves after spray. Assessment was conducted 7 days after confining the insects, by determining the number of live and dead psyllids. The results of this research indicate that mineral <b>oil</b> has <b>repellent</b> effect on adults of D. citri, which prefer oil-free plants to land, remain and oviposit. Moreover, mineral oil was effective on D. citri control (mortality≥ 80 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The insect {{repellent}} {{activity of the}} essential oils of two tropical Lamiaceae, Hyptis spicigera Lamarck and Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poitier, and of a Mediterranean one, Lavandula angustifolia (Miller), has been measured against adults of the granary weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera Dryophthoridae). The chemical composition of the three essential oils was also examinated. Results showed that the three essential <b>oils</b> had <b>repellent</b> activity on S. zeamais adults. At the lowest dose (0. 001 %) H. suaveolens essential oil exhibited a significantly higher repellent effect compared with H. spicigera and L. angustifolia, while {{no significant differences were}} observed for the repellent effect of the three essential oils at the highest dose (0. 1 %). L. angustifolia essential oils evidenced a significantly lower repellent activity at the intermediate dose (0. 01 %) after 1, 3 and 5 h of exposure. Chemical analyses showed that in the essential oil of H. suaveolens monoterpene hydrocarbons were the most represented class of volatiles (64. 1 %), followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (24. 0 %), oxygenated monoterpenes (8. 1 %) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (2. 4 %). In the essential oil of H. spicigera monoterpene hydrocarbons were the most represented class of volatiles (70. 4 %), followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (22. 6 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{maize weevil}} (Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky) {{is one of}} most {{important}} pest of stored seeds worldwide, but its current control method {{is based on the}} use of synthetic insecticides, usually leading to undesirable problems such as insecticide residues on treated food, human intoxications, and insect resistance development. Therefore the search of friendly alternative methods is required. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess, under laboratory conditions, the insecticidal properties of Peumus boldus Molina, Laurelia sempervirens (Ruiz & Pav.) Tul., and Laureliopsis philippiana (Looser) Schodde essential oils against S. zeamais. The phytochemical analysis of the three essential oils showed 1, 8 -cineole, safrole and methyleugenol as the common components; all of them documented with insecticidal activity from essential oils from other plant species. The highest toxicity (100 % mortality) of these three oils acting as a contact insecticide was observed at 24 h exposure at 4 % concentration. The estimated LC 50 values for P. boldus, L. sempervirens, and L. philippiana were 0. 37, 1. 02, and 0. 28 μL g- 1, respectively. Peumus boldus exhibited the highest fumigant activity with 100 % adult mortality at 30 μL oil L- 1 air. At ≥ 0. 5 % (v/w) concentration, all essential <b>oils</b> showed <b>repellent</b> activity. These three essential oils showed a promissory insecticidal activity against the maize weevil...|$|R
