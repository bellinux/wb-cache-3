40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest shown {{in recent years}} to investigate the behavior of heat and mass transfer in a square annulus with a porous medium fixed between the inner and outer walls. This paper aims to evaluate the Soret effect arising in the case of heat and mass transfer in a porous medium bounded by a square annulus and subjected to isothermal heating of the inner surfaces as well as the <b>outer</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The phenomenon is governed by 3 partial differential equations, the momentum, energy and concentration equations, that are coupled together and result in a situation where change in one variable affects the other equations and vice versa. The partial differential equations are converted into finite element equations {{with the help of the}} Galerkin method and then solved to predict solution variables such as temperature, stream function and concentration in the porous medium. It is found that the heat transfer rate at the hot wall decreases with increasing viscous dissipation effect in the porous medium...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} {{and distribution of}} the sponge community in ¢ve sites and four habitats in Cagarras Archipelago, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, are described. The archipelago has three major islands (Cagarra, Palmas, and Comprida), and four islets. Qualitative samples were taken by SCUBA diving in the three islands and in two islets, and quantitative samples were taken in Palmas Island only. Cluster analysis using Jaccard’s coe⁄cient on qualitative data grouped the two islets (Cagarra Bank and Cagarra Islet), which are more exposed to wave action, and the three islands formed a group of relatively sheltered sites. Cluster analysis using Bray^Curtis coe⁄cient on quantitative data from di¡erent habitats in Palmas Island allowed distinction of three groups of samples: overhangs, shallow <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> (6 m depth), and vertical walls plus deeper <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> (17 m depth). Sponge abundance was greater in overhangs (61. 2 indm 2), which were dominated by Protosuberites sp. and Clathrina conifera. Abundance was reduced in vertical walls (31. 1 indm 2) and deep <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> (16. 8 indm 2). Pachychalina sp. dominated the deep <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> and Clathrina conifera was dominant in overhangs. Values of Shannon’s diversity in overhangs, vertical walls (both with H 02. 1 bits ind 1) and deep <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> (H 01. 7 bits ind 1) were moderate and similar, whereas in shallow <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> the sponges were both less diverse (H 00. 37) and less abundant (8. 5 indm 2). Shallow <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> were dominated by Hymeniacidon heliophila. The reduced species richness of the sponge community in Cagarras Archipelago when compared with other sites in Brazil and elsewhere is probably {{due in part to}} the pollution from the city of Rio de Janeiro. Wave action appears to reduce the number of sponge species at a local scale, whereas substrate inclination a¡ects more strongly the species composition and abundance than the diversity of sponges...|$|R

The beam radiation on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface</b> owns the highest values comparing to {{diffuse radiation}} for all days of June. The total daily radiation on the tilted surface decreases with slopes. The beam radiation data also decays with slopes especially for vertical surface.

As a consequence an anisotropic model has been developed. The proposed model treats south-, north- and east/west-facing surfaces differently. The accuracy of the proposed model is {{compared with that of}} the isotropic model by employing a simple technique of error analysis, The usefulness of a good daily inclined surface irradiation model is outlined.

40|$|Mnogi naši crnkasto i sivkasto obojeni vapnenci zbog povećanog sadržaja organske tvari gube svježinu na vanjskim površinama, izbljeđuju i postaju puni svijetlih mrlja. Prirodna dekorativnost takvih vapnenaca postiže se njihovom ugradnjom u unutrašnjim prostorima. Pigmenti u mineralima magmatskih stijena znatno su postojaniji, ne mijenjaju se tijekom vremena. Ipak u uvjetima agresivnog okoliša npr. pod utjecajem posolice, porijeklom s morske površine, dolazi do blijeđenja i nagrizanja cjelokupne površine ugrađenog kamena. Veća postojanost boje magmatskih i metamorfnih varijeteta kamena ili komercijalno granita leži u njihovom silikatnom sastavu. Metamorfne stijene nakon nekog vremena počnu gubiti svježinu svoje boje ali je intenzitet promjene primjetno manji od promjene kod sedimentnih stijena. The {{stable and}} lasting {{color of the}} stone {{increases}} its decorative and commercial value. Special attention needs {{to be applied to}} the consistent colour quality depending on the influence of numerous and unforseen factors to which stone might be exposed after being installed, especially on <b>outer</b> <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>surfaces.</b> These days it is more and more often necessary to consult an expert regarding the consistency of the color quality as well as regarding the quality of the natural stone in general. Many of our black and grey coloured limestones, due to the increased content of organic matter, lose their freshness on outer surfaces; they are fading and become covered with lots of light patches. The natural decorative quality of those limestones is reached through their being installed into interior spaces. The pigments in minerals of magmatic rocks are considerably more lasting; they don’t change over time. Anyway, under the conditions of an aggressive environment, for instance under the influence of accumulated salt from the sea surface, fading occurs, as well as erosion of the total surface of the installed stone. Bigger stability of color in magmatic and metamorphic varieties of stone and commercial granite lays in their silicate composition. Metamorphic rocks start to lose the freshness of their colours but the intensity of change is notably smaller than with changes of sediment rocks...|$|R
