25|$|Liver {{transplantation}} or hepatic transplantation is {{the replacement}} of a diseased liver with the healthy liver from another person (allograft). Liver transplantation is a treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure, although availability of donor organs is a major limitation. The most common technique is <b>orthotopic</b> transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic position as the original liver. The surgical procedure is complex, requiring careful harvest of the donor organ and meticulous implantation into the recipient. Liver transplantation is highly regulated, and only performed at designated transplant medical centers by highly trained transplant physicians and supporting medical team. The duration of the surgery ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Favorable outcomes require careful screening for eligible recipient, {{as well as a}} well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.|$|E
500|$|Neuroblastoma patient derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) {{have been}} created by <b>orthotopic</b> {{implantation}} of patient tumor samples into immunodeficient mice. [...] PDX models have several advantages over conventional cancer cell lines (CCL)s. Neuroblastoma PDXs retain the genetic hallmarks of their corresponding patient tumors and PDXs display infiltrative growth and metastasis to distant organs. PDX models are more predictive of clinical outcome as compared to conventional cancer cell line xenografts. Neuroblastoma PDXs might thus serve as clinically relevant models to identify effective compounds against neuroblastoma.|$|E

2500|$|Curative intention: {{for limited}} disease, when the cancer {{is limited to}} one or more areas of within the liver, surgically {{removing}} the malignant cells may be curative. This may be accomplished by resection the affected portion of the liver (partial hepatectomy) or in some cases by <b>orthotopic</b> liver transplantation of the entire organ.|$|E
2500|$|Before transplantation, liver-support therapy {{might be}} {{indicated}} (bridging-to-transplantation). Artificial liver support like liver dialysis or bioartificial liver support concepts are currently under preclinical and clinical evaluation. Virtually all liver transplants {{are done in}} an <b>orthotopic</b> fashion, that is, the native liver is removed and the new liver {{is placed in the}} same anatomic location. The transplant operation can be conceptualized as consisting of the hepatectomy (liver removal) phase, the anhepatic (no liver) phase, and the postimplantation phase. The operation is done through a large incision in the upper abdomen. [...] The hepatectomy involves division of all ligamentous attachments to the liver, as well as the common bile duct, hepatic artery, hepatic vein and portal vein. [...] Usually, the retrohepatic portion of the inferior vena cava is removed along with the liver, although an alternative technique preserves the recipient's vena cava ("piggyback" [...] technique).|$|E
2500|$|A heart transplant, or {{a cardiac}} transplant, is a {{surgical}} transplant procedure performed on patients with end-stage heart failure or severe {{coronary artery disease}} when other medical or surgical treatments have failed. As of 2016, the most common procedure {{is to take a}} functioning heart (with or without transplantation of a lung or lungs; a cadaveric donor cardiectomy) from a recently deceased organ donor (the cadaveric allograft), and implant it into the patient. The patient's own heart is either removed (the cardiectomy for the recipient) and replaced with the donor heart (<b>orthotopic</b> procedure) or, much less commonly, the recipient's diseased heart is left in place to support the donor heart (heterotopic, or [...] "piggyback," [...] transplant procedure). [...] Approximately 3500 heart transplants are performed every year in the world, more than half of which occur in the US. Post-operation survival periods average 15 years. Heart transplantation is not considered to be a cure for heart disease, but a life-saving treatment intended {{to improve the quality of}} life for recipients.|$|E
2500|$|Cryopreservation {{in humans}} {{with regards to}} {{infertility}} involves preservation of embryos, sperm, or oocytes via freezing. [...] Conception, in vitro, is attempted when the sperm is thawed and introduced to the 'fresh' eggs, the frozen eggs are thawed and sperm is placed with the eggs and together they are placed back into the uterus or a frozen embryo is introduced to the uterus. [...] Vitrification has flaws and is not as reliable or proven as freezing fertilized sperm, eggs, or embryos as traditional slow freezing methods because eggs alone are extremely sensitive to temperature. [...] Many researchers are also freezing ovarian tissue {{in conjunction with the}} eggs in hopes that the ovarian tissue can be transplanted back into the uterus, stimulating normal ovulation cycles. In 2004, Donnez of Louvain in Belgium reported the first successful ovarian birth from frozen ovarian tissue. In 1997, samples of ovarian cortex were taken from a woman with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cryopreserved in a (Planer, UK) controlled-rate freezer and then stored in liquid nitrogen. Chemotherapy was initiated [...] after the patient had premature ovarian failure. In 2003, after freeze-thawing, <b>orthotopic</b> autotransplantation of ovarian cortical tissue was done by laparoscopy and after five months, reimplantation signs indicated recovery of regular ovulatory cycles. Eleven months after reimplantation, a viable intrauterine pregnancy was confirmed, which resulted in the first such live birth – a girl named Tamara.|$|E

During his {{stay at the}} Broussais Hospital, Gilles Dreyfus published several articles on heart transplant, such as Total <b>orthotopic</b> heart transplant: {{an alternative to the}} standard technique (Annals of Thoracic Surgery 1991), where he described a new technique called total heart transplant.|$|E
50|$|Researchers have {{established}} neuroblastoma PDXs by <b>orthotopic</b> implantation of patient tumor explants into immunodeficient mice.

50|$|At {{the same}} time Dr. Soloway was {{studying}} the usefulness of different investigational drugs in the animal model, he was also testing {{the hypothesis that the}} high rate of local recurrence of urothelial tumors {{may be the result of}} implantation of tumor cells on the urothelial surface following endoscopic resection of bladder tumors. By developing an <b>orthotopic</b> bladder implantation animal tumor model, Dr. Soloway was able to establish that an injury to the urothelium created the necessary environment for tumor implantation and the scientific evidence in support of early intravesical chemotherapy following transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. Twenty years later, a series of prospective randomized clinical trials have firmly established the benefit of post-TURBT intravesical chemotherapy. It is also noteworthy that the <b>orthotopic</b> tumor model developed by Dr. Soloway is still the only tumor model that recapitulates the development of muscle invasive bladder cancer in patients.|$|E

Tumorspheres with radial glial characteristics form tumors in <b>orthotopic</b> mouse xenografts, suggesting radial glial as cell of origin for ependymomas.|$|E

50|$|Cancer research: Because of poor spatial resolution, optical imaging is {{typically}} only used for molecular purposes, and not anatomical imaging. Due to poor {{depth of penetration}} in visible wavelengths, it is used for subcutaneous models of cancer, however near-infrared fluorescence has enabled <b>orthotopic</b> models to now be feasible. Often, investigation of specific protein expression in cancer and drug effects on these expressions are studied in vivo with genetically engineered light-emitting reporter genes.|$|E
50|$|On January 30, 1999, {{scientists}} {{announced that}} a lab-grown bladder had been successfully transplanted into dogs. These artificial bladders worked well {{for almost a year}} in the dogs. In 2000, a new procedure for creating artificial bladders for humans was developed. This procedure is called an <b>orthotopic</b> neobladder procedure. This procedure involves shaping a part (usually 35 to 40 inches) of a patient's small intestine to form a new bladder; however, these bladders made of intestinal tissues produced unpleasant side-effects.|$|E
