5|$|The present era is {{classified}} {{as part of a}} mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred. Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100years. The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems {{largely from the}} habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E

5|$|Humans regard certain insects as pests, {{and attempt}} to control them using {{insecticides}} {{and a host of}} other techniques. Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves or fruits. A few parasitic species are pathogenic. Some insects perform complex ecological roles; blow-flies, for example, help consume carrion but also spread diseases. Insect pollinators are essential to the life cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> (including humans) would be devastated. Many other insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit. Silkworms and bees have been used extensively by humans for the production of silk and honey, respectively. In some cultures, people eat the larvae or adults of certain insects.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E
25|$|Although initial {{documents}} {{indicate the}} biosphere reserve covered large areas surrounding the mountains, {{it appears that}} today, the effective definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> reserve corresponds {{to that of the}} Gault Reserve.|$|E
50|$|Generally, <b>the</b> {{projects}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fundy <b>Biosphere</b> Reserve {{revolve around}} three fields of activities: conservation, sustainable development, and capacity building. <b>The</b> Fundy <b>Biosphere</b> Reserve’s ongoing projects touch sustainable tourism, local knowledge and climate, trails and amazing places in <b>the</b> <b>Biosphere</b> Reserve and {{to educate the}} public on their own environmental footprint.|$|R
50|$|Every {{transformation}} of materials in nature - from turtle to tree - requires energy. In nature, the energy source is solar power captured biologically through photosynthesis. A tree’s captured energy {{can then be}} transferred throughout ecosystems through the trophic pyramid to herbivores and carnivores. Plants and animals also have inherent biological processes that absorb energy and store it in chemical form for later use. Solar energy therefore serves as <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere’s</b> transformations <b>of</b> material.|$|R

25|$|Early on, Goldsmith had {{formulated}} {{a concept}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> as an integrated cybernetic entity, the self-regulating parts (of which he included tribal societies) co-operating, largely unconsciously, for the mutual {{benefit of the}} whole, a view that anticipated aspects of the Gaia thesis, {{of which he was}} to become a leading proponent.|$|E
25|$|Terraforming: {{a process}} of {{planetary}} engineering, specifically directed at enhancing the capacity of an extraterrestrial planetary environment to support {{life as we know}} it. The ultimate achievement in terraforming would be to create an open planetary ecosystem emulating all the functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> of Earth, one that would be fully habitable for human beings.|$|E
25|$|The {{arguments}} for biosequestration are often shaped {{in terms of}} economic theory, yet there is a well-recognised quality of life dimension to this debate. Biosequestration assists human beings to increase their collective and individual contributions to the essential resources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere.</b> The policy case for biosequestration overlaps with principles of ecology, sustainability and sustainable development, as well as biosphere, biodiversity and ecosystem protection, environmental ethics, climate ethics and natural conservation.|$|E
40|$|Within highly diverse ecosystems, <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> bacterial taxa {{are present}} in low abundance as members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rare <b>biosphere.</b> <b>The</b> rationale for the occurrence and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rare <b>biosphere,</b> and <b>the</b> putative ecological role(s) and dynamics of its members within a specific ecosystem is currently debated. We hypothesized that in highly diverse ecosystems, a fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rare <b>biosphere</b> acts as a backup system that readily responds to environmental disturbances. We tested this hypothesis by subjecting sediments from Zodletone spring, a sulfide- and sulfur-rich spring in Southwestern OK, to incremental levels of salinity (1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 % NaCl), or temperature (28 °, 30 °, 32 °, and 70 °C), and traced <b>the</b> trajectories <b>of</b> rare members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community {{in response to these}} manipulations using 16 S rRNA gene analysis. Our results indicate that multiple rare bacterial taxa are promoted from rare to abundant members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community following such manipulations and that, in general, <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> such recruitment is directly proportional to <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applied manipulation. Rare members that are phylogenetically distinct from abundant taxa in the original sample (unique rare biosphere) played a more important role in the microbial community response to environmental disturbances, compared to rare members that are phylogenetically similar to abundant taxa in the original sample (non-unique rare <b>biosphere).</b> <b>The</b> results emphasize <b>the</b> dynamic nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rare <b>biosphere,</b> and highlight its complexity and non-monolithic nature...|$|R

25|$|Anthropologist Layla AbdelRahim {{sees the}} root of the {{anthropogenic}} degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> in the anthropology that constructs the human animal as the supreme predator. The ontological explanation offered for Human Supremacy by both science and religion, she says, alienate the human being from the community of life and allow for an immoral control and destruction of the wilderness, which, according to her contains the spirit and intelligence of life.|$|E
25|$|In November 1992, {{the hungry}} Biospherians began eating {{emergency}} food supplies {{that had not}} been grown inside the bubble. Poynter made Chris Helms, PR Director for the enterprise, aware of this. She was promptly dismissed by Margret Augustine, CEO of Space Biospheres Ventures, and told to come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere.</b> This order was, however, never carried out. Poynter writes that she simply decided to stay put, correctly reasoning that the order could not be enforced without effectively terminating the closure.|$|E
25|$|An {{extinction}} event (also {{known as}} a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases {{with respect to the}} rate of speciation. Because most diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial, and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> rather than the total diversity and abundance of life.|$|E

25|$|Teilhard, {{who was a}} Jesuit Paleontologist {{who played}} an {{important}} role in the discovery of Peking Man, presented a teleological view of planetary and cosmic evolution, according to which the formation of atoms, molecules and inanimate matter is followed by the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> and organic evolution, then the appearance of man and the noosphere as the total envelope of human thought. According to Teilhard evolution does not cease here but continues on to its culmination and unification in the Omega Point, which he identifies with Christ.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{municipality}} {{is covered in}} forest of one type or another, and these forests are its main natural resource. These forests have been having problems in recent years between insect and parasitic plant infestations and logging. The infestations have been more severe than usual because of drought conditions weakening trees. While there are strict environmental laws for the area as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> reserve, enforcement is spotty. The forests of this and neighboring municipalities have attracting illegal logging from those outside the area. Pinal de Amoles {{is one of the}} Sierra Gorda municipalities where this problem is the most serious.|$|E
25|$|Land use {{change is}} {{fundamental}} to the operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles. Management of the Earth's atmosphere involves assessment of {{all aspects of the}} carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address human-induced climate change and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities. Ocean circulation patterns have a strong influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms.|$|E
