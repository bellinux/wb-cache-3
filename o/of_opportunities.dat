40|$|Equality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{has been}} the most {{important}} organising principle in education policies in postwar Australia. Equality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> was central to the expansion of publicly-funded education: the promise of upward social mobility through education had broad appeal. Equality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> objectives are now being displaced by the newer and more limited concept of market equity. Equality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> usually implies equality of the educational resources provided to each child, and sometimes goes further to mean positive discrimination in favour of the disadvantaged. However, equity is usually understood only as the right to participate in education. Whereas economic objections used to work in tandem with equality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> policies, the two are now often in contradiction. Further, the failure of the older equality policies to deliver on their promises has partly eroded people 2 ̆ 7 s support for the equality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> perspective, especially middle-class support. There is a growing emphasis on relative individual advantage through education. This new policy environment threatens to result in significantly greater inequality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the {{following}} match, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer. On the first day, Australia set {{a world record}} by scoring 721, the most first-class runs added in one day. Halfway through the day, at 2/364, all rounder Keith Miller came to the crease. A cavalier and carefree character, Miller resented Bradman's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and often refused to try when Australia were in an unassailable position. He deliberately let the ball hit the stumps and was out for a golden duck. Hamence came in and struck 46, adding 146 runs for the fifth wicket with Sam Loxton. The partnership took only an hour, and Australia {{went on to win}} by an innings. Miller later said that one of his reasons for gifting his wicket was to protest the lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> given to Hamence and other fringe batsmen.

5|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, {{economic}} opportunities increased for the English peasantry. Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from employer to employer, or became servants in richer households. These changes were keenly felt across the south-east of England, where the London market created a wide range <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> for farmers and artisans. Local lords {{had the right to}} prevent serfs from leaving their manors, but when serfs found themselves blocked in the manorial courts, many simply left to work illegally on manors elsewhere. Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the purchasing power of rural labourers increased by around 40 percent. As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in fresh laws in 1363 to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite. These sumptuary laws proved unenforceable, but the wider labour laws continued to be firmly applied.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a criterion to assess equalization <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{that is consistent}} with theoretical views <b>of</b> equality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> We characterize inequality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> as a situation where some groups in society enjoy an illegitimate advantage. In this context, equalization <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> requires that the extent of the illegitimate advantage enjoyed by the privileged groups falls. Robustness requires that this judgement be supported by the broadest class of individual preferences. We formalize this criterion in a decision theoretic framework, and derive an empirical condition for equalization <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> based on observed opportunity distributions. The criterion is used to assess the effectiveness of child care at equalizing opportunity among children, using quantile treatment effects estimates of a major child care reform in Norway...|$|R

We argue that we need to see the moments and structures <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> not simply as fixed, but as something that actors can ‘make’. The moments <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> refer to the dynamic, emerging factors <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Meanwhile, the structures <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> consist <b>of</b> relatively consistent, stable factors <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> This theoretical insight is then applied to two debates on development planning projects in the periurban area of North Bandung Area, Indonesia.
