I argue that this is mistaken. In a tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> there is no reasonable expectation that individual, voluntary action will succeed.

40|$|Garrett Hardin’s Tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> {{argument}} {{states that}} resources held in common will inevitably suffer overexploitation and degradation. However, recent contradicting evidence has led theorists to question <b>the</b> soundness <b>of</b> this claim. This paper assesses the accuracy and predictive success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six essential assumptions <b>of</b> Hardin’s approach. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{paper is to}} compare <b>the</b> functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> approach at <b>the</b> local and the international levels, in order {{to demonstrate that the}} context we choose affects <b>the</b> applicability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis in explaining policy outcomes. The paper compares <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> hypothesis in three marine cases: California fisheries, modern Oregon fisheries and European Union Common Fisheries Policy. We find that at the local level <b>the</b> tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> can be mitigated when a co-management of institutions is achieved, while the EU case shows that <b>the</b> tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> is a realistic prediction when dealing with international institutions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The article {{contributes}} to the debate on <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> as a political strategy to counter <b>the</b> privatisation <b>of</b> water services by focusing on <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian water movement. It addresses the question: how has <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> – popularly associated with the Global South – been understood, adopted and translated into practice by social movements in a European country like Italy? We identify three different understandings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> coexisting within <b>the</b> Italian water movement – emphasising universality, locality and participation. We describe the political claims and the initiatives informed by these understandings, and the actors which promoted them. Our analysis underlines that <b>the</b> polysemy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons,</b> its complementarity with the 'human right to water' and its overlapping with <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> 'public' not only proved {{to be effective in}} the Italian case, but also posed challenges when it came to translate <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> into specific governance and management frameworks. <b>The</b> politics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> defines <b>the</b> space where these dynamics unfold: it is more articulated than a mere rhetorical reference to <b>the</b> <b>commons,</b> but less homogeneous and coherent than <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> a 'commons movement'...|$|R

5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the Jabala Upanishad was composed, {{as is true}} with most ancient Indian texts.

Hajime Nakamura, a Japanese scholar of Vedic literature, dates Jabala Upanishad along with Paramahamsa Upanishad to around the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> era. The German scholar of Upanishads, Joachim Sprockhoff, assigns it {{to be from the}} last few centuries prior to the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> era, while the German Indologist Georg Feuerstein dates it to around 300 BCE.

40|$|Over the thirty-seven {{years since}} its publication, Garden Hardin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> 2 ̆ 2 has clearly become one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{influential}} writings <b>of</b> all time. <b>The</b> tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> is one <b>of</b> those rare scholarly ideas {{that has had}} an enormous impact in academia and is also commonly used outside of academia. In legal scholarship, <b>the</b> tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> {{has been used to}} characterize a wide variety of resource problems, including intellectual property rights, overcrowding of telecommunications spectra, air and water pollution, and <b>of</b> course, <b>the</b> classic environmental <b>commons</b> problem, overfishing. But I suggest this embarrassment of citation riches highlights the fact that although we invoke it often, we do not know exactly what constitutes a tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons.</b> In an ideological policy battle between interventionists and libertarians – those that argue for and against governmental intervention – a true tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> situation presents a potentially decisive argument in favor of intervention. In a true tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons,</b> resource users impose mutual externalities upon each other, creating a paternalistic justification for intervention. Of course, in over-exploiting a resource, resource users may also impose externalities upon a larger group that has some stake in the resource, such as the general public might have in clean air or water. This externality alone may be sufficient justification for intervening. But as I define it in this Article, a tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> specifically involves {{a situation in which the}} resource users are detracting from their own ability to continue to exploit the resource. The need to save the resource users from themselves provides, independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need to internalize other large-group externalities, a particularly compelling case for governmental intervention. I use the definition set forth in this Article to analyze a problem that has not been previously recognized as a tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> – <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> ever-increasing political campaign expenditures...|$|R

5|$|The Act, finally {{passed as}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. The Court of Common Pleas thus ceased to exist, except as the Common Pleas Division of the High Court. The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880, allowing for the abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas Division and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880, with their functions merged into the King's Bench Division, with the Lord Chief Justice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas becoming Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.|$|E
