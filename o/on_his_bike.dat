5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike,</b> he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|Eberardo Pavesi {{dominated}} the difficult ninth stage that contained the major climbs of the Nava, Tenda, and San Bartolomeo. Pavesi {{went on to}} win the stage by close to six minutes over the second-place finisher Luigi Ganna. The race's tenth and final stage was marred by rain. Race leader Carlo Galetti crashed into a hay wagon early on in the stage and sustained some heavy wounds, he would get back <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> and finish the stage in fifth place. Despite the rain in Milan, many spectators still came to watch the riders arrive. Luigi Ganna was the first rider to cross the finish line in Milan and in doing so, he won his third stage of the 1910 Giro d'Italia. Carlo Galetti won the Giro d'Italia by a margin of eighteen points over Pavesi. Galetti and his team, Atala-Continental, won the team classification.|$|E

25|$|Peter Woodcock's prized {{possession}} {{was a red}} {{and white}} Schwinn bicycle on which he satisfied his continuing compulsion to wander. He rode the bike to {{the far reaches of}} the city—even during the deep, cold Toronto winters—and evolved a fantasy in which he led a gang of 500 invisible boys on bikes called the 'Winchester Heights Gang'. His foster parents were aware of this fantasy and his compulsion to wander, but they were unaware that he had begun traveling around Toronto <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> and sexually assaulting children.|$|E

25|$|On 3 September 2014, Voigt {{announced}} that he would try to beat the UCI hour record of 49.7 kilometers held by Ondřej Sosenka. The record attempt took place on 18 September 2014 in the Vélodrome Suisse in Grenchen. Jens Voigt's plans to attempt the record were hatched in June 2014 and followed some of the planning that was made for Fabian Cancellara's possible crack at the record. At 43 years old, Voigt had to work on his position <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> to improve his aerodynamics. The bike on which the German rode was revealed on 12 September 2014. The attempt occurred on the day after Voigt's 43rd birthday and was broadcast live by Eurosport and the UCI channel on YouTube. Prior to the attempt, some prominent cycling personalities such as Bradley Wiggins, Eddy Merckx and Chris Boardman expressed the opinion that Voigt had a fair chance of beating the 49.7km mark.|$|E
25|$|Lola {{hangs up}} the phone and starts running (in an {{animated}} sequence) down the staircase of her apartment, past a punk with a dog, and (back in live action) through the streets of Berlin towards her father's bank and she collides with a woman pushing a baby carriage, who is shown to later steal a baby after having lost custody of her own. Continuing, Lola runs alongside a cyclist who offers to sell her his bike, which she refuses; a flash-forward shows him being robbed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> but later marrying a nurse from the hospital in which he recovered. Lola then causes a car crash, which involves her father's colleague, Mr. Meier, and three men in a white BMW. As Lola arrives at the bank, she passes a banker shown later to be paralyzed in a car accident, then killing herself shortly after. She meets her dad, who dismisses her request for help; he reveals that he's not her biological father and that he plans to elope with his pregnant mistress, and then has Lola escorted out of the bank. A security guard who consoles her is shown to later suffer a heart attack.|$|E

50|$|He {{was also}} temperamental, {{throwing}} <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> down a ravine to stop any pressure to continue riding {{when he dropped}} out of the 1956 Tour de France on the col de Luitel. The following year he dropped out again when the retirement of his team-mate, Miguel Poblet, left him without support. He held <b>on</b> to <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> but took off his shoes.|$|R
50|$|That evening Ray {{went for}} a ride <b>on</b> <b>his</b> push <b>bike</b> having the urge {{to return to the}} scene of the crime. At the {{collision}} site was a signboard with a police appeal for witnesses.|$|R
500|$|The most {{significant}} moment during the chase came [...] from the finish, when several riders fell {{on a tight}} corner. These included Tejay van Garderen (BMC), who was helped {{to return to the}} peloton by his teammates. Another rider caught up in the incident was Ben King (...) , who stood {{by the side of the}} road waiting for his team to bring him a new bike. While he was waiting, one spectator stole his bicycle computer and another attempted to ride off <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike,</b> although a mechanical problem stopped him.|$|E
500|$|The final rider {{to set off}} was {{the race}} leader Tony Gallopin (...) [...] Gallopin was 36 seconds ahead of Porte {{overnight}} and expressed hope {{that he would be}} able to defend his lead and take overall victory. Immediately after he set off, however, he was nervous and uncomfortable <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike.</b> (Gallopin, like most of the riders, was riding a conventional road bike with aero bars attached.) At the intermediate time check, he was already 58 seconds behind Porte; he lost another 41 seconds in the second part of the stage. His time of 22' 02" [...] meant he finished 29th on the stage and lost the yellow jersey. He dropped to sixth place overall.|$|E
500|$|Boonen praised Hayman's victory. He {{said that}} Hayman was [...] "the rider nobody was really looking at" [...] {{and that he}} had ridden a [...] "good sprint", {{although}} no one had much energy left by the velodrome; Vanmarcke had faded in the final metres and boxed Boonen in {{at the bottom of the}} track. He stated that he had received a text message on the morning of the race from a doctor who had treated him after he fractured his skull in the 2015 Abu Dhabi Tour; the doctor had said that the day of the race would be the first day that Boonen would be able to get back <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike.</b> He noted that he [...] "couldn't be unsatisfied" [...] even though he had not won the race. Stannard described the race as [...] "so close yet so far" [...] and thought that he could have managed a better result than his third place had he not attacked in the final kilometres. He said that he was [...] "super happy" [...] to see Hayman win; he also said that there were [...] "two more steps to work my way up now".|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{has a large}} race track, {{which is}} frequently used for drag racing and other motorsport events. In November 1966, Italian motor scooter rider Alberto Ancillotti <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Lambretta <b>bike</b> established the 106 mph terminal speed record at this venue.|$|R

500|$|On stage eleven, Sagan {{forced a}} {{move in the}} final [...] with his {{teammate}} Maciej Bodnar, who were followed by Froome and his teammate Geraint Thomas. They opened up a lead of over twenty seconds and held it to six seconds at the finish, where Sagan beat Froome in a sprint. A successful breakaway saw De Gendt win stage twelve at the finish at Chalet Reynard, which was changed from the intended summit finish at Mont Ventoux, [...] later, due to dangerous winds. In the chasing group of overall favourites, a leading group of Porte, Froome and Bauke Mollema (...) crashed {{into the back of}} a camera motorbike that was stopped by the encroaching spectators. Froome's bike was unrideable and he was forced to run until he was given a bike from a neutral service car; although it did not fit him he managed to ride until he received his team bike. The race jury gave Froome and Porte the same time as Mollema, who had got back <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> with no issues. De Gendt took the lead of the mountains classification. Stage thirteen's [...] individual time trial was won by Dumoulin, 38 seconds ahead of second-placed Rui Costa (...) [...] Froome extended his lead to one minute and forty-seven seconds. Cavendish won his fourth stage the next day with a bunch sprint at the Parc des Oiseaux.|$|E
500|$|One {{kilometre}} {{from the}} summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Taylor and Hall {{arrived in the}} team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop when he fell, saying, [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished." [...] But Simpson {{said he wanted to}} go on. Taylor was informed and said, [...] "If Tom, wants to go on, he goes." [...] Noticing that his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] They got him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were 'On, on, on.' The words 'Put me back on my bike!' were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, covering the event for The Sun and Cycling– now Cycling Weekly. Saltmarsh was not there at the time and was in a reception black-spot for live accounts on Radio Tour. Simpson managed to ride a further [...] before he began to wobble. He was held upright by three spectators who then helped him to the ground on side of the road. He was unconscious with his hands locked to the handlebars. Hall shouted for the other mechanic, Ken Ryall, to pry them loose and the pair laid the lifeless Simpson beside the road. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before Dumas came with an oxygen mask.|$|E
500|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. Near the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture. Simpson was in the front group before slipping back {{to a group of}} chasers about a minute behind. He then began losing control of his bike, zig-zagging across the road. A kilometre from the summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Team manager Alec Taylor and Hall arrived in the team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop, saying: [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished", but Simpson said he wanted to continue. Taylor said, [...] "If Tom wants to go on, he goes". Noticing his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] They got him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were [...] "On, on, on." [...] Hall estimated Simpson rode a further [...] before he began to wobble, and was held upright by spectators; he was unconscious, with his hands locked on the handlebars. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, before Dumas arrived with an oxygen mask. Approximately forty minutes after his collapse, a police helicopter took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Two empty tubes and a half-full one of amphetamines, one of which was labelled [...] "Tonedron", were found in the rear pocket of his jersey. The official cause of death was [...] "heart failure caused by exhaustion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Loher was not {{the first}} to cross the nation on bicycle, 11 years earlier another cycler from Oakland, Thomas Stevens, made the trip on a high-wheeler. Loher, however, was the first to do so with the [...] "new {{pneumatic}} tire." [...] He also had no brake on the bicycle and his method of stopping was [...] "to drop a bunch of brush and sticks tied to a rope <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> and drag it behind to slow his momentum." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sagan {{targeted}} the Vuelta a España {{as his first}} Grand Tour appearance. He did not disappoint, earning 3 stage wins in the process. On stage 6, he caused a split in the small lead group by leading them down the final descent crouched <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>bike</b> to increase speed. Three teammates survived his onslaught, plus the heavily outnumbered Pablo Lastras Garcia (...) and Sagan {{went on to win}} the sprint. He also won stage 12 in a sprint conclusion. His next objective was the final stage in Madrid, which he won thanks to a very narrow margin to rivals Daniele Bennati and Alessandro Petacchi.|$|E
