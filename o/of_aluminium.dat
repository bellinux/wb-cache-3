5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the compressive crush behaviour of spheres <b>of</b> closed-cell <b>aluminium</b> foams with different diameters (6, 8 and 10 mm) and square tubes filled with these spheres. The spheres <b>of</b> closed-cell <b>aluminium</b> foams are net spherical shape fabricated via powder metallurgy methods by heating foamable precursor materials in a mould. The square tubes were filled by pouring the spheres <b>of</b> closed-cell <b>aluminium</b> foams freely (without any bonding). The compressive crush performance of square tubes filled with spheres of closed-cell aluminum foams {{were compared to}} that of the empty tubes. The results show a significant influence of the spheres <b>of</b> closed-cell <b>aluminium</b> foam on the average crushing load of the square tubes. The energy absorption in the square tube filled with spheres <b>of</b> closed-cell <b>aluminium</b> foam with diameters of 10 mm is higher than in the other square tubes. The spheres <b>of</b> closed-cell <b>aluminium</b> foams led to improvement of the energy absorption capacity of empty tubes...|$|R
50|$|In 2014, {{more than}} half <b>of</b> the <b>aluminium</b> used in Sapa’s {{production}} stemmed from internal scrap recycling and billets <b>of</b> remelted <b>aluminium</b> was provided by external suppliers according to Sapa's Sustainability Report of 2015.|$|R
5|$|The {{high demand}} <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> created {{the need for}} the {{production}} of sodium. After the introduction of the Hall–Héroult process for the production <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> by electrolysing a molten salt bath ended the need for large quantities of sodium. A related process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886.|$|E
5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This would produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to produce mephedrone.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} {{belongs to}} the point group D3h in its monomeric form and D2h in its dimeric form. Both forms <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> chloride, however, do not possess a dipole moment because the bond dipole moments cancel each other out.|$|E
40|$|The use of tin as an {{alloying}} {{element in the}} production <b>of</b> freeformed infiltrated <b>aluminium</b> components is explored. Tin slows the growth <b>of</b> the <b>aluminium</b> nitride skeleton which provides dimensional stability, as well as increasing the rate of infiltration <b>of</b> the <b>aluminium</b> liquid into the aluminium nitride skeleton.

5|$|In 1982 an {{exceptionally}} strong composite <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> oxide and silicon carbide whiskers was discovered. Development of this laboratory-produced composite {{to a commercial}} product took only three years. In 1985, the first commercial cutting tools made from this alumina and silicon carbide whisker-reinforced composite {{were introduced to the}} market.|$|E
5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. Electromagnets, vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes, and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do waveguides for microwave radiation.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{scandium}} {{was produced}} {{for the first}} time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides, at 700–800°C. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.|$|E

40|$|With the {{large-scale}} wind power generation connected to Gansu power grid, electrolytic aluminium load {{has reached a}} certain scale at the same time, the vast majority <b>of</b> electrolytic <b>aluminium</b> load directly connects to power grid using 330 kV transmission line. According to the physical characteristics and historical data, the continuous adjustment characteristic <b>of</b> electrolytic <b>aluminium</b> load is analysed. Based on this characteristic, a mathematical model for the electrolytic aluminium load is established. Aiming at reducing power network loss and wind power consumption, an optimization model based on the load regulation characteristics <b>of</b> electrolytic <b>aluminium</b> is constructed, which is optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm. Based on the case data of Gansu power grid, the optimal method based on the load regulation characteristics <b>of</b> electrolytic <b>aluminium</b> is analysed and its feasibility is verified...|$|R

5|$|The {{hydrated}} form <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> chloride has an octahedral molecular geometry, {{with the}} central aluminum ion surrounded by six water ligand molecules. This means that the hydrated form cannot act as a Lewis acid since it cannot accept electron pairs, and thus this cannot {{be used as a}} catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aromatic compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of scandium compounds are intermediate between those <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> and yttrium. A diagonal relationship {{exists between the}} behavior of magnesium and scandium, {{just as there is}} between beryllium and aluminium. In the chemical compounds of the elements in group 3, the predominant oxidation state is +3.|$|E
500|$|The {{addition}} <b>of</b> scandium to <b>aluminium</b> {{limits the}} grain {{growth in the}} heat zone <b>of</b> welded <b>aluminium</b> components. This has two beneficial effects: the precipitated Al3Sc forms smaller crystals than in other aluminium alloys, and the volume of precipitate-free zones at the grain boundaries <b>of</b> age-hardening <b>aluminium</b> alloys is reduced. Both of these effects increase {{the usefulness of the}} alloy. [...] However, titanium alloys, which are similar in lightness and strength, are cheaper and much more widely used.|$|R

5|$|While Klein's use <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> for {{a bicycle}} frames {{was not entirely}} novel, his use of large {{diameter}} tubes was. Aluminium alloys have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes {{he was able to}} make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.|$|E
5|$|An alloy <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> and gallium {{in pellet}} form added to {{water can be}} used to {{generate}} hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and {{does not need to be}} transported.|$|E
50|$|From 2000 to 2005, African {{production}} <b>of</b> refined <b>aluminium</b> {{increased by}} 54%. In Mozambique, the Mozal smelter {{was completed in}} 2000, and the Mozal 2 smelter, in 2003. South Africa’s production increased because of {{the expansion of the}} Hillside smelter in December 2003. Output also increased in Cameroon and Egypt. In Ghana, the Valco smelter was shut down because of droughts that reduced the country’s effective hydropower capacity. South Africa accounted for about 48% <b>of</b> African <b>aluminium</b> output; Mozambique, 32%; and Egypt, 14%. Kenya was the only African producer <b>of</b> secondary refined <b>aluminium.</b> Africa accounted for 5% <b>of</b> the world’s <b>aluminium</b> production in 2005.|$|R

5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around {{beryllium}} that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior {{is similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E
5|$|Bell was an {{energetic}} and skilful entrepreneur {{as well as}} an innovative metallurgist. He was involved in multiple partnerships with his brothers to make iron and alkali chemicals, and with other pioneers including Robert Stirling Newall to make steel cables. He pioneered the large-scale manufacture <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> at his Washington works, conducting experiments in its production, and in the production of other chemicals such as the newly discovered element thallium. He was a director of major companies including the North Eastern Railway and the Forth Bridge company, then the largest bridge project in the world.|$|E
