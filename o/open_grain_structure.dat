40|$|This study {{investigated}} the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) mechanism of 304 L under a glycine environment through electrochemical measurements, soaking test, and slow strain rate tensile test. Results show that the rapidly cooled structure at the weld heat-affected zone has a significantly higher susceptibility to SCC than the <b>open</b> <b>grain</b> <b>structure.</b> Moreover, glycine concentration influences the electrochemical and SCC behaviors of 304 L. The corrosion current density, maintaining a passive current density, and susceptibility to SCC of 304 L are proportional to glycine concentration. Meanwhile, the SCC on the sensitized structure of 304 L is a joint consequence of anodic dissolution (AD) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE).

40|$|Our far {{infrared}} studies of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic aerogel grains {{have demonstrated that}} the mm and sub-mm wave absorption produced by the fundamental two level systems (TLS) mechanism represents a more significant contribution for these <b>open</b> <b>grain</b> <b>structures</b> than for bulk amorphous silicate grains. We found that the region with the anomalous temperature dependence of the spectral index due to the TLS excitations can extend in a fluffy material up to 80 per cm, which is well beyond its typical upper limit for bulk glasses. Currently there is no theoretical explanation for this surprising result. The effects of reduced dimensionality on the optical properties of carbonaceous grains have been studied with a systematic investigation of carbon aerogels. This spectroscopic approach has permitted a more reliable determination of the single grain mass normalized absorption coefficient based on the experimentally determined characteristics of the fluffy material rather than on first principles calculations involving the bulk properties of the substance. Our finding is that the electrical connectivity of the material is the main factor affecting its {{far infrared}} absorption coefficient. Another {{one of the main}} constituents of the interstellar dust, amorphous ice, has been investigated in the mm-wave region both in the high (HDA) and low (LDA) density amorphous phases and as a function of impurities. We found that doping either phase with ionic (LiCl) or molecular (methanol) impurities decreases the difference in the mm-wave absorption coefficient between the HDA and LDA ice phases so that the HDA spectrum can be used as an analog for impure ice absorption in the far infrared spectral region...|$|R

Downstream EM tests were performed on two sets of CoWP-capped Cu interconnects with different grain sizes.

40|$|Representing a <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> {{within a}} {{combined}} finite element {{computer aided engineering}} environment is essential for micromechanics simulations. Methods are required to effectively generate high-fidelity virtual <b>grain</b> <b>structures</b> for accurate studies. A high-fidelity virtual <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> means a statistically equivalent structure in conjunction with desired grain size distribution features, and must be represented with realistic grain morphology. A family of controlled Poisson Voronoi tessellation (CPVT) models have been developed in this work for systematically generating virtual <b>grain</b> <b>structures</b> with the aforementioned properties. Three tasks have been accomplished {{in the development of}} the CPVT models: (i) defining the <b>grain</b> <b>structure’s</b> regularity that specifies the uniformity of a tessellation as well as deriving a control parameter based on the regularity; (ii) modelling the mapping from a <b>grain</b> <b>structure’s</b> regularity to its grain size distribution; and (iii) establishing the relation between a set of physical parameters and a distribution function. A one-gamma distribution function is used to describe a grain size distribution characteristic and a group of four physical parameters are employed to represent the metallographic measurements of a grain size distribution property. Mathematical proofs of the uniqueness of the determination of the distribution parameter from the proposed set of physical parameters have been studied, and an efficient numerical procedure is provided for computing the distribution parameter. Based on the general scheme, two- and three-dimensional CPVT models have been formulated, which respectively define the quantities of regularity and control parameters, and model the mapping between regularity and grain size distribution. For the 2 D-CPVT model, statistical tests have been carried out to validate the accuracy and robustness of regularity and grain size distribution control. In addition, micrographs with different grain size distribution features are employed to examine the capability of the 2 D-CPVT model to generate virtual <b>grain</b> <b>structures</b> that meet physical measurements. A crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulation of plane strain uniaxial tension has been performed to show the effect of grain size distribution on local strain distribution. For the 3 D-CPVT model, a set of CPFE analyses of micro-pillar compression have been run and the effects of both regularity and grain size on deformation responses investigated. Further to this, a multi-zone scheme is proposed for the CPVT models to generate virtual gradient <b>grain</b> <b>structures.</b> In conjunction with the CPVT model that controls the seed generating process within individual zones, the multi-zone CPVT model has been developed by incorporating a novel mechanism of controlling the seed generation for grains spanning different zones. This model has the flexibility of generating various gradient <b>grain</b> <b>structures</b> and the natural morphology for interfacial grains between adjacent zones. Both of the 2 D- and 3 D-CPVT models are capable of generating a virtual <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> with a mean grain size gradient for the <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> domain and <b>grain</b> size distribution control for individual zones. A true gradient <b>grain</b> <b>structure,</b> two simulated gradient <b>grain</b> <b>structure,</b> and a true gradient <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> with an elongated zone have been used to examine the capability of the multi-zone CPVT model. To facilitate the CPFE analyses of inter-granular crack initiation and evolution using the cohesive zone models, a Voronoi tessellation model with non-zero thickness cohesive zone representation was developed. A grain boundary offsetting algorithm is proposed to efficiently produce the cohesive boundaries for a Voronoi tessellation. The most challenging issue of automatically meshing multiple junctions with quadrilateral elements has been resolved and a rule-based method is presented to perform the automatically partitioning of cohesive zone junctions, including data representation, edge event processing and cut-trim operations. In order to demonstrate the novelty of the proposed cohesive zone modelling and junction partitioning schemes, the CPFE simulations of plane strain uniaxial tension and three point bending have been studied. A software system, VGRAIN, was developed to implement the proposed virtual <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> modelling methods. Via user-friendly interfaces and the well-organised functional modules a virtual <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> can be automatically generated to a very large-scale with the desired grain morphology and grain size properties. As a pre-processing <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> representation system, VGRAIN is also capable of defining crystallographic orientations and mechanical constants for a generated <b>grain</b> <b>structure.</b> A set of additional functions has also been developed for users to study a generated <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> and verify the feasibility of the generated case for their simulation requirements. A well-built <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> model in VGRAIN can be easily exported into the commercial FE/CAE platform, e. g. ABAQUS and DEFORM, via script input, whereby the VGRAIN system is seamlessly integrated into CPFE modelling and simulation processing. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
