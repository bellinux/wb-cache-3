5|$|Bodyguard of Lies is a 1975 non-fiction {{book written}} by Anthony Cave Brown, {{his first major}} {{historical}} work.

40|$|The present article {{endeavors to}} examine {{narratives}} of virginity {{as they have}} been viewed by some contemporary literary trends and to conceptualize, articulate and interpret <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> elicited from Greek-Australian women across three generations. These <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> encompassed and redefined a view of virginity - and the sequence of three intergenerational women affirms that its significance is waning - as a gradual evolution, transformation or even rejection of the concept. In literature, virginity has been presented antithetically as both anatomical and ideological, real and imagined, private and social/public, prestigious and as an obstacle, sacred and profance as well as a commodity and artifact. <b>Oral</b> <b>testimonies,</b> on the other hand, have the ability to reveal hidden realities of the individual self and to incorporate a novel variety of experiences and perspectives to this subject matter. As an epithet the word "virgin" means the unknown, the unattached, the unspoiled and the pure; as a noun "virginity" means an intact hymen and the absence of sexual intercourse between male and female. In this article the discussion is limited to this framework and won't extend to other connotations and subdivisions of the term. 22 page(s...|$|R

In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of sharia, such as those found in Hanbali madhhab.|$|E

25|$|The {{return to}} {{systemic}} agriculture {{coincided with the}} introduction of a new social system called feudalism. This system featured a hierarchy of reciprocal obligations. Each man was bound to serve his superior in return for the latter's protection. This made for confusion of territorial sovereignty since allegiances were subject to change over time and were sometimes mutually contradictory. Feudalism allowed the state to provide a degree of public safety despite the continued absence of bureaucracy and written records. Even land ownership disputes were decided based solely on <b>oral</b> <b>testimony.</b> Territoriality was reduced to a network of personal allegiances.|$|E
25|$|After AD 596, {{documentary}} {{sources that}} Bede {{took pains to}} obtain throughout England and from Rome are used, as well as <b>oral</b> <b>testimony,</b> which he employed along with critical consideration of its authenticity.

It {{seems to be a}} mixture of fact, legend and literature. For example, Bede quotes at length some speeches by people who were not his contemporaries and whose speeches do not appear in any other surviving source; it is doubtful whether oral traditional history supported these ostensible quotations.|$|E
25|$|A confession, an oath, or the <b>oral</b> <b>testimony</b> of Muslim {{witnesses}} {{are the main}} evidence admissible, in sharia courts, for hudud crimes, that is the religious crimes of adultery, fornication, rape, accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to prove it, apostasy, drinking intoxicants and theft. Testimony must be from at least two free Muslim male witnesses, or one Muslim male and two Muslim females, who are not related parties and who are of sound mind and reliable character. Testimony to establish the crime of adultery, fornication or rape must be from four Muslim male witnesses, with some fiqhs allowing substitution of up to three male with six female witnesses; however, at least one must be a Muslim male. Forensic evidence (i.e., fingerprints, ballistics, blood samples, DNA etc.) and other circumstantial evidence is likewise rejected in hudud cases in favor of eyewitnesses, a practice which can cause severe difficulties for women plaintiffs in rape cases.|$|E

40|$|Xenophon {{appears to}} be less {{interested}} in documents than his predecessors. He uses documents but not as widely as Herodotus and Thucydides, {{and he does not}} consider them as methodologically relevant as they do. The corroboration of the historical reconstruction, which is typically provided by documents in Herodotus and Thucydides, depends in Xenophon on other methodological tools, such as authorial interventions and quotations of others’ opinions. These “tools” are parsimoniously inserted in Xenophon’s work in compliance with programmatical and methodological principles, and are privileged over documents in order to increase the reliability of the historical reconstruction. The special authoritativeness attributed to <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> in comparison with written documents can probably be connected to the strictly contemporary nature of the Hellenica, since documents are more often used in the reconstruction of the past while <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> are on the contrary preferred when reconstructing contemporary events...|$|R
25|$|Initial European {{contact was}} limited to explorers and shipwrecks. The first {{recorded}} European to sight Fraser Island was James Cook who passed {{along the coast of}} the island between 18 and 20 May 1770. He named Indian Head after viewing a number of Aboriginal people gathered on the headland. After Cook's passage the Aboriginals composed a song to commemorate the event. This was later recognized as the first preserved <b>oral</b> <b>testimony</b> of indigenous observation of Europeans. Matthew Flinders sailed past the island in 1799, and again in 1802, this time landing at Sandy Cape, while charting Hervey Bay. His 1814 chart is a combination of both voyages, but did not confirm Fraser Island as being separate from the mainland. However, Flinders did suggest the presence of shallow swampy areas at {{the lower part of the}} bay. Flinders was told of an opening at Hook Point, between Fraser Island and the mainland, by two American whalers who were hunting whales in Hervey Bay. In 1842, Andrew Petrie discovered good pastoral lands and forests, attracting graziers to the island. Lieutenant Robert Dayman was the first European to sail between Fraser Island and the mainland in 1847.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, {{there were}} plans to {{demolish}} the monument, although little written evidence is available to historians and research is largely based on <b>oral</b> <b>testimony.</b> On September 29, 1949 (although according to <b>oral</b> <b>testimony,</b> the issue was first raised as early as October 1944) the Council of People's Commissars of the Latvian SSR proposed {{the restoration of the}} statue of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great. [...] While they did not expressly call for the demolition of the Freedom Monument, the only way to restore the statue to its original position would have been to tear down the monument. The result of the debate is unrecorded, but since the monument still stands the proposition was presumably rejected. The Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina (1889–1953; designer of the monumental sculpture Worker and Kolkhoz Woman) is sometimes credited with the rescue of the monument, although there is no written evidence to support the fact. According to her son, she took part in a meeting where the fate of the monument was discussed, at which her opinion, as reported by her son, was that the monument was of very high artistic value and that its demolition might hurt the most sacred feelings of the Latvian people.|$|E
500|$|Evidential issues also exist. Because secret trusts are by {{definition}} secret, they {{are difficult to}} prove in court. The parol evidence rule states that where there is written evidence, <b>oral</b> <b>testimony</b> cannot be introduced to the court if it contradicts that evidence. Since secret trusts are oral and normally exist outside of the will (a written document) this causes problems. In Re Keen, the issue came up, and the Court of Appeal decided that the parol evidence rule extended to secret trusts, and such trusts could not be enforced if they contradicted written documents. More generally, the problem is proving that the testator intended to create a trust. As in McCormic v Grogan, the standard is high; the person trying to enforce the trust must show [...] "most clearly and distinctly" [...] that it exists.|$|E

This article presents findings from the oral narratives of a cohort of first-generation Italians who migrated from the region of Campania, in southern Italy, {{to the city of}} Adelaide, in the state of South Australia, in the 1950 s and 1960 s. In the course of exploring the pre- and post-migratory vicissitudes of the informants, as well as their personal memories of the long sea voyage, the analysis examines the effects of cultural dislocation over a broad arc of time and discusses issues connected to identity formation, belonging, the loss of home and cultural maintenance on a group of migrants who are now senior citizens. The <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> evidence the candid reactions of the project informants to the prospect of transnational migration, the cultural impact upon reaching the unfamiliar destination site and the transformative factors that motivated both the maintenance of core values and the enactment of cross-cultural communication strategies. The <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> reveal the project conversants’ negotiation of cultural boundaries, in order to cope with the assimilation pressures being exerted by the dominant culture, and their honing of survival strategies in order to facilitate the identity formation and successful integration of subsequent generations. The article also includes excerpts from the <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> of a second cohort of informants of Anglo-British origin who were residing in Adelaide during the post-war period.
