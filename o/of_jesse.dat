She was somewhat gaunt, and constantly ill from tuberculosis and psychological ailments. She abhorred politics and especially disliked Washington, D.C., creating a tension that would continue throughout Pierce's political ascent.|$|E

5|$|They are an {{essential}} part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the Creation of Adam. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette <b>of</b> <b>Jesse.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Gilgun {{spoke of}} his character's {{interactions}} with DeBlanc and Fiore, while also being rather critical <b>of</b> <b>Jesse's</b> flippant approach, to an extent with his abilities; though speaking first of the government agents, Gilgun states, [...] "I think it's really funny because Cassidy's saying 'Look I don't know what the bloody hell they are. They could be androids ... could be anything'. Though too mentions mentions, [...] "The one thing they do have is a good instinct for people and who they are." [...] He concludes by making mention <b>of</b> <b>Jesse's</b> trivial approach, [...] "He's bartering with something that doesn't belong {{to him and he}} has no idea how dangerous it is." ...|$|R

25|$|When Ulysses was {{stationed}} on the West coast of California at Fort Humboldt in 1854 {{he had at}} that point been away from his wife and family two years. Longing to return home, and also prompted by rumors of excessive drinking, Ulysses tendered his resignation. Shocked by the news, Jesse intervened, feeling Ulysses was making a terrible mistake, and urged Congressmen Andrew Ellison, and old friend <b>of</b> <b>Jesse's,</b> to get the War Department to order Grant home on recruitment duty instead, or otherwise grant him a six-month leave. Ellison presented the request to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, but the request was denied. This {{would prove to be}} one more example <b>of</b> <b>Jesse's</b> involvement with his son's affairs.|$|R

5|$|Down {{by three}} {{to start the}} second half, Georgia responded {{with a pair of}} touchdowns and took a 21–10 lead early in the third quarter. The first was scored on a three-yard Todd Gurley run that {{completed}} a 75-yard drive that opened the quarter. The second came on a special teams play on the drive that ensued, when Cornelius Washington blocked a 49-yard Cade Foster field goal attempt that was recovered by Alec Ogletree and returned 55 yards for a touchdown and a 21–10 lead.

5|$|Presley {{was born}} on January 8, 1935 in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Love (née Smith; 1912–1958) and Vernon Elvis Presley (1916–1979), in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernon's father in {{preparation}} for the child's birth. Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before his own birth. Jesse was buried in an unmarked grave at Priceville Cemetery in Tupelo. After Presley became famous, he asked people on several occasions to try and find the whereabouts <b>of</b> <b>Jesse.</b> The efforts were to no avail, because no papers marked the spot. Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Although he was in conflict with the Pentecostal church in his later years, he never officially left it. Rev. Rex Humbard officiated at Presley's funeral, because Presley had been an admirer of Humbard's ministry.|$|E

5|$|The idea <b>of</b> <b>Jesse</b> riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E
