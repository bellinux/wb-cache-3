Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the Cyprus Convention ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{positive}} {{reception of the}} first game, Sony Computer Entertainment commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to make a sequel to MediEvil {{before the end of}} the PlayStation's lifespan. The original concepts for MediEvil 2 went through many transformations during development before the Cambridge team finally settled <b>on</b> <b>making</b> a sequel set during the Victorian Gothic revival, largely reminiscent of its predecessor. The game received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise including slight improvements over its predecessor such as artificial intelligence and graphical enhancements, but was criticised for lack of innovation from the original.|$|E
5|$|For {{over seven}} years, Parker worked <b>on</b> <b>making</b> a film {{based on the}} life of Nat Turner. In 2014, he {{announced}} that he had funding and was working on assembling his team, and that the film would be called The Birth of a Nation, in an ironic reappropriation of the infamously racist 1915 film of the same name. In addition to writing and directing, Parker cast himself as Turner. Aja Naomi King, Armie Hammer and Gabrielle Union were also cast in key roles.|$|E

5|$|Lawless was {{attracted}} to the show because of her appreciation for its writing and after hearing the description of her role.

5|$|Maibaum kept <b>on</b> <b>making</b> rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant {{was added}} to the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey—a change that brought more focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during {{shooting}} involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead of Bond, who ends up just finding the man dead). For {{the last quarter of the}} movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, and changed the location of Bond and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice.|$|E

They considered several different types of animals before settling <b>on</b> <b>making</b> him a frog.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control.
