40|$|Background: One of {{the main}} usages of social {{networks}} in clinical studies is facilitating the process of sampling and case finding for scientists. The main focus {{of this study is}} on comparing two different methods of sampling through <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> and using social network, for study purposes. Methods: One of the researchers started calling 214 families of children with diabetes during 90 days. After this period, <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> stopped, and the team started communicating with families through telegram, a virtual social network for 30 days. The number of children who participated in the study was evaluated. Results: Although the telegram method was 60 days shorter than the <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> method, researchers found that the number of participants from telegram (17. 6 %) did not have any significant differences compared with the <b>ones</b> being <b>phone</b> <b>called</b> (12. 9 %). Conclusions: Using social networks can be suggested as a beneficial method for local researchers who look for easier sampling methods, winning their samples' trust, following up with the procedure, and an easy-access database...|$|R
