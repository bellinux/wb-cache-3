25|$|In 2014–15, the WHO {{estimated}} that approximately 2 billion people were infected with soil-transmitted helminthiases, 249 million with schistosomiasis, 56 million people with food-borne trematodiasis, 120 million with lymphatic filariasis, 37 million people with <b>onchocerciasis,</b> and 1 million people with echinococcosis.

25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{the most}} common {{diseases}} in Ghana include those endemic to sub-Saharan African countries, particularly: cholera, typhoid, pulmonary tuberculosis, anthrax, pertussis, tetanus, chicken pox, yellow fever, measles, infectious hepatitis, trachoma, malaria, HIV and schistosomiasis. Though not as common, other regularly treated diseases include dracunculiasis, dysentery, river blindness or <b>onchocerciasis,</b> several kinds of pneumonia, dehydration, venereal diseases, and poliomyelitis.|$|E
25|$|From 1936 to 1958, Browne {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} the mission hospital at Yakusu, Belgian Congo. At Yakusu, he performed {{a wide range of}} roles from treating disease outbreaks and researching diseases to performing operations to midwifery. Patients {{with a wide variety of}} ailments arrived from surrounding areas daily to seek care. He frequently handled outbreaks of smallpox, polio, tuberculosis, malaria, yaws and typhoid and made major breakthroughs in the treatment of leprosy and <b>Onchocerciasis.</b> Browne, who would later concentrate his studies on leprosy, was the one of the first doctors to use Dapsone in the treatment of leprosy. He made a major epidemiological breakthrough related to <b>Onchocerciasis,</b> commonly known as river blindness, when he discovered it was caused by a black fly that bred on crabs. After having the crabs caught and exterminated and the streams cleaned, 98% of the black fly population had disappeared. Despite being based in Yakusu, Browne embarked on frequent expeditions to surrounding dispensaries and mission stations, travelling by car, motor boat, canoe or on foot. The doctors of Yakusu were often called to surrounding areas to provide medical care to acutely ill or injured patients.|$|E
25|$|Epidemics of cholera, malaria, rabies and African hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg hemorrhagic fever, {{are common}} {{diseases}} in several {{parts of the}} country. Many regions {{in this country have}} high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high HIV prevalence rates. Dengue, filariasis, leishmaniasis and <b>onchocerciasis</b> (river blindness) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region. Angola {{has one of the highest}} infant mortality rates in the world and one of the world's lowest life expectancies. A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in Angola. Demographic and Health Surveys is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on malaria, domestic violence and more.|$|E

2500|$|In 1974, the Expanded Programme on Immunization and {{the control}} {{programme}} of <b>onchocerciasis</b> was started, an important partnership between the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and World Bank. In 1967 the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases was also launched. In 1976, the World Health Assembly voted to enact a resolution on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation, {{with a focus on}} community-driven care. In 1977, the first list of essential medicines was drawn up, and a year later the ambitious goal of [...] "health for all" [...] was declared.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Onchocerciasis</b> is a {{neglected}} tropical disease. The primary strategy to control <b>onchocerciasis</b> is {{to interrupt the}} life cycle of the parasite. Ivermectin, known by its trade name Mectizan, is the only drug available for treating <b>onchocerciasis</b> without severe side effects. The drug rapidly kills microfilariae (immature worms) but not the adult worms. A single oral dose of ivermectin, taken annually for the 10-15 year life span of the adult worms, protects individuals from further progression of <b>onchocerciasis.</b> Merck & Co. manufactures the drug and provides it free [...] worldwide for the treatment of <b>onchocerciasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Erisipela de la costa is {{an acute}} phase of <b>onchocerciasis</b> {{characterized}} by {{swelling of the}} face with erythema and itching. <b>Onchocerciasis</b> causes different kinds of skin changes and these changes vary in different geographic regions. This skin change, erisípela de la costa, of acute <b>onchocerciasis</b> is most commonly seen among victims in Central and South America.|$|E
50|$|Various control {{programs}} aim to stop <b>onchocerciasis</b> {{from being}} a public health problem. The first was the <b>Onchocerciasis</b> Control Programme (OCP), which was launched in 1974, and at its peak, covered 30 million people in 11 countries. Through the use of larvicide spraying of fast-flowing rivers to control black fly populations, and from 1988 onwards, the use of ivermectin to treat infected people, the OCP eliminated <b>onchocerciasis</b> {{as a public health}} problem. The OCP, a joint effort of the World Health Organisation, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, was considered to be a success, and came to an end in 2002. Continued monitoring ensures <b>onchocerciasis</b> cannot reinvade the area of the OCP.|$|E

50|$|One {{drug that}} has been {{proposed}} {{for the treatment of}} <b>onchocerciasis</b> is doxycycline. This drug {{has been shown to be}} effective in killing both the adult worm of O. volvulus and Wolbachia, the bacteria believed to play a major role in the onset of <b>onchocerciasis,</b> while having no effect on the microfilariae of L. loa. In a study done at 5 different co-endemic regions for <b>onchocerciasis</b> and loiasis, doxycycline was shown to be effective in treating over 12,000 individuals infected with both parasites with minimal complications. Drawbacks to using Doxycycline include bacterial resistance and patient compliance because of a longer treatment regimen and emergence of doxycycline-resistant Wolbachia. However, in the study over 97% of the patients complied with treatment, so it does pose as a promising treatment for <b>onchocerciasis,</b> while avoiding complications associated with L. loa co-infections.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, the <b>Onchocerciasis</b> Elimination Programme for the Americas, {{which also}} relies on ivermectin, was launched.
