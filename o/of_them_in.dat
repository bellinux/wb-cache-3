5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those afflicted by AD.

Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe.
