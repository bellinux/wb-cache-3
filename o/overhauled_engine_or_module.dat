Crate engines are manufactured by many different companies, but they all share the same characteristics of being complete engines ready to install once removed from the crate. Generally a crate engine only needs bolt on accessories such as water pump, fuel system, and exhaust. This type of engine has various applications including general replacement, hot rod builds and motorsports competition.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} with the RS 18 rocket engine using liquid oxygen (LO 2) and liquid methane (LCH 4) propellants under simulated altitude conditions at NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). This project is part of NASA s Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development (PCAD) project. "Green" propellants, such as LO 2 /LCH 4, offer savings in both performance and safety over equivalently sized hypergolic propellant systems in spacecraft applications such as ascent <b>engines</b> <b>or</b> service <b>module</b> <b>engines.</b> Altitude simulation was achieved using the WSTF Large Altitude Simulation System, which provided altitude conditions equivalent up to approx. 120, 000 ft (approx. 37 km). For specific impulse calculations, engine thrust and propellant mass flow rates were measured. Propellant flow rate was measured using a coriolis-style mass-flow meter and compared with a serial turbine-style flow meter. Results showed a significant performance measurement difference during ignition startup. LO 2 flow ranged from 5. 9 - 9. 5 lbm/sec (2. 7 - 4. 3 kg/sec), and LCH 4 flow varied from 3. 0 - 4. 4 lbm/sec (1. 4 - 2. 0 kg/sec) during the RS- 18 hot-fire test series. Thrust was measured using three load cells in parallel. Ignition was demonstrated using a gaseous oxygen/methane spark torch igniter. Data was obtained at multiple chamber pressures, and calculations were performed for specific impulse, C* combustion efficiency, and thrust vector alignment. Test objectives for the RS- 18 project are 1) conduct a shakedown of the test stand for LO 2 /methane lunar ascent engines, 2) obtain vacuum ignition data for the torch and pyrotechnic igniters, and 3) obtain nozzle kinetics data to anchor two-dimensional kinetics codes...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the results of a joint academic and industrial study on the development of a detailed nonlinear dynamic model of a turbofan jet engine to be used for research into advanced control strategies for civil turbofan aircraft engines. The model is representative of a dual shaft engine with variable bleed, variable stator vanes, turbine cooling, heat transfer, and a duct and exhaust nozzle. A switched, gain-scheduled, feedback control system incorporating bumpless transfer and antiwindup functionality has been designed and implemented according to current industrial practice. This baseline implementation permits realistic transient operation of the simulation and may act as a reference design for further control work. The simulation computes a non-iterative solution, by progressing calculations {{in the direction of the}} gas stream flow. Where possible the underlying physics are used and empirical approximations are avoided so that the model requires minimum data. This approach also makes a future inclusion of component failure easier to implement. The simulation is modular in nature so that <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> control <b>modules</b> can be easily replaced or modified if an improved design becomes available. The Simulink implementation of the control architecture has been redesigned to permit the addition or removal of control loops, also during the simulation’s operation, to allow testing of advanced control strategies. The entire controller can also be easily replaced. A detailed description of the modeling process, the various simulation issues that arise with a model of this complexity, and the results of the overall aero-engine system are presented. The design of the switched, gain-scheduled aero-engine controller with bumpless transfer and antiwindup which achieves dynamic performance that closely matches that of a real aero-engine is also discussed.

40|$|Hot {{sections}} of gas engine turbines require specialized materials to withstand extreme conditions present during engine operation. Nickel-base superalloys are typically used as blades and disks {{in the high}} pressure turbine section because they possess excellent fatigue strength, creep strength and corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures. Components undergo thermomechanical fatigue conditions {{as a result of}} transient engine operation. Sharp geometric features, such as cooling holes in blades or fir-tree connections in disks, act as local stress raisers. The material surrounding these features are potential sites of localized inelastic deformation and crack formation. To reduce customer costs associated with unnecessary <b>overhauls</b> <b>or</b> <b>engine</b> down-time, gas turbine manufacturers require accurate prediction methods to determine component endurances. The influence of stress concentration severity on thermomechanical fatigue crack formation is of particular importance as cracks often initiate in these hot spots. Circumferentially notched specimens were utilized to perform thermomechanical fatigue experiments on blade material CM 247 LC DS and disk material PM IN 100. A parametric study on CM 247 LC DS was performed utilizing four notched specimens. Experimental results were coupled with finite element simulations utilizing continuum based constitutive models. The effects of applied boundary conditions on crack initiation life was studied in both alloys by performing experiments under remotely applied force and displacement boundary conditions. Finite element results were utilized to develop a life prediction method for notched components under thermomechanical fatigue conditions. M. S...|$|R

40|$|Mining {{industry}} in India currently occupies a coveted {{position in the}} world league table. Large scale mechanization has made major breakthroughs in this industry. Mechanization trends have introduced sophisticated off-road dumpers as the main ore/rock transporting equipment in opencast mines. To achieve targeted production and to survive intense competition in the mining industry, it is imperative that the dumper as an equipment and its different operating units should be reliable and maintained effectively to ensure its maximum availability. The diesel engine is the most critical operating unit of a dumper. To improve the performance and to reduce frequency of downtime, the <b>engines</b> need <b>overhauling</b> time to time. The <b>engine</b> after <b>overhauling</b> should be able to perform its desired function under stated condition for a specified period of time. The present study investigates reliability of <b>overhauled</b> <b>engines</b> in a fleet of dumpers used in an opencast mine. In this paper the operational reliability of <b>overhauled</b> <b>engines,</b> mean time to overhaul (MTO) and time between inspection (TBI) are examined. MTO and TBI values predicts the next time to overhaul and inspection respectively, which will aid in reducing the downtime of dumpers and thereby increasing their availability...|$|R
5000|$|Electronic {{throttle}} control (ETC) is an automobile technology which electronically [...] "connects" [...] the accelerator {{pedal to the}} throttle, replacing a mechanical linkage. [...] A typical ETC system consists of three major components: (i) an accelerator pedal module (ideally with two or more independent sensors), (ii) a throttle valve that can be opened and closed by an electric motor (sometimes referred to as an electric or electronic throttle body (ETB)), and (iii) a powertrain <b>or</b> <b>engine</b> control <b>module</b> (PCM <b>or</b> ECM). The ECM {{is a type of}} electronic control unit (ECU), which is an embedded system that employs software to determine the required throttle position by calculations from data measured by other sensors, including the accelerator pedal position sensors, engine speed sensor, vehicle speed sensor, and cruise control switches. The electric motor is then used to open the throttle valve to the desired angle via a closed-loop control algorithm within the ECM.|$|R
