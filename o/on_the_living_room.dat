In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> wall. [...] Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. [...] Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.|$|E

Cosby assured Rashad {{that she would be}} allowed to remain on the show should she and Ahmad decide to have a baby, joking, [...] "We'll just add another Huxtable". Rashad became pregnant with their child during season three. To avoid having to add an infant to the main cast, extreme tactics were used to conceal the actress' pregnancy onscreen, such as confining Clair to bed or having her be out of town for several episodes at a time. Scooped out, the bed's mattress was specially constructed to prevent Rashad's growing stomach from being visible underneath the covers but ultimately resulted in the actress suffering a pinched nerve in her back. Rashad would also hide behind props such as kitchen tables, counters and jackets. In the episode [...] "Vanessa's Rich", Rashad uses a large teddy bear to hide her pregnancy while seated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> sofa, but the toy's origin and purpose within the episode remains unexplained.

2500|$|Arne De Boever {{believes}} {{that there is a}} [...] "close affinity, and intimacy even, between the sheriff and Chigurh in No Country for Old Men [...] in a number of scenes. There is, to begin with, the sheriff's voice {{at the beginning of the}} film, which accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial weaving together of the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff is further developed later on in the film, when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean. Chigurh has visited the trailer only minutes before, and the Coen brothers have the sheriff sit down in the same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting (which is almost the exact same spot where, the evening before, Moss joined his wife on the couch). Like Chigurh, the sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were to superimpose these two shots. When the sheriff pours himself a glass of milk from the bottle that stands sweating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> table—a sign that the sheriff and his colleague, deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt), only just missed their man—this mirroring of images goes beyond the level of reflection, and Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{was deemed}} architecturally {{significant}} as [...] "a {{fine example of}} Prairie School architecture designed by the noted firm of Purcell and Elmslie." [...] <b>The</b> firm focused <b>on</b> designs for relatively inexpensive houses on small lots, such as this. According to the NRHP nomination:The houses were distinguished by simple massing, compact plans and, if possible, the use of inexpensive materials. Inspiration for these homes came from Frank Lloyd Wright's [...] "Fireproof House for $5,000", published by the Ladies' Home Journal in 1907. The Goodnow House is characteristic of Purcell and Elmslie's residential designs with two stories, a gabled roof, tinted stucco and grouped windows. The massing is unified by string courses, extended beams and boldly overhanging roofs which co-exist with the interplay of horizontals and verticals. Typical of Purcell and Elmslie {{was the use of}} both brick and stucco <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exterior. <b>The</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and dining room are opened as a single space which pivots around the fireplace. This was a highly sophisticated spatial arrangement maximizing the sense of space in a restricted area. This arrangement was continually refined by Purcell and Elmslie in their residential work.|$|R

The Beebe house is the firm's only house in Saint Paul, and {{includes}} some elements from English Arts and Crafts design as well as the Prairie Style. [...] Purcell and Elmslie designed the primary rooms with good views, since the Summit Avenue location was important.

So the unusual corner windows looking both ways from <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> were accepted as a fine response toward a choice and expensive location."
