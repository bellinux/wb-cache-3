5|$|Following {{the general}} {{capitulation}} of TSAM, {{the remnants of}} the 19th Mechanized Division surrendered to the Germans at Serres in the afternoon of 10 April, while {{the remnants of the}} Krousia Detachment did so near Thessaloniki.

Apart from sending detachments, 191st Regiment did not participate en masse in battle. As soon as news came <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Thessaloniki, the regiment moved to Stavros, where it disintegrated, with its men dispersing across Chalkidiki. This signalled the end of the division and its major sub-units as coherent fighting forces.|$|E
5|$|For medieval writers, the {{two most}} {{influential}} ancient sources on the Trojan War were the purported eye-witness accounts of Dares the Phrygian, and Dictys the Cretan, which both survive in Latin versions. In Western Europe the Trojan side {{of the war was}} favoured and therefore Dares was preferred over Dictys. Although Dictys' account positions Troilus' death later in the war than was traditional, it conforms to antiquity's view of him as a minor warrior if one at all. Dares' De excidio Trojae historia (History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fall</b> of Troy) introduces the character as a hero who takes part in events beyond the story of his death.|$|E
