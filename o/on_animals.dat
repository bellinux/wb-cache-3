5|$|Characteristics differ {{between various}} groups of Icelandic horses, {{depending}} on the focus of individual breeders. Some focus <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> for pack and draft work, which are conformationally distinct from those bred for work under saddle, which are carefully selected {{for their ability to}} perform the traditional Icelandic gaits. Others are bred solely for horsemeat. Some breeders focus on favored coat colors.|$|E
5|$|Cosmetics testing <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> {{is banned}} in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway while {{legislation}} in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans. In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban {{on the sale of}} animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested <b>on</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Johngarthia lagostoma {{lives in}} burrows among vegetation, at altitudes {{of up to}} , {{emerging}} at night to feed on plant matter and occasionally <b>on</b> <b>animals.</b> From January to March there is an annual migration to the sea to release the planktonic larvae. The species was first described (as Gecarcinus lagostoma) by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837 from material sent {{to him by the}} naturalists Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, collected by the French ship Astrolabe.|$|E
5|$|Nazi {{society had}} {{elements}} supportive of animal rights {{and many people}} were fond of zoos and wildlife. The government took several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a stringent animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research. However, the law was only loosely enforced {{and in spite of}} a ban on vivisection the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments <b>on</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{moral and}} ethical {{questions}} raised by performing experiments <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century.

5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made that are based <b>on</b> <b>animals.</b> For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is {{used to create a}} {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|Attorney Hy Mayerson was {{an early}} pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with {{environmental}} attorney Victor Yannacone in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, {{one of the first}} civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor. The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians {{are found}} mainly in {{lowlands}} in the tropics, but alligators also {{live in the}} southeastern United States and the Yangtze River in China. They are largely carnivorous, the various species feeding <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, and mammals; some species like the Indian gharial are specialised feeders, while others like the saltwater crocodile have generalised diets. Crocodilians are typically solitary and territorial, though cooperative feeding does occur. During breeding, dominant males try to monopolise available females. Females lay eggs in holes or in mounds and, unlike most other reptiles, care for their hatched young.|$|E
