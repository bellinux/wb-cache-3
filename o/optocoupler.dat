A photodiode is often combined into a single component with an emitter of light, usually a light-emitting diode (LED), either to detect the presence of a mechanical obstruction to the beam (slotted optical switch), or to couple two digital or analog circuits while maintaining extremely high electrical isolation between them, often for safety (<b>optocoupler).</b> The combination of LED and photodiode is also used in many sensor systems to characterize different types of products based on their optical absorbance.|$|E

5000|$|Developers {{have long}} {{recognized}} that Optocouplers {{are based on}} outdated technology, and only recently have cost effective {{and easy to use}} alternatives become available. These advanced package and pin compatible drop-in <b>optocoupler</b> replacements provide sustainability higher performance and reliability with none of the technical liabilities of optocouplers. Digital isolators can directly replace 6-pin and 8-pin optocouplers and are suitable for both <b>optocoupler</b> retrofit and new system designs. These devices use CMOS-based isolation architecture that are ten times more reliable than optocouplers, enabling manufacturers to support longer end product warranties and reduce costs associated with repairs or replacement.|$|E
50|$|Usually, <b>optocouplers</b> have {{a closed}} pair {{configuration}}. This configuration refers to <b>optocouplers</b> enclosed {{in a dark}} container wherein the source and sensor are facing each other.|$|R
50|$|Alternative {{isolators}} {{are typically}} built using ultra thin (0.01 mm - 0.02 mm) insulation layers, whereas <b>optocouplers</b> have insulation thicknesses up to 2 mm. The thinner insulation barrier means that alternative isolators experience much higher electric-field stress than <b>optocouplers,</b> {{and could be}} less robust under high voltages. Currently, there are no IEC component level safety standard available for such isolators. As a result, some manufacturers might seek IEC 60747-5-2 (older revision) or IEC 60747-5-5 (current revision) certification (a standard originally intended for <b>optocouplers).</b> Alternative isolators are structurally different from <b>optocouplers</b> and thus do not qualify for full IEC60747-5-2/5 certification, but only for BASIC insulation.|$|R

50|$|The first {{technique}} {{involving an}} <b>optocoupler</b> {{has been used}} to obtain tight voltage and current regulation, whereas the second approach has been developed for cost-sensitive applications where the output {{does not need to be}} as tightly controlled, but up to 11 components including the <b>optocoupler</b> could be eliminated from the overall design. Also, in applications where reliability is critical, optocouplers can be detrimental to the MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) calculations. The third technique, primary-side sensing, can be as accurate as the first and more economical than the second, yet requires a minimum load so that the discharge-event keeps occurring, providing the opportunities to sample the 1:N secondary voltage at the primary winding (during Tdischarge, as per Fig3).|$|E
50|$|Later amplifiers, and {{particularly}} the Fender Blackface amps of the mid 1960s and the later Silverface amps, used a much more complex circuit, producing the kind of effect that was especially popular with surf musicians. Modulation was produced using an <b>optocoupler,</b> a light-dependent resistor whose pulsating signal (producing a lopsided wave) affects the preamp circuit.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, an opto-isolator, {{also called}} an <b>optocoupler,</b> photocoupler, or optical isolator, is a {{component}} that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits by using light. Opto-isolators prevent high voltages from affecting the system receiving the signal. Commercially available opto-isolators withstand input-to-output voltages up to 10 kV and voltage transients with {{speeds up to}} 10 kV/Î¼s.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>optocouplers</b> have {{a slotted}} coupler/interrupter {{configuration}}.

50|$|A crude {{example is}} a typical {{inverting}} op-amp configuration with a light-dependent resistor (LDR) in the feedback loop. The gain of the amplifier then depends on the light falling on the LDR, which can be provided by an LED (an <b>optocoupler).</b> The gain of the amplifier is then controllable by the current through the LED. This {{is similar to the}} circuits used in optical audio compressors.|$|E
50|$|A {{solid state}} relay or SSR is a solid state {{electronic}} component that provides a function similar to an electromechanical relay but {{does not have any}} moving components, increasing long-term reliability. A solid-state relay uses a thyristor, TRIAC or other solid-state switching device, activated by the control signal, to switch the controlled load, instead of a solenoid. An <b>optocoupler</b> (a light-emitting diode (LED) coupled with a photo transistor) can be used to isolate control and controlled circuits.|$|E

50|$|The flyback {{converter}} is an isolated power converter. The two prevailing control schemes are {{voltage mode control}} and current mode control (in {{the majority of cases}} current mode control needs to be dominant for stability during operation). Both require a signal related to the output voltage. There are three common ways to generate this voltage. The first is to use an <b>optocoupler</b> on the secondary circuitry to send a signal to the controller. The second is to wind a separate winding on the coil and rely on the cross regulation of the design. The third consists on sampling the voltage amplitude on the primary side, during the discharge, referenced to the standing primary DC voltage.|$|E
5000|$|American {{guitar and}} organ {{manufacturers}} of the 1960s embraced the resistive opto-isolator as a convenient and cheap tremolo modulator.

To date, Vactrols activated by pressing the stompbox pedal are ubiquitous in the music industry. Shortages of genuine PerkinElmer Vactrols forced the DIY guitar community to [...] "roll their own" [...] resistive opto-isolators. Guitarists to date prefer opto-isolated effects because their superior separation of audio and control grounds results in [...] "inherently high quality of the sound". However, the distortion introduced by a photoresistor at line level signal is {{higher than that of}} a professional electrically-coupled voltage-controlled amplifier. Performance is further compromised by slow fluctuations of resistance owing to light history, a memory effect inherent in cadmium compounds.
