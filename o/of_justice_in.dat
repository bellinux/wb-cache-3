5|$|On 11 November 2009, Wiens {{was found}} guilty of the murder of El-Sherbini and the {{attempted}} murder of Okaz, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Judge Birgit Wiegand stated that the court had also found that Wiens's deeds constituted a heinous crime, because they were committed in front of a child, against two people, in a court of law, and fulfilled the murder criterion of treacherousness, such as hatred against foreigners. It meant that Wiens received the maximum sentence for this crime. Wiens appealed the conviction; however, the appeal was rejected by the Federal Court <b>of</b> <b>Justice.</b> <b>In</b> a decision published on 18 June 2010, the fifth criminal division of the court <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> <b>in</b> Leipzig stated that the appeal on points of law was unfounded and confirmed the verdict and sentence of the regional court as final matter of criminal law.|$|E

2500|$|In Yong Vui Kong, the Court of Appeal {{identified}} a conceptual difference between fundamental rules <b>of</b> natural <b>justice</b> <b>in</b> the Constitution, and ordinary rules <b>of</b> natural <b>justice</b> <b>in</b> administrative law– {{they are the}} same in nature and function, but they operate at different levels in the legal order. The fundamental rules <b>of</b> natural <b>justice</b> <b>in</b> the Constitution, which the Court also referred to as the [...] "Ong Ah Chuan rules of natural justice", act to invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality. On the other hand, the rules <b>of</b> natural <b>justice</b> <b>in</b> administrative law (that is, the principles of impartiality and fair hearing) act to invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles.|$|R

In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban {{on the sale of}} animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court <b>of</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>in</b> Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{felt that}} their best chances lay in {{interviewing}} Christopher Addison about his contact with Booth; as Addison was a government minister he could be relied on to tell the truth.

Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the American Bar Association {{presented}} {{a statue of}} Blackstone to the English Bar Association, however, at the time, the sculpture was too tall {{to be placed in}} the Royal Courts <b>of</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>in</b> London.

Congress approved the placement of the sculpture in Washington, D.C. on 15 March 1943, and appropriated $10,000 for the installation. The bronze statue is a nine-foot (2.7 m) standing portrait of Blackstone wearing judicial robes and a long curly wig, holding a copy of Commentaries.

5|$|The {{bishops of}} Olinda and Belém (in {{the provinces of}} Pernambuco and Pará, respectively) {{were two of the}} new {{generation}} of educated, zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the Ultramontanism which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872 they ordered Freemasons expelled from lay brotherhoods. While European Masonry often tended towards atheism and anti-clericalism, things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common—although PedroII himself was not a Freemason. The government headed by the Viscount of Rio Branco tried on two separate occasions to persuade the bishops to repeal, but they refused. This led to their trial and conviction by the Superior Court <b>of</b> <b>Justice.</b> <b>In</b> 1874 they were sentenced four years at hard labor, although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.|$|E
