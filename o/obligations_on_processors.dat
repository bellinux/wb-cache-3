The algorithm runs in O(log n) time using <b>O(n)</b> <b>processors</b> <b>on</b> a concurrent-read-exclusive-write parallel random access machine. The algorithm is superior to previous algorithms on this model, that either obtain O(log n) time performance using <b>O(n</b> 2) <b>processors,</b> or employ <b>O(n)</b> <b>processors</b> but have a time complexity of O(log 2 n) ...|$|R

The algorithm runs in O(log 2 n) time with <b>O(n)</b> <b>processors</b> <b>on</b> a PRAM and is within an O(log 2 n) factor of optimal. The best previously known algorithm for this problem takes O(log 2 n) time with <b>O(n</b> 3) <b>processors.</b> The key subroutine of the algorithm is an O(logn) time, <b>O(n)</b> <b>processor</b> parallel algorithm for constructing a maximal independent {{set in a}} one-page planar graph.
