25|$|Tor aims {{to conceal}} its users' identities and their online {{activity}} from surveillance and traffic analysis by separating identification and routing. It is an implementation of <b>onion</b> <b>routing,</b> which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through {{a network of}} relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ encryption in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure perfect forward secrecy between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous hidden service feature. Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade Internet censorship that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.|$|E
25|$|<b>Onion</b> <b>routing</b> is {{implemented}} by encryption {{in the application}} layer of a communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination IP address, multiple times and sends it through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal only the next relay in the circuit in order to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing, or even knowing, the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication is partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single {{point at which the}} communicating peers can be determined through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination.|$|E
25|$|David finds online {{videos of}} the molesters' confessions taped just before their murders. While {{attempting}} {{to trace the}} source of the videos, Charlie finds one uploading as the agents discuss the case and uses <b>onion</b> <b>routing</b> to trace the live feed. Unknown to Charlie, the killer piggybacked the system, causing Charlie to send the agents to an address two blocks from the site of the latest murder. Later, Charlie suggests using the syntax of the chats to determine if McCrary or any of his relatives, who would have similar syntax to McCrary, could have contacted the victims. Meanwhile, Larry expresses his disappointment about the mission to Megan, and Megan asks Charlie to help Larry fulfill his dream. While Megan brings the files containing the chats to Charlie, she and Amita overhear Charlie vouching for Larry to someone at the NSA. Larry later thanks Charlie for persuading NASA officials to allow Larry to be on the mission.|$|E

5000|$|The {{anonymity}} network Tor formerly {{used the}} top-level pseudo-domain onion for Tor hidden services, {{which can only}} be reached with a Tor client because it uses the Tor <b>onion</b> <b>routing</b> protocol to reach the hidden service to protect the anonymity of users.
