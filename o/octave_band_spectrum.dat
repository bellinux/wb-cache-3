The airborne sound insulation of façades, floors and walls, and also the impact sound insulation of floors was measured. Each measurement has been repeated with different methods: the common interpretation of ISO 140, with fixed points of measurement; the manually moving microphone technique, also allowed according to ISO 140 and the survey method described in ISO 10052, with the sound level meter held by hand by the operator and moved along a defined path. According to ISO 10052, the operator can use the reverberation time resulting from measurements or estimated by tables given in the same Standard. Besides, ISO 10052 establish that measurements {{have to be made}} in octave band, but in this study it has even been tried to apply this method using 1 / 3 octave bands and with the reverberation time achieved from measurements, obtaining a 1 / 3 <b>octave</b> <b>band</b> <b>spectrum</b> for the parameters under analysis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences on amniotic fluid temperature and intrauterine sound pressure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Temperature and sound pressure measurements during MRI (1. 5 T) in pregnant ewes were done. Linear levels and third <b>octave</b> <b>band</b> <b>spectra</b> were compared. RESULTS: No {{significant changes in the}} temperature of amniotic fluid were observed. Intrauterine summation levels reached peak levels up to 103. 0 dB(A) before starting the MRI sequence and levels up to 116. 0 dB(A) during a real-time sequence.

40|$|The {{determination}} {{of the magnitude of}} sonic boom exposure which would be acceptable to the general population requires, as a starting point, a method to assess and compare individual sonic booms. There is no consensus within the scientific and regulatory communities regarding an appropriate sonic boom assessment metric. Loudness, being a fundamental and well-understood attribute of human hearing was chosen as a means of comparing sonic booms of differing shapes and amplitudes. The figure illustrates the basic steps which yield a calculated value of loudness. Based upon the aircraft configuration and its operating conditions, the sonic boom pressure signature which reaches the ground is calculated. This pressure-time history is transformed to the frequency domain and converted into a one-third <b>octave</b> <b>band</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The essence of the loudness method is to account for the frequency response and integration characteristics of the auditory system. The result of the calculation procedure is a numerical description (perceived level, dB) which represents the loudness of the sonic boom waveform...|$|E
40|$|The {{tonal noise}} or {{vibration}} of air-cooled or water-cooled chillers with rotary twin screw compressors {{is crucial for}} environmental concerns. This work aims to perform the receiver tests regarding the radiated noise and structural vibration due to the compressor in different operating conditions. The sound pressure near the compressor is recorded by the one-third octave and narrow band frequency analyzers, respectively. For environmental concern, the one-third <b>octave</b> <b>band</b> <b>spectrum</b> is frequently adopted to evaluate the radiated noise, while the narrow band spectrum {{can be used to}} characterize the noise sources. The axial, vertical and horizontal accelerations on the compressor shell at the motor and oil-injection locations are also monitored to correlate the structure-borne noise. Other than the comparison of spectral content between radiated noise and compressor shell vibration, the frequency response functions and the coherence functions are examined to further characterize the relation between noise and vibration. This work lays out the general steps and measurement procedures for noise and vibration evaluation in primary stage for receiver tests considering different load capacities. The vibration energy transmission path tests as well as the refrigerant pulsation effects on the compressor noise and vibration can then be carried out accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Versión PostprintEnvironmental {{vibrations}} due to {{railway traffic}} are predominantly due to dynamic axle loads caused by wheel and track unevenness and impact excitation by rail joints and wheel flats. Because of its irregular character, track unevenness is commonly processed statistically and represented by its {{power spectral density}} function or its root mean square (RMS) value in one-third octave bands. This statistical description does not uniquely define the track unevenness at a given site, however, and different track unevenness profiles matching the statistical description will lead to different predictions of dynamic axle loads and resulting ground vibration. This paper presents a methodology that allows quantifying the corresponding variability in ground vibration predictions. The procedure is derived assuming the geometry of the track and soil to be homogeneous along the track. The procedure is verified by means of Monte Carlo simulations and its usefulness for assessing the mismatch between predicted and measured ground vibrations is demonstrated in a case study. The {{results show that the}} response in time domain and its narrow band spectrum exhibit significant variability which is reduced when the running RMS value or the one-third <b>octave</b> <b>band</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the response is considered.

40|$|Acoustic {{data were}} {{obtained}} for the 25 ft. diameter X-wing rotor model during performance testing of the rotor system in hover. Data collected at the outdoor whirl tower test facility with a twelve microphone array were taken for approximately 150 test conditions comprised of various combinations of RPM, blade pressure ratio (BPR), and blade angle of attack (collective). The three test parameters had four values of RPM from 404 to 497, twelve values of BPR from 1. 0 to 2. 1, and six values of collective from 0. 0 deg to 8. 5 deg. Fifteen to twenty seconds of acoustic data were reduced to obtain an average 1 / 3 <b>octave</b> <b>band</b> <b>spectrum</b> for each microphone for each test condition. The complete, as measured, 1 / 3 octave band results for all the acoustic data are listed. Another part of the X-wing noise test was the acoustic calibration of the Rye Canyon whirl tower bowl. Corrections were computed which, when applied to as measured data, yield estimates of the free field X-wing noise. The free field estimates provide a more realistic measure of the rotor system noise levels. Trend analysis of the three test parameters on noise level were performed...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to see how different diffuser designs affected the acoustic characteristics of a small room. This research tests a number of different geometries including a flat panel, convex poly-cylinder set, concave poly-cylinder set, triangular set, broad curve geometry and a quadratic residue sequence. This research employs a Finite Difference Time Domain model as well as scale model measurements in order to quantify the effects of these diffusers at a given receiver position. Simulations include a free field environment, in order to observe diffraction behaviour in the time domain, and a studio configuration in order to observe a more complicated scenario with a specific receiver position. The results of this research offer a few key findings. Firstly, there is a design compromise between how effectively a diffuser can scatter sound temporally and how well that same diffuser can offer similar behaviour over all angles of incidence. These are design limitations and compromises that warrant consideration when designing a diffuser geometry for a specific application. Secondly, a diffuser is most effective when the wave interacts along the appropriate design axis. The design axis is the direction in which the geometry is distorted. Thirdly, the type of diffuser can make a difference but, the appropriate diffusing geometry must be chosen in context of its proposed task. Otherwise, the diffuser geometry will not likely yield a difference beyond 3 dB in a given 3 rd octave band. The end conclusion is that differences between diffusers for a given configuration are measurable but do not consistently yield variation in a 1 / 3 rd <b>octave</b> <b>band</b> <b>spectrum</b> above a given threshold of 3 dB SPL and do not point to consistently possible audible changes (in the context of the room used) ...|$|E
