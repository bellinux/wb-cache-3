5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen's team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could <b>only</b> <b>put</b> down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes. Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of the crash because the remains of the car were so charred.|$|E
5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was <b>only</b> <b>put</b> on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Vicksburg, the Mississippi River from Cairo to the Gulf of Mexico was finally {{in control of the}} Union. As {{northern}} Louisiana, southern Arkansas and eastern Texas, with their vast cotton fields, were still an economic objective, controlling it would not <b>only</b> <b>put</b> millions into the U.S. Treasury, but also deprive the Confederacy of badly needed wartime funds that cotton, with its inflated value, would bring.|$|E
25|$|An {{arm of the}} Atlantic, Long Island Sound {{stretches}} {{along the}} New York and Connecticut shorelines to the ocean. The western end of the estuary meets the Manhattan’s East River at Hell’s Gate. This waterway not <b>only</b> <b>put</b> New Rochelle on a trade route, it propelled the farming community into a resort destination. Sophisticated entrepreneurs and the advancement of steamboat travel ensured its success, as they banked on the wide open vistas, clean country air and aquatic activities just a boat ride from the increasingly crowded and sullied streets of Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|Henry resumed {{war with}} France, but was plagued with {{financial}} problems, declining health and frequent rebellions. A Scottish invasion was defeated at the Battle of Homildon Hill, but {{it resulted in}} a long war with Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, for northern England, which was resolved only with the near complete destruction of the Percy family at the Battle of Bramham Moor. In Wales Owain Glyndŵr's widespread rebellion was <b>only</b> <b>put</b> down in 1408. Many {{saw it as a}} punishment from God when Henry was later struck down with leprosy and epilepsy.|$|E

That afternoon, fifteen French soldiers at a battery on Point Mesino hoisted a flag of truce. They surrendered to boats from Cyane, which then spiked their four 42-pounder guns and destroyed the carriages. The French deserters left with boats. That evening Cyane fired into the French vessels at anchor in Pozzuoli Bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, the Governor {{found himself}} {{dealing with a}} series of communal riots that in August 1921 broke out in the Malabar District. Following a number of cases of arson, looting, and assaults, Willingdon declared martial law just before the government of India sent in a large force to quell the riots. At around the same time, over 10,000 workers in the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills of Madras city organised for six months a general strike contemporaneous with the non-cooperation movement, which also sparked riots between pro- and anti-strike workers that were again <b>only</b> <b>put</b> down with police intervention.|$|E
25|$|French scholar Victor Saxer dates the {{identification}} of Mary Magdalene as a prostitute, and as Mary of Bethany, to a sermon by Pope Gregory the Great on September 21, 591 A.D., where he seemed to combine the actions of three women mentioned in the New Testament and also identified an unnamed woman as Mary Magdalene. In another sermon, Gregory specifically identified Mary Magdalene as the sister of Martha mentioned in Luke 10. But according to a view expressed more recently by theologian Jane Schaberg, Gregory <b>only</b> <b>put</b> the final touch to a legend that already existed before him.|$|E

Midway through the trial, Volpe changed his plea to guilty, confessing to having sodomized Louima. Despite the fact that Louima had several broken teeth, Volpe denied that he ever struck Louima in the mouth with the stick and claimed that he <b>only</b> <b>put</b> it very close to Louima's mouth. Volpe also admitted that he had threatened Louima's life. On December 13, 1999, Volpe was sentenced to 30 years in prison, without the possibility of parole as well as a $525 fine and restitution in the amount of $277,495.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} {{created a}} conundrum for the anti-western Islamic Republic which took power {{after the fall}} of the Pahlavi Dynasty in 1979. Although politically the fundamentalist government rejected Western influence in Iran, the Western art collection amassed by the Empress was retained, most likely due to its enormous value. It was, nevertheless, not publicly displayed and spent nearly two decades in storage in the vaults of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. This caused much speculation as to the fate of the artwork which was <b>only</b> <b>put</b> to rest after a large portion of the collection was briefly seen again in an exhibition that took place in Tehran during September 2005.|$|E
25|$|After three days' refitting, the {{division}} rejoined what had {{now become a}} war of movement against German rearguards. The First Surreys had a tough fight to take Moislans trench on 2 September, {{even though they were}} officially following up in support, because the attacking forces were also badly thinned – 1/21st Bn itself could <b>only</b> <b>put</b> 100 men into the battle. By now, 47 Division was in need of reinforcements that were not forthcoming; after calling up detached working parties, the First Surreys provided a composite company of 150 men for the operations of 6–7 September, after which {{the division}} was pulled out of the offensive.|$|E

25|$|How people {{answered}} {{these questions}} depended largely on their position {{prior to the}} revolt. But {{the destruction of the}} Second Temple by the Romans not <b>only</b> <b>put</b> an end to the revolt, it marked the end of an era. Revolutionaries like the Zealots had been crushed by the Romans, and had little credibility (the last Zealots died at Masada in 73). The Sadducees, whose teachings were so closely connected to the Temple cult, disappeared. The Essenes also vanished, perhaps because their teachings so diverged from the issues of the times that the destruction of the Second Temple was of no consequence to them; precisely for this reason, they were of little consequence to the vast majority of Jews).|$|E
25|$|A {{sacrifice}} {{fly to the}} center-field warning track by Beckham allowed Kemp to score the go-ahead run in the 12th and the Braves won 4-3 {{in the first of}} four games against the Brewers. Despite giving up the first run of the game off a Ryan Braun home run, the Braves scored two runs on a walk and three singles in the seventh inning to win the second game of the series 2-1. Two home runs from Freeman weren't enough to overcome a three-run homer by Chris Carter in the third inning as the Braves fell 4-3. In the final game of the series, the Brewers scored a run in every inning of the game – only the eighth time this feat has occurred since 1961 – as the Braves could <b>only</b> <b>put</b> up an Aybar homer in an 11-3 loss.|$|E
25|$|Sonny Bono ran a {{restaurant}} in downtown Palm Springs. Frustrated {{by the lack of}} cooperation he faced from the city council over a new sign for the restaurant, the entertainer took matters into his own hands and ran for mayor. He retained local conservative talk radio host Marshall Gilbert (heard regularly on KNWQ) as his campaign manager in a successful bid that not <b>only</b> <b>put</b> Bono back in the public eye, but fueled his later campaign for a seat on the United States Congress, a position he held until his death in a skiing accident in 1998. His widow, Mary (now Mary Bono Mack), filled the vacancy left by her husband and later campaigned successfully on her own. She was defeated by Democrat Raul Ruiz in the 2012 election, and moved to Florida. Both Sonny Bono and Frank Sinatra are buried at Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City.|$|E
50|$|Structurally, no {{internal}} struts are required. The principals (wooden poles running radially {{out from}} {{the apex of the}} roof {{to the top of the}} rondavel's wall) are fully supported by the circular purlins: First, the principals do not sag in the middle, because sagging <b>only</b> <b>puts</b> the purlins near the middle of the principals under compression. Second, the principals do not splay at the bottom (push the top of the walls over to the outside) because splaying <b>only</b> <b>puts</b> the purlins near the bottom of the principals under tension. Thus it is possible to build a large rondavel without internal bracing for the roof. Traditional African rondavels range in size depending on the availability of building and construction materials.|$|R

25|$|Despite a scoring {{opportunity}} with bases loaded in {{the eighth}} inning, the Braves squandered it, gave up a shallow left hit to Joey Votto with bases loaded and lost 9-8 to the Reds. After a rough first inning for Teherán, the Braves <b>only</b> <b>put</b> up a run in a 3-1 loss to the Reds. After failing to score a walk off with bases loaded in the 11th and giving up two runs {{in the top of}} the 13th, a single by d'Arnaud allowed Jace Peterson to score the walk off run and gave the Braves a 9-8 victory. During the game, Freeman doubled in the third, tripled in the fourth, hit a home run in the sixth and singled in the 11th to become only the seventh Braves player to hit for the cycle and first to do so since Mark Kotsay in 2008. The Braves concluded the four-game series with two home runs from Freeman in a 7-2 victory over the Reds.|$|E
25|$|The Moriscos of {{southern}} Spain had been forcibly converted to Christianity in 1502, {{but under the}} rule of Charles I they had been able to obtain a degree of tolerance from their Christian rulers. They were allowed to practice their former custom, dress, and language, and religious laws were laxly enforced. (However, Charles also passed the Limpieza de sangre, a law that excluded those not of pure Old Christian, non-Jewish blood from public office.) Philip began to put back into place the restrictive laws of generations before and in 1568 the Moriscos rebelled (see Morisco Revolt). The revolt was <b>only</b> <b>put</b> down by Italian troops under Don John of Austria, and even then the Moriscos retreated to the highlands and were not defeated until 1570. The revolt was followed by a massive resettlement program in which 12,000 Christian peasants replaced the Moriscos. In 1609, on the advice of the Duke of Lerma, Philip III expelled the 300,000 Moriscos of Spain.|$|E
