25|$|Impulsivity is {{characterized}} by actions based on sudden desires, whims, or inclinations rather than careful thought. Individuals with substance abuse {{have higher levels of}} impulsivity, and individuals who use multiple drugs tend to be more impulsive. A number <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> the Iowa gambling task as a measure for impulsive behavior found that drug using populations made more risky choices compared to healthy controls. There is a hypothesis that the loss of impulse control may be due to impaired inhibitory control resulting from drug induced changes that take place in the frontal cortex. The neurodevelopmental and hormonal changes that happen during adolescence may modulate impulse control that could possibly lead to the experimentation with drugs and may lead to the road of addiction. Impulsivity is thought to be a facet trait in the neuroticism personality domain (overindulgence/negative urgency) which is prospectively associated with the development of substance abuse.|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} {{dangers of}} population decline are not universally accepted. Organizations like the Fraser Institute question whether a declining population would reduce or increase per capita income, noting {{that in the}} short term, with a stable economy, fewer people would increase the per capita income simply because you divide the income among fewer people. [...] The study's authors conducted a series <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> large amounts of census data (844,476 individuals) and conclude that immigrants who arrived from 1987-2004 paid only 57% of the taxes paid by average Canadian in 2006, with the effect that taxes from immigrants do not exceed the government expenses relating to them (a gap of $23 billion annually according to their numbers). [...] A study by the C. D. Howe Institute suggests that immigration cannot keep Canada's population young and could possibly contribute to population ageing in the near term. [...] Employment statistics also bring into question whether skilled worker immigrants, with a 34% unemployment rate, are successfully meeting existing labour market needs in Canada. Many developed nations have much lower fertility rates than Canada but have not embraced immigration.|$|E
