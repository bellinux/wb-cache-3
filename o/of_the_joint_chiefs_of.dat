5|$|Arthur William Radford (27 February 1896– 17 August 1973) was a United States Navy admiral {{and naval}} aviator. In over 40 years of {{military}} service, Radford held {{a variety of}} positions including Vice Chief of Naval Operations, commander of the United States Pacific Fleet and later the second Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E
5|$|Radford died {{of cancer}} at age 77 on 17 August 1973 at Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He was buried with the full honors accorded to a former Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff in Section 3 of the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

5|$|As a brigadier, Dutton {{served at}} the Ministry of Defence as Director, NATO policy, a senior staff post, prior to {{attending}} the Royal College of Defence Studies. He was pulled off the course before completion and seconded to The Pentagon in Washington, DC to act as liaison between the British Chief of the Defence Staff and the American Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the terrorist attacks on the United States.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|However, he did {{not remain}} Chief of Staff for long. He was {{appointed}} Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff effective 1 July 1974. As Chairman, Brown {{was responsible for the}} handling of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, and the Mayaguez incident, the final act of the war in Vietnam in 1975. He also dealt with the 1976 shootings and Axe Murder Incident in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and oversaw the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977.|$|E

5|$|The {{articles}} described Cheney's {{influence on}} decisions pertaining to detention of suspected terrorists {{and the legal}} limits that apply to their questioning, especially what constitutes torture. U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Colin Powell's chief of staff when he was both Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff {{at the same time}} Cheney was Secretary of Defense, and then later when Powell was Secretary of State, stated in an in-depth interview that Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld established an alternative program to interrogate post-9/11 detainees because of their mutual distrust of CIA.|$|E
5|$|This list {{is drawn}} from {{graduates}} of the Naval Academy who became CNOs. The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The first alumnus to graduate {{and go on to}} become a CNO was William S. Benson, who graduated from the Class of 1877. The current CNO, Jonathan Greenert, is also an Academy graduate. Four graduates subsequently became Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff, three became ambassadors, three were recipients of the Navy Cross, and one was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
50|$|However, the United States {{military}} was still organized along lines of command that reported {{to their respective}} service chiefs (Commandant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marine Corps, Chiefs <b>of</b> Staff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army and Air Force, and Chief of Naval Operations). These service chiefs in turn made up <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff. <b>The</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff elected a Chairman {{to communicate with the}} civilian government. <b>The</b> Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> in turn reported to <b>the</b> Secretary <b>of</b> Defense, <b>the</b> civilian head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military.

5|$|Heavy {{fighting}} {{broke out}} on the Plain of Jars as the members of each political grouping chose sides. Souvanna called upon the U.S. for support and was answered in the affirmative by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was eager to support a rightist/neutralist alliance in Laos. In November 1963 General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff had proposed that U.S. armed reconnaissance missions be conducted over Laos {{as part of a}} two phase program that would warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to support the Saigon government. The missions were to take place along North Vietnamese infiltration routes then developing in the Laotian panhandle.|$|E
5|$|While Eisenhower {{appreciated}} Shoup's fiscal {{experience and}} apolitical outlook, Shoup was called upon most often by Kennedy. With Kennedy's {{relations with the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff strained, particularly following the Cuban Missile Crisis, he called upon Shoup privately for many consultations. Shoup's biographer Howard Jablon wrote that Shoup was Kennedy's favorite general. In turn, Shoup was the most supportive of Kennedy of all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff. Kennedy had asked Shoup to remain as Commandant {{for a second term}} in 1963, but Shoup declined in order to allow the advancement of other Marine generals.|$|E
5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit strategy for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases {{and the use of}} nuclear weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when the}} Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{appointed}} Army General Maxwell D. Taylor as his Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff. Taylor, {{like most}} Army brass, {{was a major}} supporter of the Zeus program. Kennedy and Taylor initially agreed to build a huge Zeus deployment with seventy batteries and 7,000 missiles. McNamara was also initially {{in favor of the}} system, but suggested a much smaller deployment of twelve batteries with 1,200 missiles. A contrary note was put forth by Jerome Wiesner, recently appointed as Kennedy's scientific advisor, and chair of the 1959 PSAC report. He began to educate Kennedy on the technical problems inherent to the system. He also had lengthy discussions with David Bell, the budget director, who came to realize the enormous cost of any sort of reasonable Zeus system.|$|E
5|$|Loper {{returned}} to the United States to become Chief of the Joint Photo and Survey Section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff's Joint Intelligence Group in 1948. The next year he was appointed as an Army member of the Military Liaison Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. He wrote a report which {{became known as the}} Loper Memorandum, which was influential in the decision to develop thermonuclear weapons. He was Deputy Commander of Joint Task Force 3, which was responsible for the conduct the Operation Greenhouse nuclear tests in the Pacific. In 1951 became Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, but was forced to retire after he suffered a heart attack in 1953. He subsequently served as Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee from 2 August 1954 to 14 July 1961.|$|E
5|$|Congress held {{hearings}} on the two bills {{in the summer of}} 1986. Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff, led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill—Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform. By most accounts, retired Army Major General Richard Scholtes gave the most compelling reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in Grenada, explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.|$|E
50|$|Taylor {{received}} fierce {{criticism in}} Major (now Lieutenant General) H.R. McMaster's book Dereliction of Duty. Specifically, Gen.
