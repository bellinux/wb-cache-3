5|$|The procellariids are small- to {{medium-sized}} seabirds. The largest, {{the giant}} petrels with a wingspan <b>of</b> , <b>are</b> almost {{as large as}} albatrosses; the smallest, such as the fairy prion have a wingspan <b>of</b> , <b>are</b> slightly bigger than the diving petrels. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter. Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction. This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate nesting colonies. The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the Cape petrel).|$|E
5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists <b>of,</b> <b>are</b> studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% <b>of</b> <b>are</b> aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} four {{forms of the}} {{philosophical}} consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{which can lead to}} a break-through of Hegel' s logical ontology at the metalogicallevel. The views of K. Jaspers, S. L. Frank, P T. Raju and D. T. Suzuki are considered in succession. These four modern philosophers conform to the following methodological conditions: a. they <b>are</b> representative <b>of</b> prevailing forms of the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in the traditions of Western, Russian. Indian and Chinese philosophy; b. they have given expression to the metalogical factor in the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> and c. they can be confronted basically. with Hegel's logical ontology. Their views are. structurally characterized by the author and submitted to critical comparison. It is then demonstrated that the Indian philosopher Aurobindo Ghose has assimilated these forms of the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in his personal experience <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> Finally, the author shows how the Western logical Notion <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> is overcome by the metalogical experience <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> ...|$|R

This study employs quantitative and qualitative research methods: pre- and post-course surveys and interviews. The surveys were distributed to eight BE teachers and their 57 students at the beginning and the end of the eight-week courses. The results of pre- and post-course surveys were compared to examine how their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers may have changed. After the post-course survey, interviews to randomly selected students taught by different BE teachers were conducted to further examine their perceptions. The results showed that both BE teachers and students had positive images <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers. Moreover, not many variables were found in both groups <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers and their students.

40|$|Heidegger {{argued that}} modern {{human beings have}} {{forgotten}} a more fundamental and originary understanding of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> This forgetting <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{is not limited to}} lived experience but permeates the history of philosophy and metaphysics. Put simply, modern philosophy (and, for Heidegger, metaphysics) presupposes a reductive understanding <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> as an entity, or an entity with enduring presence, that ultimately limits the possibilities of human thinking and existence. Educational practice and scholarship also operates from this comportment of a forgetting <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> The following inquiry raises the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in teaching by phenomenologically engaging with three key distinctions from Heidegger’s thinking as each bears upon educational practice. World and attunement, the first two distinctions, are most accessible in Heidegger’s thinking from his magnum opus Being and Time. The third distinction represents a theme from Heidegger’s later thinking on technology, the danger of Enframing. While not exhaustive, each concept interrogates the many-sided question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in order to illuminate new possibilities for teaching. The inquiry does not offer solutions but rather traces a path that opens and keeps in tension the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in teaching in order to support further study...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{relation}} between the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{and the question of}} art in the thought of Martin Heidegger. His thought trajectory comprises two different forms <b>of</b> question considering <b>Being.</b> He calls the first one the main question. This form he considers to be metaphysical since it can be traced in traditional philosophical thought back to Plato and Nietzsche, or the thought of the first beginning. The second form is the fundamental question about Being which leads to overcoming of metaphysical understanding <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> and belongs to the thought of the second beginning. This second form, according to his words at the seminar at Le Thor appears in three forms along his thought trajectory; firstly, as a fundamental ontological question of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Being,</b> then, as significant historical question concerning the truth <b>of</b> <b>Being,</b> and finally, as a topological question concerning the space and spatiality <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> His position concerning art needs to be considered in the light of fundamental issue <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in his thought...|$|R
