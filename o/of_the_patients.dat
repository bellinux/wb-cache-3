5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> with around 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> {{suffering from}} constipation {{and up to}} 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|A {{medical center}} was also {{built in the}} {{compound}} in 2004, named Schaller Medical Centre after Leon and Freda Schaller from London, who were the prime donors. It serves as an emergency ward, but {{does not have the}} equipment needed to perform operations, and such patients are transferred to the Soroka Medical Center. On average, 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> are transferred.|$|E

30|$|The {{progress}} and recovery {{of a patient}} with mania during hospitalization is differently seen by professionals working at an admission ward and by relatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> Professionals often indicate that <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is improving while relatives estimate the improvement to be minimal in relation to <b>the</b> recovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{patients}} who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts {{with an initial}} fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet {{for at least three}} months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.|$|E

He watches as the soldiers shoot the other patients, including apparent alien-human hybrids, into a mass grave.|$|E
5|$|Princes Margret Hospital, the island's only hospital, {{suffered}} {{damage to the}} roofs of the psychiatric and intensive care units. This led to heavy water damage, which also spread into the maternity ward and damaged the electrical system. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> had been evacuated before the storm arrived.

40|$|The {{relation}} between the physician and <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> undergoes marked changes while technology and knowledge progress rapidly in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> medicine. At present, there are new components added to <b>the</b> traditional dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient-physician relation. One <b>of</b> them is <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> respect for autonomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> This principle stresses <b>the</b> personal values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> When reaching a decision, the physician should take <b>the</b> personal values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> into account. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> has <b>the</b> right to be informed about medical interventions, {{as well as to}} make her/his decision and state her/his preference.

5|$|Short-term {{results for}} the LGIT {{indicate}} that at one month approximately half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet {{and that it is}} better tolerated, with more palatable meals.|$|E
5|$|The first {{clinical}} study of psilocybin {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. There is some evidence that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.|$|E
50|$|The {{first thing}} that is {{evaluated}} is <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> speech <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> also known as speech analysis. To {{come to the right}} diagnosis this is the gold standard in VPI evaluation. The speech scientist listens to the voice, articulation, motor speech and <b>the</b> velopharyngeal function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> <b>The</b> main symptom is hypernasality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voice. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> is unable to create normal resonance because of nasal air emission.|$|R
30|$|For this reason, {{a project}} was started with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> {{overcoming}} {{this difference in}} perspective and to enhance a shared vision about <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> <b>The</b> idea to achieve this was to record a short film <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> during a euthymic mood state. This film {{can be stored in}} <b>the</b> electronic <b>patient</b> record (EPR) or handed over by <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> or <b>the</b> relatives to <b>the</b> staff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> admission ward, when <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is admitted. In that way, the film can give the staff an impression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> when he is stable.|$|R
