She then describes being auctioned <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience members, who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|A {{field goal}} (FG), worth three points, is scored {{when the ball}} is placekicked or dropkicked through the {{uprights}} and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts.

5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|After heading east {{past the}} {{junction}} with I-69, the highway turns southeast as it heads through rural fields toward Eaton Rapids. Once {{it reaches the}} city, M-50 converges with M-99, and the two intersect M-188 {{on the south side}} of the Grand River. The two highways run south out of the city. Immediately prior to entering Jackson County, the two trunklines diverge with M-99 heading <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest and M-50 to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still {{felt that it}} was incomplete.

The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E

5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right of this road, {{there was an}} unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British had left it undefended.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of its}} extent, State Highway 34 {{passes through}} rural areas, running through the plains of western Oklahoma. The highway begins at SH-6 six miles (10km) {{northeast}} of Eldorado. Heading north from there, it intersects U.S. Route 62 (US-62) just east of Duke. The highway continues north into Greer County to its county seat of Mangum, where SH-34 joins US-283. Two miles (3km) north of Mangum, SH-9 joins for a four-mile (6km) concurrency with SH-34 and US-283. Thereafter, SH-9 splits <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|E

As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment {{put in place to}} prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E

5|$|In Braddock Heights, Maryland, a man mistakenly kills his wife, believing her, {{as well as}} {{the police}} who soon arrive, to all be someone else. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is tipped <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> case by the mysterious Plain-Clothed Man, who {{provides}} him with a newspaper article discussing the case.

5|$|In {{gridiron}} football, {{the safety}} (American football) or safety touch (Canadian football) is a scoring play {{that results in}} two points (or, in rare cases, one point) being awarded to the scoring team. Safeties can be scored {{in a number of}} ways, such as when a ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by the offense in their own end zone. After a safety is scored in American football, the ball is kicked <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team that scored the safety from the 20-yard line; in Canadian football, the scoring team also has the options of taking control of the ball at their own 35-yard line or kicking off the ball, also at their own 35-yard line. The ability of the scoring team to receive the ball through a kickoff differs from the touchdown and field goal, which require the scoring team to kick the ball <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scored upon team. Despite being of relatively low point value, safeties can {{have a significant impact on}} the result of games, and Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals, despite being worth a point less, due to the field position and reclaimed possession gained off the safety kick.|$|E
