They performed detailed paleomagnetic and structural analyses along the sampling route and found that complicated block rotation since the Cretaceous was governed by a north-trending dextral shear (Figure  8 c). Thus, dextral deformation and CW rotation dominantly occurred on the forearc after {{the demise of the}} Izanagi Plate. Itoh and Tsuru (2006) inferred a similar rotation sequence (CCW to CW) in the offshore basin of northeast Japan based on remanence directions of the late Cretaceous and Eocene <b>oriented</b> <b>core</b> samples in a deep borehole (MITI Sanriku-oki in Figure  1).|$|E

In general, the remanence of the samples was very resistant to alternating field demagnetization up to 100 mT and thermal demagnetization to 610 deg C, strongly suggesting hematite as the carrier of the magnetization. Of 17 sites, 9 show downward magnetization directions (normal polarity) and 8 have upward directions (reverse polarity). When compared to a reference direction for stable North America, all reverse sites have shallow inclinations and apparent counter-clockwise rotations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{exploratory}} survey {{has been made}} on the magnetic fabric {{of a variety of}} sediments from Legs I-VI of the Deep Sea Drilling Project. Pelagic clays and calcareous and siliceous fossil oozes have generally proved to have no significant magnetic fabric. In the majority of the remaining sediments, primary style fabrics are rare, probably as a result mainly of deformation during drilling. Sufficient undisturbed specimens have been measured, principally from the coarser silts, to indicate that useful fabric information can be obtained from the cores by this method. Measurements from Hole 1 tend to confirm the view that chevron folding in some cores is due to penecontemporaneous mass movement of near-surface material. Results from Holes 26, 35 and 60 indicate that drilling disturbance is comparatively slight. The influence of palaecurrents is seen; their directions might be determined in <b>oriented</b> <b>cores...</b>|$|R

40|$|Medicine Lake Volcano is a Quaternary {{shield volcano}} {{located in a}} tectonically complex and active zone at the {{transition}} between the Basin and Range Province and the Cascade Range of the Pacific Province. The volcano is topped by a 7 x 12 km elliptical depression surrounded by a discontinuous constructional ring of basaltic to rhyolitic lava flows. This thesis explores {{the possibility that the}} depression may have formed due to regional extension (rift basin) or dextral shear (pull-apart basin) rather than through caldera collapse and examines the relationship between regional tectonics and localized volcanism. Existing data consisting of temperature and magnetotelluric surveys, alteration mineral studies, and core logging were compiled and supplemented with additional core logging, field observations, and fault striae studies in paleomagnetically <b>oriented</b> <b>core</b> samples. These results were then synthesized with regional fault data from existing maps and databases. Faulting patterns near the caldera, extension directions derived from fault striae P and T axes, and three-dimensional temperature and alteration mineral models are consistent with slip across arcuate ring faults related to magma chamber deflation during flank eruptions and/or a pyroclastic eruption at about 180 ka. These results are not consistent with a rift or pull-apart basin. Limited subsidence {{can be attributed to the}} relatively small volume of ash-flow tuff released by the only known major pyroclastic eruption and is inconsistent with the observed topographic relief. The additional relief can be explained by constructional volcanism. Striae from unoriented and <b>oriented</b> <b>core,</b> augmented by striae measurements in outcrop suggest that Walker Lane dextral shear, which can be reasonably projected from the southeast, has probably propagated into the Medicine Lake area. Most volcanic vents across Medicine Lake Volcano strike north-south, suggesting they are controlled by crustal weakness related to Basin and Range extension. Interaction of dextral shear, Basin and Range extension, and the zone of crustal weakness expressed as the Mount Shasta-Medicine Lake volcanic highland controlled the location and initiation of Medicine Lake Volcano at about 500 ka...|$|E

BCRs were produced using both thermosetting (unsaturated polyester) and thermoplastic (polypropylene) matrices and synthetic (carbon, glass, HT polyethylene), as well as natural (sisal) core fibres. BCRs were characterized for tensile properties and the influence of core fibres was studied. Moreover, BCRs containing carbon fibre in the core composition were characterized for piezoresistivity and strain sensing properties under flexural deformation.

The two sections can be confidently correlated using the key marker (tuff) bed described above.

The nine remaining Jurassic sites represent 100 samples from three general areas in southern Alaska. The southern Alaskan Jurassic paleomagnetic pole is significantly different from the North American Jurassic pole. This suggests that since the Jurassic, southern Alaska must have moved approximately 18 degrees north and rotated 52 degrees clockwise to reach its present position.

Since the mid- 1990 s, both in the United States of America (USA) and in the United Kingdom (UK), there has been increasing interest in service improvement within the healthcare sector. Following its introduction, the iterative components of improvement theory (Deming, 1994) have been adapted for use in healthcare. Early improvement frameworks, for example, European Foundation Quality Management (EFQM, 1999) and Process Redesign (Hammer and Champey, 1993), developed from manufacturing which focused upon mechanistic processes more suited to industrial settings.

40|$|Structural and paleomagnetic {{studies of}} Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) cores are {{severely}} {{hampered by the}} fact that the recovered cores can rarely be reoriented with any degree of confidence. Although several techniques for <b>orienting</b> <b>cores</b> have been used, none is without limitations. Core orientation devices used during drilling are expensive to operate and are usually unreliable. A common alternative, used when no core orientation tools are available, is to assume that the horizontal component of the magnetization direction of the core pointed north, and thus that features may be oriented relative to this direction. However, this neglects the effects of secular variations in the Earth's magnetic field and of later tectonic rotation on the sample. In this paper we outline a technique for core reorientation that matches distinctive inclined planar features measured on the core with their images on Formation MicroScanner and Borehole Televiewer wireline logs. It allows reorientation of structural and magnetic data, and hence the possibility of detecting vertical axis tectonic rotations using Paleomagnetism.
