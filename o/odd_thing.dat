500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] became R.E.M.'s {{biggest hit}} in the U.S., peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single stayed on the chart for 21 weeks. It charted at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 16 and No. 11 in Canada and Australia, respectively. Mills said years later, [...] "Without 'Losing My Religion', Out of Time would have sold two or three million , instead of the ten [...] or so it did. But the {{phenomenon}} that is a worldwide hit is an <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> to behold. Basically that record was a hit in almost every civilised country in the world." [...] The success of [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] and Out of Time broadened R.E.M.'s audience beyond its original college radio-based fanbase. When asked at the time if he was worried that the song's success might alienate older fans, Buck told Rolling Stone, [...] "The people that changed their minds because of 'Losing My Religion' can just kiss my ass." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> is that it was left in there. I mean if minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Creem, Jagger said, [...] ", I {{thought it was a}} really <b>odd</b> <b>thing,</b> because it was only one song, after all. It wasn't like it was a whole album, with lots of occult signs on the back. People seemed to embrace the image so readily, [...] it has carried all the way over into heavy metal bands today. Some people have made a living out of doing this; for example, Jimmy Page." ...|$|E

60|$|Once more, 17,000 cases, {{though a}} larger number than is usual in {{biological}} inquiries, are decidedly not enough for a popular argument on probabilities; a million, it will be said, would not be too many. Finally, granting honesty, accurate memory, and non-selection (none {{of which will be}} granted by opponents), it is easy to say that <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> must occur, and that the large proportion of affirmative answers as to coincidental hallucinations is just a specimen of these <b>odd</b> <b>things.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Kaidan (怪談), which {{literally}} means “supernatural tale” or [...] "weird tale", {{is a form}} of Japanese ghost story. Kaidan {{entered the}} vernacular when a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular in the Edo period. The popularity of the game, as well as the acquisition of a printing press, {{led to the creation of}} a literary genre called Kaidanshu. Kaidan are not always horror stories, they can [...] "be funny, or strange, or just telling about an <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> that happened one time".|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Enemies of Reality was remixed by Andy Sneap, who {{produced}} Nevermore's Dead Heart in a Dead World and would later produce This Godless Endeavor, mix and master The Year of the Voyager, and mix and master The Obsidian Conspiracy. The remixed/remastered sound was received more positively. [...] Warrel Dane admitted that [...] "The remix of the albumobviously sounds better. But to me, that's the really <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> about that album. I find it really strange that the production on that album got reviewed {{more than the}} songs did." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} of Moore's grave is not known. His grandson, John, said: [...] "The <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> {{is that my}} father was such a good story-teller but he couldn't or wouldn't tell me where my grandfather was buried. It was if there was some unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery." [...] Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London. By chance, what {{is believed to have been}} the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.|$|E

2500|$|Davidson had {{the actors}} {{who played in}} Eddie's band rehearse {{as if they were}} getting ready for a real concert. Pare remembers, [...] "The first time we played {{together}} - as a band - was a college concert. An <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> happened. At first, the extras simply did what they were told. Then, as the music heated up, so did the audience. They weren't play-acting anymore. The screaming, stomping and applause became spontaneous." [...] Davidson recalls, [...] "One by one, kids began standing up in their seats, screaming and raising their hands in rhythmic applause. A few girls made a dash for the stage, tearing at Michael's shirt. We certainly hadn't told them to do that. But we kept the cameras rolling." [...] Additionally, New Jersey musician Southside Johnny was hired as a technical advisor for the film.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting to Digital Spy {{about her}} return, Lawrence said: [...] "I've {{not been in}} the show for 11 years and it's not like I've ever thought [...] "I'll never go back", you just think that your chance to go back has gone. It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E
