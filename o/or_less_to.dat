Where Cuvier's group names correspond (more <b>or</b> <b>less)</b> <b>to</b> modern taxa, these are named, in English if possible, in parentheses. The table from the 1828 Penny Cyclopaedia indicates species that were thought to belong to each group in Cuvier's taxonomy. The four major divisions were known as embranchements ("branches").|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{measurements}} of Vega at 193μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, {{suggesting that they}} must instead be {{on the order of}} 100μm <b>or</b> <b>less.</b> <b>To</b> maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that {{were in the process of}} collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E
5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months <b>or</b> <b>less,</b> <b>to</b> which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E

5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea during the rainy season. To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E

25|$|Less than 100 {{years after}} Captain Cook's landing, {{most of the}} {{original}} vegetation had been cleared and burnt, larger trees had been ring barked or simply cut down.

25|$|In 58 BC the nobleman Orgetorix instigated a new Helvetian migration, {{in which}} the entire tribe was to leave their {{territory}} (which is now described as corresponding more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> the Swiss plateau) and to establish a supremacy over all of Gaul. They marched from their villages but were stalled by Julius Caesar {{on the banks of}} the Rhône. They marched around and crossed the Jura Mountains, but near the Aeduan oppidum Bibracte, Caesar caught up with the Helvetii and faced at the Battle of Bibracte, which ended in the Helvetii’s retreat and the capture of most of their baggage by the Romans. Following their surrender the Helvetii became foederati, an allied civitas that were required to provide soldiers but were not citizens.|$|E
25|$|If {{the symbol}} width is n, the codes of width n+1 fall {{naturally}} into two blocks: the lower block of 2n codes for coding single symbols, {{and the upper}} block of 2n codes {{that will be used}} by the decoder for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: 2n for CLEAR and 2n + 1 for STOP. The decoder must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, 2n+1 − 1, because when the decoder fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are 2n − 3 codes available to the decoder that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the decoder is always one step behind in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the encoder, but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the encoder can generate 2n − 2 codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore the encoder must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of 2n − 2 codes <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> make the decoder reset the coding dictionary. The GIF standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time. The composite data stream is partitioned into sub-blocks that each carry from 1 to 255 bytes.|$|E
25|$|As a result, all Brenda's friends {{apologized for}} their {{behavior}} towards her. During the fourth season, Brenda {{is interested in}} the drama department but it also led to problems: she spoiled her first audition and then went to the director of the play to try again and convince him. She then got the role, but a student made a rumor saying that she had slept to have the role. Unfortunately, this student was the girlfriend of Steve Sanders and the latter believed the rumors, others refusing more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> believe the denials of Brenda. Steve understood his mistake when the student asked him to attack Brenda to make her miss rehearsals. A little later, Steve's friend tried to commit suicide, but Brenda and Steve joined forces to save her and Steve was finally compensated by following Brenda's debut on stage. The director's praise led her to accept the latter at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in London for a year. After Kelly and Dylan last broke up, Brenda finally learned that a relationship was possible between Kelly and Brandon and expressed her blessing. She later spent her last night with Dylan, telling her she would not be gone forever. The couple will reconcile briefly in the final scene of the fourth season, though (because of Shannen Doherty's departure) Brenda's character was removed from the script and she never returned to Beverly Hills.|$|E

500|$|To explain each form, Russell {{provides}} illustrations. The {{power of}} mere force {{is like the}} tying of a rope around a pig's belly and lifting {{it up to a}} ship while ignoring its cries. The power of inducements is likened to two things: either conditioning, as exemplified by circus animals which have been trained to perform this-or-that trick for an audience, or group acquiescence, as when the leader among sheep is dragged along by chains to get the rest of the flock to follow. Finally, the power of propaganda is akin to the use of carrot and stick to influence the behaviour of a donkey, {{in the sense that the}} donkey is being persuaded that making certain actions (following the carrot, avoiding the stick) would be more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> their benefit.

500|$|Many {{physicians}} {{are slow to}} refer to hospice care, waiting until they are absolutely certain of a terminal prognosis. Some physicians believe that the patient must have a six-month prognosis <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> receive hospice care, while others are overly optimistic in their assessment of prognosis, presuming treatment will {{be more effective than}} it is. As a result, the majority of patients are referred to hospice in the very end-stages of their diseases, or choose that time to seek hospice care. The average length of stay in hospice before a patient dies was 26 days in 1994 and 19 days in 1998. Although the length of average stays has since increased, the term of care continues to be underused. In 2004 the average stay was 57 days and the median length was 22 days. 33% of hospice patients admitted in 2004 died within seven days of admission.|$|E
500|$|Later, authors Vince Gordon and Peter DijkemaIt {{argue that}} the guitar sound on [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] could be created with {{distortion}} commonly achievable with a highly-overdriven early 1950s guitar amplifier.

[...] The authors add that this difference in sound could be achieved with the pole piece for the low E string raised higher than the rest, thereby allowing it to overload the amplifier more than the treble strings. They also argue that Nashville session guitarist Grady Martin provided the guitar parts for the Trio's recording; they base this on stylistic and technical qualities, since, at the time, Martin was a more accomplished player than Burlison, and these qualities are apparent in his work on other recordings.|$|E
