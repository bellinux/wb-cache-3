40|$|Marine traffic {{engineering}} {{has been pushed}} to the limits due to a rising demand in the shipping business. Merchant ships are growing dramatically, both in numbers and in size. To keep pace with current developments, automation {{seems to be one}} viable option when it comes to keeping ships running with fewer seafarers available. The aim {{of this paper is to}} monitor a modern day mariners’ performance while working in a tense situation. The objective is to define the size of the safety domain whilst <b>overtaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel.</b> The approach was to assess the ship's domain area within a 3  nm wide traffic separation scheme by using a ship handling simulator. From the simulation results, <b>an</b> <b>overtaking</b> domain was determined as 1. 36  nm long and 0. 4  nm wide. Safety domains in real-life situations were experienced on a much smaller scale compared to the previous findings. The working load for this particular operation is expected to be stressful and highly skilled orientated...|$|R

60|$|Being in {{the track}} of the ocean steamers {{it was not long}} before he found himself <b>overtaking</b> <b>a</b> {{magnificent}} <b>vessel</b> whose decks were crowded with passengers. He dropped down some distance, to enable him to see these people more plainly, and while he hovered near he could hear the excited exclamations of the passengers, who focused dozens of marine glasses upon his floating form. This inspection somewhat embarrassed him, and having no mind to be stared at he put on additional speed and soon left the steamer far behind him.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the deck}} of a junk is always to be found a josshouse or temple, in front of which the crew keep incense, sticks, and perfumed paper {{continually}} burning. When <b>a</b> calm <b>overtakes</b> <b>an</b> English <b>vessel,</b> the sailors and passengers are always supposed to try what [...] "whistling for a wind" [...] will effect. In lieu of this method of [...] "raising the wind," [...] a Chinese sailor shapes little junks out of paper, and sets them afloat on the water as a propitiatory service to the divinity who has the welfare of seamen under his especial care.|$|R
5000|$|Notwithstanding {{anything}} {{contained in}} the Rules ..... <b>an</b> <b>overtaking</b> <b>vessel</b> must keep {{out of the way}} of the vessel being overtaken. [...] "Overtaking" [...] means approaching another vessel at more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam, i.e., so that at night, the overtaking vessel would see only the stern light and neither of the sidelights of the vessel being overtaken. Note that the opening words of this rule make clear that this rule overrides all other rules.|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes we met a {{black and}} rusty-looking vessel, laden with lumber, salt from Syracuse, or Genesee flour, and shaped at both ends like a square-toed boot, {{as if it had}} two sterns, and were fated always to advance backward. On its deck would be a square hut, and a woman seen through the window at her {{household}} work, with a little tribe of children who perhaps had been born in this strange dwelling and knew no other home. Thus, while the husband smoked his pipe at the helm and the eldest son rode one of the horses, on went the family, travelling hundreds of miles in their own house and carrying their fireside with them. The most frequent species of craft were the [...] "line-boats," [...] which had a cabin at each end, and a great bulk of barrels, bales, and boxes in the midst, or light packets like our own decked all over with a row of curtained windows from stem to stern, and a drowsy face at every one. Once we encountered a boat of rude construction, painted all in gloomy black, and manned by three Indians, who gazed at us in silence and with a singular fixedness of eye. Perhaps these three alone, among the ancient possessors of the land, had attempted to derive benefit from the white mail's mighty projects and float along the current of his enterprise. Not long after, {{in the midst of a}} swamp and beneath a clouded sky, we <b>overtook</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> that seemed full of mirth and sunshine. It contained a little colony of Swiss on their way to Michigan, clad in garments of strange fashion and gay colors, scarlet, yellow, and bright blue, singing, laughing, and making merry in odd tones and a babble of outlandish words. One pretty damsel, with a beautiful pair of naked white arms, addressed a mirthful remark to me. She spoke in her native tongue, and I retorted in good English, both of us laughing heartily at each other's unintelligible wit. I cannot describe how pleasantly this incident affected me. These honest Swiss were all itinerant community of jest and fun journeying through a gloomy land and among a dull race of money-getting drudges, meeting none to understand their mirth, and only one to sympathize with it, yet still retaining the happy lightness of their own spirit.|$|R

50|$|At {{the race}} circuit, the presenters were {{to gain a}} point for every car they <b>overtook</b> and lose <b>a</b> point each time they were <b>overtaken.</b> <b>As</b> the field {{consisted}} predominately of high-end sports and supercars, none of the presenters managed to overtake any competitors. Clarkson rolled his car attempting to <b>overtake</b> <b>a</b> Ford Focus.|$|R
60|$|The Dawn steered beautifully, {{one of the}} {{greatest}} virtues in a ship, under the circumstances in which we were then placed. A single man was all that we had at the wheel, and he controlled it with ease. I could see it was very different with the ship ahead, and fancied they had made a mistake on board her, by taking in all their canvass. Talcott and the gang aloft, had not got out of the top, however, before we had a hint that it would be well to imitate the stranger's prudence. Though our vessel steered so much better than another, no ship can keep on a direct line, while running before the wind, in a heavy sea. The waves occasionally fly past <b>a</b> <b>vessel,</b> like the scud glancing through the air; then, they seem to pause, altogether, as if to permit the ship to <b>overtake</b> them. When <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> is lifted aft by one of these torrents of rushing waters, the helm loses a portion of its power; and the part of the vast machine that first receives the impulse, seems intent on exchanging places with the bows, vessels often driving sideways before the surges, for spaces of time that are exceedingly embarrassing to the mariner. This happens to the best-steering ships, and is always one source of danger in very heavy weather, to those that are running off. The merit of the Dawn was in coming under command again, quickly, and in not losing so much of the influence of her helm, as is frequently the case with wild-steering craft. I understand there is a sloop-of-war now in the navy, that is difficult to get through a narrow passage, in a blow, in consequence of her having this propensity to turn her head first one way, then another, like a gay horse that breaks his bridle.|$|R
