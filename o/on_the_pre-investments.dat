40|$|We study {{a dynamic}} limit order market where agents may invest into a trading {{technology}} that grants them a speed advantage over others. Being fast is valuable {{because it allows}} limit orders to be revised quickly {{in the light of}} new information and therefore reduces the risk of being picked off. Even though this can generate more trading, the equilibrium level of investment is excessive and always generates a welfare loss because fast traders exert negative externalities on slow agents and are able to extract any surplus. If the diffusion of trading technology additionally leads to a more efficient trading process, this result may reverse completely. For sufficiently large efficiency gains, fast traders exert positive externalities on slow market participants and their presence leads to an increase in social welfare, albeit the equilibrium level of investment is below the social optimum. Our results imply that the marginal impact of investments related to algorithmic and high-frequency trading on social welfare crucially depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pre-investment</b> level of market efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|In this master thesis we have {{performed}} an explorative study <b>on</b> <b>the</b> VC-entrepreneur relationship. Paper 1 is a literature review of several frameworks describing the VC-entrepreneur relationship, how these frameworks take the VC and/or the entrepreneur's perspective, and their applicability and limitations to the pre- and post-investment stage. Our main {{findings in this}} literature review show that little emphasis has been placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pre-investment</b> stage and how the VC-entrepreneur relationship is initiated and developed. In addition few scholars take a demand-side view on equity finance which leads to an unbalanced understanding of the forces affecting the market for venture capital. Two main findings from Paper 1 was that social embeddedness may help explain how external parties in the entrepreneur's network may mediate the relation to investors {{and there is a}} need to further investigate how the entrepreneur may initiate and build relationships towards investors in an early venture stage. Thus the following papers aim to explore these findings. Paper 2 investigates how outside directors may strengthen entrepreneurial ventures in an early stage by performing explorative case analyses. Our findings suggest that outside directors may strengthen high-growth entrepreneurial ventures in an early stage by increasing the ventures competitive advantage in terms of strategically combining and managing resources. In addition they add legitimacy towards external stakeholders and increases the ventures interaction with its surroundings. The implications from Paper 2 suggest that more qualitative research should be performed <b>on</b> how <b>the</b> outside directors' strengthening contribution to early stage ventures can be related to stage theory. Paper 3 explores how entrepreneurs may develop investment readiness to bridge the financing gap and become seed level investor ready. This was done by conducting an explorative, theory building case study. From exploring the investment readiness we build a model that are able to relate investment readiness to the stages of development, and offers an explanation to how entrepreneurs use social ties as an information transferring mechanism effectively developing the investment readiness of the venture in order to overcome the high level of information asymmetry and risk related to the early stages of venture development. The implications from paper 3 suggest that the use of social ties could improve the entrepreneurs ability to become seed stage investor ready and effectively bridge the gap in early stage venture capital. </p...|$|R

40|$|A venture {{capitalist}} (VC) needs to trade off {{benefits and costs}} when attempting to mitigate agency problems in their investor-investee relationship. We argue that signals of ventures complement the VC’s capacity to screen and conduct a due diligence during <b>the</b> <b>pre-investment</b> phase, but its attractiveness may diminish in institutional settings supporting greater transparency. Similarly, whereas a VC may opt for contractual covenants to curb potential opportunism by ventures in the post-investment phase, this may only be effective in settings supportive of shareholder rights enforcement.

It delineates theoretical and practical implications for how investors can best deploy their capital in different institutional settings whilst nurturing their relationships with entrepreneurs...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{exploitation}} of petroleum resources {{has the capacity}} to enhance a nation 2 ̆ 7 s economy and promote national industry. This study examines how a state[1] can utilise the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) to develop national industries and commerce in the {{exploitation of}} its petroleum resources. The development of petroleum resources of a state relies on investment in petroleum producing enterprises and the development of infrastructure, in order to produce petroleum. It also relies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ability of a state to gain access to certain markets in order to sell the petroleum products. The ECT was established to provide a legal framework that creates mutual trade benefits for all parties, to ensure access to energy products, and to secure investment[2] to develop those energy products. This study focuses on two important pillars of the ECT: trade and investment. After a consideration of the history, scope and aims of the ECT, this study will examine how Article 5 of the ECT (Trade Related Investment Measures) can assist a state to develop its petroleum resources through the non-discriminatory access to trade under the GATT provisions in a transparent manner. It will then analyse how the Article 10 investment measures (Promotion, Protection and Treatment of Investments) assists in the development of commerce and industry.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how venture capitalists {{implement}} ESG issues internally, as well as before the investment decision and during the investment period. Theoretical framework: The theoretical framework consists of previous studies that identify different driving forces behind the work of the ESG and present a number of different strategies for implementing ESG issues in the investment process. Method: This study aims at providing an understanding of a phenomenon which implies an inductive approach. This thesis applies a qualitative method of data collection in the form of semi-structured interviews.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a visually interactive decision support framework designed {{to aid the}} decision maker, typically top management, in selecting the most appropriate technology and design, when planning a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). The framework {{can be used in}} <b>the</b> <b>pre-investment</b> stage of <b>the</b> planning process, after the decision in principle has been made to build an FMS. First, both qualitative and quantitative criteria are used to narrow the set of alternative system configurations under consideration down to a small number of most attractive candidates. After this pre-screening phase, a multiobjective programming model is formulated for each remaining configuration, allowing the manager to explore and evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} various different scenarios for each configuration separately by experimenting with different levels of batch sizes and production volumes. The system uses visual interaction with the decision maker, graphically displaying the relevant tradeoffs between such relevant performance criteria as investment and production costs, manufacturing flexibility, production volume and investment risk, for each scenario. Additional criteria, when relevant, can be included as well. The ease of use and interpretation and the flexibility make the proposed system a powerful analytical tool in the initial FMS design process. The insights gained from experimenting with the different scenarios form the basis of understanding the anticipated impact of techno-economic factors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> performance of the FMS configuration, and provide valuable information for the implementation stage of building the FMS.

Economic interaction arising from the development of naturalresource potential is the subject-matter of the study. The development of the methodological tools for the assessment of investment attractiveness for business and authorities is the purpose of the study. For the zoning of territories at <b>the</b> <b>pre-investment</b> project stage typical landscapes were selected and assessed by each type of renewable natural resources. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> basis of the analysis of the existing approaches to the zoning of natural resources, three types of landscapes were defined: the investment-attractive ones, the investment-attractive ones with some restrictions and the investment unattractive ones. During the study, the following hypothesis was confirmed: the selection of the most valuable natural resources increases the opportunities of their development. The investment attractiveness is determined by the advantages of geographical location, development of regional infrastructure, natural potential which is considered as a priority investment target. The need for the valuation of the natural resource potential of landscape areas within the boundaries of the assessed area is justified. The limitations are the low level of infrastructure development, insufficient resistance of landscapes to anthropogenic influence, the export of raw materials for recycling from the territories. The list of conditions that demand the introduction of correction factors to the cost parameters of the natural resource potential of landscape areas is justified.

40|$|Two outline {{schemes for}} {{the course of the}} 2 nd track <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railway line Ljubljana-Jesenice for {{estimating}} the land market value of the individual corridor or territory are presented and analyzed in the Bachelor degree. A relevant legislation in the area of acquisition of real estates for the public interest is analyzed. A surface analysis of the land use in the area defined is made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of the applicable spatial implementation acts and a type of use according to <b>the</b> cadastral classification <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of information of land cadastre is formed. Land prices, contractual and advertised land price, were analyzed for the purpose of estimating the land market value planned for the purchase inside and the remaining surface outside the defined corridor. The analysis represents the baseline for land classifications for the purpose of estimating the land within a framework of <b>the</b> <b>pre-investment</b> study. All land is evaluated with the method of direct price comparison of similar real estates. For this purpose the currently available information about the functioning of the real estate market is used. In the conclusion of the Bachelor degree we found out that we lack a suitable number of specified types of data to formulate the right evaluation methodology, especially information on contractual land prices at some stage of land development. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> basis of the estimated land market value for the potential construction of the public railway infrastructure on two different variants we found out that the most favorable variant of the planned route is next to the existing railway line. The second variant would require a purchase of more surface land, which would be more expensive. In the process of acquiring land for the construction of the 2 nd track <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railway line Ljubljana-Jesenice a more detailed separate estimation of land will be required, which would be carried out by the competent experts - appraiser...|$|R
