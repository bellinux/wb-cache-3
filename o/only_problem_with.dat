500|$|Following Jackson's death, {{reports of}} {{his use of}} {{pethidine}} (Demerol) surfaced. Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he asked her for unspecified [...] "products for sleep." [...] On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol. Lee refused, telling him, [...] "Michael, the <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> you taking this medication ... is you're {{going to take it}} and you're not going to wake up." [...] Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor told him it was safe. He did not name the doctor. [...] An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.|$|E

Author Andy Slaven {{wrote that the}} <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the game was its [...] "strange" [...] three-quarter perspective. Nintendo Power gave it a 3.375 out of 5. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 7.6 out of 10, summarizing that [...] "this one {{requires a lot of}} skill and technique, but the various antics and animations (especially on Kidd's enemy) are incredibly lifelike and make this one of the better games around." [...] IGN called the Super NES version overlooked and described it as a [...] "zany" [...] game that [...] "boasts stellar colors and some really frantic animation". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell described the video game J.J. & Jeff as a [...] "poor man's Plok/Kid Klown in Crazy Chase/Putty Quest/etc". Edge compared Let's Tap to Kid Klown due to the similar challenges found in Let's Taps multi-player mode. Nintendo Life's Andrew Donaldson commented that while not a bad game, there's no reason to play it {{due to a lack of}} levels and an abundance of games that do what it does better.|$|E

500|$|Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop named Spooks series seven as {{the best}} {{television}} show of 2008 out of 50 programmes. Gimmers felt the seventh series performed better than the previous, as it [...] "lost its way slightly" [...] with the concentration of Islamic extremists. The seventh series however, was praised for bringing back the more traditional enemy, the Russians. With the introduction of Lucas North, Gimmers stated [...] "the possibilities for double-blinding the audience were legion and every single one was exploited to the max." [...] Gimmers also cited the more [...] "pacy" [...] plots due to a shorter series as another factor of the series's success, and also said [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> having a series as good as this in the bag is how they will match it next year?" [...] David Blackwell of Enterline Media said that the series' storylines [...] "have a grain of truth reflecting today's climate" [...] and also [...] "more deeply rooted in gritty realism and preying on the real dangers that terrorists and other countries pose to the UK." [...] Blackwell also posed the storylines also [...] "keeps the characters human and show what they go through" [...] and reacted positevely towards Lucas' introduction, stating [...] "I like Lucas North better than Adam Carter or Tom Quinn. His dark and conflicted persona adds to the story and makes him a more interesting character than Adam or Tom ever were." [...] Blackwell summed up the series as [...] "as great as the first six seasons. The show maintains a high standard of quality." ...|$|E

2500|$|To read Reston on Henry Kissinger today is, as it {{was during}} the Nixon administration, a little embarrassing. (Reston once titled one of his columns [...] "By Henry Kissinger with James Reston".) Nothing in his {{experience}} in Washington, Reston says over and over in these memoirs, [...] "was ever quite as good or as bad as the fashionable opinion of the day", and he thinks of Kissinger as a prime example of this. [...] But in praising Kissinger, Reston is praising a man who regularly misled him, who wiretapped NSC staff members to determine who was leaking to reporters when they revealed his unconstitutional maneuverings, and who urged Nixon to prosecute Reston's newspaper for its constitutionally protected publication of the Pentagon Papers. During the infamous 1972 Christmas bombing of North Vietnam, Reston wrote of Kissinger that [...] "he has said nothing in public about the bombing in North Vietnam, which he undoubtedly opposes.... If the bombing goes on ... Mr. Kissinger will be free to resign." [...] The <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the interpretation, however, was that the bombings were Kissinger's idea. He misled Reston about his own position and then misled the White House staff about these conversations, finally admitting the truth when confronted with his phone records.|$|E

Even though Hatfield particularly disliked the final boss fight for being the [...] "opposite of fun", {{he said that the}} game's level design and core mechanics make up for it by being [...] "so much damn fun". Hatfield also spoke positively of the premise of being an alien against humans, rather than a human against aliens, the humour, and the difficulty balance.|$|R

2500|$|Modern {{reception}} of the album has been very positive. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic gave the album a rating of four and half stars out of five, and referred to the album as [...] "one {{of the most exciting}} and experimental psychedelic albums of the late 1960s" [...] and compared some of the band's more hard-edged material to early Pink Floyd and The Velvet Underground. Music webzine Pitchfork Media gave the album a high rating of 8.9 out of 10, and claimed that [...] "USA's self-titled album still stands above the work of most of their Monterey-era, psych-rock peers". Dusted Magazine also praised the album on its 2004 re-issue, stating [...] "The most ambitious, idiosyncratic debut album of 2004 is 36 years old.". Negative points of the album were mentioned by Allmusic noting that [...] "Occasionally things get too excessive and self-conscious, and the attempts at comedy are a bit flat, but otherwise this is a near classic." [...] The Dusted Magazine review also noted this stating [...] "The less successful tracks on the album are the ones that ditch subtlety for extremely strident attacks on bourgeois America." [...] Pitchfork Media's <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the album was some of the dated electronic effects, suggesting that [...] "some of the album's synthesizer works haven't aged well and are stigmatized by the [...] "B-flick sound effects" [...] tag that magnifies the wrinkles on so many electro-acoustic pieces from the analog years."

40|$|AbstractThe design {{method of}} {{polynomial}} control laws {{by mean of}} pole placement are actually smart solutions to many industrial applications. This category of controllers is very popular in the industry; however most of their applications concern <b>only</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> constant reference signals. In this paper, we propose an indirect adaptive controller by fractional order pole placement. The proposed control strategy {{is based on the}} self-tuning control structure and on-line estimation of the plant model parameters using the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. To show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme two simulation examples are presented. The first example is the control of a DC motor angular speed and the second one is the control of an air-lubricated capstan drive for precision positioning. Improvement in the system control dynamical behavior compared to classical control scheme has been shown for the two illustrative examples...|$|R

5000|$|In {{computer}} graphics, unbiased rendering {{refers to}} a rendering technique that does not introduce any systematic error, or bias, into the radiance approximation. Because of this, it {{is often used to}} generate the reference image to which other rendering techniques are compared. Mathematically speaking, the expected value of the unbiased estimator will always be the population mean, for any number of observations. Error found in an unbiased rendering will be due to variance, which manifests itself as high-frequency noise in the resultant image. Variance is reduced by [...] and standard deviation by [...] for [...] data points, meaning that four times as many data points are needed to halve the standard deviation of the error. This makes unbiased rendering techniques less attractive for realtime or interactive rate applications. Conversely, an image produced by an unbiased renderer that appears smooth and noiseless is probabilistically correct. For now, there are <b>only</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> unbiased rendering of human, especially human face.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of Chapter 11 was to {{introduce}} information space (I-space) concepts and to provide illustrative examples that aid in understanding.

Section 12. 1 covers general-purpose algorithms, for which it will quickly be discovered that <b>only</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> very few states can be solved because of the explosive growth of the I-space. In Chapter 6, it was seen that general-purpose motion planning algorithms apply <b>only</b> to simple <b>problems.</b> Ways to avoid this were either to develop sampling-based techniques or {{to focus on a}} narrower class of problems. It is intriguing to apply sampling-based planning ideas to I-spaces, but as of yet this idea remains largely unexplored. Therefore, the majority of this chapter focuses on planning algorithms designed for narrower classes of problems. In each case, interesting algorithms have been developed that can solve problems that are much more complicated than what could be solved by the general-purpose algorithms. This is because they exploit some structure that is specific to the problem...|$|R
