5|$|In {{the same}} period, {{different}} helms {{began to be}} used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affronté), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests would always have faced {{the same way as the}} helm, but as a result of these rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse rolls <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind {{takes hold}} of the comic so that it flies towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The next morning, the three boys reflect on how their inability to share led {{to the destruction of}} the comic, although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E
5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under the barrel. This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip. The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E

5|$|The Mersea Week is {{a week-long}} August festival of boat racing {{organised}} by the West Mersea Yacht Club and Dabchicks Sailing Club, established in 1973. During the week, starting on Monday, there are races for many boat {{classes in the}} Blackwater Estuary, from Optimist dinghies to large yachts. The most celebrated event is the Round-the-Island race, where dinghies attempt to sail round the island in either direction, helped over the Strood by volunteers. On Saturday, there is a regatta at West Mersea, followed by a selection of water sports and a firework display at dusk. One of the popular events on Saturday is walking a greasy pole rigged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hosting Thames sailing barge.|$|E
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it {{has been associated with}} reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, the {{relatively}} brief Second English Civil War broke out, and Rupert informed the French King {{that he would}} be returning to King Charles' service. The Parliamentary navy mutinied in favour of the King and sailed for Holland, providing the Royalists with a major fleet {{for the first time since}} the start of the civil conflict; Rupert joined the fleet under the command of the Duke of York, who assumed the rank of Lord High Admiral. Rupert argued that the fleet should be used to rescue the King, then being held prisoner on the Isle of Wight, while others advised sailing in support of the fighting in the north. The fleet itself rapidly lost discipline, with many vessels' crews focussing on seizing local ships and cargoes. This underlined a major problem for the Royalists—the cost of maintaining the new fleet was well beyond their means. Discipline continued to deteriorate, and Rupert had to intervene personally several times, including defusing one group of mutinous sailors by suddenly dangling the ringleader <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his vessel and threatening to drop him into the sea. Most of the fleet finally switched sides once more, returning to England in late 1648.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 29 November 1877, heavy rain caused the dam of the Rhodgeidio mill near Llanerchymedd to breach, and the surge of water washed away the wooden Caemawr bridge over the Afon Alaw. The first train {{of the day was}} driven by William Taylor, with fireman John Saunders and railway {{inspector}} John Davies also on the footplate. The train also included two coal trucks, a passenger coach, and a guard's van, with Edward Hughes serving as the guard. The whole train went <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the bridge into the river. Edward Hughes dragged himself out, and was taken to the nearest farm. John Davies was scalded to death, and Taylor and Saunders were found injured, and could not be freed until mid-day. John Saunders later died from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E

5|$|After {{commissioning}} {{too late}} {{to participate in the}} First World War, Argus was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from Furious. The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush {{with the rest of the}} flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two Airco DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.|$|E

5000|$|Some flying bridges have [...] "bridge wings", open areas which thrust {{outward from}} <b>the</b> flying bridge <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel by {{approximately}} 10 to 15 ft to allow an officer to see <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his ship while docking or working with smaller vessels.|$|R
50|$|The engine had its {{cylinders}} cast {{together with}} the upper crankcase and featured a four-bearing crankshaft with counterbalancing weights.

25|$|Apollo was {{launched}} in March 1794 and commissioned in August under her first commander, Captain John Manley.

On Manley's orders the ship was lightened by the disposal <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> her stores and several of her guns, after which she floated free of the sand. Her rudder had broken in the process, and after some difficulty she was sailed to Great Yarmouth for repairs.|$|E

25|$|Outside of {{professional}} wrestling, Ferraro is a real-life performing strongman. His demonstrations have included bending steel bars and breaking iron bars over his head, and headbutting and snapping a Louisville slugger in half with his skull. His specialty, however, is using {{his head to}} break various hard or heavy objects. He has had cinder blocks jack-hammered off his head, concrete blocks set on fire and broken <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his head using a sledge hammer, and having 16lb bowling balls dropped on his head from heights up to 15 feet. Ferraro has also used his forehead to drive spikes through 2x4s wrapped in sheet metal.
