This function may be deranged in sickle cell anemia and some other hemoglobinopathies. An automated oxyhemoglobin <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> analyzer constructed <b>dissociation</b> <b>curves</b> in 55 patients with hemoglobinopathies and in 24 control subjects while maintaining constant temperature and pH. Sigmoid curves were converted to rectilinear ones using the Hill equation. Oxygen affinity of red cells was assessed by calculation of P 50 (the PO 2 at which hemoglobin is half saturated). Results revealed separation of oxyhemoglobin dissociation Hill plots according to phenotype but with wide variability. Mean oxygen affinity of fetal hemoglobin was greatest, whereas that of sickle hemoglobin was least. Other hemoglobins were intermediate. A positive correlation between decreased oxygen affinity and carboxyhemoglobin confirmed the decreased oxygen affinity of sickle hemoglobin and decreased oxygen affinity and increased diphosphoglycerate in red cells. Hill plots are less sensitive discriminators of oxygen affinity than traditional sigmoid <b>dissociation</b> <b>curves</b> and offer no particular advantage.

40|$|Abstract Background Fluorescence of dyes {{bound to}} {{double-stranded}} PCR products has been utilized extensively in various real-time quantitative PCR applications, including post-amplification <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> analysis, or differentiation of amplicon length or sequence composition. Despite the current era of whole-genome sequencing, mapping {{tools such as}} radiation hybrid DNA panels remain useful aids for sequence assembly, focused resequencing efforts, and for building physical maps of species {{that have not yet}} been sequenced. For placement of specific, individual genes or markers on a map, low-throughput methods remain commonplace. Typically, PCR amplification of DNA from each panel cell line is followed by gel electrophoresis and scoring of each clone for {{the presence or absence of}} PCR product. To improve sensitivity and efficiency of radiation hybrid panel analysis in comparison to gel-based methods, we adapted fluorescence-based real-time PCR and <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> analysis for use as a novel scoring method. Results As proof of principle for this <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> method, we generated new maps of river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) chromosome 20 by both <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> analysis and conventional marker scoring. We also obtained sequence data to augment <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> results. Few genes have been previously mapped to buffalo chromosome 20, and sequence detail is limited, so 65 markers were screened from the orthologous chromosome of domestic cattle. Thirty bovine markers (46 %) were suitable as cross-species markers for <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> analysis in the buffalo radiation hybrid panel under a standard protocol, compared to 25 markers suitable for conventional typing. Computational analysis placed 27 markers on a chromosome map generated by the new method, while the gel-based approach produced only 20 mapped markers. Among 19 markers common to both maps, the marker order on the map was maintained perfectly. Conclusion <b>Dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> analysis is reliable and efficient for radiation hybrid panel scoring, and is more sensitive and robust than conventional gel-based typing methods. Several markers could be scored only by the new method, and ambiguous scores were reduced. PCR-based <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> analysis decreases both time and resources needed for construction of radiation hybrid panel marker maps and represents a significant improvement over gel-based methods in any species. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In medicine, oxygen {{saturation}} (SO2), {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "sats," [...] measures the percentage of hemoglobin binding sites in the bloodstream occupied by oxygen. At low partial pressures of oxygen, most hemoglobin is deoxygenated. At around 90% (the value varies according to the clinical context) {{oxygen saturation}} increases according to an <b>oxygen-hemoglobin</b> <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> and approaches 100% at partial oxygen pressures of >10 kPa.

This curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen. Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation (SO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2), and is determined by what is called [...] "hemoglobin affinity for oxygen"; that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules into the fluid that surrounds it.|$|E

However, about 12. 5 % of the saturation measurements would be more than 10 % higher if HbAA were present instead of HbSS. This study confirms that SpO 2 is a reasonable estimate of oxygenation status in patients with sickle cell disease.

50|$|An {{example of}} {{positive}} cooperativity is the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. One oxygen molecule {{can bind to}} the ferrous iron of a heme molecule {{in each of the}} four chains of a hemoglobin molecule. Deoxy-hemoglobin has a relatively low affinity for oxygen, but when one molecule binds to a single heme, the oxygen affinity increases, allowing the second molecule to bind more easily, and the third and fourth even more easily. The oxygen affinity of 3-oxy-hemoglobin is ~300 times greater than that of deoxy-hemoglobin. This behavior leads the affinity curve of hemoglobin to be sigmoidal, rather than hyperbolic as with the monomeric myoglobin. By the same process, the ability for hemoglobin to lose oxygen increases as fewer oxygen molecules are bound. See also <b>Oxygen-hemoglobin</b> <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E

40|$|Oxygen is transported {{throughout}} the body by hemoglobin in red blood cells. While the oxygen affinity of blood is well understood and is routinely assessed in patients by pulse oximetry, variability at the single-cell level has not been previously measured. In contrast, single-cell measurements of red blood cell volume and hemoglobin concentration are taken millions of times per day by clinical hematology analyzers and are important factors in determining {{the health of the}} hematologic system. To better understand the variability and determinants of oxygen affinity on a cellular level, we have developed a system that quantifies the oxygen saturation, cell volume and hemoglobin concentration for individual red blood cells in high-throughput. We find that the variability in single-cell saturation peaks at an oxygen partial pressure of 2. 5 %, which corresponds to the maximum slope of the <b>oxygen-hemoglobin</b> <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve.</b> In addition, single-cell oxygen affinity is positively correlated with hemoglobin concentration, but independent of osmolarity, which suggests variation in the hemoglobin to 2 - 3 DPG ratio on a cellular level.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether possible preglomerular arterial-to-venous oxygen shunting is affected by the interaction between renal preglomerular carbon dioxide and oxygen transport. We hypothesized that a reverse (venous-to-arterial) shunting of carbon dioxide will increase partial pressure of carbon dioxide and decrease pH in the arteries and thereby lead to increased oxygen offloading and consequent oxygen shunting. To test this hypothesis, we employed a segment-wise three-dimensional computational model of coupled renal oxygen and carbon dioxide transport, wherein coupling is achieved by shifting the <b>oxygen-hemoglobin</b> <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> in dependence of local changes in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and pH. The model suggests that primarily due to the high buffering capacity of blood, there is only marginally increased acidity in the preglomerular vasculature compared to systemic arterial blood caused by carbon dioxide shunting. Furthermore, effects of carbon dioxide transport do not promote but rather impair preglomerular oxygen shunting, as the increase in acidity is higher in the veins compared to that in the arteries. We conclude that while substantial arterial-to-venous oxygen shunting might take place in the postglomerular vasculature, the net amount of oxygen shunted at the preglomerular vasculature appears to be marginal...|$|E

Since RQ was not measured in those studies, {{it was not clear}} whether Pv–aCO 2 /Ca–vO 2 effectively reflected the presence of anaerobic metabolism or was only the result of factors that could increase that ratio in the absence of anaerobic metabolism. In fact, Pv–aCO 2 /Ca–vO 2 is not a straightforward variable. Although related to RQ, it might be hypothetically increased by several factors beyond anaerobic metabolism. Many of the changes in Pv–aCO 2 /Ca–vO 2 might be ascribed to modifications of the CO 2 -Hb <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve.</b> Haldane effect, metabolic acidosis, and anemia can increase PCO 2 for a given CCO 2 [13].
