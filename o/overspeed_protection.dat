The splined sleeve disintegrated, severing the high-speed shaft, which led to an overspeed of the right-hand power turbine which in turn burst, destroying the left-hand engine as well as to cutting control rods which made the helicopter uncontrollable.|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 157 - 168 Turbine {{overspeed}} events lead to {{the most}} dangerous and costly of catastrophic turbine failures. Traditionally, <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> systems were designed and provided by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) - few options were available either in terms of testing or modifying these systems. With new turbines, and with the retrofit of older systems, it is more common to see third party systems playing this critical protective role. However users often do not appreciate the <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> system response time that is required to adequately protect their equipment. This tutorial will explain the basic components of a turbine trip system, and consider sources of variability in the response times of those components.

40|$|The {{development}} of aileron-control for wind turbines is discussed. Selected {{wind tunnel test}} results and full-scale rotor test results are presented for various types of ailerons. Finally, {{the current status of}} aileron-control development is discussed. Aileron-control was considered as a method of rotor control for use on wind turbines based on its potential to reduce rotor weight and cost. Following an initial feasibility study, a 20 percent chord aileron-control rotor was fabricated and tested on the NASA/DOE Mod- 0 experimental wind turbine. Results from these tests indicated that the 20 percent chord ailerons regulated power and provided <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection,</b> but only over a very limited windspeed range. The next aileron-control rotor to be tested on the Mod- 0 had 38 percent chord ailerons and test results showed these ailerons provided <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> and power regulation over the Mod- 0 's entire operational windspeed range...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using aileron or spoiler controls as alternates to pitch control for large horizontal axis wind turbines was studied. The NASA Mod- 0 100 kw machine {{was used as}} the basis for the study. Specific performance studies were conducted for 20 % chord ailerons over the outboard 30 % span, and for 10 % chord spoilers over the same portion of the span. Both control systems utilized control deflections up to 60 deg. Results of the study show that either ailerons or spoilers can provide the control necessary to limit turbine power in high wind conditions. The aileron system, as designed, provides <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> at hurricane wind speeds, low wind speed starting torque of 778 N-m (574 ft. lb) at 3. 6 m/sec, and a 1. 3 to 1. 5 % increase in annual energy compared to a fixed pitch rotor.

This paper proposes an alternative control strategy for small {{wind turbines}} [...] the soft-stall control method. The furling and soft-stall control strategies are compared using steady state analysis and dynamic simulation analysis. The soft-stall method is found to offer several advantages: increased energy production at high wind speeds, energy production which tracks the maximum power coefficient at low to medium wind speeds, reducing furling noise, and reduced thrust...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{effective}} global harmony search algorithm (EGHS) to solve {{two kinds of}} reliability problems: the complex (bridge) system optimization problem and the reliability–redundancy optimization problem of the <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> system for a gas turbine. In general, the two problems are formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems with several constraints. The EGHS combines harmony search algorithm (HS) with concepts from the swarm intelligence of particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to solve optimization problems. The proposed algorithm {{has been applied to}} two typical problems with results better than previously reported. The results have demonstrated that the EGHS has strong convergence and capacity of space exploration on solving reliability optimization problems. ...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear reactor plants {{include a}} turbine {{generator}} system (TGS) {{to convert the}} energy in steam from the {{nuclear steam supply system}} into electrical energy. The TGS consists essentially of the turbine unit and the automatic devices, alarms, and trips which control and regulate turbine action, and the generator unit and its Con-trols. The turbine control system and the steam inlet stop and control valves, the low pressure turbine steam intercept and inlet control valves, and the extraction steam control valves control the speed of the turbine under normal and abnormal conditions, and are thus related to the overall safe operation of the plant. The turbine generator system installed in a nuclear plant is typically equipped with redundant <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> instrumentation and controls and the main steam and reheat steam control and stop valving arrangements typically provide redundancy in the valves essential for <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection.</b> The intent of the review under this SRP section is to verify that such redundancy, in conjunction with inservice inspection and testing of the essential valves, makes a turbine overspeed condition above the design overspeed very unlikely and to assure conformance with General Design Criterion 4. Assessment of the risk to essential plant systems and struc-tures from potential turbine missiles is reviewed under SRP Section 3. 5. 1. 3. 1. The PSB reviews the turbine generator system and the components and subsystems normally provided with this equipment with respect to the following considera-tions: a. The general arrangement of the turbine and associated equipment with respect to safety-related structures and systems and balance of plant. b.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} undertaken to further evaluate {{and enhance the}} performance of an aerodynamic device for wind turbine <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> and power modulation applications. The trailing-edge device, known as the Spoiler-Flap, was examined in detail during wind tunnel tests. The impact of hp length, vent angle, pivot point and chord variations on aerodynamic and hinge moment characteristics were evaluated and a best overall configuration was identified. Based on this effort, a 40 % chord device with a 1 % hp length and 40 degree vent angle offers improved performance potential for wind turbine applications. This specific configuration appears to offer good suction coefficient performance for both turbine power modulation and overspeed (i. e., aerodynamic braking) applications.

40|$|Horizontal-axis wind {{turbines}} utilize partial or full variable blade pitch to regulate rotor speed. The weight {{and costs of}} these systems indicated a need for alternate methods of rotor control. Aileron control is an alternative which has potential to meet this need. The NASA Lewis Research Center has been experimentally testing aileron control rotors on the Mod-U wind turbine to determine their power regulation and shutdown characteristics. Experimental and analytical shutdown test results are presented for a 38 percent chord aileron-control rotor. These {{results indicated that the}} 38 percent chord ailerons provided <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> over the entire Mod-O operational windspeed range, and had a no-load equilibrium tip speed ratio of 1. 9.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that a human}} pilot uses {{the same set of}} generic skills to control a wide variety of aircraft. If this is true, then {{it should be possible to}} construct an electronic controller which embodies this generic skill set such that it can successfully control difference airplanes without being matched to a specific airplane. In an attempt to create such a system, a fuzzy logic controller was devised to control throttle position and another to control elevator position. These two controllers were used to control flight path angle and airspeed for both a piston powered single engine airplane simulation and a business jet simulation. <b>Overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> and stall protection were incorporated in the form of expert systems supervisors. It was found that by using the artificial intelligence techniques of fuzzy logic and expert systems, a generic longitudinal controller could be successfully used on two general aviation aircraft types that have very difference characteristics. These controllers worked for both airplanes over their entire flight envelopes including configuration changes. The controllers for both airplanes were identical except for airplane specific limits (maximum allowable airspeed, throttle lever travel, etc.). The controllers also handled configuration changes without mode switching or knowledge of the current configuration. This research validated the fact that the same fuzzy logic based controller can control two very different general aviation airplanes. It also developed the basic controller architecture and specific control parameters required for such a general controller...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of complex safety-critical {{systems such as}} integrated modular avionics challenges the limits of traditional process-based assurance methods based on what DO- 178 B calls “reviews. ” The problem is that interaction between subsystems produces too many possible behaviors. Assurance for these cases needs support from what DO- 178 B calls “analyses”; in particular, tool-supported calculation of (properties of) all possible system behaviors. These calculations can be performed by automated formal methods, but have been infeasible in the past due to inadequate tools and absence of suitable descriptions of the products. Recent advances have produced much more capable tools, and the {{emergence of}} “model based ” approaches to system development has made suitable product descriptions available. 1. The Challenge Assurance is about providing evidence that we know the consequences of the system’s behavior in every possible circumstance, and that those consequences are acceptable in some appropriate sense. Knowing the consequences of the system’s behavior in every possible circumstance {{does not necessarily mean that}} we need to have detailed knowledge of its behavior in every possible circumstance: for example, we may not need to know all the ways an engine controller can get into an overspeed situation if there is a separate <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> mechanism that can shut off the fuel. But as systems become more intimately connected to other systems, and are themselves composed of interacting subsystems, so the provision of easily understood protection mechanisms becomes less feasible and it does become necessary to comprehend all possible behaviors of the system concerned...|$|E

40|$|Wind {{power is}} a mature market for large wind {{turbines}} but the small wind turbine market is still an open one. There is only one player of considerable size on the small wind market: the market leader Southwest Windpower. Now Skyllermarks Pressar AB (hereafter referred to as Skyllermarks) wants to develop a more competitive turbine than Southwest Windpower’s Skystream 3. 7. The first step in this project {{is to develop a}} blade for injection moulding for FuturEnergy’s FE 10 XX turbine. Skyllermarks is a reseller for the English small wind turbine manufacturer FuturEnergy. As a first step towards developing a new turbine the aim of this theisis is to provide the backbone for developing a new wind turbine blade for FuturEnergys FE 10 XX turbine. The turbine is a fixed pitch, variabel speed machine with a rotordiameter of 1. 75 m. It uses furling for <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection.</b> Southwest Windpower is Skyllermarks’s main competitor as the market leader in the small wind sector. Because of this, Southwest Windpower’s turbine Skystream 3. 7 is used as a basis for comparsion for the FE 10 XX. It is found that the FE 10 XX turbine should be able to provide the desired annual energy production of 2000 kWh for a average wind speed of 4 to 6 m/s if the rotordiameter is expanded to 3. 6 m. The blade profile family S 822 or S 833 from NREL should be used for the new blade. To make the turbine quieter the optimal tip speed ratio of the blades should be reduced from the present 5. 5 to 4. 5. The tip shape of the blade also has an impact on the sound and therefore a tip shape with a sweept leading edge is recomended. Is is concluded that the new blade can be produced in the largest injection moulding machine at Skyllermarks’s plastic mouldning partner Accenta Plast. At the price of added complexity the rotor can be improved further by adding vortex generators to make the blades more efficient and quiet and by using PETD technology for de-icing the blades...|$|E
