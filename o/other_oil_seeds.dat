30|$|Since other {{oilseeds}} & crop is {{the primary}} source of edible oils, it is required in almost all processed food items and wide range of culinary. For this reason with the growth in food grains, the supply of other oilseeds and crops needs to grow substantially. As <b>other</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> and crops are becoming costlier, the tendency towards crop diversification intensifies. Farmers tend to replace pulses and cereal production with more of oil seed production. The minimum support price of food grains should be sufficiently high to restrain this. Otherwise, food grain production would decrease and the food security of the country would be jeopardised.|$|E

In plants, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is stored in subcellular organelles called oil bodies (OBs), which are stabilized by proteins. Proteome composition of the J. curcas OBs revealed oleosins as the major component and additional proteins similar to those in <b>other</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> plants. Three J. curcas oleosins were isolated and characterized at the gene, transcript and protein level. They all contained the characteristic proline knot domain and were each present as a single copy in the genome. The smallest, L-form JcOle 3 contained an intron. Isolation of its promoter revealed seed-specific cis-regulatory motifs among others. Spatio-temporal transcript expression of J. curcas oleosins was largely similar to that in <b>other</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> plants. Immunoassay with antibodies against an Arabidopsis oleosin or against JcOle 3, on seed proteins extracted by different approaches, revealed JcOle 3 oligomers. Alleles of JcOle 3 and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its intron were identified in J. curcas accessions, species and hybrids. Identified alleles and SNPs could serve as markers in phylogenetic or breeding studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) is an {{oilseed plant}} species with high {{potential}} utility as a biofuel. Furthermore, following recent sequencing of its genome {{and the availability}} of expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries, it is a valuable model plant for studying carbon assimilation in endosperms of oilseed plants. There have been several transcriptomic analyses of developing physic nut seeds using ESTs, but they have provided limited information on the accumulation of stored resources in the seeds. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We applied next-generation Illumina sequencing technology to analyze global gene expression profiles of developing physic nut seeds 14, 19, 25, 29, 35, 41, and 45 days after pollination (DAP). The acquired profiles reveal the key genes, and their expression timeframes, involved in major metabolic processes including: carbon flow, starch metabolism, and synthesis of storage lipids and proteins in the developing seeds. The main period of storage reserves synthesis in the seeds appears to be 29 - 41 DAP, and the fatty acid composition of the developing seeds is consistent with relative expression levels of different isoforms of acyl-ACP thioesterase and fatty acid desaturase genes. Several transcription factor genes whose expression coincides with storage reserve deposition correspond to those known to regulate the process in Arabidopsis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results will facilitate searches for genes that influence de novo lipid synthesis, accumulation and their regulatory networks in developing physic nut seeds, and <b>other</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seeds.</b> Thus, they will be helpful in attempts to modify these plants for efficient biofuel production...|$|E

Sampling was carried out randomly from nine different sites from Ethiopia and one sample from Eretria for comparison. The following metal concentration ranges (μg/g) were determined in niger seed samples, respectively: Na (159 – 736), K (5594 – 8203), Ca (340 – 680), Mg (2404 – 4656), Mn (13. 4 – 34. 3), Fe (31. 6 – 370), Cu (9. 5 – 61. 2), Zn (23. 4 – 46. 2), Cr (4. 0 – 16. 8), Co (4. 9 – 27. 3), Ni (13. 0 – 32. 4), Pb (15. 5 – 19. 3) and Cd was not detected in all the samples. The analysis of variance indicated the presence of significance difference at 95 % confidence level among niger seeds collected from different sites. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated that there were significant correlations among some metals in the niger seed. The study revealed that niger seed is good source of essential metals and free from toxic metal such as Cd and hence safe for human consumption.

A re-lationship between the chick's dietary zinc requirements and phytates has been sug-gested. The zinc content of isolated soy protein is very low, {{and its effect on}} the chick's dietary requirement seems to be in increasing the amount of added zinc neces-sary to fulfill this requirement. Sesame meals contain phytic acid but differ from isolated soy protein in that they contain relatively large amounts of zinc. The avail-ability of zinc from sesame meals varied (Turk and Lease, 1962).

Sesame meals fell into three classes: (1) those from which zinc is avail-able to the chick, (2) those from which zinc is partly or not available and (3) those from which zinc is not only unavail-able but which have the capacity to bind added zinc and thus increase the chick's dietary zinc requirement.
