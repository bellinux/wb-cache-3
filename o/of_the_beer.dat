5|$|Nearby Sierra Nevada Brewing Company {{partnered with}} the monks of New Clairvaux {{to make a}} series of Belgian-style beers under the Ovila Abbey brand. In late 2010, the beer {{producer}} launched a website to tell about the making <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> product line {{and the story of}} the restoration of the stones. Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman said he had long been interested in making a line of Belgian beers, and the abbey's project provided a good opportunity. The first product, a Dubbel, was released in March 2011, followed in July by a Saison and in November by a Quadrupel. Sierra Nevada has dedicated a percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> sales to assist in funding the rebuilding project.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} shipment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> to the United States was in 1817. In 1827, {{the first official}} shipment of Guinness on the African continent arrived in Sierra Leone. The beer was renamed Foreign Extra Stout from around 1849 onwards.

5|$|After {{successful}} test marketing from 1974, John Smith's Bitter {{was distributed}} in the South of England from 1979 onwards, accompanied by an extensive marketing budget. As research by Courage indicated that Southern drinkers considered Yorkshire bitter to be superior, the beer was sold there under the name John Smith's Yorkshire Bitter. Sales <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> doubled in 1981 owing {{to the increase in}} free trade outlets in the South stocking the beer. By 1982 it was the highest selling Courage brand and the highest selling canned bitter in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{consumed}} {{out of a}} variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a pewter tankard, a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which beer {{is consumed}} can influence the perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E
5|$|In many societies, beer is {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} drink. Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); visiting a series of pubs in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating beer. Drinking games, such as beer pong, are also popular. A relatively new profession is that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.|$|E

5|$|The Sounders {{hosted the}} San Jose Earthquakes at Starfire on June 24 and both teams {{scored in the}} first half. The Earthquakes second-string goalie, David Bingham, kept his team in the match by {{stopping}} three shots from Chad Barrett late in the second half. Neither team scored in extra time and the game went to a shoot-out. After the shoot-out ended 4–1, goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann celebrated by drinking a beer in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> garden and the home fans.|$|E
5|$|The starch {{source in}} a beer {{provides}} the fermentable material {{and is a}} key determinant of the strength and flavour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer.</b> The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E
40|$|Medication {{review is}} an {{essential}} component of comprehensive falls assessment. A medication review by pharmacists can assist to identify and notify prescribers of medications that require adjustment or discontinuation. <b>Beers</b> Criteria and <b>the</b> Medication Assessment Index (MAI) are explicit and implicit inappropriate prescribing (IP) tools, respectively. While <b>the</b> <b>Beers</b> Criteria has been applied to falls prevention, the MAI has not. Developing alternative falls prevention tools has been spurned by both the desire to overcome limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beers</b> Criteria, coupled with the need for implicit criteria which includes consideration for patient –specific clinical judgement. A literature search and review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beers</b> Criteria and MAI tools revealed advantages and disadvantages of each.

5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer.</b> In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E

5|$|The Stoßtrupp was {{abolished}} {{after the}} failed 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, {{an attempt by}} the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organize a new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando (Protection Command). It was tasked with providing personal protection for Hitler at NSDAP functions and events. That same year, the Schutzkommando was expanded to a national organization and renamed successively the Sturmstaffel (Storm Squadron), and finally the Schutzstaffel (Protection Squad; SS). Officially, the SS marked its foundation on 9 November 1925 (the second anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beer</b> Hall Putsch). The new SS was to provide protection for NSDAP leaders throughout Germany. Hitler's personal SS protection unit was later enlarged to include combat units.|$|E
5|$|In 1923–24, Himmler, while {{searching for}} a world view, came to abandon Catholicism {{and focused on the}} occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, {{reinforced}} by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the NSDAP appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of Führer worship. However, as he learned more about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party, and he later admired and even worshipped him. To consolidate and advance his own position in the NSDAP, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beer</b> Hall Putsch. From mid-1924 he worked under Gregor Strasser as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature. Placed in charge of the party office in Lower Bavaria by Strasser from late 1924, he was responsible for integrating the area's membership with the NSDAP under Hitler when the party was re-founded in February 1925.|$|E
5|$|The {{thrust of}} Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty {{in order to}} cover up the bribery case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal ligation, thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.|$|E
