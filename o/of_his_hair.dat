5|$|Ellis {{started the}} 1967 season with Columbus. He {{believed}} {{that he was not}} on the major league club because the Pirates already had a number of African American players; he felt that the team did not want to alienate white fans. Ellis was sent down to the Macon Peaches of the Southern League, which Ellis believed was due to the length <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair.</b> Ellis said that he was promoted back to Columbus after shaving his head. He had a 2–0 win-loss record with Macon and a 5–7 record with Columbus.|$|E

5|$|Promotional {{activities}} halted after G-Dragon {{tested positive}} for marijuana. Though a urine test back in August came back negative, a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> in October. Since {{it was his first}} recorded offence with a minuscule amount of the drug, it resulted in an indictment and he was not charged. He later claimed to have accepted an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, threw it away. Because he was not charged, he did not lose any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E
5|$|Shishupala, {{the king}} of Chedi and Rukmi are the kings under emperor Jarasandha. All three have deep hatred towards Krishna. Jarasandha proposes that Rukmi should marry his sister, Rukmini, to Shishupala, unaware that she {{is in love with}} Krishna. Narada acts as the {{mediator}} between the love couple. After a brief courtship, Rukmini elopes with Krishna. Rukmi tries to stop Krishna and challenges him to a fight. Krishna easily defeats him, and grants his wife - Rukmini's wish by keeping him alive. He however shaves half <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> to add insult to the injury.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E

5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair,</b> eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E
5|$|Vasil Levski's hanging is {{observed}} annually across Bulgaria on 19 February instead of 18 February, {{due to the}} erroneous calculation of 19th-century Julian calendar dates after Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1916. Although the location of Levski's grave has not been determined, some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> is on exhibit at the National Museum of Military History. After Levski gave up monkhood in 1863, he shaved his hair, which his mother and later his sister Yana preserved. Levski's personal items—such as his silver Christian cross, his copper water vessel, his Gasser revolver, made in Austria–Hungary in 1869, and the shackles from his imprisonment in Sofia—are also exhibited in the military history museum, while Levski's sabre {{can be seen in}} the Lovech regional museum.|$|E
5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as 'Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn', the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the first floor were officially opened by Lord Coleridge a descendant of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 2011 the National Trust undertook a major re-presentation project that also saw the opening of additional rooms. The oldest parts of the cottage are now presented as the Coleridge family might have known them, with the original inglenook fireplace in the parlour uncovered and working once more. The garden was opened to visitors for the first time, complete with an 18th-century vegetable plot, a wildflower area and representations of Coleridge's animals. It is possible to listen to poetry at audio posts around the garden and the well is operational once more and {{can be seen in the}} small courtyard behind the cottage. A number of mementos of Coleridge are on display including his inkstand, locks <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> and correspondence in his handwriting.|$|E

25|$|There is {{dispute about}} the cause of Beethoven's death: {{alcoholic}} cirrhosis, syphilis, infectious hepatitis, lead poisoning, sarcoidosis and Whipple's disease have all been proposed. Friends and visitors before and after his death clipped locks <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair,</b> {{some of which have}} been preserved and subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1862 exhumation. Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that Beethoven was accidentally poisoned to death by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.|$|E

They made golden caskets for the relics and took them to their own city (Balkh) where they enshrined them in a stupa by the city gate. See Nava Vihara.|$|R
25|$|Durvasa {{felt that}} Ambarisha had {{violated}} the respect {{due to a}} guest by breaking his fast before the guest had taken his meal and in his rage created a demon to kill Ambarisha, out of a strand <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair.</b> Narayana's Sudarshana Chakra intervened, destroyed the demon and started chasing Durvasa himself. Durvasa went to Brahma and Shiva for protection. Both pleaded their inability to save him. Durvasa next went to Narayana himself, {{who said that he}} could do nothing as he was bound by the blemishless devotion of Ambarisha and suggested that the sage seek the king's pardon. Durvasa took this advice and returned to Ambarisha, who prayed to Vishnu to recall the Sudarshana and save the sage, whereby the discus ceased to afflict him.|$|E
25|$|Semar Gugat (Indonesian for Semar Accuses) is a stage play {{written by}} Nano Riantiarno for his troupe Teater Koma. It follows the {{traditional}} wayang character Semar as he attempts— and fails— to take revenge against Arjuna and Srikandi for humiliating him by cutting off a lock <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> {{while they are}} {{under the influence of}} the demon queen Durga. Completed in mid-1995, the play consists of 559lines of dialogue spread through 30scenes. Semar Gugat has been read as a critique of the New Order government under president Suharto. It was first performed on 25November 1995 after the government withheld permission for several months. After Teater Koma gave an initial two-week run, it was adapted by various amateur groups. In 1998 Riantiarno won a S.E.A. Write Award for the work.|$|E

From first hand accounts of his physical appearance Umar is said to be vigorous, robust and a very tall man, in markets he would tower above the people. The front part of his head was bald, always A'sara Yusran (working with two hands), both his eyes were black, with yellow skin, however, ibn Sa'ad in his book stated that he never knew that 'Umar had yellow skin, except if the people took into criterion a certain part of his life where his color changed because he always ate oil at that part of his life. Others say he had reddish-white skin. His teeth were ashnabul asnan (very white shining). He would always color his beard and take care <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> using a type of plant.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get work as an actor, Reuss began an {{elaborate}} subterfuge. He retreated to a cabin he owned up in the mountains. There he lived and studied the mannerisms of the local Tyrolian farmers, while letting his hair and beard grow. He practiced at adapting their ways of speech and movement. After a year, he {{showed up in the}} created persona of Kaspar Brandhofer, a Tyrolian peasant, having grown a full beard. To further hide his identity, he dyed all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair,</b> head and body, by bathing every ten days in diluted hydrogen. He also had obtained papers from one of the peasants he had been observing in the mountains. Armed with this new Christian identity, he began presenting himself as a naturally taught actor. Having worked with director Max Reinhardt years before, Reuss was fearful that the director would recognize him, but Reinhardt did not. In fact, his ability so impressed the director, that Reinhardt recommended him to Ernst Lothar, in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} and the semi-main event both {{stemmed from the}} same storyline, pitting the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno (Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero) against the tecnico team of Shocker and Vampiro Canadiense. The storyline started not long after Guerrero and Bucanero {{defeated}} Negro Casas and El Hijo del Santo to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship in mid-2002 and originally centered around Los Guerreros championship, with Shocker and Vampiro chasing the title. The two teams met {{in one of the}} feature matches at the CMLL 69th Anniversary Show where Los Guerreros successfully defended the tag team title. Following the title defense the storyline split into two, with Último Guerrero focusing on Shocker, demanding a match for Shocker's CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship. In the other storyline the feud between Bucanero and Vampiro focused more on a Lucha de Apuestas or bet match challenge. Since neither held a singles championship they would both bet their hair against the outcome of the match and be shaved bald in case they lost. The Luchas de Apuestas match is the most prestigious match type in Lucha Libre, which is why it was chosen over the championship match to main event the show. In the semi-main event Último Guerrero won the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship after forcing Shocker to submit to his own trademark submission hold La Reienera (a Modified spinning backbreaker rack). In the main event Vampiro gained a measure of revenge for his tag team partner as he defeated Rey Bucanero, pinning him to win the third and deciding fall. Following the match Bucanero's long hair was cut off and then the rest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> was shaved off as per the Lucha Libre traditions.|$|E
