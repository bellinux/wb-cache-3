5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>season.</b> Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} the Western Conference Final in the 2006 playoffs, the newly renamed Anaheim Ducks entered the 2006–07 season with high expectations; the team brought Selänne {{back with a}} one-year, $3.75 million contract.

On December 31, he played his 1,000th NHL game.

It was the same day he spoke with a friend in Finland with terminal cancer and whom asked to be sent the game puck if Selänne had a three-goal game. Finally, he scored his 301st goal as a Duck on February 18, 2007, to break Paul Kariya's franchise record.|$|E

50|$|On May 21, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{released}} its forecast for tropical activity across the Central Pacific during 2013.

5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, {{the variety of}} pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances over the course <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>season,</b> potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E

5|$|It {{continued}} to organize {{throughout the day}} on June21, developing banding features and increased convection. Several hours after being classified a depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Andres. Upon being named, Andres marked latest date that the first named storm <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>season</b> developed since 1969 when Tropical Storm Ava developed on July1 of that year. By the morning of June22, very deep thunderstorm activity existed near the center, and the overall convective pattern had become more symmetric in nature. Favorable conditions, warm sea surface temperatures, allowed Andres to gradually intensify as it tracked near the Mexican coastline. However, strong wind shear, a factor that generally weakens tropical cyclones, {{had little effect on}} the developing storm.|$|E
