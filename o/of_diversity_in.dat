5|$|Many American {{cities and}} towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles. Along with musical centers such as Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Nashville, Austin, and Los Angeles, many smaller cities such as Asbury Park, New Jersey have produced distinctive styles of music. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music, and the bluegrass and old time music of the Southeastern states are a few examples <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> American music. Modern day music is heavily influenced by previous and present African-American music genres.|$|E
5|$|The {{species are}} native to meadows and woods in {{southern}} Europe and North Africa with a center <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely, and were {{introduced into the}} Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes. Some Narcissus species have become extinct, while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism.|$|E
5|$|During the game's development, {{the team}} lacked artists. The art {{director}} at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes {{could not make}} enough new textures because of the amount <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> characters and maps. In order to supplement the skin and texture production, Epic turned to contract artist Steve Garofalo. The game's level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy, {{but no one had}} time to fix it. The game engine had an object-oriented design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to be more like Java. The modularity of the object-oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Canadian horse and the Newfoundland pony {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. The Canadian horse showed high haplotype diversity, sharing haplotypes with all Canadian populations, as well as draft breeds, Nordic pony breeds and British mountain and moorland pony breeds also tested in the study. The Canadian horse had been shown to be related to draft horse breeds, including the Percheron, Belgian and Clydesdale, in previous microsatellite loci studies. This relationship was supported by findings in the 2012 study. The high levels <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> the Canadian horse supported the conclusions of a 1998 study, which determined that the small population size and historical genetic bottlenecks had not resulted in a significant loss of genetic variation. The 1998 paper also stated that the Canadian horse did not show inbreeding any more significant than other, more popular, breeds.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to a rapid growth of minorities population in the United States, healthcare organizations have responded by providing new services and undergoing health reforms in terms <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> leadership and workforce. Despite improvements and progress seen in some areas, minorities are still underrepresented within both healthcare leadership and workforce. To improve the weak minorities representation in leadership and workforce, an organization must acknowledge the importance of cultures, be sensitive to cultural differences, and establish strategic plans to incorporate cultural diversity.|$|E

This diversity among immigrants can be seen in language use, as the majority of second-generation immigrants are bilingual, with 2/3 speaking a language other than English in their homes. In addition, differing ethnicity and racial groups have experiences that are unique to their group. Hispanics, Asian Americans, and African Americans are three of the major groups that make up the population of second-generation immigrants in the United States.|$|E

25|$|On 24 July 1773, Porto Alegre {{became the}} capital city of the province, when the {{administration}} of Manuel Sepúlveda, who used the fictitious name or pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo, to hide their identity, officially started. In 1824, immigrants {{from all over the world}} started arriving, especially German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Jewish, and Lebanese. This mosaic <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> appearance, ethnic origin, religions and languages is what makes Porto Alegre, nowadays with nearly 1.5 million inhabitants, a cosmopolitan and multicultural city.

40|$|The issue <b>of</b> {{maintaining}} linguistic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> {{the world}} today and ensuring its sustainability in the fu-ture has become a near obsession for many professional linguists and organisations. Why is this ne-cessary? And what efforts are being made in this direction? This paper discusses trends <b>in</b> linguistic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> {{the world today}} {{in relation to the}} fear Krauss (1992) and others express about the current trends of language use in the world today? The paper argues that the current efforts by such bodies as the UNESCO in addressing the situation are paradoxical. The essay does this by discussing the practicalities (factors that may be promoting or threatening) <b>of</b> linguistic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> Ghana today and in the future. The paper provides some facts on linguistic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> Ghana, and discusses some ex-ternal and internal factors that affect linguistic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> Ghana. The paper then links these facts and trends to the facts and patterns <b>of</b> linguistic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> the world today, and submits that the patterns <b>of</b> linguistic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> Ghana today, reflect the patterns <b>of</b> linguistic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> many parts <b>of</b> the world today and argues that the current efforts being made fall short of achieving the ultimate aim due to their inherent paradoxical nature...|$|R

25|$|Jejungwon (later Severance Hospital) was {{primarily}} a hospital, but it also performed medical education as an attachment. The hospital admitted its first class of 16 medical students selected through examinations in 1886, one year after its establishment. By 1899, Jejungwon Medical School was independently recognized. Following the increase <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> missionary denominations in Korea, collaboration began to form. Jejungwon began to receive medical staff, school faculty, and financial support from the Union Council of Korean Missionaries (한국연합선교협의회; 韓國聯合宣敎協議會) in 1912. Accordingly, the medical school was renamed as Severance Union Medical College in 1913.|$|E

Given the range <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious, in particular Hindu, and cultural choices and traditions. Also, Middle Eastern and Central Asian influences have occurred on North Indian cuisine from the years of Mughal rule. Indian cuisine is still evolving, {{as a result of the}} nation's cultural interactions with other societies.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequencing}} of individual genomes further unveiled levels of genetic complexity {{that had not}} been appreciated before. Personal genomics helped reveal the significant level <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> the human genome attributed not only to SNPs but structural variations as well. However, the application of such knowledge to the treatment of disease and in the medical field is only in its very beginnings. Exome sequencing has become increasingly popular as a tool to aid in diagnosis of genetic disease because the exome contributes only 1% of the genomic sequence but accounts for roughly 85% of mutations that contribute significantly to disease.|$|E

25|$|Cocoa beans may be {{cultivated}} under shaded conditions, e.g. agroforestry. Agroforestry {{can reduce}} the pressure on existing protected forests for resources, such as firewood, and conserve biodiversity. Agroforests act as buffers to formally protected forests and biodiversity island refuges in an open, human-dominated landscape. Research of their shade-grown coffee counterparts has shown that greater canopy cover in plots is significantly associated to greater mammal species richness and abundance. The amount <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> tree species is fairly comparable between shade-grown cocoa plots and primary forests. Farmers can grow a variety of fruit-bearing shade trees to supplement their income to help cope with the volatile cocoa prices. Though cocoa has been adapted to grow under a dense rainforest canopy, agroforestry does not significantly further enhance cocoa productivity.|$|E
