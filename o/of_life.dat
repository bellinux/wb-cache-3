5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student stage <b>of</b> <b>life),</b> then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student stage <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> or after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts that those who have married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless of which stage <b>of</b> <b>life</b> he is in, and whether he has completed that stage.|$|E
