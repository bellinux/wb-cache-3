500|$|Flanders was {{an early}} and strong critic of fellow Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy’s [...] "misdirection <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>efforts</b> at {{fighting}} communism” and his role in “the loss of respect {{for us in the}} world at large.” He felt that rather than looking inward for communists within U.S. borders, the nation should look outward at the “alarming world-wide advance of Communist power” that would leave the United States and Canada as “the last remnants of the free world.” On March 9, 1954 he addressed Senator McCarthy on the Senate floor, expressing these concerns. (McCarthy had been advised of the speech, but was absent at the time.) Apart from a brief note of encouragement after this speech, Flanders was grateful that President Eisenhower stayed out of the McCarthy controversy. Members of President Eisenhower’s cabinet passed along the message that Flanders should “lay off.” ...|$|E
500|$|After the Liberal {{losses in}} the 1910 elections, ILP member and {{journalist}} Henry Brailsford helped organise a Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage, which gathered 54 MPs from various parties.

Thus the WSPU agreed to suspend its support for window-breaking and hunger strikes while it was being negotiated. When {{it became clear that the}} bill would not pass, Pankhurst declared: [...] "If the Bill, in spite <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>efforts,</b> is killed by the Government, then... I have to say there is an end to the truce." [...] When it was defeated, Pankhurst led a protest march of 300 women to Parliament Square on 18 November. They were met with aggressive police response, directed by Home Secretary Winston Churchill: officers punched the marchers, twisted arms, and pulled on women's breasts. Although Pankhurst was allowed to enter Parliament, Prime Minister Asquith refused to meet her. The incident became known as Black Friday.|$|E

40|$|Using linked employer-employee {{data for}} Britain we find job {{satisfaction}} and job anxiety are negatively correlated but higher wages are associated with higher {{job satisfaction and}} higher job anxiety. However, we observe a positive association between higher wages and non-pecuniary job satisfaction, which disappears with the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> measures. Thus high effort levels provide high levels of non-pecuniary job satisfaction and higher wages, in contrast to what compensating wage differentials predicts. On the other hand, the positive association between wages and pay satisfaction and the positive association between wages and job anxiety are both robust to the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> measures and rich job controls.
