5|$|Schirra began {{training}} for the mission in early July, logging 29hours in simulators as well as 31hours in the spacecraft itself. This included multiple systems tests and three simulated flights, culminating in a six-and-a-half-hour simulated flight on September 29, with the spacecraft and booster fully stacked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad.</b> Highlights of the training period included a visit from President John F. Kennedy on September 11.|$|E
5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft expected to return to his role in Mission Control. He would have been lead flight director on the first manned Apollo mission (later known as Apollo 1), which was scheduled to launch in early 1967. However, on January 27, 1967, the three crew members were killed in a fire during a countdown test <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad.</b> At the time of the fire, Kraft was in Mission Control, but under the circumstances there was little he could do. He was asked by Betty Grissom, the widow of astronaut Gus Grissom, {{to be one of the}} pallbearers at Grissom's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

Both transporters were delivered to the ALMA Operations Support Facility (OSF) in Chile on 15 February 2008.|$|R
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad.</b> The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of this {{had to do with the}} modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced pump failure and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at liftoff due to a failure of the sustainer turbopump. Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the sustainer inlet valve to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed flight-worthy. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of fine pitch Sn– 3. 8 Ag– 0. 7 Cu flip chip solder joints {{with three different}} pads, i. e., bare pads, pads with solder masks, and pads with microvia, on printed circuit boards (PCBs) was studied through thermal cycling. After assembly, (Au,Ni) Sn 4 intermetallics (IMCs) formed both in the bulk solder and at the interfaces due to <b>the</b> immersion-Au finish <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PCB side. The (Au,Ni) Sn 4 IMCs formed in <b>the</b> solder joints <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pads</b> with microvia were more abundant than those formed in <b>the</b> solder joints <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pads</b> without microvia. <b>The</b> results showed that <b>the</b> solder joints <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pads</b> with a microvia had poor reliability due to the insufficient solder volume {{and the formation of}} large amounts of (Au,Ni) Sn 4 IMCs. The main crack initiation position was the corner of solder joint at the chip side. For <b>the</b> <b>pads</b> with microvia, <b>the</b> main location of failure was at the (Au,Ni) Sn 4 /solder interface <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chip side, and for <b>the</b> solder joints <b>on</b> bare pads and pads with solder mask, the possible failure location was in the bulk solder...|$|R

25|$|Steve Harmison then bowled {{the next}} {{over from the}} Pavilion End, {{removing}} spinner Rafique for a duck on his second ball of the over as he was caught behind and then having Mortaza bowled as Mortaza missed the ball only to have it graze his pad and roll behind him to hit his leg stump. Bangladesh had lost three wickets for two runs {{in the space of}} nine balls, and Harmison nearly added another wicket to his tally as he hit Anwar Hossain Monir <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> in front. However, umpire Hariharan wasn't convinced it was going to hit the stumps, and Harmison was denied the hat-trick.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{dismissal}} of Martyn, Vaughan brought back Jones – realising that Australia were reluctant to hit runs and thus allowing Jones to get through his overs without causing as much damage as he did early on. In fact, he and Harmison {{were part of a}} remarkable streak – they served up 28 successive dot-balls to Symonds and Michael Clarke (who bowed under to the pressure and was hit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad,</b> out lbw for a 19-ball two). However, Michael Hussey – facing his first ball at 93 for 5 after 25 overs – took control of Jones, and when Harmison was taken off, Australia were let off the hook.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the vehicle}} is a Launch Table, with six Tail Service Masts (TSMs), two for each CBC. The Launch Table {{supports}} the vehicle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad,</b> and the TSMs provide further support and fueling functions for the CBCs. The vehicle is mounted to the Launch Table by a Launch Mate Unit (LMU), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle by bolts that sever at launch. Behind the Launch Table is a Fixed Pad Erector (FPE), which uses two long-stroke hydraulic pistons to raise the vehicle to the vertical position after being rolled to the pad from the Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF). Beneath the Launch Table is a flame duct, which deflects the rocket's exhaust away from the rocket or facilities.|$|E

Having failed in an attempt to sweep Warne, Jones was struck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad,</b> resulting in an unsuccessful appeal for LBW from the Australians. Jones, however, was too preoccupied waiting for the umpire's verdict to notice that his back foot was out of his batting crease. This fact did not escape an alert Ponting, however, who swooped in from silly point and underarmed the ball into the stumps. Jones was out for a duck – his second of the match.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses are {{typically}} {{inserted into the}} eye by placing them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may {{be placed on the}} sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes and then look towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.|$|E
25|$|Acceleration {{increased}} during S-IC flight {{for three}} reasons. One, increased acceleration increased the propellant pressure at the engines, increasing the flow rate somewhat. This {{was the least}} important factor, though this feedback effect often led to an undesirable thrust oscillation called pogo. Two, as it climbed into thinner air F-1 engine efficiency increased significantly, a property of all rockets. The combined thrust of five engines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> was about 7.5 million pounds, reaching nearly 9 million pounds at altitude. But the biggest contribution by far was the rocket's rapidly decreasing mass. The propellant in just the S-IC made up about three-quarters of Saturn V's entire launch mass, and it was furiously consumed at over 13 metric tonnes per second. Newton's second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration, or equivalently that acceleration is equal to force divided by mass, so as the mass decreased (and the force increased somewhat), acceleration rose. Including gravity, launch acceleration was only 1¼g, i.e., the astronauts felt 1¼g while the rocket accelerated vertically at ¼g. As the rocket rapidly lost mass, total acceleration including gravity increased to nearly 4g at T+135 seconds. At this point, the inboard (center) engine was shut down to prevent acceleration from increasing beyond 4g.|$|E

500|$|On January 25, 1967, the Apollo 1 crew began {{a series}} of {{countdown}} tests in the spacecraft <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> at Cape Kennedy. Although Shea had ordered his staff to direct North American to take action on the issue of flammable materials in the cabin, he had not supervised the issue directly, and little if any action had been taken. During pad testing, the spacecraft suffered a number of technical problems, including broken and static-filled communications. Wally Schirra, the backup commander for the mission, suggested to Shea that he should go through the countdown test in the spacecraft with the crew in order to experience first-hand the issues that they were facing. Although Shea seriously considered the idea, it proved to be unworkable because of the difficulties of hooking up a fourth communications loop for Shea. The hatch would have to be left open in order to run the extra wires out, and leaving the hatch open would make it impossible to run the emergency egress test that had been scheduled {{for the end of the}} day on the 27th. As Shea later told the press, joining the crew for the test [...] "would have been highly irregular".|$|E
