The evaluation work has also been carried out in an unorganized way by the Local Action Teams, hereinafter called ‘HACS’. There was hardly a precedent for cooperation; national networks did not play an important role. Self assessment has rarely been followed by correction steps. The upward approach was taken into account while selecting HACS and carrying out the program’s other stages, although {{in most parts of the}} region (for instance in Portugal and Greece) hidden possibilities were not fully put to account. The hitch in the upward approach might have been caused by the lack of downward support. It must be considered to be a negative fact that in consequence of the exclusion of the country towns, the maximum resident threshold (100, 000) by local action teams has prevented the establishment of contiguous LEADER area. Although deviation was permitted, the mentioned threshold has been criticized several times because it limits the implementation of sale initiatives in some well developed parts of the country. As for the effect on broadening the knowledge of cooperation and network building, there are numerous signs in some countries like Ireland, Finland and Austria, that the LEADER approach, forwarding the information to <b>other</b> <b>interested</b> <b>country</b> parties, facilitates integrated country development.

The authors carry out brief analysis for each type of national economic interests and find out how they are reflected in the national documents on socio-economic development and in international documents on economic cooperation with Russia’s participation. These interests in the national aspect are reflected in the Concept for long-term socio-economic development, and in the strategies and state programs for development of economic sectors. As for the international economic aspect, the authors consider Russia’s contracts with individual countries on trade and/or cooperation, the Agreement on the Eurasian Economic Union, the Declaration and agreements of the BRICS countries, the Program for Trade and Economic cooperation between the SCO countries, and international standards relating to socio-economic ratings and indexes. The analysis shows that the country requires the development of a unified conceptual project that would link strategic priorities of socio-economic development of the Russian Federation with changing geoeconomic conditions.

In May 1966, President Johnson said "This government {{is ready to}} work with <b>other</b> <b>interested</b> <b>countries</b> {{to see to it}} that smallpox is a thing of the past by 1975. " To begin to implement this pledge, the U. S. Public Health Service and the U. S. Agency for International Development in coordination with the World Health Organization formulated plans for a 19 -country program of smallpox eradication (and measles control) in West and Central Africa. In January of 1966, the Smallpox Eradication Program (SEP) was organized at NCDC from the old Smallpox Unit, Epidemiology Branch, to direct the 19 -country West African Program as well as to continue NCDC's responsibilities for preventing the re-establishment of smallpox in the USA. Concurrent with the development of the West African Program, seven intermittent reports under the title West African Smallpox Eradication/Measles Control Program Surveillance Report" have been issued since July 1966 providing demographic and morbidity and mortality data for the countries in the program. In addition, beginning in December 1966, four "Status Reports" were issued summarizing technical and logistical information for those immediately concerned with the West African Program. With this issue, SEP inaugurates several changes including a new cover, a new name, and most important, a new scope. While primary emphasis will continue to be on the surveillance of smallpox (and measles in West Africa), the Report will not be limited to surveillance information. An attempt will be made to include comments on the methodology and problems of smallpox eradication as reported from workers in the field in Africa and elsewhere. From time to time, information on anti-smallpox activities in the U. S. and other non-endemic countries will be included as will data on the occurrence of complications of vaccination. The Chief, Smallpox Eradication Program welcomes all comments, critical or otherwise, of the SEP Report and warmly invites submission of any information which may be of interest to those committed to smallpox eradication.

The main objective is to provide knowledge of pedestrians' quality needs and how these needs relate to structural and functional interventions, policy making and regulation to support walking conditions across the EU and <b>other</b> <b>interested</b> <b>countries.</b> This paper suggests {{a new way to}} satisfy children's rights to road safety. According to the UN ‘Children's Charter', its Convention on Children's Rights, their rights include road safety, and ratifying countries, are obliged to take all appropriate measures to implement the Convention. Child Consequence Analyses, i. e. preliminary tests of the consequences that an intended decision may have on children and young people and on their right to health, survival and to play etc. should be carried out to ensure that Children's Rights are fulfilled according to the convention. Free movement of children in the physical environment is important for their health as well as for their social, cognitive, and motor development. With increasing age, children's desire for free movement increases - and their territory gradually expands. However, this leads to increased exposure to risk: accidents to children as pedestrians are a function of mobility. The objektive is that children of preschool age should not encounter cars in their play areas or where they walk; though in some cases, vehicles travelling at a maximum of walking pace (or crawling speed) can be accepted. Children 7 to 12 should not cross streets at locations where vehicle speeds exceed 15 - 20 km/h. For older children, the same principles apply as for adult unprotected road users: they should not cross at locations where motor vehicle speeds exceed 30 km/h. This applies to routes to school, to leisure activities, and to friends. However, other measures than low speed is needed to accomplish systematic traffic planning for children. Approaches should have only one entry and one exit lane, and typically be separated by a refuge island where pedestrians cross. This is proposed to be systematically provided at bus stops, at schools, in residential areas, and other places where children can be expected to walk. For traffic quantity and composition, the aim is that traffic flows should be low, with few or no heavy vehicles. Layouts and sections should have clear visibility and clarity. Countermeasures are proposed to be used in a systematic way to achieve a safe and independent freedom of movement for children. Godkänd; 2010; 20101216 (chjo...|$|E

These documents, called Eurocodes, are systematically based on the recently developed Council Directive 89 / 106 /EEC “The Construction Product Directive” and its Interpretative Documents ID 1 and ID 2. Implementation of Eurocodes in each Member State is a demanding task as each country has its own long-term tradition in design and construction. The project should enable an effective implementation and application of the new methods for designing and verification of buildings and civil engineering works in all the partner countries (CZ, DE, ES, IT, NL) and in other Member States. The need to explain and effectively use the latest principles specified in Eurocodes standards is apparent from enterprises, undertakings and public national authorities involved in construction industry and also from university and colleges. Training materials, manuals and software programmes for education are urgently required. The submitted Guidebook 2 completes the set of two guidebooks intended to provide required manuals and software products for training, education and effective implementation of Eurocodes: Guidebook 1 : Load Effects on Buildings Guidebook 2 : Design of bridges. It is expected that the Guidebooks will address the following intents in further harmonization o f European construction industry: -	reliability improvement and unification {{of the process of}} design, -	development of a single market for product and for construction services, -	new opportunities for trained primary target groups in the labour market. The Guidebook 2 is focused on determining load effects on road, railway and pedestrian bridges and special civil structures. The following main topics are discussed in particular: -	basic requirements on bridges, -	basis of structural design, -	traffic loads for static and fatigue assessment, -	non traffic actions, -	accidental actions, -	combination rules for bridges, -	examples and case studies. Annex A to Guidebook 2 concerns new traffic trends in European traffic and their consequence on bridge design and on assessment of existing bridges, Annex B provides basic information about action and combination rules for special structures, like cranes, masts, towers and pipelines. The Guidebook 2 is written in a user-friendly way employing only basic mathematical tools, supplemented by examples and case studies developed in detail. A wide range of potential users of the Guidebooks and other training materials includes practising engineers, designers, technicians, experts of public authorities, young people – high school and university students.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} provide a concise survey of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 2 ̆ 7 s recent {{progress}} and major policy emphases and challenges. IntroductionThe Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) is the premier regional grouping in East Asia. It is widely credited for its substantial contribution to making Southeast Asia more stable and more prosperous than might otherwise have been the case. ASEAN has also {{played a major role}} as sponsor of wider regional cooperation groupings which provide forums for the Southeast Asian states, the major powers and <b>other</b> <b>interested</b> <b>countries</b> (including Australia) to discuss and coordinate approaches to regional issues. After a cautious beginning in 1967, ASEAN has attained a high international profile. However, pursuing cooperation among its very diverse members has never been an easy task. In the past decade it has struggled with the challenges of trying to both deepen cooperation and maintain unity, when its members remain highly sensitive about their own rights to national sovereignty. ASEAN’s desired image of congenial discussion and capacity for peaceful change has recently been dented by incidences of conflict between members, including a border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia and (in 2013) the re-emergence of discord (involving the Philippines and Malaysia) over the status of the Malaysian state of Sabah. ASEAN is also experiencing pressure in relation to the competing territorial claims in the South China Sea which involve four ASEAN members along with China and also the government in Taiwan. Tensions over South China Sea issues saw the ASEAN Foreign Ministers unable to issue an agreed communique after their meeting in Phnom Penh in July 2012, {{for the first time in}} forty-five years. ASEAN’s ongoing success thus cannot be taken for granted. ASEAN is a significant partner for Australia. Australia has had a multilateral relationship with ASEAN since 1974 and will mark the 40 th anniversary of this next year. Since the 1970 s, Australia-ASEAN cooperation has involved both efforts to enhance regional security, for example through the Cambodia peace process (1991 – 1993) and through development of the ASEAN Regional Forum (from 1994) and the East Asia Summit (from 2005), and regional economic cooperation (including the multilateral ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement adopted in 2009). This paper seeks {{to provide a}} concise survey of ASEAN’s recent progress and major policy emphases and challenges. Section I outlines ASEAN’s inauguration and development and the Association’s efforts to deepen its own cooperation by pursuing development of the ASEAN Economic Community, the ASEAN Political-Security Community and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. Section II discusses ASEAN’s efforts to develop wider cooperation in East Asia, in the context of the often tense and competitive relations among the major powers, particularly through the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN Plus Three process and the East Asia Summit. The paper in Section III considers recent challenges confronting ASEAN in pursuing cooperation and maintaining cohesion, including contested interests in the South China Sea, the political transition in Myanmar, ASEAN’s institutional capacities and the issue of potential membership for Timor-Leste. The paper concludes in Section IV with an assessment of Australia’s current major policy interests in relations with ASEAN, including in economic relations, political interactions, and cooperation in the development of wider regional dialogues...|$|E
