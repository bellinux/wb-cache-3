Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, {{in most of the}} towns and in many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>villages.</b>|$|E

He is pleased {{that one of his}} hunters brings him a male hornbill, shot at its nest hole while feeding the female.|$|E
5|$|Often {{armed with}} no more than shovels and spades, {{soldiers}} and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble. Other than this, rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>villages</b> damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors.|$|E
