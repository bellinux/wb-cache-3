40|$|Immersing {{players in}} {{believable}} and engaging virtual environments {{is a common}} goal for many interactive computer games. While PC-based audio <b>only</b> <b>games</b> set in virtual worlds have traditionally been developed for blind players, new technology will soon create a market for audio <b>only</b> <b>games</b> aimed at a mass audience. We propose a framework for authoring interactive narrative-based audio <b>only</b> adventure <b>games</b> set in 3 D virtual environments. Our work builds on several years of research into audio only applications for sight impaired users, augmented reality systems and human-computer interaction studies. We argue that a simple user interface enhances both immersion and entertainment value, making audio <b>only</b> <b>games</b> practical for mobile computing. Novel features of our system include real-time gameplay and support for multiple players. We also describe a software architecture for creating audio <b>only</b> <b>games,</b> the current implementation of which uses low-cost existing PC-based hardware and software...|$|R

However, Shigeru Miyamoto, a Nintendo executive, demanded the team to recreate the game as a Star Fox title for Nintendo's new console, the GameCube. Unlike previous Star Fox games, Star Fox Adventures focused on ground-based open world exploration. The game received positive reviews upon its launch in 2002. Star Fox Adventures was the <b>only</b> <b>game</b> developed by Rare for GameCube.|$|E
5|$|By {{now in his}} mid thirties, {{first team}} {{opportunities}} became scarce for Gibbs in 2000–01. He made only seven first team appearances, although Watford managed to avoid defeat in six of those. His final appearance, and <b>only</b> <b>game</b> under Gianluca Vialli, came on 24 April 2002. An 82nd-minute substitute, Gibbs was unable to prevent a late Gillingham goal, which secured them a 3–2 victory. Among Gillingham's players for Gibbs' professional swansong was Andy Hessenthaler, the man who became Watford captain after Gibbs' injury. Gibbs retired as Watford's second highest all-time appearance maker, although he started more matches than Luther Blissett, the man ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland posted an 11–1 {{record in}} 1951, losing their <b>only</b> <b>game</b> to the San Francisco 49ers {{in the season}} opener.

Graham fumbled {{the ball in the}} third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14–10. Three of his throws were intercepted, but he put up 280yards of passing and a touchdown.

40|$|AbstractThe {{widespread}} use of sophisticated mobile computing devices has {{set the stage for}} a renaissance in audio only entertainment. Traditional visual games are already used widely in cellular phones and similar devices. A significant limitation is the small display size. In contrast, audio <b>only</b> <b>games</b> on suitable mobile hardware need not degrade due to the smaller form factor. This makes audio <b>only</b> <b>games</b> an attractive alternative to visual games. We describe a framework for authoring interactive narrative-based audio <b>only</b> <b>games</b> set in 3 D virtual environments. Despite the novelty in audio only gaming, our approach builds on a foundation of several years of research into audio only applications for sight impaired users, augmented reality systems and human–computer interaction studies. In comparison to attempts to provide a realistic user interface, we argue a simple interface enhances both immersion and entertainment value, serendipitously making audio <b>only</b> <b>games</b> practical for mobile computing. Novel features of our system include real-time gameplay and multi-player support. We also describe our software architecture, the current implementation of which uses low-cost existing PC-based hardware and software. In addition, we describe our first game, Dragon’s Roar...|$|R
