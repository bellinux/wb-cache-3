5|$|That September, Conrad filmed a pilot episode for {{a program}} that would have focused on her {{professional}} endeavors, though MTV passed on the project after Conrad preferred not to feature her personal life. Patridge was commissioned the VH1 program Audrina in 2011, which focused <b>on</b> <b>herself</b> and her family. However, the series was canceled after its debut season due to underwhelming ratings.|$|E
5|$|Against this existential {{threat and}} fraying social order, the film also explores how {{individual}} characters bend or break existing rules for both selfish and selfless reasons. Dr. Hextall violates protocols by testing a potential vaccine <b>on</b> <b>herself,</b> Dr. Sussman continues experiments {{on a cell}} line despite orders to destroy his samples, Dr. Cheever notifies his fiancé {{to leave the city}} before a public quarantine is imposed, Sun Feng kidnaps Dr. Orantes to secure vaccine supplies for his village, Dr. Mears continues her containment work despite contracting the virus, and Krumwiede is paid to use his blog to peddle snake oil cures so as to drive demand and profit for investors in Alternative Medicine. Soderbergh repeatedly uses the cinematographic style of lingering and focusing on the items and objects which are touched by the infected and become vectors (fomites) to infect other people. These objects link characters together and reinforce the multi-narrative hyperlink cinema style which Soderbergh developed in Traffic (2000) and Syriana (2005), which he produced.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé dances seductively {{towards the}} men as scenes of Beyoncé wearing several outfits are seen, {{the first of}} which is a white evening gown as she grasps the chains of two chained hyenas. As the {{confrontation}} escalates, Beyoncé appears next to several flaming vehicles, and she undergoes another costume change. Returning to the main plot, the video shows Beyoncé in front {{of a small group of}} her female army, wearing a yellow ensemble and black heeled-boots. As the dancing commences, scenes of the two clashing armies are seen while Beyoncé writhes in sand. The females, now an even larger group, are shown dancing, using powerful and emphatic movements, in front of the male army with alternating costumes and several flags in the background. The video ends with the front line of females confronting the men face to face, raising their right arms and saluting to them as Beyoncé rips off the male general's badge, placing it <b>on</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E

5|$|Favret {{points out}} that Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is quite {{different}} from the despondent and plaintive love letters she actually sent to Imlay; the travel narrative much more closely resembles the personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding the people she encountered and the places she visited. While her letters to Imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively <b>on</b> <b>herself,</b> the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark offers social commentary and sympathizes with the victims of disaster and injustice. To Imlay, Wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts, but to the world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears. She ruminates on them and transforms them into the basis of a letter akin to the open political letter popular during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, using her personal experience as the foundation for a discussion of national political reform.|$|E
5|$|Samantha {{takes the}} {{children}} to the park, where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different skin colors. When they arrive home, Tabitha casts a spell <b>on</b> <b>herself</b> and Lisa so that Tabitha's skin has black spots and Lisa's skin has white spots. Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are witches. When Samantha finds the two girls polka-dotted, she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell, which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do. Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to remain so she and Lisa {{will continue to be}} sisters. Samantha tells the girls that differences in appearance won't prevent them from being sisters, and Tabitha then successfully reverses the spell just as Lisa's parents arrive to pick up Lisa.|$|E
5|$|Scully is {{warned by}} Hendershot, {{the woman from}} Zeus Genetics, that their unborn {{children}} are in danger. Scully meets Doggett and Skinner, having requested {{a leave of absence}} from the FBI. After Doggett leaves, Skinner tries to convince Scully to reveal her pregnancy to Doggett. Scully and Hendershot visit an army research hospital to have Hendershot's labor induced. Whilst Hendershot is being prepped for the operation, Scully asks to have an ultrasound performed <b>on</b> <b>herself.</b> The scan appears normal, but Scully realises the monitor they are watching is simply a video of another woman's scan. Realising they have been tricked, Scully finds Hendershot and the two sneak out of the exam room.|$|E

Fearing Niall's attentions are <b>on</b> <b>herself,</b> she goes to Scotland to stay with Craig. Niall follows her and holds her, Tom and Craig hostage. He tries to make her run away with him. Steph tricks Niall into believing she will run away with him but is later caught by Niall when she tries to call the police. Steph manages to get away and this results in Steph, Craig and Niall having a brawl {{on the edge of a}} cliff. When Steph reveals to Niall she will never love him he jumps off the cliff. Steph is left devastated by another loss in her life. When she returns home she finds that Niall has destroyed her wedding photos, the only piece of Max she had left. The sheer amount of trauma Steph has faced made her extremely shaken and she decided to leave for a break once more.|$|E
5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun <b>on</b> <b>herself.</b> According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned the gun <b>on</b> <b>herself.</b> But {{weeks after the}} murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands {{to make it look like}} a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne <b>on</b> <b>herself</b> and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E
5|$|Gui {{returned}} to China in 1999 {{and started a}} daughter company in Ningbo for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui {{was involved in a}} drink-driving incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police investigation report that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for not paying attention to traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the car had been speeding, so she risked her life to experiment <b>on</b> <b>herself</b> {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the driving speed had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed a civil lawsuit against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, he worked for a German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Karnaca, the player is tasked with rescuing Sokolov, who was kidnapped by the Crown Killer. Infiltrating Addermire Institute, where the Crown Killer is reportedly hiding out, the player discovers that the Crown Killer {{is in fact}} the alter ego of Karnaca's Chief Alchemist, Alexandria Hypatia (Jessica Straus). Hypatia accidentally created the Crown Killer persona when she tested an experimental serum <b>on</b> <b>herself,</b> and the Duke exploited her by using the Crown Killer to frame Emily. The player has the choice of either killing her or curing her condition. After investigating Addermire, it is made known that Sokolov was imprisoned by Kirin Jindosh (John Gegenhuber), the Duke's Grand Inventor and creator of the clockwork soldiers. The player enters Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion, kills him or performs an electrical lobotomy on him thus stripping him of his intellect, and frees Sokolov. Sokolov then directs the player to eliminate Breanna Ashworth (Melendy Britt), the curator of the Royal Conservatory and witch working for Delilah. The player enters the Royal Conservatory and discovers that after Delilah's defeat at the hands of Daud, who was responsible for assassinating Emily's mother, it was Ashworth who brought Delilah back from the Void. Ashworth is eliminated by way of a fatal attack or having her powers removed.|$|E
