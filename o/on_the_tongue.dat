5|$|Taste is {{generated}} from receptors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> and passed along the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem.

5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Epidermoids cysts are {{benign and}} rare lesions in oral cavity. It {{presents}} as a nodular lesion of sessile base, soft to palpation. In the oral cavity, it most happens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{floor of the}} mouth’s midline. Without treatment, these lesions can lead to dysphagia, dysphonia and dyspnea due to reach a large size. Objective: To report {{a case of a}} 12 -year-old boy presenting a lesion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue’s</b> ventral surface causing difficult to swallow. Case report: The patient was referred to the School of Dentistry of Paulista University, complaining about an asymptomatic nodule <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue’s</b> ventral surface, lasting for 10 months. Clinical examination showed the extensive fibrous mass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue’s</b> medium anterior ventral surface. Conclusion: With a clinical diagnosis of dermoid, epidermoid cyst, or lipoma, an excisional biopsy was performed. Histological examination was consistent to the diagnosis of epidermoid cyst. The patient was followed up and 2 years after surgery {{there was no sign of}} recurrence...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tongue</b> is an {{important}} accessory organ in the digestive system. <b>The</b> <b>tongue</b> is used for crushing food against the hard palate, during mastication and manipulation of food for softening prior to swallowing. <b>The</b> epithelium <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue’s</b> upper, or dorsal surface is keratinised. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> can grind against the hard palate without being itself damaged or irritated.|$|R
5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> of the subject, {{articulation}} {{may be affected}} depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal.|$|E

Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongue,</b> speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing.

25|$|In a June 9, 1876 {{engagement}} {{called the}} Skirmish at Tongue River Heights, during the Great Sioux War of 1876-77 General George Crook was camped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tongue</b> {{near the mouth}} of Prairie Dog Creek with about 950 soldiers, when Sioux fired into his camp from a bluff across the Tongue. A battalion under Captain Anson Mills responded, crossing the river and driving the Sioux force from the bluffs. As a consequence of this engagement, on June 11, General Crook moved his base camp to the junction of Big and Little Goose Creeks, some 7 miles south of the junction of Goose Creek and the Tongue River, where Sheridan, Wyoming is now located. On June 16, after being joined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tongue</b> by some 260 Crow and Shoshone scouts, Crook moved his forces north, across the Tongue, and on June 17, 1876 engaged a large Sioux and Cheyenne force at the Battle of the Rosebud. After the battle Crook returned south of the Tongue River to the base camp on Goose Creek, and he was still there on June 25, 1876 when General George A. Custer was defeated at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, some 65 miles to the north.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using bacteria indigenous to <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> dorsum of humans and rats as models. Streptococcus salivarius and S. sanguis averaged 22. 6 and 2. 8 %, respectively, of the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongues</b> of rats (Charles River strain). S. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongues</b> of rats, {{but they were not}} detected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tongues</b> of <b>the</b> humans examined. The ability of these organisms to adhere to <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> surface of <b>the</b> hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. S. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to <b>the</b> dorsal <b>tongue</b> surface of humans than did strains of S. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. S. sanguis also adhered to human <b>tongues</b> better than <b>the</b> serum-requiring diphtheroid. However, S. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to <b>the</b> <b>tongues</b> of rats. In an in vivo assay, human strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. Collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb {{with a high degree of}} specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their natural host tropisms. The selective adherence of S. salvarius and S. faecalis was similar to <b>the</b> <b>tongues</b> of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. Moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize <b>the</b> <b>tongues</b> of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. Direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. Indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anterior tip and lateral edges of <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. This localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of <b>the</b> <b>tongues</b> of rats...|$|R
