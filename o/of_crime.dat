In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

40|$|This paper {{purports to}} explore the nature <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> against {{humanity}} as a unique family <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> and how the concept <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> against humanity embodies the spirit of our time.

Doing so, it will first demonstrate how the concept <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> against humanity bears out the truth that the norm of humanity is a legal norm; humanity is a possible object of legal injury and a legitimate subject to which action is held accountable for. It then examines the four basic features <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> against humanity, indicating that a crime against humanity is a global crime that is motivated to injure humanity, policy-laden, and systematic. Finally, it further discusses the nature and precepts of the laws of humanity in virtue <b>of</b> which <b>crimes</b> against humanity are defined as so and so...|$|R
5000|$|Researchers {{who argue}} for causal effects {{argue that the}} {{discrepancy}} of violent acts seen on TV compared {{to that in the}} real world are huge. One study looked at the frequency <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> occurring in the real world compared with the frequency <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> occurring in the following reality-based TV programs: America's Most Wanted, Cops, Top Cops, FBI, The Untold Story and American Detective, (Oliver, 1994). The types <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> were divided into two categories, violent crimes and non-violent <b>crimes.</b> 87% <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> occurring in the real world are non-violent crimes, whereas only 13% <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> occurring on TV are considered non-violent crimes. [...] However, this discrepancy between media and real-life crimes may arguably dispute rather than support media effects theories. Some previous research linked boxing matches to homicides although other researchers consider such linkages to be reminiscent of ecological fallacies (e.g. Freedman, 2002). Much more research is required to actually establish any causal effects.|$|R
