5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Dunstan became {{well known for}} his {{campaign}} {{against the death penalty}} being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Playford aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as an unfair process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as {{a turning point in the}} LCL's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy.|$|E
5|$|Konnan {{is known}} to be outspoken, and in the last decade, he has been openly {{critical}} of promotions that he feels have mistreated either himself personally or the talent in general. He has been particularly outspoken against what he sees as racism against Latino wrestlers in United States promotions – he butted heads with TNA over treatment of himself and Ron Killings, and WWE over issues regarding Latino wrestlers Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio, but he has also come into conflict with AAA <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> alleged was non-payment of talent.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{relationship}} between Lie and Gerhardsen grew cooler. Gerhardsen was becoming far more amenable to the Soviets {{in part due to}} the influence of his wife, Werna, who was highly sympathetic to the Soviet Union (some even claiming she was a KGB informant). Gerhardsen had grown more and more frustrated at Lie's hard-line tactics against communists and perceived Soviet sympathisers, as well as his attempts to stifle foreign policy debate within the Central Committee. Lie on his part grew embittered <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> perceived was the Gerhardsen-couple protecting key leftists, such as Trygve Bull. According to Bull, Lie and Gerhardsen hardly spoke to each other after 1957.|$|E
50|$|Ansgar I., a Count of Lahnstein {{who lived}} in the 17th century. In 2012, Ansgar finds out about his {{existence}} and gets obsessed over his life story. Ansgar I. was a ruthless man, who {{was having an affair with}} a maid. She ended up pregnant and Ansgar I. threw her from the castle. She and the baby died, leaving Ansgar I. mourning <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> done.|$|R

50|$|A generic storybook Jack. The {{children}} and Mark often speculate <b>over</b> <b>what</b> tale <b>he</b> is from, sometimes reading through {{a book of}} nursery rhymes. It never clearly states which Jack he is.|$|R
5|$|Stephen {{was furious}} <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially {{refused to allow}} Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to consult with the Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen also cut his links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Raziel {{discovers the}} Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time Streamer once hid the Chronoplast, a magical time machine. Raziel {{traverses}} the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has learned, and Kain says his actions are justified {{due to his}} being subject to destiny, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to be when the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Seattle {{lost in the}} 2-legged 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League quarter finals by an {{aggregate}} score of 7–3 to Santos Laguna. The Sounders advanced to the finals of the Open Cup where they were defeated by Sporting Kansas City after penalty kicks. Schmid was furious <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as a controversial call that handed Kansas City the victory. The team finished the regular season with a 15–8–11 record {{to make the playoffs}} where they advanced past Real Salt Lake to reach the conference championship series against the Galaxy. The team played defensive and suffered a 3–0 blowout in the first leg. They won on the return leg but lost on aggregate.|$|E

5000|$|Bruce Johnston, {{who joined}} the band in 1965, said of the album in 2008: [...] "I think as an {{exercise}} in keeping him Brian occupied, it's interesting. (...) I talk to him {{every once in a}} while. But I'm never going to tell him that I'll take Pet Sounds <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing now. Fate is very uncool. Fate says to Brian and Mike, [...] "I'm going to mess with your head, and I'm {{not going to give you}} a Grammy for anything while you're hot. (...) Brian and Mike and the band deserved a Grammy in prime time, and it never happened." ...|$|R
60|$|Undoubtedly {{the man had}} {{carefully}} thought <b>over</b> beforehand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> intended to say, and yet he spoke earnestly, for <b>he</b> really meant <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said, and Dr. Ashleigh, a shrewd observer of men, saw that he did so, and his face rather softened in its expression. Robert Gregory observed the change, and went on.|$|R
5|$|Once he {{was back}} in Egypt, Hargest was {{critical}} of Freyberg's conduct of the fighting on Crete in a meeting with General Archibald Wavell, commander of the Allied forces in the Middle East. He expressed similar views in a meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, who was in Egypt at the time on a visit to the New Zealand forces. He also voiced concern <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered to be a lack of consultation by Freyberg with his senior commanders. He was able to resolve his differences with Freyberg and in later correspondence with Fraser expressed his satisfaction with the way Freyberg dealt with his subordinates. Hargest's own performance on Crete escaped official scrutiny and he was awarded a bar to his DSO. He was also awarded the Greek War Cross for his services in the military campaigns in Greece and Crete.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the death}} of Gaveston varied considerably. Edward was furious and deeply upset <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as the murder of Gaveston; he made {{provisions}} for Gaveston's family, and intended to take revenge on the barons involved. The earls of Pembroke and Surrey were embarrassed and angry about Warwick's actions, and shifted their support to Edward in the aftermath. To Lancaster and his core of supporters, the execution had been both legal and necessary to preserve the stability of the kingdom. Civil war again appeared likely, but in December, the Earl of Pembroke negotiated a potential peace treaty between the two sides, which would pardon the opposition barons for the killing of Gaveston, in exchange for their support for a fresh campaign in Scotland. Lancaster and Warwick, however, did not give the treaty their immediate approval, and further negotiations continued through most of 1313.|$|E
25|$|William Dunbar, who was {{reporting}} then for Russia Today from Georgia, {{said he had}} not been on air since he mentioned Russian bombing of targets inside Georgia on 9 August 2008, and had to resign <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> claimed was biased coverage by the outlet.|$|E
50|$|At the showcase, Victor sabotages Bev's {{performance}} of ("Make You Believe") by destroying her iPhone, on which is Katie's recorded singing voice. After threatening to drown Victor {{in the kitchen}} sink for <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> just done, Gail forces Katie to sing live backstage. Luke trips <b>over</b> <b>what's</b> happening; <b>he</b> realizes at last that Bev is a fake, and that beautiful voice is actually Katie's.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Pete McCloskey gave {{a speech}} at a conference of the Institute for Historical Review, which publishes Holocaust denial material. When McCloskey ran in the 2006 Republican Party primary for Congress, which he would lose, there was a public {{controversy}} <b>over</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said about the Holocaust at the event.|$|R
50|$|Derk Dorf is {{the main}} {{character}} and the voice-over. He is playing a game of golf when, apparently, a voice <b>over</b> commands <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does. For example, the voice over said for Dorf to keep his left elbow in, and he did and sliced it just as the voice-over said. Apparently Dorf re-enacts whatever the Golf bible commandments are.|$|R
25|$|During {{the last}} decades of his life, Erdős {{received}} at least fifteen honorary doctorates. He {{became a member of}} the scientific academies of eight countries, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the UK Royal Society. Shortly before his death, he renounced his honorary degree from the University of Waterloo <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered to be unfair treatment of colleague Adrian Bondy.|$|E
25|$|Norton {{is still}} {{concerned}} <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw days earlier when out with Hastings and Cole. Hastings advises Norton {{to confide in}} Poirot.

The next morning, Norton is found dead in his locked room with a bullet-hole in the centre of his forehead, the key in his dressing-gown pocket and a pistol nearby.|$|E
25|$|The {{two teams}} {{met in the}} playoffs {{for the first time in}} the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals, which is best remembered for a mock {{surrender}} by then-Canucks coach Roger Neilson <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> deemed questionable officiating in Game 2, which began the Towel Power tradition in Vancouver and elsewhere in sports. Vancouver prevailed in the series four games to one, as part of their 1982 Cinderella Stanley Cup run. The Blackhawks swept the Canucks in the 1995 Western Conference Semifinals.|$|E

5000|$|The movie {{opens with}} Cheech and Chong driving a limo through the desert. Chong, who {{has decided to}} stop doing drugs for a while, is talking about rock and roll, and Cheech is falling asleep, but Cheech is narrating <b>over</b> <b>what's</b> happening. <b>He</b> says that [...] "things are tough all over" [...] and that he's going to tell their story.|$|R

25|$|The {{brothers}} {{remained with}} Tan's through early 1940, directing the dramas Sorga Ka Toedjoe (Seventh Heaven) Siti Akbari, and Roekihati. However, in late 1940 Joshua, upset <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{perceived as an}} unfair division of the profits, left Tan's and worked on Kris Mataram (Kris of Mataram) for the rival studio Oriental Film. The film, a love story between a noblewoman and commoner, {{proved to be the}} Wongs' last production for eight years, in part owing to the Japanese invasion which led to almost all studios being closed.|$|E
25|$|Dick and Nicole's {{marriage}} {{breaks down}} when he becomes increasingly alcoholic and pines for Rosemary, {{who is now}} a successful Hollywood star. Nicole is becoming increasingly aware of her independence. She distances herself from Dick when his confidence and friendliness turns into sarcasm and rudeness towards everyone. His constant unhappiness <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had been and what he could have been fuels his alcoholism and Dick becomes increasingly embarrassing in social and familial situations. Nicole enters into an affair with Tommy Barban. Nicole divorces Dick and marries Barban.|$|E
25|$|In week 11, Mebo lawyer Dieter Neupert {{filed an}} {{official}} criminal complaint against the Crown <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> alleged was a 'forged fragment of MST-13 timer'. Tony Gauci of Mary's House, Sliema in Malta, {{testified that he}} had sold a number of items of clothing {{to one of the}} defendants, Megrahi. Wilfred Borg, Ground Operations Manager at Malta's Luqa airport, was questioned about Luqa's baggage handling procedures. A Mr Ferrugia confirmed that he had been a passenger on Air Malta flight KM 180 to Frankfurt on 21 December 1988.|$|E
6000|$|... "Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde," [...] was the stolid reply. The officer wrote {{until he}} had finished, read <b>over</b> to himself <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had written, sanded it, {{and handed it to}} Defarge, with the words [...] "In secret." ...|$|R
50|$|Today Bercot is a {{lecturer}} and author who emphasizes {{the simplicity of}} Biblical doctrine and early (ante-Nicene) Christian teaching <b>over</b> against <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would call the heavy and complex body of theological understandings that have built up over the centuries in churches and in academia and {{that have come to}} be thought of as orthodoxy. He is particularly notable for his deeply nonresistant understanding of Jesus's and New Testament teaching.|$|R
5000|$|Dennis Pitt is a {{disturbed}} {{young man}} on parole from {{a mental institution}} who becomes attracted to teenager Sue Ann Stepenek. He tells her {{that he is a}} secret agent, and takes her along on a series of [...] "missions" [...] that eventually end in murder. While Dennis is wracked with guilt <b>over</b> both <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has allowed to happen, Sue Ann is excited by the [...] "adventure" [...] and entreats Dennis to run away with her to Mexico. First, however, they {{have to get rid of}} her disapproving mother.|$|R
25|$|Ted {{carries a}} war injury that causes him ongoing {{physical}} and mental pain. While he cannot speak {{of his time in}} the Cavalry, Rose shows Albert his father's medals from the Second Boer War that he earned for bravery under fire. She gives Albert his father's regimental pennant, telling Albert that his father felt shame <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did during the war, and that he had thrown the flag and medals away, though Rose saved and kept them hidden. Albert does not understand why Ted would be ashamed of having fought in a war.|$|E
25|$|After {{candidates}} {{have been through}} their interviews, and Lord Sugar has heard feedback from the interviewers, he conducts a boardroom session to discuss with the candidates <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has learnt about them, as well as reviewing their performance on the tasks they undertook. Eventually after discussions, he will determine who he feels has potential {{to move on to}} the Final, with his decision usually resulting in three candidates being fired at this stage of the competition; there has only been one instance in the show's history where Lord Sugar fired just one candidate, as the feedback from the interviewers during the third series' competition made it difficult to fire more than one. For Series 7 & 8, where the Interviews was the final task, his decision determined who won the competition.|$|E
25|$|On value, Petty {{continued}} the debate begun by Aristotle, and chose {{to develop an}} input-based theory of value: all things ought to be valued by two natural Denominations, which is Land and Labour (p.44). Both of these would be prime sources of taxable income. Like Richard Cantillon after him, he sought to devise some equation or par between the 'mother and father' of output, land and labour, and to express value accordingly. He still included general productivity, one's 'art and industry'. He applied his theory of value to rent. The natural rent of a land was the excess of what a labourer produces on it in a year <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> ate himself and traded for necessities. It was therefore the profit above the various costs related to the factors involved in production.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 {{the company}} debuted a feature {{especially}} for Christmas Eve; callers can hear recorded messages from Santa Claus.

In 2009 they added {{a service that}} allows you to receive messages a week early from Santa explaining <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing to prepare for Christmas.|$|R
60|$|Terence {{had already}} thought <b>over</b> <b>what</b> course <b>he</b> had best take, {{should he be}} offered freedom on parole, and had {{resolved}} to accept it. The probabilities of making his escape were extremely small. There would be no chance whatever of rejoining the army; and a passage, alone, across the all-but-impassable mountains, {{was not to be}} thought of. Therefore he decided that, at any rate for the present, he would give his promise not to attempt to escape.|$|R
2500|$|From {{the outset}} Romney sought to show {{himself as the}} state's first 'CEO governor'. [...] His choices for the {{executive}} cabinet included well-known figures such as Democrat Robert Pozen, former vice chairman of Fidelity Investments, and Douglas Foy, who had {{served as president of}} the Conservation Law Foundation. [...] They and other cabinet members and advisors were picked more on managerial abilities rather than on party affiliation. Romney gave them broad authority <b>over</b> new <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called [...] "super-secretariats".|$|R
