The {{mechanism of}} <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> electrification in transformers could be understood from {{the effect of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>flow’s</b> movement and the electromotive action of AC electric field. The electric polarity of <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> and the insulating layer were mainly depended on the state of charged cations and anions in oil, while the surface characteristics of solid materials only played a supporting adsorption role...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present {{the results of an}} <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> {{investigation}} on an airbreathing missile model. This <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> study examined the flow around the model, which can be configured with both axisymmetric and two-dimensional inlets. Flow visualization analyses were conducted for both types of geometries by examining the surface flow patterns made visible by the <b>oil</b> <b>flows</b> for Mach numbers of 2. 5 and 3. 95. The analysis has shown the extent of flow spillage around the inlet which has helped explain the force and moment data collected during previous testing of the model. The <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> data has also been used to develop guidelines for modeling the location of the crossflow separation line along inlet fairings. Finally, the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> analysis has been used to identify unique features of the boattail flow. These boattail flow characteristics have been correlated with previous <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> analysis of noncircular body models. This paper demonstrates the use of this type of <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> analysis in developing missile flow field analysis and aerodynamic predictions ranging from impact angle methods through Navier-Stokes methods...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} already {{considered}} starved lubrication. However, {{there have been}} no reports on the oil film thicknesses under steady starved EHL (elastohydrodynamic lubrication), where the ultra-low volume of oil supplied per unit time is uniform. The present study examined the relationship between the supplied <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate and <b>oil</b> film thickness under steady starved lubrication. A ball-on-disk testing machine was used in experiments to measure the oil film thickness by means of optical interferometry. A microsyringe pump was used to accurately control the supplied <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate. The supplied <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate was kept constant, and the minimum oil film thickness was measured for 1 h after the start of the tests to determine the relationship between the supplied <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate and <b>oil</b> film thickness...|$|R
30|$|Affecting factor can be {{classified}} into two types according to its desirability on the assessing indicator. The factor resulting in favour for the indicator (i.e. promoting the indicator) {{is defined as the}} desirable factor. On the other hand, the factor resulting in unfavour for the indicator (i.e. eradicating the indicator) is defined as the undesirable factor. According to the example, the higher the relative permeability of oil phase (kro), the higher the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> (qo). Thus, the relative permeability of oil phase (kro) is defined as a desirable factor to the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> (qo). Besides, the higher the oil viscosity (μo), the lower the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> (qo). Then, the oil viscosity (μo) is defined as an undesirable factor to the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> (qo).|$|R

We can state that flow rate is directly proportional to the velocity of the saturation front. The well <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate is constant for incompressible case before the gas breaks through. Subsequently, the well <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate drops after breakthrough, as the well produces both oil and gas.|$|R

40|$|Oil {{enters a}} {{horizontal}} rotating tube through a radially-attached duct at one end. The tube {{with the other}} end closed is attached with radial twin exit branches permitting oil to exit into open air. Air begins to enter {{through one of the}} two branches into the tube when its rotational speed reaches certain critical values. An experimental study is performed to investigate this air-oil two-phase flow behavior. Both the tube and the branches are transparent to allow illumination and flow visualization during spin-up and spin-down processes. The branch-totube diameter ratio, rotational speed, and <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate are varied. Changes in <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rates are measured as a function of rotational speed. A comparison is made between cases of a varying total <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate due to rotation effects and a constant one under control. It is disclosed that cavitation in <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> is induced by air entering the branches opposite to the ejecting <b>oil</b> <b>flow.</b> Subsequently air bubbles progress in the tube. The origin of this intrusion depends on the hydraulic head loss of the piping system. This study can be applied to oil lubrication analysis of rotating machinery, such as automotive transmission lines...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{concerns}} modelling {{and control}} of a novel turbocharged burner unit developed for small-scale industrial and marine boilers. The burner consists of a gas turbine mounted on a furnace. The burner has two inputs; <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> to the gas generator (gas turbine combustion chamber) and <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> to the furnace, and two outputs; power and oxygen percentage in the exhaust gas. The control objective of the burner unit is to deliver the requested power set by e. g. an outer pressure loop while keeping a clean combustion and optimising efficiency. A first principle model is derived and validated against preliminary test data. The preliminary test shows that the model is capable of capturing the important dynamics of the burner unit while more testing is required to determine the reason for discrepancies in gains. An analysis of the model shows that both dynamics and gains change remarkably over the entire load range. However, local linearised models of low order can be derived and used in a subsequent controller design. Also, the model includes an inverse response (non-minimum phase zero) from the gas generator <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> to the controlled oxygen level. This means that when changing the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> to the gas generator, the oxygen level initially moves {{in the opposite direction}} before it moves in the long term direction. A control strategy based on a nonlinear feedforward and a linear feedback controller, adjusting the ratio between the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> to the gas generator and to the furnace, is proposed. The feedforward is calculated from an inverse mapping of the requested power output to find the two stationary <b>oil</b> <b>flows</b> while respecting oxygen constraints. Simulation results gathered from the developed nonlinear model with added noise and external disturbances illustrate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy...|$|R

Based on remarkably limited knowledge consisting of very global balance arguments and disregarding all the details of the mechanisms in the reaction zone, the local governing equations are formulated in a dimensionless form. We use finite difference method to solve this model and address the study by way of qualitative analysis. The time-space dimensionless <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate (qD) profiles are established for comprehensive studies on the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate characteristic affected by thermal effects.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) structure of near-wall jets observed in disc-like gas vortex units (GVUs), experimental and numerical studies are performed. The experimental results are obtained using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser doppler anemometry, pressure probes and surface <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> visualization techniques. The first three techniques {{have been used}} to investigate the bulk flow hydrodynamics of the vortex unit. Surface <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> visualization is adopted to visualize streamlines near the end-walls of the vortex unit. The surface streamlines help to determine the azimuthal and radial velocity components of the radial near-wall jets. Simulations of the vortex unit using FLUENTVR v. 14 a are simultaneously performed, computationally resolving the near-wall jet regions in the axial direction. The simulation results together with the surface <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> visualization establish the 3 D structure of the near-wall jets in GVUs {{for the first time in}} literature. It is also conjectured that the near-wall jets develop due to the combined effect of bulk flow acceleration and swirl. The centrifugal force diminishes in the vicinity of the end-walls. The radially inward pressure gradient in these regions, no longer balanced by the centrifugal force, pushes gas radially inward thus developing the near-wall jets.

40|$|A {{vertical}} oil curtain {{is excited}} by an orthogonal flow of air. In a first step, the flow is asymmetrical {{and the air}} is injected at 10 Hz. Varying the air flow strength and the oil flow-rate, several regimes are encountered and a phase diagram has been pictured. The curtain may remain undamaged by the air pulses. When the strength is increased or if the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> is decreased, a hole may be generated and directly self-healed. Finally, for even higher air flow and even lower <b>oil</b> <b>flow,</b> the curtain may break up. Among the `no-hole' states, a periodic ejection of oil droplets is observed and even oil bubbles are formed. In a second step, the air flow is injected in a symmetrical way from {{each side of the}} oil curtain. The oil film is then locally squeezed. A stable hole may be generated downstream. It remains at a constant distance from the air injection point. This distance may be changed by increasing the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate, resulting from a balance between the capillary forces (pulling upstream) and the convective flow (pushing downstream) ...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} been carried out in order to assess the {{influence}} of groove activation and deactivation on the performance of a twin axial groove steadily loaded hydrodynamic journal bearing. Temperature distribution at the oil–bush interface, oil outlet temperature, total <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate, partial <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate (at each groove), and motor consumption were measured for several journal speeds and loads under constant feeding pressure (pf) and constant feeding temperature (Tf), at five different loading angles (). In this study, the corresponding groove was deactivated whenever negative <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> rate was observed in it and results were compared. It was found that the groove deactivation strategy has profound influence on the bearing performance when negative flow rate occurs at one groove, preventing such undesirable effects as lubricant starvation at the loaded region of the bearing. Groove deactivation in the event of negative flow rate may be easily implemented by incorporating a check valve to the feeding system of each groove. Such strategy seems to be highly recommended for the safe operation of bearings subjected to high loads and load angles deviated from 90 º...|$|R
