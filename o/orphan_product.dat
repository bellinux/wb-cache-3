40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsVincent Amanor-BoaduMost {{corporations}} seem {{geared to}} buy assets, not sell them. Estimates suggest corporations acquire three businesses {{for every one}} they divest (Mankins 2008). A corporation with a disciplined approach to divestiture seems more likely to sharpen strategic focus and deliver value to shareholders. This thesis defines and explores {{the concept of an}} <b>orphan</b> <b>product</b> as an opportunity for divestiture from a parent company and subsequent acquisition for a startup company. <b>Orphan</b> <b>product</b> is defined by reviewing literature and selecting the following criteria for a given product; the product has a lack of marketing support/focus, the product is not considered core to the parent company, product sales trend over a 5 -year time frame is decreasing, cash flows are uncertain, market growth for the category the product competes in is smaller than the industry average, the product life cycle position is mature, and portfolio synergy is low due to the parent company having other products that deliver similar benefits. A scorecard is developed and used to score orphan characteristics of four products in the animal health industry. Two of the four products analyzed are classified as orphan products and therefore potential candidates for purchase by the startup company. A Strategy Canvas is developed and value curves are assigned per product to show how the startup company can market an acquired product relative to the critical success factors in the animal health industry (Kim and Mauborgne, 2005). A framework of critical questions is posed to each product resulting in recommendations for the startup on critical success factors to eliminate, reduce, raise, or create. For the orphan products, a recommendations include: raise price, increase marketing support, and/or create new factors to differentiate such as to offer additional services or to develop pricing models that are simple and clear. Application of this research can be applied to companies seeking to acquire animal health products that would like to better understand how to improve their chances for success...|$|E
40|$|Background: Some orphan {{drugs can}} cost {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars annually per patient. As a result, payer sensitivity to the cost of orphan drugs is rising, particularly in light of increased numbers of new launches in recent years. In this article, we examine payer coverage in the United States, England and Wales, and the Netherlands of outpatient orphan drugs approved between 1983 and 2012, as well as the 11 most expensive orphan drugs. Methods: We collected data from drug regulatory agencies as well as payers and drug evaluation authorities. Results: We found that orphan drugs have more coverage restrictions than non-orphan drugs in all three jurisdictions. From an economic perspective, the fact that a drug is an <b>orphan</b> <b>product</b> or has a high per-unit price per se should not imply a special kind of evaluation by payers, or necessarily the imposition of more coverage restrictions. Conclusion: Payers should consider the same set of decision criteria that they do with respect to non-orphan drugs: disease severity, availability of treatment alternatives, level of unmet medical need, and cost-effectiveness, criteria that justifiably may be taken into account and traded off against one another in prescribing and reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs...|$|E
40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} large increases {{in the number of}} drugs available to treat rare diseases and HIV on mortality associated with them. Mortality from both diseases declined dramatically following increases in drug approvals. Before the Orphan Drug Act went into effect (between 1979 and 1984), mortality from rare diseases grew {{at the same rate as}} mortality from other diseases. In contrast, during the next five years, mortality from rare diseases grew more slowly than mortality from other diseases. I estimate that one additional orphan drug approval in year t prevents 211 deaths in year t+ 1 and ultimately prevents 499 deaths, and that about 108 thousand deaths from rare diseases will ultimately be prevented by all of the 216 orphan drugs tha t have been approved since 1983. Deaths are more closely related to the number of <b>orphan</b> <b>product</b> designations (which include experimental drugs) than they are to the number of approvals. Consistent with previous patient- level studies of HIV, I find that new drugs played a key role in the post- 1995 decline in HIV mortality.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : Lomitapide (a microsomal {{triglyceride}} transfer protein inhibitor) is an adjunctive {{treatment for}} homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH), a rare genetic condition characterised by elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and premature, severe, accelerated atherosclerosis. Standard {{of care for}} HoFH includes lipid-lowering drugs and lipoprotein apheresis. We conducted a posthoc analysis using data from a Phase 3 study to assess whether concomitant apheresis affected the lipidlowering efficacy of lomitapide. METHODS : Existing lipid-lowering therapy, including apheresis, was to remain stable from Week 6 to Week 26. Lomitapide dose was escalated {{on the basis of}} individual safety/tolerability from 5 mg to 60 mg a day (maximum). The primary endpoint was mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 26 (efficacy phase), after which patients remained on lomitapide through Week 78 for safety assessment and further evaluation of efficacy. During this latter period, apheresis could be adjusted. We analysed the impact of apheresis on LDL-C reductions in patients receiving lomitapide. RESULTS : Of the 29 patients that entered the efficacy phase, 18 (62 %) were receiving apheresis at baseline. Twenty-three patients (13 receiving apheresis) completed the Week 26 evaluation. Of the six patients who discontinued in the first 26 weeks, five were receiving apheresis. There {{were no significant differences in}} percent change from baseline of LDL-C at Week 26 in patients treated (48 %) and not treated (55 %) with apheresis (p ¼ 0. 545). Changes in Lp(a) levels were modest and not different between groups (p ¼ 0. 436). CONCLUSION : The LDL-C lowering efficacy of lomitapide is unaffected by lipoprotein apheresis.

Safety and pharmacokinetics of nikkomycin Z were evaluated in healthy male subjects following single, rising oral doses ranging from 250 mg to 2, 000 mg. A total of 12 subjects were recruited and divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 6) received {{two out of three}} doses of 250 mg, 1, 000 mg, or 1, 750 mg and a placebo randomly in place of one of the doses. Group 2 (n = 6) received two out of three doses of 500 mg, 1, 500 mg, or 2, 000 mg and a placebo in place of one of the doses. Subjects were confined to the study unit overnight prior to dosing, and 12 blood samples were collected over 24 h postdosing while subjects were confined. Subjects returned for additional blood samples and safety evaluations at 48 h and 72 h after each dose. There was a 2 -week washout period between doses. Plasma drug concentrations were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. Nikkomycin Z was absorbed after oral administration, reaching a maximum concentration in serum of 2. 21 μg/ml at 2 h postdose and an area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity of 11. 3 μg·h/ml for the 250 -mg dose. Pharmacokinetics appeared linear over the range of 250 to 500 mg; however, relative bioavailability was about 62 to 70 % for the 1, 000 -mg dose and 42 to 47 % for doses between 1, 500 and 2, 000 mg. The mean terminal half-life ranged from 2. 1 to 2. 5 h and was independent of dose. No serious or dose-related adverse events were observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND Patients with {{homozygous}} {{familial hypercholesterolaemia}} respond inadequately to existing drugs. We aimed {{to assess the}} effi cacy and safety of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor lomitapide in adults with this disease. METHODS We did a single-arm, open-label, phase 3 study of lomitapide for treatment of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Current lipid lowering therapy was maintained from 6 weeks before baseline through to at least week 26. Lomitapide dose was escalated {{on the basis of}} safety and tolerability from 5 mg to a maximum of 60 mg a day. The primary endpoint was mean percent change in levels of LDL cholesterol from baseline to week 26, after which patients remained on lomitapide through to week 78 for safety assessment. Percent change from baseline to week 26 was assessed with a mixed linear model. FINDINGS 29 men and women with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, aged 18 years or older, were recruited from 11 centres in four countries (USA, Canada, South Africa, and Italy). 23 of 29 enrolled patients completed both the effi cacy phase (26 weeks) and the full study (78 weeks). The median dose of lomitapide was 40 mg a day. LDL cholesterol was reduced by 50 % (95 % CI – 62 to – 39) from baseline (mean 8 · 7 mmol/L [SD 2 · 9]) to week 26 (4 · 3 mmol/L [2 · 5]; p< 0 · 0001). Levels of LDL cholesterol were lower than 2 · 6 mmol/L in eight patients at 26 weeks. Concentrations of LDL cholesterol remained reduced by 44 % (95 % CI – 57 to – 31; p< 0 · 0001) at week 56 and 38 % (– 52 to – 24; p< 0 · 0001) at week 78. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common adverse event. Four patients had aminotransaminase levels of more than fi ve times the upper limit of normal, which resolved after dose reduction or temporary interruption of lomitapide. No patient permanently discontinued treatment because of liver abnormalities. Interpretation Our study suggests that treatment with lomitapide could be a valuable drug in the management of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.
