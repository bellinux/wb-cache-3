5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic <b>oil</b> <b>plant</b> at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

Considering the {{requirements}} of index evaluation system for data of input and output indicators and following the principles of accessibility and representative of the data, this paper selected 10 <b>oil</b> <b>plants</b> as the decision-making units. Insufficient decision-making units would weaken {{the applicability of the}} result, while over-sufficient decision-making units can lead to “overcrowding” in the data processing. Therefore, it was appropriate to select 10 decision-making units for evaluation. The data are from China Energy Statistical Yearbook, Petroleum Statistical Yearbook, annual reports, and other relevant sources in 2015. After collecting and organizing the data, we obtained the panel data of 10 <b>oil</b> <b>plants</b> under discussion during 2012 – 2015. In this paper, 10 <b>oil</b> <b>plants</b> (C 1, C 2, [...]..

5|$|The {{shale oil}} {{industry}} at Kohtla-Järve and Kiviõli was redeveloped. In 1945, the first tunnel kiln was restored, {{and by the}} end of the 1940s four tunnel kilns located in Kiviõli and Kohtla-Nõmme had been restored. German prisoners of war contributed most of the labour. Between 1946 and 1963, 13Kiviter-type retorts were built in Kohtla-Järve and eight in Kiviõli. In 1947, a pilot Galoter retort was built at the Ilmarine engineering plant in Tallinn. This unit, in operation until 1956, was capable of processing 2.5tonnes of oil shale per day and was used for modelling the next generation of commercial-scale retorts. The first Galoter-type commercial-scale pilot retorts were built at Kiviõli in 1953 and 1963 with capacities of 200 and 500tonnes of oil shale per day, respectively. The first of these retorts closed in 1963 and the second in 1981. The Narva <b>Oil</b> <b>Plant,</b> annexed to the Eesti Power Station and operating two Galoter-type 3,000-tonnes-per day retorts, was commissioned in 1980. Started as a pilot plant, the process of converting it to a commercial-scale plant took about 20years.|$|E
5|$|Trevor {{eventually}} {{discovers that}} Michael set him and Brad up, and that Brad {{is not in}} jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael. Near {{the end of the}} game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit a friend that he hates, which Michael accepts. If the second option is chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death. If the first option is chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an <b>oil</b> <b>plant.</b> When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him. If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.|$|E

25|$|Ricin is {{synthesized}} in the endosperm of castor <b>oil</b> <b>plant</b> seeds. The ricin {{precursor protein}} is 576 amino acid residues {{in length and}} contains a signal peptide (residues 1–35), the ricin A chain (36–302), a linker peptide (303–314), and the ricin B chain (315–576). The N-terminal signal sequence delivers the prepropolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then the signal peptide is cleaved off. Within the lumen of the ER the propolypeptide is glycosylated and a protein disulfide isomerase catalyzes disulfide bond formation between cysteines 294 and 318. The propolypeptide is further glycosylated within the Golgi apparatus and transported to protein storage bodies. The propolypeptide is cleaved within protein bodies by an endopeptidase to produce the mature ricin protein that is composed of a 267 residue A chain and a 262 residue B chain that are covalently linked by a single disulfide bond.|$|E
500|$|Shale oil {{production}} started in Estonia in 1921 when Riigi Põlevkivitööstus built 14experimental oil shale processing retorts in Kohtla-Järve.

[...] Along with the shale oil extraction plant, an oil shale research laboratory was founded in 1921. Following the experimental retorts, the first commercial shale <b>oil</b> <b>plant</b> was put into operation on 24 December 1924. [...] The German-owned company Eesti Kiviõli ( [...] , , predecessor of Kiviõli Keemiatööstus), affiliated with G. Scheel & Co. and Mendelssohn & Co., was established in 1922.

500|$|Forensic chemists' {{analysis}} can provide leads for investigators, {{and they can}} confirm or refute their suspicions. [...] The identification of the various substances found at the scene can tell investigators {{what to look for}} during their search. [...] During fire investigations, forensic chemists can determine if an accelerant such as gasoline or kerosene was used; if so, this suggests that the fire was intentionally set. [...] Forensic chemists can also narrow down the suspect list to people who would have access to the substance used in a crime. [...] For example, in explosive investigations, the identification of RDX or C-4 would indicate a military connection as those substances are military grade explosives. [...] On the other hand, the identification of TNT would create a wider suspect list, since it is used by demolition companies {{as well as in the}} military. [...] During poisoning investigations, the detection of specific poisons can give detectives an idea of what to look for when they are interviewing potential suspects.
