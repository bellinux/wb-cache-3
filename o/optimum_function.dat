This implies a continuous supervision of the water supply process in order to allow any problem that could appear to be solved, and in the same time, to maintain normal functioning parameters.

Chain-length dependence, chain asymmetry of lipids forming partially interdigitated and mixed interdigitated gel phases, chain unsaturation, positional dependence of methyl branching, headgroup-attached and α-branched chains, and length of zwitterionic headgroups are all covered.

In fact, minimizing a quadratic function with nonlinear constraints {{is known to}} be an NP-hard problem. This implies a severe computational burden for higher dimensional problems. One class of multi-modal optimization approach that could overcome this problem is random search optimization. However, very little is known about how different parameters of such algorithms should be adjusted in order to achieve a desired convergence speed. This paper presents a systematic analysis of an Adaptive Random Search Algorithm similar to that of Pronzato. The analysis reveals the key parameters affecting convergence time and provides insight on ways to tune the algorithm for more rapid convergence. A new stopping criterion is also proposed that eliminates the need to estimate the <b>optimum</b> <b>function</b> value beforehand. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince the {{beginning}} of the last century, the localization of brain function has been represented by Brodmann areas, maps of the anatomic organization of the brain. They are used to broadly represent cortical structures with their given sensory-cognitive functions. In recent decades, the analysis of brain oscillations has become important in the correlation of brain functions. Moreover, spectral connectivity can provide further information on the dynamic connectivity between various structures. In addition, brain responses are dynamic in nature and structural localization is almost impossible, according to Luria (1966). Therefore, brain functions are very difficult to localize; hence, a combined analysis of oscillation and event-related coherences is required. In this study, a model termed as “CLAIR” is described to enrich and possibly replace the concept of the Brodmann areas.
