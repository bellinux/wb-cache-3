5|$|Serous {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied endometrium and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as <b>omental</b> caking) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, papillary structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.|$|E
25|$|In disseminated {{intraperitoneal}} leiomyomatosis, leiomyomata grow diffusely on the peritoneal and <b>omental</b> surfaces, with uterine fibroids {{as their}} source. This can simulate a malignant tumor but behaves benignly.|$|E
25|$|From {{its upper}} part, it joins {{to the neck}} of the {{pancreas}} at a well-marked prominence, the <b>omental</b> tuber, which abuts the lesser omentum. Its right edge is marked by a groove for the gastroduodenal artery.|$|E
25|$|It {{begins on}} the right in the <b>omental</b> tuber, and is in {{relation}} with the celiac artery, from which the hepatic artery courses to the right just above the gland, while the splenic artery runs toward the left in a groove along this border.|$|E
25|$|These {{studies showed}} that the {{mesocolon}} is continuous from the ileocaecal to the rectosigmoid level. It was also shown that a mesenteric conﬂuence occurs at the ileocaecal and rectosigmoid junctions, {{as well as at}} the hepatic and splenic ﬂexures and that each confluence involves peritoneal and <b>omental</b> attachments. The proximal rectum was shown to originate at the conﬂuence of the mesorectum and mesosigmoid. A plane occupied by perinephric fascia was shown to separate the entire apposed small intestinal mesentery and the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum. Deep in the pelvis, this fascia coalesces to give rise to presacral fascia.|$|E
25|$|CT {{scanning}} {{is preferred}} {{to assess the}} extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used. CT scanning can also be useful for finding <b>omental</b> caking or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a barium enema, which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and paracentesis are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results. However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present. A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations. However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} shown that there are {{significant}} correlations between the expression of miR-181a and both adipose tissue morphology and key metabolic parameters, including visceral fat area, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and circulating leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6. [...] The expression of miR-181a may contribute to intrinsic differences between <b>omental</b> and subcutaneous adipose tissue.|$|E
2500|$|Mice {{have eight}} major adipose depots, four {{of which are}} within the {{abdominal}} cavity. The paired gonadal depots {{are attached to the}} uterus and ovaries in females and the epididymis and testes in males; the paired retroperitoneal depots are found along the dorsal wall of the abdomen, surrounding the kidney, and, when massive, extend into the pelvis. [...] The mesenteric depot forms a glue-like web that supports the intestines and the <b>omental</b> depot (which originates near the stomach and spleen) and- when massive- extends into the ventral abdomen. [...] Both the mesenteric and <b>omental</b> depots incorporate much lymphoid tissue as lymph nodes and milky spots, respectively. [...] The two superficial depots are the paired inguinal depots, which are found anterior to the upper segment of the hind limbs (underneath the skin) and the subscapular depots, paired medial mixtures of brown adipose tissue adjacent to regions of white adipose tissue, which are found under the skin between the dorsal crests of the scapulae. [...] The layer of brown adipose tissue in this depot is often covered by a [...] "frosting" [...] of white adipose tissue; sometimes these two types of fat (brown and white) are hard to distinguish. [...] The inguinal depots enclose the inguinal group of lymph nodes. [...] Minor depots include the pericardial, which surrounds the heart, and the paired popliteal depots, between the major muscles behind the knees, each containing one large lymph node. [...] Of all the depots in the mouse, the gonadal depots are the largest and the most easily dissected, comprising about 30% of dissectible fat.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{advances}} in biotechnology have {{allowed for the}} harvesting of adult stem cells from adipose tissue, allowing stimulation of tissue regrowth using a patient's own cells. [...] In addition, adipose-derived stem cells from both human and animals reportedly can be efficiently reprogrammed into {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} without the need for feeder cells. The use of a patient's own cells reduces the chance of tissue rejection and avoids ethical issues {{associated with the use of}} human embryonic stem cells. A growing body of evidence also suggests that different fat depots (i.e. abdominal, <b>omental,</b> pericardial) yield adipose-derived stem cells with different characteristics. [...] These depot-dependent features include proliferation rate, immunophenotype, differentiation potential, gene expression, as well as sensitivity to hypoxic culture conditions.|$|E
2500|$|On rare occasions, a {{piece of}} small {{intestine}} (or rarely colon) can become trapped through the epiploic foramen into the <b>omental</b> bursa. The blood supply to this piece of intestine is immediately occluded and surgery is the only available treatment. This type of colic {{has been associated with}} cribbers, possibly due to changes in abdominal pressure, and in older horses, possibly because the foramen enlarges as the right lobe of the liver atrophies with age, although it has been seen in horses as young as 4 months old. Horses usually present with colic signs referable to small intestinal obstruction. During surgery, the foramen can not be enlarged due to the risk of rupture of the vena cava or aorta, which would result in fatal hemorrhage. Survival is [...] 74–79%, and survival is consistently correlated with abdominocentesis findings prior to surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Understanding the {{macroscopic}} {{structure of}} the mesenteric organ meant that associated structures—the peritoneal folds and congenital and <b>omental</b> adhesions—could be better appraised. The small intestinal mesenteric fold occurs where the small intestinal mesentery folds onto the posterior abdominal wall and continues laterally as the right mesocolon. During mobilization of the small intestinal mesentery from the posterior abdominal wall, this fold is incised, allowing access to the interface between the small intestinal mesentery and the retroperitoneum. The fold continues at the inferolateral boundary of the ileocaecal junction and turns [...] as the right paracolic peritoneal fold. This fold is divided during lateral to medial mobilization, permitting the surgeon to serially lift the right colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and retroperitoneum. At the hepatic flexure, the right lateral peritoneal fold turns and continues medially as the hepatocolic peritoneal fold. Division of the fold in this location permits separation of the colonic component of the hepatic flexure and mesocolon off the retroperitoneum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Omental</b> {{infarction}}: <b>Omental</b> infarction is uncommon {{reason for}} acute abdomen. It {{is similar to}} acute appendicitis. The pain is of a few days duration centering in the right lower or upper quadrant. Imaging is required to obtain an accurate diagnosis due to the common misdiagnosis of <b>omental</b> infarction as appendicitis or cholecystitis. <b>Omental</b> infarction occurs commonly in pediatric patients approximately 15 percent of cases. The most frequent cause of non- torsion related <b>omental</b> infarction is due to trauma as well as thrombosis or the <b>omental</b> veins. The predisposition for <b>omental</b> infarction includes obesity, strenuous activity, congestive heart failure, digitalis administration, recent abdominal surgery and trauma.” The typical CT findings are a solitary large non-enhancing <b>omental</b> mass with heterogeneous attenuation, which is most often located in the right lower quadrant, deep to the rectus abdominis muscle and either anterior to the transverse colon or anteromedial to the ascending colon”. <b>Omental</b> Infarction {{can be difficult to}} differentiate from diverticulitis however <b>omental</b> infarction is not normally attributed with bowel wall thickening. It is rare that the colonic wall will be thickened due to spread of the inflammation from the omentum (a fold of peritoneum connecting or supporting abdominal structures) to the tenia omentalis of the colon.|$|E

50|$|In radiology, <b>omental</b> cake is sign {{indicative}} of an abnormally thickened greater omentum. It refers to infiltration of the <b>omental</b> fat by material of soft-tissue density. Typically, it {{is caused by}} infiltration of metastatic tumours arising from the stomach, ovary, or colon. It can also result from tuberculous peritonitis. Another cause is lymphoma, in which <b>omental</b> caking is usually associated lymphadenopathy.|$|E
