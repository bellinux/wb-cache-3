5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{combined}} intravenous and intracoronary streptokinase without (Group I, n = 103) or with (Group II, n = 103) immediate coronary angioplasty were evaluated during a long-term (3 year) follow-up <b>of</b> 206 <b>patients</b> with acute transmural myocardial infarction. There were no baseline {{differences between the}} groups with regard to gender, age, infarct location, serum creatine kinase levels, time between onset of symptoms and treatment and coronary artery patency rate. Angioplasty was performed with a success rate of 69 % and a reocclusion rate of 2 %. Elective angioplasty was performed in 22 (21 %) <b>of</b> 103 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> Group I and 9 (9 %) <b>of</b> 103 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> Group II, with a success rate of 86 % and 100 %, respectively, reflecting the higher incidence of angina pectoris and antianginal therapy in Group I.

Also <b>patient</b> education <b>in</b> the US is presented <b>in</b> this issue. <b>Patient</b> education is defined as all the educational activities directed to <b>patients,</b> including aspects <b>of</b> therapeutic education, health education and clinical health promotion. Five important factors are identified <b>in</b> the development <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> education. (I) research and evidence based standards; (2) the organization of care; (3) training and methodological support; (4) professional values; and (5) acknowledgment, funding and place <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> education <b>in</b> health policy. Several of the discussed common orientations and priorities <b>in</b> the <b>patient</b> education <b>in</b> the reviewed countries are highlighted in this issue.
