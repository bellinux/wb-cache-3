5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are seen}} on Earth {{because of a}} fortuitous {{combination}} of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Hundreds {{of millions of years}} in the past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total and there were no annular eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully <b>occlude</b> the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size. Estimates of the when the moon will be unable to <b>occlude</b> the entire sun when viewed from the Earth range between 1.4 billion and 650 million years in the future.|$|E
5|$|Cyclogenesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a biologically-inspired model for partly <b>occluded</b> {{patterns}} is proposed. The model {{is based on}} the hypothesis that in human visual system <b>occluding</b> patterns {{play a key role in}} recognition as well as in reconstructing internal representation for a pattern’s <b>occluding</b> parts. The proposed model is realized with a bidirectional hierarchical neural network. In this network top-down cues, generated by direct connections from the lower to higher levels of hierarchy, interact with the bottom-up information, generated from the un-occluded parts, to recognize <b>occluded</b> patterns. Moreover, positional cues of the <b>occluded</b> as well as <b>occluding</b> patterns, that are computed separately but in the same network, modulate the top-down and bottom-up processing to reconstruct the <b>occluded</b> patterns. Simulation results support the presented hypothesis as well as effectiveness of the model in providing a solution to recognition of <b>occluded</b> patterns. The behavior of the model is in accordance to the known human behavior on the <b>occluded</b> patterns...|$|R
40|$|Does visual {{attention}} {{spread from}} the cued {{end of an}} <b>occluded</b> object to locations occupied by inferred portions of that object? We investigated this question by using a probe detection paradigm with two-dimensional (2 -D) displays of <b>occluded</b> objects. Probes could appear in <b>occluded</b> or nonoccluded locations on either a cued or noncued object. Participants responded faster to probes appearing within the region of space occupied by the cued object. This was true not only when the probe appeared in positions separated from the cued location by an <b>occluder</b> (as demonstrated by Moore, Yantis, 2 ̆ 6 Vaughan, 1998), but also when it appeared in positions on the <b>occluder</b> itself. Thus, results suggest that cued facilitation spreads to regions of noncued <b>occluding</b> objects that overlap cued <b>occluded</b> objects in 2 -D space...|$|R

5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{are found}} in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able to <b>occlude</b> the ribosome binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the hairpin structure can 'melt' and expose the RBS or Shine-Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The start codon, typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome. In addition to this cis-acting mechanism, a lone example of a trans-acting RNA thermometer has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought {{to be involved in the}} starvation response.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones <b>occlude</b> as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E

Results: there were seven technically successful procedures but after a median follow up of four weeks, only one case had persistent patency of the previously <b>occluded</b> segment.

40|$|Although 4 -month-olds {{perceive}} {{continuity of}} an object's trajectory through occlusion, {{little is known}} about the information specifying an <b>occluding</b> surface at this age. We investigated this in 3 experiments involving 84 participants. Testing the claim that 5 -month-olds are unable to perceive the Kanizsa figure as an <b>occluding</b> surface (Csibra, 2001), we demonstrated that 4 -month-olds perceived trajectory continuity behind this figure providing its horizontal extent was small. We demonstrated that the presence of visible <b>occluding</b> edges or occlusion of background was insufficient to specify an <b>occluding</b> surface but that their combination was sufficient. Thus, beyond object deletion and accretion, both visible <b>occluding</b> edges and occlusion of background are necessary for perception of <b>occluding</b> surfaces at this age...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether an}} agnosic {{patient with a}} deficit in early visual processing, HJA, completed <b>occluded</b> contours. We used matching tasks with stimuli composed of three superimposed or <b>occluded</b> shapes. Experiments 2 and 6 required superimposed or <b>occluded</b> shapes to be discriminated from distractors in which the position of one shape was changed. HJA was selectively impaired with <b>occluded</b> relative to superimposed shapes. His performance was affected by the spatial separation of the <b>occluded</b> contours rather than {{the area of the}} <b>occluded</b> surface. Experiments 3 and 5 required HJA to discriminate the central shape. Making <b>occluded</b> contours easier to compute (by reducing their spatial separation) facilitated discrimination of a central <b>occluded</b> shape (in the background), although it impaired discrimination of a central <b>occluding</b> shape (in the foreground). Free-choice shape judgements made to the central shape (Experiment 2) showed that HJA used both real and completed contours to segment foreground shapes inappropriately. When asked to copy overlapping shapes (Experiment 4), HJA drew in the <b>occluded</b> parts as if real contours were present, at least on some occasions. These drawings and a task requiring discrimination between real and <b>occluded</b> contours (Experiment 7), showed a tendency to continue contours inappropriately, an insensitiviy to junctions, and impaired integration of contours into more global shapes. The results suggest that <b>occluded</b> contours can be computed early on in visual processing, probably at the level where long-range mechanisms group collinear contour segments together. Our control experiment shows that HJA is not impaired in collinear contour grouping. These mechanisms are prior to processes in which contours are bound to shapes and in which foregroundbackground relationships between shapes are resolved. In visual agnosia, <b>occluded</b> contours can be computed even when there is impairment of both binding of contours to shapes and the computation of foreground-background relations in overlapping shapes...|$|R

25|$|Calcification at {{the outer}} base of older or more {{advanced}} lesions. Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques, are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable). The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated, but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, {{which tend to}} be asymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells, and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous cap) is usually weak and prone to rupture. Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material, such as collagen, to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen. Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can <b>occlude</b> arteries outright (e.g., coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation, and eventually <b>occlude</b> smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism.|$|E

Westling, A. Bäckström, & J. R. Flanagan, 2001). However, these contact positions are not always visible due to occlusion. Subjects might look at <b>occluded</b> parts to determine the location of the contact positions based on extrapolated information. On the other hand, subjects might avoid looking at <b>occluded</b> parts since no object information can be gathered there. To find out where subjects fixate when grasping <b>occluded</b> objects, we let them grasp flat shapes with the index finger and thumb at predefined contact positions. Either the contact position of the thumb or the finger or both was <b>occluded.</b> In a control condition, a part of the object that does not involve the contact positions was <b>occluded.</b> The results showed that subjects did look at <b>occluded</b> object parts, suggesting that they used extrapolated object information for grasping. Additionally, they preferred to look {{in the direction of the}} index finger. When the contact position of the index finger was <b>occluded,</b> this tendency was inhibited. Thus, an <b>occluder</b> does not prevent fixations on <b>occluded</b> object parts, but it does affect fixation locations especially in conditions where the preferred fixation location is <b>occluded.</b> © ARVO...|$|R

40|$|According to the Norwegian cyclone model, {{whether a}} warm-type or cold-type <b>occluded</b> front forms de-pends upon which {{cold air mass}} is colder: the prewarm-frontal air mass or the postcold-frontal air mass. For example, a cold-type {{occlusion}} is said to occur when the <b>occluded</b> front slopes rearward with height because the prewarm-frontal airmass is warmer than the postcold-frontal airmass. This temperature difference and the resulting occluded-frontal structure in the Norwegian cyclone model {{is part of what}} is called the temperature rule. Paradoxically, no clear example of a rearward-sloping, cold-type <b>occluded</b> front has been found in the literature, even though the required temperature difference has been documented in several cases. This article presents the first documented, rearward-sloping, cold-type <b>occluded</b> front. This <b>occluded</b> front forms in a cy-clone over the North Atlantic Ocean on 3 – 5 January 2003 and is documented in model output from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Cross sections through the evolving cyclone show the <b>occluded</b> front forms as the less statically stable warm-frontal zone ascends over the more stable cold-frontal zone. Such a stability difference between the cold- and warm-frontal zones is consistent with a pre-viously published hypothesis that the less stable air is lifted by the more stable air to form <b>occluded</b> fronts, in disagreement with the temperature rule. Because warm-frontal zones and the cold air underneath tend to be more stable than cold-frontal zones and the postcold-frontal air, warm-type <b>occluded</b> fronts are much more common than cold-type <b>occluded</b> fronts, explaining why well-defined, rearward-sloping, cold-type <b>occluded</b> fronts are not common in the meteorological literature. 1...|$|R
