In literary circles however, his reputation had been tarnished in the meantime: he had openly taken both Wordsworth and Coleridge to task on personal grounds and for failing to fulfill the promise of their earlier accomplishments, and both were apparently responsible for retaliatory rumours which seriously damaged Hazlitt's repute.

The 1878 census population count for the entire kingdom had been only 57,985. As the tale went, Kalākaua would then hand the deed to the islands over to the Chinese government.

500|$|The Cabanatuan {{prison camp}} {{was named after}} the nearby city of 50,000people (locals also called it Camp Pangatian, after a small nearby village). The camp had first been used as an American Department of Agriculture station and then a {{training}} camp for the Filipino army. When the Japanese invaded the Philippines, they used the camp to house American POWs. It {{was one of three}} camps in the Cabanatuan area and was designated for holding sick detainees. Occupying about , the rectangular-shaped camp was roughly [...] deep by [...] across, divided by a road that ran through its center. One side of the camp housed Japanese guards, while the other included bamboo barracks for the prisoners as well as a section for a hospital. Nicknamed the [...] "Zero Ward" [...] because zero was the probability <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it alive, the hospital housed the sickliest prisoners as they waited to die from diseases such as dysentery and malaria. Eight-foot (2.4-m) high barbed wire fences surrounded the camp, in addition to multiple pillbox bunkers and four-story guard towers.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years into}} the role, she {{experienced}} a 14-month nervous breakdown but did not confide in anyone besides her close family or take any time off work, which in retrospect she deemed [...] "the worst thing [...] could have done. During {{the worst part of}} her experience Lancashire described herself as [...] "hysterical at the thought <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed". Her mother Hilda forced her to seek medical assistance for her condition, which Lancashire states [...] "gave me my life back", her twenties having been [...] "a write-off". Lancashire felt her first marriage had also contributed to her unhappiness; in 2001, she stated that though her marriage lasted ten years, it [...] "was 10 years longer than it should have done". [...] In 1995 she separated from Hargeaves; the pair would ultimately later divorce. She described leaving her marriage as a [...] "cleansing experience" [...] and a [...] "renaissance"; one that enabled her to rediscover her sense of identity. Other steps that Lancashire took to combat her depression included remaining single for five years, attending therapy sessions, and taking prescriptions of the anti-depressant drug Paroxetine. In December 1995 Lancashire starred in the spin-off straight-to-video film Coronation Street– The Cruise, a 75-minute special detailing Raquel and Curly's honeymoon. The special was advertised as being exclusive to video, and 750,000 copies were sold, to the value of £10million. Lancashire departed Coronation Street in 1996 due to her heavy work schedule and desire to pursue other projects. She had also tired of the fame the role brought her, shying away from personal appearances and interviews with television magazines. Her final scenes attracted 20million viewers. Lancashire's performance in the role saw her nominated in the Most Popular Actress category at the 2nd National Television Awards in October 1996.|$|E
500|$|H. J. R. Murray {{wrote that}} Staunton's {{response}} to Morphy's initial challenge and his {{article about the}} same in The Illustrated London News should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, {{and one of the}} main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Murray also commented on the whole affair, [...] "In all this there is but little in which we can reproach Staunton, beyond the fact that he kept open the possibility of a match for so long, and even here there is a good deal that could be urged in justification of the course followed by Staunton" [...] but also noted that both sides were playing tactical games with each other in front of the public, and that comments made by both players or their respective supporters were acrimonious. In response to Morphy's complaints Lord Lyttelton, then president of the British Chess Association, said that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match. von der Lasa later wrote, although not specifically about this affair, that he thought there was no chance of Staunton's health being good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards. William Norwood Potter wrote in his obituary of Staunton in the City of London Chess Magazine, [...] "...nor were his innuendoes concerning Morphy otherwise than an utterly unworthy means <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an engagement, which he could have either declined with a good grace at first, or afterwards have honourably asked to be released from. Nevertheless, all said and done, Staunton was, as we have often heard a distinguished enemy of his say, emphatically a MAN. There was nothing weak about him, and he had a backbone that never curved with fear of any one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wang An-shih, a high {{magistrate}} of the Sung dynasty (960-1278 A.D.), was {{a learned}} scholar but recklessly irreverent, and so introduced, radical innovations in his administration. People complained, officers demurred, and the emperor expressed surprise; {{but he would}} say, [...] "Heavenly omens should not be heeded, human discontent need not be minded, {{and there is no}} sense in following the ancestral laws." [...] He and his son, who assisted him in his office, even attempted to revive the ancient cruel custom of corporal punishment; but before the law was passed, the son died, and Wang An-shih built a Buddhist temple on the site of his son's residence. While the magistrate was performing the customary Buddhist rite, he thought he faintly perceived in the flame of a burning candle the image of his son, bound hand and foot in a cangue, crying: [...] "Our attempt to revive corporal mutilation angered Heaven, and I have no chance <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this infernal torture." [...] Later An-shih fell in disgrace; he lost his position and died miserably in exile. Now it happened that soon afterwards, one of An-shih's relatives was taken ill, and swooned, and when he recovered, {{he said that he had}} been ushered into a special department in hell, where hung the sign: [...] "Wickedness and Crime Eternally Prohibited," [...] and there lie saw a noble-looking man in a cangue, who had gray hair and large eyes. Though he did not mention the name of this unfortunate person, everyone around knew that it was Wang An-shih of whom he spoke. When An-shih's daughter inquired what could be done, the sick man simply said: [...] "All that is necessary is to accumulate merits and nothing more." [...] (tr. Suzuki and Carus 1906: 96-97) ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the major}} forms of {{literature}} during the Han dynasty was the fu (sometimes translated as [...] "rhapsody"), a kind of eclectic grab bag of prose and verse, not easy to classify in English as being either poetry or prose. In Chinese, the fu is classified as wen rather than shi, however these terms do not correspond to English categories of prose and verse (one {{of the differences in}} the traditional Chinese categorization being that shi was sung or chanted, whereas the fu was not, at least according to the Hanshu), the credibility of this being enhanced by the fact that one of the compilers of the Hanshu (also known as Book of Han or History of the Former Han Dynasty) was Ban Gu, who was himself a practitioner of the fu style. The Han fu derived from the Chuci, which was traditionally considered to be the work of Qu Yuan, who was a wanderer through the countryside and villages of the Kingdom of Chu, after his exile from court. In this context the [...] "Li Sao" [...] is particularly relevant. The Han fu of the second and first centuries BCE were intimately associated with the courts of the emperor and his princes. In other words, they were refined literary products, ornate, polished, and with an elite vocabulary; and, often the subject matter includes topics such as life in the palaces of the Han capital cities. The development of the fu form of literature during the Han dynasty shows a movement toward later more personal poetry and the poems of reclusion, typical for example, of Tao Yuanming, the Six Dynasties poet. The famous Han dynasty astronomer, mathematician, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) wrote a fu about his own, personal experience (real or imagined) <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the city and its politics and getting back to the country and nature. The fu form continued to be popular in the centuries following the demise of the Han imperial power.|$|E
