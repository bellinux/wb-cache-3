25|$|Emmy Werner {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{scientists}} to use the term resilience in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from Kauai, Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work. Werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-wedlock births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'. Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non-resilient children and families.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} contains 111 mummies, mostly women, with some men and about 20 children, but only 59 {{of these are}} on display. It is considered the largest collection of mummies in the Western Hemisphere. Almost {{all of the people}} were commoners and came from backgrounds such as miners and farmers. The mummies were disinterred from the municipal cemetery between 1870 and 1958, and were people who died between 1850 and 1950. The first of the documented mummies, which has been on display {{in one form or another}} since the 1870s, is that of a French doctor named Remigio Leroy. He can be seen at the current museum. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection, one can see evidence of a practice where deceased Catholic children were dressed as angels, if girls, or as saints, if boys, to indicate their purity and assured entrance into heaven. Several are babies, including one considered the smallest mummy in the world. Two of these small bodies were partially embalmed by taking out internal organs and replacing the cavities with packing material. One was a fetus, which probably miscarried at about 24 weeks, and the other is a newborn male infant. This embalming process may have enhanced the natural mummification process but was not the cause. It is not known why these had been embalmed, nor are their years of death exactly known. There is a mummy of a woman who died in childbirth or miscarriage (a dried placenta is attached to her) but it is not known if she is the mother of either of these mummified children.|$|E

This exhibition was created by Tomasz Pietrasiewicz, the director of The Grodzka Gate – Theater NN Center.

The idea of the project was born when one of the survivors noticed that Majdanek Museum does not inform the visitors and does not show them the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> camp.

The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. [...] In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species. [...] It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.

2500|$|In 2007, the British-based Internet Watch Foundation {{reported}} that child pornography on the Internet {{is becoming more}} brutal and graphic, {{and the number of}} images depicting violent abuse has risen fourfold since 2003.

[...] About 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abusive images are female, and 91 percent appear to be {{children under the age of}} 12. Prosecution is difficult because multiple international servers are used, sometimes to transmit the images in fragments to evade the law. Some child pornographers also circumvent detection by using viruses to illegally gain control of computers on which they remotely store child pornography. In one case, a Massachusetts man was charged with possession of child pornography when hackers used his computer to access pornographic sites and store pornographic pictures without his knowledge. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has ruled that if a user downloads child pornography from a file sharing network and possesses it in his [...] "shared folder" [...] without configuring the software to not share that content, he can be charged with distributing child pornography.|$|E
