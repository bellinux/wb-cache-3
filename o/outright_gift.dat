2500|$|Where {{property}} passes between individuals, English law {{presumes that}} the relationship between them makes it an <b>outright</b> <b>gift,</b> and thus not subject to a resulting trust in the event of failure; this is the [...] "presumption of advancement". A presumed resulting trust occurs where the transfer fails, {{and there is no reason}} to assume it was intended as an <b>outright</b> <b>gift.</b> With some relationships, such as property transfers between father and son and husband and wife, this presumption of advancement is applied by default, and requires strong evidence for it to be rebutted. Presumed resulting trusts do arise, however, in one of three situations: where it is a voluntary gift, where there is a contribution to purchase price, and where the presumption that it was an <b>outright</b> <b>gift</b> can be rebutted. Rules differ for transfers and gifts of personal property and land; while personal property is assumed by default to create a resulting trust, Section 60(3) of the Law of Property Act 1925 prevents the creation of automatic resulting trusts. It does not comment on presumed resulting trusts, and while later law has seemingly permitted such trusts, there is some disagreement.|$|E
2500|$|Presumed {{resulting}} trusts do arise, however, in one {{of three}} situations; where it is a voluntary gift, where there is a contribution to purchase price, and where the presumption that it was an <b>outright</b> <b>gift</b> can be rebutted. Where a gift is voluntary, the assumption for personal property is that it creates a resulting trust on failure, as in Re Vinogradoff. For real property, Section 60(3) of the Law of Property Act 1925 prevents the creation of automatic resulting trusts, but does not comment on presumed trusts. In Hodgson v Marks, it is generally agreed that a presumed resulting trust was created over a transfer of real property, although there is some dispute. Where a person contributed to the price of a piece of property, they are presumed to take an equivalent equitable interest in that property; this is the [...] "clearest form of presumed resulting trust", and was recognised by both Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank and Megarry in Vandervell (No. 2). These principles originated with Eyre CB's judgment in Dyer v Dyer, where he said that: [...] Thus, where a person contributes to the purchase of the property, they will receive an equivalent equitable interest in any resulting trust that arises. For trusts over homes, a distinct set of rules have arisen that do not apply to other land, because of the additional concerns. For example, while contributing to the mortgage will create an equitable interest, as in Lloyds Bank v Rosset, contributing to domestic expenses will not, as in Burns v Burns. It must also be demonstrated that the contribution was not made for any purpose other than acquiring an equitable interest; in Sekhon v Alissa, for example, a mother transferred a house into her daughter's name to avoid capital gains tax. The court ruled that this created a resulting trust; because tax avoidance was the main objective, the mother could not possibly have intended it to be an <b>outright</b> <b>gift.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The last {{situation}} where a {{presumed resulting trust}} is created is if the court can rebut the presumption of an <b>outright</b> <b>gift.</b> The general philosophy here was set out by James LJ in Fowkes v Pascoe, and is that the judge should base his decision on [...] " [...] story as to how I came to have , and judge that story {{with reference to the}} surrounding facts and circumstances". Where the property is money held in a joint bank account, the presumption {{is that it is a}} joint tenancy of that account. As such, when one dies the property is passed absolutely to the other, as in Marshall v Crutwell. This presumption can be rebutted in several situations. It will be rebutted when the account, while in the name of both the husband and wife, is used exclusively for the husband's personal use, as in Young v Sealey, or where the joint account exists solely so the husband can guarantee the wife's account, as in Anson v Anson. Tax avoidance (which is legal, as opposed to tax evasion) frequently involves transferring property to a family member to avoid tax. Where the family member refuses to transfer it back, the taxpayer can come to court and argue it was a resulting trust.|$|E

The officers' homesteads would be located in the same part of the province as the soldiers whom the officer would command in battle, often close to the rote.

40|$|This study {{represents}} a {{first attempt to}} map the almost unexplored territory of legacy societies in planned giving. Existing literature has not examined planned gifts {{through the lens of}} legacy societies. This study thus represents the first systematic data collection and analysis of planned gifts made to higher education institutions in the U. S. The study first reviewed charitable bequests received by the top 120 U. S. higher education institutions in the fiscal year of 2014 and examined the basic characteristics of their legacy societies. This list of 120 institutions is based on data from the 2014 Digest of Education Statistics, which is issued by the National Center for Education Statistics at the U. S. Department of Education. Data on charitable giving and bequests came from the Voluntary Support of Education survey by the Council for Aid to Education. Information on university legacy societies was collected from universities' websites, brochures, and newsletters. This study then examined data on planned gifts and donors from five case-study universities located in different geographic regions in the U. S. We received data between the summer of 2014 and the fall of 2015 from these five universities. The sample includes data on planned gifts made from 1972 to 2015 (the exact range varies by university). The combined data set contains both donor-level and gift-level informationfor example, age, graduation class and residence of donor, amount and type of planned gifts, and year when the gift was made (or announced to the university). In addition to this common set of data, each university also has some additional, unique data offering rich information on donors (such as gender, marital status, and degree) or gifts (such as restrictions of <b>gifts</b> or <b>outright</b> <b>gifts</b> made by planned giving donors). Further, one university has information on both legacy society members and non-members. Compared with survey data or tax records, this sample has unique advantages, capturing both the trend in planned gifts over time and detailed information on each gift and donor. The uniqueness of the data in this study offers a great opportunity to explore planned giving behavior among actual donors. The analysis here includes bequest intentions, realized bequests, and deferred gifts because the data often do not contain enough detailed information allowing a clear separation of these types of planned gifts...|$|R
