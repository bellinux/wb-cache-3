5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|Owsley's {{political}} career began in 1809 {{when he was}} elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, serving one term. Governor Charles Scott appointed him to the Kentucky Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> 1810, where he served alongside his teacher, John Boyle. Soon after Owsley's appointment, the legislature reduced the number of justices on the court, and Owsley resigned his seat. He was elected to the state House again in 1811. When a vacancy on the Court of Appeals occurred in 1813, Governor Isaac Shelby re-appointed Owsley to the court.|$|E
50|$|Judicial appeals {{were heard}} by Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary and Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> {{under the age}} of seventy-five. Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were {{entitled}} to emoluments. Thus, Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary ceased to be paid at the time they ceased to hold office and became Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal.</b> The Senior Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary received £185,705 as of 2009 (the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales was the only judicial figure who received a higher salary). The other Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary received £179,431.|$|R

50|$|The Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary {{were joined}} by the Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal,</b> who include members of the House of Lords, not {{necessarily}} created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, who held or had held high judicial office. Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> retained their titles for life but were incapable of hearing cases {{after the age of}} 75. Only Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary received salaries: in 2004, the salary for the Senior Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary was £185,705, and for other Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary it was £179,431.|$|R
5|$|Ronnie Lee Gardner (January 16, 1961 – June 18, 2010) was an American {{criminal}} {{who received}} {{the death penalty for}} murder in 1985, and was executed by a firing squad by the state of Utah in 2010. Gardner's case spent nearly 25years in the court system, prompting the Utah House of Representatives to introduce legislation to limit the number <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> capital cases.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 trial {{defendants}} {{appealed to}} the Second Circuit Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> 1950. In the appeal they raised issues {{about the use of}} informant witnesses, the impartiality of the jury and judge, the judge's conduct, and free speech. Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues: they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|Until 2004, New Jersey {{permitted}} in-state wineries {{to directly}} ship products to in-state customers. The state {{did not allow}} out-of-state producers to ship to New Jersey residents or permit New Jersey wineries to ship to out-of-state customers. This practice was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 in a case from Michigan. New Jersey's statute was subsequently struck down by the Third Circuit Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> 2010 because such limitations were held to violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
50|$|The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Chancery {{was created}} in 1851 to hear <b>appeals</b> <b>of</b> {{decisions}} made by the Vice Chancellors and the Master of the Rolls in Chancery Court. The <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> the court were heard by the Lord Chancellor and two Lords Justices <b>of</b> <b>Appeal.</b> Cases from the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Chancery could be further appealed to the House of Lords. Prior {{to the creation of}} the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Chancery, the Lord Chancellor of the Chancery Court heard <b>appeals</b> as part <b>of</b> the Chancery Court caseload. The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Chancery became part of England's Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal,</b> which was established later in the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary {{held the}} rank of Baron and seats in the House for life. Under the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 they ceased to be Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary {{at the age of}} seventy, but could be {{permitted}} by ministerial discretion to hold office as late as age seventy-five. The original Act provided for the appointment of only two Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary, but as of 2009 twelve could be appointed; this number could have been further raised by a Statutory Instrument approved by both Houses of Parliament. Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were, by custom, appointed to the Privy Council if not already members. They served on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which is the highest court <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> certain cases. Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were often called upon to chair important public inquiries, such as the Hutton inquiry.|$|R
50|$|The {{judicial}} functions {{could also}} be exercised by Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> (other members <b>of</b> the House who happened to have held high judicial office). No Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary or Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> could sit judicially beyond the age of seventy-five. The judicial business of the Lords was supervised by the Senior Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary and their deputy, the Second Senior Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary.|$|R
5|$|Cristina {{had not yet}} {{graduated}} {{when they}} moved to Río Gallegos, and completed the remaining subjects with distance education. There have been claims made that she never graduated, and {{that she may have}} worked as a lawyer without having a degree. This idea was proposed by the constitutionalist Daniel Sabsay, and fueled by the reluctance of the National University of La Plata (UNLP) to release her degree. She registered at the Tribunal Superior de Justicia of Santa Cruz in 1980, the Comodoro Rivadavia's chamber <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>in</b> 1985, and worked as an attorney for the Justicialist Party in 1983. There are also logs of minor cases where she acted as a lawyer. The claim has been sent to trial four times, and the judges Norberto Oyarbide, Ariel Lijo, Sergio Torres, and Claudio Bonadio all ruled that she has a degree.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Abu-Jamal was punished with solitary {{confinement}} {{for engaging in}} entrepreneurship contrary to prison regulations. Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary , which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons. In litigation before the US Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals,</b> <b>in</b> 1998 he successfully established his right to write for financial gain in prison. The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his mail {{in an attempt to}} establish whether he was writing for financial gain.|$|E
5|$|In June 2001, the Brussels Correctional Court {{declared}} itself incompetent to {{hear the}} case, as it related to political misconduct. In February 2003, the Brussels Appellate Court followed and gave a similar judgement. The original plaintiffs then appealed, and the case {{was sent to the}} Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Ghent, which upheld the complaint; the Vlaams Blok non-profit organisations were fined, and it was deemed that the Vlaams Blok was an organisation that sanctioned discrimination. The Vlaams Blok lodged an appeal which was rejected, and in November 2004, the ruling was made definite, when it was upheld by the Court of Cassation. The ruling meant that the party would lose access to state funding and access to television, effectively shutting the party down.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} senior Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were {{designated}} the Senior and Second Senior Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary respectively. The Senior Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary historically was the Law Lord who was senior {{by virtue of}} having served in the House for the longest period. With the appointment of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in 2000, however, it became an appointed position.|$|R

50|$|On 1 October 1996, he was {{appointed}} Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary and additionally a life peer with the title Baron Clyde, of Briglands in Perthshire.

5|$|Taft {{was born}} in Cincinnati in 1857. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of War. William Taft {{attended}} Yale {{and was a member}} of Skull and Bones secret society like his father, and after becoming a lawyer was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named Solicitor General and as a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals.</b> <b>In</b> 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.|$|E
5|$|The {{amendment}} defined pornography as a {{civil rights}} violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered {{the wording of the}} ordinance to be too vague. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of the ordinance by voter initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} appealed and {{heard by the}} Second Circuit Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Manhattan on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the {{herbicides}} contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were {{not intended to be}} used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.|$|E
50|$|Two of the Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary were {{designated}} the Senior and Second Senior Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary.

On 12 March 1971, {{he was appointed}} Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> Ordinary and was made a life peer with the title Baron Cross of Chelsea, of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. He retired as Lord <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>in</b> 1975, upon reaching fifteen years of judicial service.|$|R
5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|When Flem D. Sampson {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1927, he appointed Willis {{to fill his}} seat on the Kentucky Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals.</b> <b>In</b> 1928, Willis was elected to a full four-year term representing the Court's Seventh Appellate District. Holding a state-level office increased his political stature, as did revising Thornton on the Law of Oil and Gas, a six-volume law reference, during his time on the bench. His political image was not badly tarnished when he lost his seat on the court to Alex Ratliff during the Democratic surge that swept Franklin D. Roosevelt into the presidency in 1932. Following this defeat, {{he returned to his}} private practice.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Albany, New York, Hand majored in {{philosophy}} at Harvard College and graduated with honors from Harvard Law School. After a short career as a lawyer in Albany and New York City, he was appointed {{at the age of}} 37 as a Federal District Judge in Manhattan in 1909. The profession suited his detached and open-minded temperament, and his decisions soon won him a reputation for craftsmanship and authority. Between 1909 and 1914, under the influence of Herbert Croly's social theories, Hand supported New Nationalism. He ran unsuccessfully as the Progressive Party's candidate for Chief Judge of the New York Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> 1913, but withdrew from active politics shortly afterwards. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge promoted Hand to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which he went on to lead as the Senior Circuit Judge (later retitled Chief Judge) from 1939 until his semi-retirement in 1951. Scholars have recognized the Second Circuit under Hand as one of the finest appeals courts in the country's history. Friends and admirers often lobbied for Hand's promotion to the Supreme Court, but circumstances and his political past conspired against his appointment.|$|E

5|$|Following the marriage, {{there was}} a period of {{consolidation}} taking the form of a series of statutes of the Reformation Parliament aimed at finding solutions to any remaining issues, whilst protecting the new reforms from challenge, convincing the public of their legitimacy, and exposing and dealing with opponents. Although the canon law was dealt with at length by Cranmer and others, these acts were advanced by Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Audley and the Duke of Norfolk and indeed by Henry himself. With this process complete, in May 1532 More resigned as Lord Chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry's chief minister. With the Act of Succession 1533, Catherine's daughter, Mary, was declared illegitimate; Henry's marriage to Anne was declared legitimate; and Anne's issue was decided to be next in the line of succession. With the Acts of Supremacy in 1534, Parliament also recognised the King's status as head of the church in England and, with the Act in Restraint <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> 1532, abolished the right of appeal to Rome. It was only then that Pope Clement took the step of excommunicating Henry and Thomas Cranmer, although the excommunication was not made official until some time later.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Collins won the Democratic {{nomination}} for Clerk of the Kentucky Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>in</b> a five-way primary. In the general election, she defeated Republican Joseph E. Lambert {{by a vote}} of 382,528 to 233,442. During her term, an amendment to the state constitution changed the name of the Court of Appeals to the Kentucky Supreme Court; Collins was the last person to hold the office of Clerk of the Court of Appeals and the first to hold the office of Clerk of the Supreme Court. As Clerk, she compiled and distributed a brochure about the new role of the Supreme Court, and worked with the state department of education to create a teacher's manual for use in the public schools, detailing the changes effected in the court system {{as a result of the}} constitutional amendment. The Woodford County chapter of Business and Professional Women chose Collins as its 1976 Woman of Achievement, and in 1977, Governor Julian Carroll named her Kentucky Executive Director of the Friendship Force.|$|E
