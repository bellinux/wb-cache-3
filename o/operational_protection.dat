The energy stored in the magnet system at 7 TeV/c will exceed 10 GJ. In order to avoid damage of accelerator equipment, complex machine protection systems are required. Magnet protection and powering interlock systems must be operational already before commissioning the magnet powering system.

40|$|Ideally, a {{statistically}} {{representative sample of}} measured high-resolution wind profiles with wavelengths as small as tens of meters is required for assessment of launch vehicle ascent flight systems component capability and vehicle operability for a selected launch site. At most potential launch sites a sample of high-resolution measured wind profiles may not exist. Representative samples of Rawinsonde wind profiles {{are more likely to}} be available because of the extensive network of measurement sites established for routine measurements at 12 -hr intervals in support of national and international weather observing and forecasting activity. Such a sample, although large enough to statistically represent relatively large wavelength perturbations, would be inadequate for launch system design assessment applications because the Rawinsonde system can accurately measure wind perturbations with wavelengths no smaller than 2000 m (1000 m altitude increment). Wavelengths less than 2000 m in the raw Rawinsonde data, which tend to be dominated by un-damped spurious balloon motion and radar tracking system noise, are filtered within the data processing scheme. The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Jimsphere wind profiles (150 /month and seasonal pairs) are the only adequate high resolution (approximately 150 to 300 m effective resolution, but over-sampled at 25 m intervals) data that have been used extensively in launch vehicle design, operability assessments and <b>operational</b> <b>protection</b> of vehicle systems for wind perturbation uncertainty. Jimsphere wind profiles have been measured at a few other potential launch sites but the number of profiles is relatively small and the samples are not statistically representative of the site dependent wind profile variability. A simulation process has been developed for enhancement of measured low-resolution Rawinsonde profiles that {{are more likely to be}} available in the vicinity of potential launch sites and are {{a statistically}} representative sample of wind profile perturbation wavelengths greater than 2000 m.

40|$|Understanding the {{financial}} value resulting from IS security investments {{is critically important}} to organizations focused on protecting service confidentiality, integrity, and availability {{in order to preserve}} firm revenues and reputations. Quantifying {{the financial}} effect from IS security investments is difficult to derive. This study investigated the relationship between e-banking investments in IS security and their market value impacts. Using an event study approach, the author captured e-banking firm specific data and isolated the IS security effect through the measured change in market values. The author hypothesized that announcements of IS security investments would result in statistically significant changes in market values. The author also hypothesized two sub-segments of the selected security investment data, technology and people, would support statistically significant changes in the market values of e-banking service providers. The hypotheses were tested by measuring stock market reactions to the IS security announcements selected from an eight-year period (2003 - 2010). Study findings indicated statistically significant market reactions for e-banking firms making IS security investment announcements and suggested that investors rewarded IS security technology investments more highly than e-banking firms making IS security people-focused investment announcements. The author concluded that because investors understand that mandatory regulatory compliance represents an e-banking firm 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to creating a secure computing environment, e-banking information systems are perceived as secure therefore, disclosing IS security investments results in weak changes to market values. Ultimately effective management of IS security requires acceptance of the idea that it is not technically feasible or financially viable to implement protections for all identified IS security risks therefore IS security investments must be effectively measured and risk levels consciously selected in order to implement the right technical and <b>operational</b> <b>protections</b> to support a firm 2 ̆ 7 s selected risk posture.

40|$|Modernization of the {{historical}} building’s interior entails {{the need to take}} many decisions, often conflicting. <b>Operational</b> requirements, <b>protection</b> of the architectural heritage, fire-safety recommendations, construction regulations, all these aspects involve a whole set of problems that require a rational solution, respecting ambient architectural and historical value, as well as the needs arising from the planned transformation. Respecting complex spatial relationships, the introduction of the contemporary architectural means into the historic building requires custom design solutions. The method adopted to solve design problems rely on restoring the original technical solutions, based on an analysis of constructional elements of the original structure. The paper describes methods and means used during the adaptation and renovation process of several interiors, both in design and construction domains. A tissue of a historical building required a special approach to these tasks, with special emphasis on good recognition of problems, careful planning and consistent implementing of proper solutions. An additional factor affecting the quality of the solutions is the planned building’s function. Its occupancy and the complexity of the carried out processes substantially affect the ability of its adaptation.

The introduction describes the suits and presents goals of several experiments performed with them. The first chapter provides background {{information about the}} dynamic radiation environment experienced at ISS and summarized radiation health and protection requirements for activities in low Earth orbit. Supporting studies report the development and application of a computer model of the EMU space suit {{and the difficulty of}} shielding EVA crewmembers from high-energy reentrant electrons, a previously unevaluated component of the space radiation environment. Chapters 2 through 6 describe experiments that evaluate the space suits' radiation shielding characteristics. Chapter 7 describes a study of the potential radiological health impact on EVA crewmembers of two virtually unexamined environmental sources of high-energy electrons-reentrant trapped electrons and atmospheric albedo or "splash" electrons. The radiological consequences of those sources have not been evaluated previously and, under closer scrutiny. A detailed computational model of the shielding distribution provided by components of the NASA astronauts' EMU is being developed for exposure evaluation studies. The model is introduced in Chapters 8 and 9 and used in Chapter 10 to investigate how trapped particle anisotropy impacts female organ doses during EVA.

Since a crew personnel dosimeter {{does not make}} direct measurement of effective dose, {{it has been estimated}} with skin-dose measurements and radiation transport codes for ISS and STS missions. The Phantom Torso Experiment (PTE) of NASA s <b>Operational</b> Radiation <b>Protection</b> Program has provided the actual flight measurements of active and passive dosimeters which were placed throughout the phantom on STS- 91 mission for 10 days and on ISS Increment 2 mission. For the PTE, the variation in organ doses, which is resulted by the absorption and the changes in radiation quality with tissue shielding, was considered by measuring doses at many tissue sites and at several critical body organs including brain, colon, heart, stomach, thyroid, and skins. These measurements have been compared with the organ dose calculations obtained from the transport models. Active TEPC measurements of lineal energy spectra at the surface of the PTE also provided the direct comparison of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) or trapped proton dose and dose equivalent. It is shown that orienting the phantom body as actual in ISS is needed for the direct comparison of the transport models to the ISS data. One of the most important observations for organ dose equivalent of effective dose estimates on ISS is the fractional contribution from trapped protons and GCR. We show that for most organs over 80 % is from GCR. The improved estimation of effective doses for radiation cancer risks will be made with the resultant tissue weighting factors and the modified codes...|$|R
