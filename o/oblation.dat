25|$|Europe's {{cultural}} makeover {{marked a}} period of significant innovation for adoption. Without support from the nobility, the practice gradually shifted toward abandoned children. Abandonment levels rose {{with the fall of}} the empire and many of the foundlings were left on the doorstep of the Church. Initially, the clergy reacted by drafting rules to govern the exposing, selling, and rearing of abandoned children. The Church's innovation, however, was the practice of <b>oblation,</b> whereby children were dedicated to lay life within monastic institutions and reared within a monastery. This created the first system in European history in which abandoned children did not have legal, social, or moral disadvantages. As a result, many of Europe's abandoned and orphaned children became alumni of the Church, which in turn took the role of adopter. <b>Oblation</b> marks the beginning of a shift toward institutionalization, eventually bringing about the establishment of the foundling hospital and orphanage.|$|E

50|$|The Vedic text Satapatha Brahmana {{defines a}} {{sacrifice}} {{as an act}} of abandonment of something one holds of value, such as <b>oblations</b> offered to god and Dakshina (fees, gifts) offered during the yajna. For gifts and fees, the text recommends giving cows, clothing, horses or gold. The <b>oblations</b> recommended are cow milk, ghee (clarified butter), seeds, grains, flowers, water and food cakes (rice cake, for example). Similar recommendations are repeated in other texts, such as in the Taittiriya Shakha 2.10 of the Krishna Yajurveda).|$|R
25|$|Coulter sends men to get Lyra and Pan back, {{but they}} are saved by Gyptians, and begin living on their ship, the Noorderlicht. Lyra learns {{how to use the}} Alethiometer more proficiently than any adult, and is visited by the witch queen Serafina Pekkala who tells her where the General <b>Oblation</b> Board has taken the missing children. The next day, the Noorderlicht docks at Trollesund, where they are joined by Iorek and Lee Scoresby, an aeronaut.|$|E

25|$|She {{is taken}} to the General <b>Oblation</b> Board's {{facility}} in Bolvangar, where she is reunited with Roger. She is then brought to see Coulter, to whom she lies, saying she was forcibly taken from the apartment, and pretends she is unable to understand the Alethiometer. She then flees from Coulter, sets off a fire alarm and destroys the Intercision machine. With the facility in chaos, the children escape outside. Meanwhile, Iorek and an army of witches led by Serafina destroy the facility.|$|E

In respect to the adhyatma paksha, the Prajapati-Agni, or the Purusha, the Creator, is the Ashva; He is the same as the Varuna, the Most Supreme. The word medha stands for homage; it later on became synonymous with <b>oblations</b> in rituology, since <b>oblations</b> are offered, {{dedicated}} to the one whom we pay homage. The word deteriorated further when it came to mean 'slaughter' or 'sacrifice'.|$|R

25|$|When the {{war ended}} in 1945, the {{buildings}} intended to be {{the homes of the}} College of Law and the College of Liberal Arts were left with extensive damages. The university administration led by UP President Bienvenido Gonzales sought a grant worth P13 million from the US-Philippines War Damage Commission to restore the damaged facilities and to construct new ones so that the transfer of the university from Manila to Diliman could be pushed through. Through a symbolic ceremony of transferring the <b>Oblation</b> from Manila to Diliman, the whole university's administration was relocated to the new campus. New buildings were constructed in response to the creation of more academic degrees.|$|E
25|$|In Karnataka, the {{preparation}} for the festival starts on the New Moon day of Bhimana Amavasya, five days prior to the festival day of Panchami. Girls offer prayers to the images made out of white clay painted with white dots. They take a vow by tying a thread dipped in turmeric paste on their right wrist and offer prayers. An image of snake is drawn {{on the floor in}} front of the house and milk is offered as <b>oblation.</b> On the night previous to the festival they keep complete fast or take a salt free diet. After the pooja, a food feast is held.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were usually}} one, or three, fires lit {{in the center}} of the {{offering}} ground. <b>Oblations</b> are offered into the fire. Among the ingredients offered as <b>oblations</b> in the yajna are ghee, milk, grains, cakes and soma. The duration of a yajna depends on its type, some last only a few minutes whereas, others are performed over a period of hours, days or even months. Some yajnas were performed privately, while others were community events. In other cases, yajnas were symbolic, such as in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad hymn 3.1.6, where [...] "the mind is the Brahmin of sacrifice" [...] and the goal of sacrifice was complete release and liberation (moksha).|$|R
5000|$|Verse 14 has {{multiple}} interpretations. K. V. Ramesh read a word {{used to describe}} Sallakshana as ejyagva, but this word has no meaning. Kishore Kunal read this word as rajyaddār ("one who has pleasing wives"). Ramesh translated {{the first part of}} the verse as [...] "He who is to be offered <b>oblations...</b> by the beautiful for the realization of their desires... himself by the worlds". Kishore Kunal reconstructs this part to mean that Sallakshana [...] "deserved <b>oblations</b> from handsome persons who concealed themselves from the world to oobtain desired things". The last part of the verse describes Sallakshana's residence as full of wealth and comforts, and where many sing his glory.|$|R

25|$|The {{substance}} of the Brahmana text varies with each Veda. For example, {{the first chapter of}} the Chandogya Brahmana, one of the oldest Brahmanas, includes eight ritual suktas (hymns) for the ceremony of marriage and rituals at {{the birth of a child}}. The first hymn is a recitation that accompanies offering a Yajna <b>oblation</b> to Agni (fire) on the occasion of a marriage, and the hymn prays for prosperity of the couple getting married. The second hymn wishes for their long life, kind relatives, and a numerous progeny. The third hymn is a mutual marriage pledge, between the bride and groom, by which the two bind themselves to each other. The sixth through last hymns of the first chapter in Chandogya Brahmana are ritual celebrations on the birth of a child and wishes for health, wealth, and prosperity with a profusion of cows and artha. However, these verses are incomplete expositions, and their complete context emerges only with the Samhita layer of text.|$|E
25|$|Muslim {{scholars}} {{were divided}} on the motives behind Cain's murder of Abel, and further why the two brothers were obliged to offer sacrifices to God. Some scholars believed that Cain's motives were plain jealousy and lust. Both Cain and Abel desired to marry Adam's beautiful daughter, Aclima (Aqlimia in Arabic). Seeking to end to the dispute between them, Adam suggested that each present an offering before God. The one whose offering God accepted would marry Aclima. Abel, a generous shepherd, offered the fattest of his sheep as an <b>oblation</b> to God. But Cain, a miserly farmer, offered only a bunch of grass and some worthless seeds to him. God accepted Abel's offering and rejected Cain's—an indication that Abel was more righteous than Cain, and thus worthier of Aclima. As a result, {{it was decided that}} Abel would marry Aclima. Cain, on the other hand, would marry her less beautiful sister. Blinded by anger and lust for Aclima, Cain sought to get revenge on Abel and escape with Aclima.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Coulter takes Lyra {{into her}} home, {{in a big}} city that resembles a retrofuturistic London, and starts taking her to socialite dinners and parties. In her bedroom, Lyra gazes upon the alethiometer and notices that it {{continuously}} points to a lady, a lightning bolt, and a baby. She does not {{know what to make of}} her observation, however, and says nothing of it to Mrs.Coulter. Despite initially projecting the image of a free-spirited woman, she reveals herself to be extremely respectful of the Magisterium and its function. One night, Lyra casually mentions Dust; this puts Mrs. Coulter on edge as she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she stop carrying around the bag secretly containing the aleithiometer. Mrs.Coulter's dæmon (a golden monkey) attacks Pantalaimon, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pantalaimon discover that Mrs.Coulter is head of the General <b>Oblation</b> Board, also known as the “Gobblers”, who have been kidnapping local children. Lyra also learns that her best friend Roger and her Gyptian friend Billy have been both taken by the Gobblers.|$|E
50|$|Human {{sacrifice}} and cannibalism are explicitly condemned in the Bhagavata Purana (5.26.31). The Chandogya Upanishad (3.16) {{states that the}} Purushamedha is actually a metaphor for life itself, and it compares the various stages of life to the <b>oblations</b> that are offered.|$|R
50|$|Me-Dam-Me-Phi {{is one of}} the {{important}} festivals observed by the Ahoms from very ancient times. The word ‘Me’ means offerings. ‘Dam’ means ancestors and ‘Phi’ means gods. So the word ‘Me-Dam-Me-Phi’ means <b>oblations</b> offered to the dead and sacrifices to gods.|$|R
50|$|The Upanishad {{states in}} chapter 2 {{that while some}} people do Prajapati rituals before commencing on renunciation, they should not.

500|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} some people perform the Prajapati ritual when they renounce, but {{this should not be}} done. A person should instead make an {{offering}} to Agni (fire) that is one's own vital breath. He should make the [...] "three-element offering", namely, to [...] "Sattva , Rajas [...] and Tamas [...] " [...] within. He should revere Prana (internal life force) because it is the yoni (womb, birthplace) of all fires. If he cannot obtain this fire, he should offer the <b>oblation</b> [...] "Om! I offer to all godheads, svaha" [...] with water as he begins the renunciation stage of life. As he offers this <b>oblation,</b> he should learn that the liberating mantra of Om is the three Vedas and the Brahman to be revered.|$|E
