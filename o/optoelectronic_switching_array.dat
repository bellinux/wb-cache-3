40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{features}} description of electronics switches for digital <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> and on the design of program for optimal calculation of switching points and the figure of switches in digital <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> investigation. The electronics switches types, used for time circuit separation, are described in the preamble. These switches are the base of digital <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> and in principal two types are defined: the switch S and switch T. The switch S allows the interconnection only of the same channel intervals from incoming circuit with random outgoing circuit. The switch S is being used in multistage <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> in combination with the switches T because it can not be used separately. The switch T allows exchanging the time position of incoming circuit to different time position of outgoing circuit depending on connection needs. The time switch can substitute the space switch under specific work conditions. In practice, the time switch with controlled reading and writing is used. The following part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the designs and calculations of optimal switching points of digital <b>switching</b> <b>array</b> which is the executive unit of switching systems. These systems directly interconnect the signals from digital multiplexes and make the basic assumptions for telecommunication networks integration. The digital <b>switching</b> <b>array</b> means the equipment which is able to connect the channels of digital multiplexes carrying the information in encoding form. The multiplexes are the most often with pulse coded modulation or adaptive delta modulation. The digital <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> are divided into the time and space one. The <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> of digital <b>switching</b> systems can be made by time <b>switching</b> <b>array</b> T whose realization is limited to specific capacity or by the connection of multistage arrays.
