5000|$|The soundtrack {{received}} generally favourable critical reviews. Philip French of The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented</b> that [...] "The {{music is}} subtly varied; the soundtrack makes admirable use {{of silence and}} natural sound." ...|$|R
2500|$|With the {{establishment}} of the British Raj in India, modern European cartographic traditions were officially employed by the British Survey of India (1767). One British <b>observer</b> <b>commented</b> on the tradition of native Indian cartography: ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the <b>Observers</b> <b>comment</b> on this {{development}} revealing that they planted the test answers for Danny to find, hoping {{it will change}} him. The Observers are convinced Danny will still become evil because he made the wrong decision, but Clockwork insists otherwise.|$|R
500|$|The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented,</b> [...] "...we have {{authors and}} musicians quite as talented as .... The subject of Thespis is unquestionably funny.... Mr. Arthur Sullivan has entered with heart {{into the spirit}} of Mr. Gilbert's fun, he has brightened it up with the most fanciful and {{delightful}} music".|$|R
5000|$|Jevan Brandon-Thomas wrote a {{pantomime}} version, Babbs in the Wood, for {{the amusement}} of the 1930 London cast and their friends. The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented,</b> [...] "It {{is quite clear}} that Mr Brandon-Thomas could earn a handsome living {{at any time in}} low - very low - comedy." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1995, a {{reporter}} for the St. Kitts and Nevis <b>Observer</b> <b>commented,</b> [...] "...he's one of those rare individuals who not only performs a public service...but also touches the lives of so many of us" [...] and, [...] "We are fortunate to have someone like Brother among us".|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, a {{manuscript}} changes between the initial draft and final publication. Naked writing [...] "exposes" [...] the author's work before these later phases. This is claimed to heighten {{the connection between}} the reader and the writer. In some cases the author modifies the work following <b>observer</b> <b>comments</b> and suggestions.|$|R
50|$|Rousseau's flat, {{seemingly}} childish {{style was}} disparaged by many critics; people often were shocked by his work or ridiculed it. His ingenuousness was extreme, {{and he always}} aspired, in vain, to conventional acceptance. Many <b>observers</b> <b>commented</b> that he painted like a child, but the work shows sophistication with his particular technique.|$|R
500|$|Regarding {{his career}} in the House of Representatives, an <b>observer</b> <b>commented</b> that Calhoun was [...] "the most elegant speaker that sits in the House... His {{gestures}} are easy and graceful, his manner forcible, and language elegant; but above all, he confines himself closely to the subject, which he always understands, and enlightens everyone within hearing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Quincy (played by Michael K. Williams) is a SWAT sniper. He largely {{acts as an}} <b>observer,</b> <b>commenting</b> on {{the action}} {{unfolding}} below to his spotter [...] "Johnny-Boy", who says little. Like LT Reubens, Quincy wears a U.S. Army Combat Infantry Badge on his body armor, with two stars, denoting service in two separate wars.|$|R

2500|$|A {{monument}} to Maya Plisetskaya was unveiled {{in the center}} of Moscow, on Bolshaya Dmitrovka, in the square named after her. The opening took place on November 20, 2016, the date of her birth, and shows her in a pose from [...] "Carmen". Describing the monument, one <b>observer</b> <b>commented</b> about sculpturist Viktor Mitroshin and the statue's design: ...|$|R
5000|$|Euan Ferguson of The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented,</b> [...] "The passive-aggressive {{golf game}} between 'old chums' Ollie and Ian had every twitch {{of the tension}} of an Ayckbourn endgame without the {{leavening}} humour, {{and this was a}} good thing: gripping, and I realise I am in terrible danger of saying that we've again got the finest TV in the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented</b> on defections of Haggis {{and actor}} Jason Beghe from Scientology, [...] "The {{decision}} of Beghe and Haggis to quit Scientology {{appears to have}} caused the movement its greatest recent PR difficulties, not least because of its dependence on Hollywood figures as both a source of revenue for its most expensive courses and an advertisement for the religion." ...|$|R
500|$|An <b>observer</b> <b>commented</b> that Byrne may {{not have}} been in the best of {{condition}} for the fight, as [...] "his appearance failed to favour the impression that he possessed active vigour"; boxing historian Gilbert Odd describes the fight as [...] "disgraceful". Another commentator noted that [...] "it is a singular fact that neither of the men had a black eye; neither had an external cut worth mentioning".|$|R
5000|$|A 2004 <b>observer</b> <b>commented</b> that Lindner's {{compositions}} {{are often}} [...] "buoyant, singable melodies enlivened by circular, interlocking rhythms that often coalesce, swell {{and burst into}} euphoric exclamations ...with a mesmerizing, transportive vibe that seamlessly reconciles elements of Afro-Cuban, modern and modal jazz with R&B, hip-hop and house music." [...] Between the release of Now Vs. Now's first and second albums, Lindner's compositions became influenced more by electronica.|$|R

5000|$|In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw {{observed}} that [...] "despite {{a bit of}} shortbread-sugary emotion and an ending that fizzles out disappointingly, there's some nice period detail and decent lines in Charles Dance's directing debut," [...] while Philip French of The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented</b> on the [...] "beautiful setting, a succession of implausible incidents, and characteristically excellent work from Smith (all suppression and stoicism) and Dench (exuding unfulfilled yearning)." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was soon}} cast {{in his first}} British movie, playing a murderous actor in Train of Events (1949). Critic C. A. Lejeune praised {{his work in the}} London <b>Observer</b> <b>commenting</b> that he [...] "adds good cheekbones to a quick {{intelligence}} and is likely to become a cult, I fear." [...] The Scotsman said [...] "he should be {{regarded as one of the}} most hopeful recruits to the British screen." ...|$|R
5000|$|The quintet {{has had a}} {{changing}} membership, but has primarily consisted of Howe, Quentin Collins (trumpet), Brandon Allen (tenor sax), Ross Stanley (piano) and Chris Hill (double bass). Jazz fusion musician Robert Wyatt has previously provided vocals to live performances. This Is It featured as The Guardians single of the week in November 2004, and The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented</b> on Howe's [...] "needle-sharp" [...] drum fills on the live Translation album.|$|R
50|$|Numerous Maine Republicans {{and local}} <b>observers</b> have <b>commented</b> on the {{inclusion}} of the preference ballots from the delayed caucuses.|$|R
500|$|The Times Literary Supplement {{observed}} in 1950 that [...] "while one might hesitate to attempt 'Lobster à la Enfant Prodigue' (with champagne, garlic, basil, lemon, chervil, mushrooms and truffles), the resourceful cook with {{time to explore}} London's more individual shops, and money, should not often be nonplussed." [...] The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented,</b> also in 1950, that the book deserved [...] "to become the familiar companion of all who seek uninhibited excitement in the kitchen." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the [...] "unsuprising" [...] {{closure of}} the Broadway run of the show, many <b>observers</b> <b>commented</b> that Newcastle or another venue in the UK would have been [...] "a more natural home" [...] for the show, which was [...] "a tough sell" [...] for the US. [...] "Tyneside accents {{and the decline of}} Britain’s {{industrial}} heartland aren’t naturally in the wheelhouse of Manhattan’s jewellery-rattling theatregoers." [...] Sting has been dismissive of the argument.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1915 Lester reprised his {{original}} {{role in a}} revival of The Arcadians, and among his most celebrated shows of the First World War years was a revue, The Bing Boys Are Here (1916) in which he and George Robey co-starred with Violet Lorraine. The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented,</b> [...] "Nothing so funny in revue has ever been seen in London … the three together are almost too much to endure for three hours".|$|R

500|$|Shostakovich's {{relationship}} with Stravinsky was profoundly ambivalent; {{as he wrote}} to Glikman, [...] "Stravinsky the composer I worship. Stravinsky the thinker I despise." [...] He was particularly enamoured of the Symphony of Psalms, presenting {{a copy of his}} own piano version of it to Stravinsky when the latter visited the USSR in 1962. (The meeting of the two composers was not very successful, however; <b>observers</b> <b>commented</b> on Shostakovich's extreme nervousness and Stravinsky's [...] "cruelty" [...] to him.) ...|$|R
5000|$|By January 2001, she {{had been}} {{diagnosed}} as suffering from clinical depression. A memoir, Shoot the Damn Dog (2008), a partial reference to Churchill's description of his depression as a [...] "black dog", recounts Brampton's experience of the condition and periods as an in-patient. The journalist Simon Garfield, writing for The <b>Observer</b> <b>commented</b> that [...] "her story is compelling and unflinching and she makes no claims that her descent and slow recovery will match those of others".|$|R

500|$|Political <b>observers</b> <b>commented</b> {{that the}} attacks on North Indians by MNS were a [...] "shrewd ploy" [...] of their chief Raj to embarrass the Shiv Sena and usurp its core Marathi constituency. They also felt Raj was trying to gain a {{political}} foothold by imitating his uncle and political mentor Bal Thackeray, who had headed the anti-South Indian campaign—"Lungi Bhagao, Pungi Bajao" [...] (throw out those who wear lungis, celebrate by blowing bugles)—during the formative years of the Shiv Sena in the 1960s.|$|R
2500|$|Penelope Gilliatt, who {{reviewed}} the film for The <b>Observer,</b> <b>commented</b> {{that it was}} [...] "an artistic micro-cosmos of the German situation from an East German perspective... Well photographed and better than it might have been." [...] Philip Oakes of The Sunday Telegraph opined that Naked Among Wolves was [...] "rough, gory and realistic, but above all meant to serve as entertainment", that it contained [...] "propaganda" [...] and was [...] "a violent variation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." ...|$|R
50|$|Outing {{has become}} {{relatively}} mainstream, and the journalistic rules regarding {{the disclosure of}} the sexual orientation of public figures is now largely in keeping with OutWeek’s original goals. For example, when publishing mogul Jann Wenner left {{his wife in the}} late 1990s, the Wall Street Journal reported on its front page - and without Wenner's permission - that he had moved in with his male lover. Many <b>observers</b> <b>commented</b> that such reporting would have been unthinkable before the outing controversy.|$|R
5000|$|Generally speaking, <b>observers</b> <b>commented</b> that Marn Grook was a {{football}} game which featured punt kicking and catching a stuffed [...] "ball". It involved large numbers of players, and games were played over an extremely large area. Totemic teams may have been formed; however, to observers the game appeared to lack a team objective, having no real rules, scoring or winner. Individual players who consistently exhibited outstanding skills, such as leaping high over others to catch the ball, were often commented on.|$|R
