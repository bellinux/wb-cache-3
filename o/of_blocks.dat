5|$|Knight Lore is a 1984 action-adventure game {{known for}} popularising {{isometric}} graphics in video games. The game {{was developed and}} published by Ultimate Play the Game and written by company founders Chris and Tim Stamper. In Knight Lore, the player character Sabreman has forty days to collect objects throughout a castle and brew a cure to his werewolf curse. Each castle room is depicted in monochrome on its own screen and consists <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> to climb, obstacles to avoid, and puzzles to solve.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While {{crossing}} a street a couple <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.|$|E
5|$|NY22 {{runs along}} South Catherine Street {{for a few}} blocks, then divides into one-way couplets {{for the first time}} since Westchester County, with {{northbound}} traffic moving a block to the east to follow Oak Street, while southbound traffic comes down North Catherine Street. It parallels US9 for a couple <b>of</b> <b>blocks,</b> intersecting NY3 (Cornelia Street) just a block west of its eastern terminus at that highway. After Boynton Avenue, the separate streets reunite and turns northwest just before it has its second and final exit with the Northway.

It is the third largest such district in the United States, and the largest preservation district featuring almost entirely Victorian architecture. It is also unique in {{that a majority of}} its structures are made of brick, and the neighborhood contains the highest concentration of residential homes with stained glass windows in the U.S. Many of the buildings are in the Victorian-era styles of Romanesque, Queen Anne, Italianate, among others; and a large number <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> have had few or no buildings razed.

5|$|Route177 {{began at}} {{a traffic light}} {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 206 {{in the city of}} Somerville. At the intersection, southbound traffic on Route206 had to use a jughandle to connect to Route177. The state highway went northeastward, progressing along as South Bridge Street through a curve. Heading northward, the route passed the Somerville Old Cemetery before intersecting with Fifth Street. There, state-maintenance ended, and the designation of Route177 terminated. Entering downtown Somerville, South Bridge Street continued northward into a large residential community. Passing to the east and west of several residential homes, South Bridge Street continued into the downtown portion, crossing the current-day Raritan Valley Line tracks maintained by New Jersey Transit and served the Somerville train station. After a couple <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> of residential homes and businesses, South Bridge Street came to an intersection with New Jersey Route 28, where it switched to North Bridge Street.|$|E

5|$|The High Line viaduct, then {{a portion}} of the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line, opened to trains in 1934. It {{originally}} ran from 34th Street to St. John's Park Terminal at Spring Street, and was designed to go through the center <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> rather than over the avenue. It connected directly to factories and warehouses, allowing trains to load and unload their cargo inside buildings. Milk, meat, produce, and raw and manufactured goods could be transported and unloaded without disturbing traffic on the streets. This also reduced the load for the Bell Laboratories Building (which has housed the Westbeth Artists Community since 1970), {{as well as for the}} former Nabisco plant in the Chelsea Market building, which were served from protected sidings within the structures.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{composed}} of six worlds with three levels each, totalling to 18 main levels. The objective of the main levels in each world is to collect four jet pods. Each final level of a world consists of a boss fight. The level designs vary from snow-capped mountains to carnivals. While most of the levels are large, outdoor excursions, two are enclosed within a narrow interior. The game features hidden bonus levels, which are triggered when secret entrances are found. Bonus levels consist <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> with balloons in them; popping the balloons yields either coins or power-ups. A time attack mode is available for any level the player has completed.|$|E

The rate of home ownership in the suburb was 46.9%—much higher than the national average of 31.0%. 25.4% of the households rented. Accommodation was mostly separate houses (64.2%), although the number of residences in the suburb has been increasing through conversion <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> to dual occupancy and other medium-density-type developments. Despite this, only 5.9% of residences were apartments or units, slightly {{less than half of the}} national average.|$|E
5|$|The {{upgraded}} engine offered better {{speed efficiency}} and new graphical features. While both the original Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider II used a grid system where developers could build the levels {{with a set}} <b>of</b> <b>blocks,</b> Tomb Raider IIIs system incorporated triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex architectural structures. The triangles also allowed developers to implement the game's quicksand and rippling water features. The dynamic lighting system was improved with coloured lighting and better water reflection, making Tomb Raider III more atmospheric than its predecessors. The team also implemented new weather effects such as rain, snow, and wind. The game features more particle effects, offering more realistic explosions and smoke. All the textures used in the game were drawn in true colour before being rendered by the graphics engine, resulting in a better output quality.|$|E

30|$|The number <b>of</b> similar <b>blocks</b> is an {{important}} factor on non-local image denoising problem, the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>block</b> matching in transform domain filtering is also critical in influencing the denoising performance. Romano and Elad [33] and Levin et al. [42] respectively analyzed the influence <b>of</b> <b>block</b> size on image block matching accuracy and denoising performance; they theoretically discussed the effect <b>of</b> <b>block</b> size on the accuracy <b>of</b> image <b>block</b> matching. In the classic BM 3 D algorithm, the size <b>of</b> the image <b>block</b> is fixed. However, for image blocks with different morphological components, using fixed block size could limit the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>block</b> matching results or the denoising ability. Actually, the bigger block size has the stronger denoising ability in advance <b>of</b> the accurate <b>block</b> matching; however, image blocks with contour component are difficult to get higher accuracy <b>of</b> <b>block</b> matching when bigger image blocks are used than those image blocks in smooth areas. So we had better use bigger blocks in smooth areas but smaller blocks in texture or contour areas. This is consistent with human visual perception, and inspired us to use different block size in block matching, according to different morphological components.|$|R
5|$|Although MalcolmX {{retained}} {{final approval}} of their hybrid text, {{he was not}} privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past MalcolmX,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of MalcolmX had begun well prior to his assassination.|$|E
5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up only a small number <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{scientist}} Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental {{investigations of}} crystal symmetry. Steno {{showed that the}} angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of {{a particular type of}} crystal, and René Just Haüy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> of the same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Haüy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schönflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.|$|E

5|$|The vimana, {{also called}} the cella, {{contains}} the most sacred shrine wherein resides {{the image of the}} presiding deity. The vimana is often topped by a tower which is quite different on the outside than on the inside. Inside, the vimana is plain and square, whereas outside it is profusely decorated and can be either stellate ("star-shaped") or shaped as a staggered square, or feature a combination of these designs, giving it many projections and recesses that seem to multiply as the light falls on it. Each projection and recess has a complete decorative articulation that is rhythmic and repetitive and composed <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> and mouldings, obscuring the tower profile. Depending on the number of shrines (and hence on the number of towers), the temples are classified as ekakuta (one), dvikuta (two), trikuta (three), chatushkuta (four) and panchakuta (five). Most Hoysala temples are ekakuta, dvikuta or trikuta, the Vaishnava ones mostly being trikuta. There are cases where a temple is trikuta but has only one tower over the main shrine (in the middle). So the terminology trikuta may not be literally accurate. In temples with multiple disconnected shrines, such as the twin temples at Mosale, all essential parts are duplicated for symmetry and balance.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the U.S. railroad system, natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of the refrigerator car. The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and were crude constructions holding up to 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of ice, on top of which the food was placed. It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> of ice in cars caused it to perish; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks, allowing the meat to breathe, while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car. After the Civil War, J. B Sutherland, John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars, which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool. This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods. Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car, which preserved foods even better. For much of the 19th century, the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines, which was a problem when the ice was continually melting; by the 1860s, refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process.|$|E
