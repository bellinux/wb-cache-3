5|$|Guepinia helvelloides is an edible, but bland, fungus. Older {{specimens}} {{are usually}} tough and indigestible. It {{can be used}} raw in salads, for pickling in vinegar and also for preserving in sugar like candied fruit. <b>One</b> <b>source</b> reports using it to prepare a wine by fermenting with wine yeast.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{reserves}} {{have been}} infamously estimated to last under 10 years by <b>one</b> <b>source</b> {{if the world}} population increases and demand grows.

5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to <b>one</b> <b>source,</b> he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, perhaps in the entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; another possibility is the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although <b>one</b> <b>source</b> claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, {{another possibility is that}} he was forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, it is apparent that about a decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E

5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; <b>one</b> <b>source</b> gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
50|$|The {{definition}} of macromarketing can vary depending upon <b>one’s</b> <b>source,</b> but macromarketing typically is differentiated by {{its focus on}} aggregations and systems, and the way marketing processes within them affect and are affected by those systems and the society in which they function.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>one</b> helper <b>source</b> coding problem posed and investigated by Ahlswede, Körner and Wyner. In this system, the error probability of decoding goes to <b>one</b> as the <b>source</b> block length n goes to infinity. This implies {{that we have}} a strong converse theorem for the <b>one</b> helper <b>source</b> coding problem. In this paper we provide a much stronger version of this strong converse theorem for the <b>one</b> helper <b>source</b> coding problem. We prove that the error probability of decoding tends to one exponentially and derive an explicit lower bound of this exponent function.

5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as {{the law of the}} land and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to <b>one</b> <b>source</b> is the closest system in the modern world to the form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E
