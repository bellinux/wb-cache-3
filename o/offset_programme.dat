Because of their appearance in the home pages, these programmes appear to be relevant as an offer from LSPs, thus placing it in category 1, but no shippers mention this general environmental practice as important for the business deal. On the contrary, the shippers in the two DHL relationships are aware of this environmental practice as offered by the LSPs but {{are not interested in}} it. One can perhaps question the value of the emissions <b>offset</b> <b>programmes</b> if the shippers do not want them. However, even though the case sample in this paper point towards uninterested shippers with regard to these programmes, other cases might show another situation.

40|$|In 2011, the UK {{government}} set {{in motion}} a process to establish a formal biodiversity <b>offsetting</b> <b>programme</b> in England, as an attempt to tackle biodiversity loss as a result of development. Drawing on critical approaches to the commodification of nature, this article traces the dilemmas encountered by the UK government in its endeavours to roll out a biodiversity <b>offsetting</b> <b>programme</b> in the English planning system. Based on 34 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, documentary analysis and participant observation at policy-focused events, the paper aims to show how the promise of reconciling development and conservation proved difficult to deliver. In government attempts to enrol sympathetic actors, disputes emerged over the purpose and fine detail of the proposals. Deeper tensions were revealed in clashes between governmental emphasis on deregulation and advocates’ calls for strong mandatory rules and well-resourced oversight, while efforts to balance complex ecology with market demands for simplicity and certainty undermined the promise of objective biodiversity metrics delivering uncontroversial hard numbers. Though the English case is in many ways context-specific, the problems experienced raise wider political questions around establishing meaningful offsetting schemes in any part of the world...|$|R

40|$|Local {{authorities}} (regions, departments, {{metropolitan areas}} and towns) are increasingly involved in defining and implementing policies to combat climate change. This {{is not a}} simple task, as beyond emissions generated by their administrative services, most greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in their territorial jurisdiction are beyond their direct control. Often given responsibility for the emissions of all actors within their administrative boundaries, different local authorities are often restricted in their ability to foster reductions through their attributed jurisdictional competencies. Faced with such limitations in fostering reductions, voluntary offsetting is one of the tools available to local authorities for reducing territorial emissions, by either purchasing carbon credits in order to offset emissions or by selling generating credits {{in order to create a}} source of financial income. Although the voluntary offset market is still small in comparison with the compliance market created by the Kyoto Protocol, market participants find it to be a more flexible, innovative and responsive framework. In exchange, average prices, which are determined on an over-the-counter basis, are usually lower than those for compliance credits. At the same time, the compliance and voluntary markets reveal very significant differences linked to the nature of the project. This Climate Report presents ten case studies in order to better understand how and why local authorities use this instrument. Analysing the offer, local authorities that sell carbon credits account for a very small percentage – just 3 % – of voluntary offset projects. Their typical profile is that of a US local authority, which is implementing a methane elimination project at its waste disposal site, primarily in order to anticipate future regulation and to obtain a source of additional financing. Local authorities’ share of the demand for voluntary credits is harder to quantify. The case studies nonetheless shed some light on the determining factor for a successful offset programme: namely a carefully designed project rooted in the local authority specific context and is shared by local players. In fact, the vast majority of local authorities prefer to buy carbon credits generated by projects implemented within their jurisdiction, in order to maximise other economic, social and environmental benefits than the simple reduction of GHG emissions. The choice of the financing vehicle (dedicated framework, tender or tax) depends on the size of the <b>offset</b> <b>programme</b> and on the type of projects targeted. It has no determining impact on the success and sustainability of the <b>offset</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|E

30|$|Outside {{the range}} of the initial practices, two LSPs offer {{emission}} <b>offset</b> <b>programmes,</b> where the customers can choose to pay (a low price) for the provider to invest in CO 2 -reduction programmes of different types. This is a quite explicit offering; however, it does not involve the providers’ business or activities as such. Furthermore, environmental education of the personnel in general, other than eco-driving, is also mentioned. Among the shippers, one additional requirement was identified, which challenged LSPs to adopt a more strategic and long-term view on greening their offerings.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{environmental}} practices identified {{as reflected in the}} offerings and requirements in these specific relationships, most of them fall into the initial ten categories of environmental practices identified in the frame of reference and confirmed by the home page scan (see Table  5). However, some of the practices within the pre-defined ten categories appear to be more specific than many of those identified on the home pages. Two examples are the change in pickup system and the milk-run project that fit into transport management. These environmental practices appear to be a result of the specific relationship and thus differ somewhat from those practices presented on LSPs’ or shippers’ home pages. Further, the cases offer additional environmental practices to the ten suggested in the frame of reference. Emission <b>offset</b> <b>programmes</b> (or the GoGreen concept) were identified in the home page scan as well. Interestingly, the cases confirm these <b>offset</b> <b>programmes</b> as belonging to the more general logistics market, since none of the shippers studied appear interested in including this environmental practice in their relationships with the LSP. In contrast, environmental competence at the LSP and environmental project appear to be of relevance in LSP–shipper relationships. Unlike emission offsets, these practices give more insight into the types of practices that can be reflected as parts of offerings and requirements in specific LSP-shipper relationships.|$|R

40|$|Carbon <b>offset</b> <b>programmes</b> are {{creating}} {{a new breed of}} forester. These are retail carbon offsetters who respond to opportunities to offset the carbon footprint of their lifestyle, for example travel, by paying for tree planting. This new cohort of de facto foresters act out of their green values and/or ecological awareness. However since modern silviculture is chemically based, the obverse of their carbon offsetting, is pesticide onsetting - consequently their “solution” is at best dirty green. Forestry standards, FSC, PEFC and SFI, are all very weak standards and allow pesticides and fertilizers. IFOAM previously rejected the adoption of an Organic Forestry Standard. Nevertheless, two organic certifiers have such standards: Debio and Naturland. The entry of retail carbon offsetting is an opportunity for the organic sector to revisit the challenges and opportunities of Certified Organic Forestry, to create a world’s next practice forestry...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the biodiversity <b>offsetting</b> <b>programme</b> for England {{initiated by the}} UK government in 2011 and abandoned in 2014. Offsetting enables developers to purchase biodiversity credits, representing conservation gain somewhere else, to compensate for residual loss on the development site, ensuring no net loss of biodiversity overall. Recent years have seen increasing interest globally in market-based instruments for nature conservation, which advocates promise will deliver win-win outcomes, facilitating economic growth and safeguarding of nature at the same time, through market efficiencies. Political ecologists, on the other hand, have long highlighted the contradictions encountered in efforts to commodify nature. Drawing on Marxist political ecologies and literature on the neoliberalisation of nature, this thesis examines why the UK government was unable to establish its proposed biodiversity <b>offsetting</b> <b>programme</b> in a particular geographical and historical setting, in a climate of fiscal austerity and growth-orientated deregulation. As the government attempted to enrol sympathetic actors, disputes soon emerged over the purpose and technical details of the proposals. Deeper tensions were quickly revealed: the government’s non-negotiable position that offsetting should impose no new costs on developers, {{that it should be}} voluntary and that no new resources would be provided for planning authorities administering the policy locally, meant that it could not convince offsetting’s advocates – let alone its detractors – that it would achieve either meaningful biodiversity outcomes. Nor could it stimulate a substantial offset market, which it hoped would lubricate the planning system and accelerate land development, which was its primary goal. The thesis explores how the government’s non-interventionist, strictly pro-growth conditions played out in different moments of the policymaking process. It argues that it was precisely offsetting’s appeal to government, predicated on its promise of a win-win for development and conservation, in a neoliberal world of limited and diminishing public resources, which undermined the possibility of its implementation. Though the English case is specific, the thesis concludes that this underlying tension appears politically hard-wired into the very concept of offsetting, raising questions over its meaningful implementation anywhere...|$|R

40|$|Organic farming was {{proposed}} in 1940 by Lord Northbourne {{as a response}} to chemical agriculture. Since then, organic agriculture has developed into an international A$ 50 billion industry with annual growth reported up to 30 %. Currently {{it is one of the}} fastest growing food sectors with demand exceeding supply in many markets, and price premiums averaging 80 % in Australia. With economic, and now environmental, incentives for planting trees, there is the opportunity, and even imperative, for a new silviculture category that embraces the precepts of organic agriculture. There are environmental, economic and ethical issues with carbon <b>offset</b> <b>programmes</b> that seek to reduce, or erase, the carbon footprint of an activity, while collaterally increasing the pesticide footprint; this may be a Faustian bargain. Certified Organic Forestry standards have made a tentative start with a modest uptake. Organic forestry offers a clean green, rather than a dirty green, option for carbon offsets, and can appeal to those inclined to a precautionary principle rather than a postcautionary principle approach. As consumers who are already familiar with the premises and promises of organic food and agriculture are attracted to carbon offsetting, this customer group has the potential to drive demand for Certified Organic Forestry. Moving beyond the current chemical forestry and silviculture standards to an organic silviculture presents a matrix of new opportunities, implications, impediments and even stakeholders...|$|R

Hydrological equations, precipitation and temperature data provided by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE) and the National Meteorological Institute (IMN) were analyzed using the Arcgis 10. 2 (ESRI, 2013) software program and digital atlas of 2008 and 2014 (Ortiz, 2008; Ortiz, 2014). The results show a moderately undulating topography and a low water supply that could affect the flow of the main channel of the river. However, since there isn’t a water balance deficit, this would benefit the operation of a possible flood scenario in the sub basin Telire River. Different scenarios show that the most affected area will be the forest coverage, especially the mature forest. Site B, with 30 m of height, is the one with higher water storage capacity while site C shows the higher water flow.

40|$|In post-Apartheid South Africa, the ANC Government {{faced the}} {{challenge}} of restructuring an unsustainably large defence sector. This was {{in the context of}} economic and social problems and a declining international arms market. This paper considers the restructuring of the South African industry over that period and more recently, providing a valuable case study of defence industrial restructuring in a small industrialised economy. It considers how the public sector (DENEL) and private sector responded to the cuts in defence spending and the impact of the Government’s decision to modernise the South African Defence Force through foreign procurement, the Strategic Defence Package (SDP) but with extensive offset deals. Within this context the prospects for the industry and the issues surrounding the privatisation of DENEL are considered. The SDP and its offset deals is seen to be continuing to have a considerable impact on the defence industry, but is of questionable value to the South African economy. While the defence projects seem to have some successes the experience of the non defence projects is poor and overall the value of the deals is nowhere near the promises made at the outset. Lack of transparency has created a environment where corruption was almost inevitable and successful industrial planning almost impossible.

40|$|Biodiversity offsets {{are part}} of a new suite of {{biodiversity}} conservation instruments designed to mitigate the impacts of economic developments on species, habitats and ecosystems. Led by an international collaboration of representatives from companies, financial institutions, governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the Business and Biodiversity <b>Offsets</b> <b>Programme</b> (BBOP) of the market-oriented Forest Trends group, has created a global framework through which principles and standards for biodiversity offsets are being established. These enable the apparently unavoidable harm caused by development to be exchanged for investment in conservation activities both at different geographical locations and in the future. Offsets can also be traded via bespoke markets for environmental conservation indicators. Given a globalizing ‘green economy’ discourse that conservation can be a profitable enterprise if guided by market-based mechanisms and the entwining of ecological with economic spheres, biodiversity offsets are becoming key to current entrepreneurial interest in biodiversity conservation. The ‘green rush’ of my title refers to both this interest in conservation activities that can be marketized, and to an associated appetite in business and financial sectors for incorporating biodiversity offsets as part of a strategy for ‘greening’ the environmental harm caused by developments. I illustrate the uses to which biodiversity offsets are being put, through a case study connecting the extraction of uranium in Namibia for the generation of nuclear power in the UK. Biodiversity offsets are invoked to satisfy requirements for off-site mitigation of environmental harm at points of both extraction and ‘consumption’ of uranium in this case.

40|$|The {{carbon market}} is touted as {{offering}} developing countries major new opportunities to achieve sustainable development while simultaneously helping {{the global community}} to combat climate change. The prospect is that implementing carbon <b>offset</b> projects and <b>programmes</b> can generate tradable carbon credits while simultaneously delivering development benefits to participating communities.

Based on focus group discussions, the paper conveys comments about this prospect and constraints to its realization from seasoned rural development practitioners in Madagascar and Mali who have shown interest in carbon project development. Their perspective is critical yet constructive, and could help guide reforms of existing carbon market instruments and the design of new climate finance mechanisms. It also provides a valuable contribution to ongoing debates regarding the potential significance of the carbon market for poor farmers.

30|$|Tropical forest {{conservation}} {{in developing countries}} has repeatedly been highlighted as a new element in international climate policy. However, no clear ideas yet exist as to what shape such a conservation strategy might take. In the present paper, {{we would like to}} make some observations to this end. It is shown how projects in order to reduce CO 2 -emissions resulting from deforestation and degradation (REDD) can be integrated into a system of tradable emission rights in an industrialised country and which requirements ought to be fulfilled. Instruments are emission credits and emission allowances. Driving actors interested in emission rights through forest projects may be private investors or the rainforest state itself. The efficiency of the system depends on a great extent on a binding reference path for the tolerable emissions from deforestation, which has been agreed upon and adhered to by the rainforest country by means of a forest law aimed at limiting deforestation. Our considerations lead us to conclude that the national baseline approach with an appropriate contribution by the rainforest country coupled with a decentralised system with private investors seems the most viable option. Since additional burdens are imposed on the rainforest country to some extent, a compromise could consist of agreeing on a moderate deforestation path, which is harmonised with the benefits from the forest projects. Combining both <b>programmes</b> (<b>offset</b> credits and emission allowances) is particularly attractive because all participants, and especially the industrialised country, benefit from it. The industrialised country can expand its climate conservation programme without any additional costs to a certain degree.|$|R
