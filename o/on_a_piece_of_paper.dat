5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the camera obscura that provides {{an image of a}} scene dates back to ancient China. Leonardo da Vinci mentions natural camera obscura that are formed by dark caves {{on the edge of a}} sunlit valley. A hole in the cave wall will act as a pinhole camera and project a laterally reversed, upside down image <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> So the birth of photography was primarily concerned with inventing means to capture and keep the image produced by the camera obscura.|$|E
25|$|Upon examination, the {{military}} surgeons determined that no one's neck {{had been broken}} by the fall. The manacles and cloth bindings were removed but not the white execution masks, and the bodies were placed into the pine coffins. The name of each person was written <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> by acting Assistant Adjutant R. A. Watts, and inserted in a glass vial, which was placed into the coffin. The coffins were buried against the prison wall in shallow graves, {{just a few feet}} from the gallows. A white picket fence marked the burial site. The night that she died, a mob attacked the Surratt boarding house and began stripping it of souvenirs until the police stopped them.|$|E
25|$|Upon this, {{there was}} a clamour among the crowds, and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was {{informed}} that the other party alleged {{that he was at}} odds with Islamic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs. Ghulam Ahmad wrote his beliefs <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and had it read aloud, but due to the clamour among the people, it could not be heard. Seeing that the crowd was drifting out of control and that violence was imminent, the police superintendent gave orders to disperse the audience, and the debate did not take place. A few days later, however, a written debate did take place between Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and Maulwi Muhammad Bashir of Bhopal, which was later published.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} {{suggestion}} for viewing randomness {{in terms of}} complexity was made by Leibniz in an obscure 17th-century document discovered after his death. Leibniz asked how one could know if a set of points <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> were selected at random (e.g. by splattering ink) or not. Given that for any set of finite points {{there is always a}} mathematical equation that can describe the points, (e.g. by Lagrangian interpolation) the question focuses on the way the points are expressed mathematically. Leibniz viewed the points as random if the function describing them had to be extremely complex. Three centuries later, the same concept was formalized as algorithmic randomness by A. N. Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin as the minimal length of a computer program needed to describe a finite string as random.|$|E
25|$|Ben Wysocki, {{a former}} bandmate of Isaac Slade, joined as drummer and later, Dave Welsh, who was another former bandmate of Slade and Wysocki, was added as lead guitarist to the band. The newly formed band {{was named the}} Fray. The band members decided on a name after asking people to put band names <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> from which they picked randomly. The members of the band first claimed that they found the name {{suitable}} because they frequently quarreled about {{the composition of the}} lyrics in their songs, but they have since stated they are usually on good terms while composing music and acknowledges contributions from all of its members. The band has had no permanent bassist since Caleb, instead employing touring bassists on a temporary basis. The current bassist is Jason Hardin, who has been touring with the band since 2014.|$|E
25|$|The Last Day of the Twelfth Moon; on {{this holiday}} ale and fruit were {{provided}} as offerings to {{the god of}} the stove, after having Buddhist or Taoist priests recite scripture at one's own home (if one had the wealth and means). Offerings were made to the stove god because it was his responsibility to make annual reports to heaven on the good deeds or sins committed by the family in question. A family would do everything to charm the god, including hanging a newly painted portrait of the god <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> above their stove on New Years, which hung in the same position for an entire year. It was a common practice to rub in some alcoholic beverage across the picture of the deities mouth, so that he would become drunk and far too inebriated to make any sort of reasonably bad or negative report about the family to heaven.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December, a message was intercepted by Indian Intelligence {{concerning}} a high-level meeting of the civilian administration in East Pakistan. A decision was then made to mount an attack. Within 15 minutes of the interception of the message, a strike was launched against Dhaka. Armed with tourist guide maps of the city, four Mig 21s of No. 28 Squadron became airborne. Only a few minutes had passed after the meeting had started when the IAF aircraft blasted the Governors House with 57mm. rockets, ripping the massive roof off the main hall and turning the building into a smoldering wreck. The Governor of East Pakistan, Mr. A. H. Malik, was so shocked after the incident that he resigned on the spot by writing his resignation <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> thereby renouncing all ties with the West Pakistani administration. He then took refuge at the InterContinental Hotel in Dhaka under UN flag.|$|E
25|$|Herbert and {{the author}} Thomas Nelson Page (a friend of Ezekiel's) visited with the {{sculptor}} in Washington, D.C., on November 5, 1910. Ezekiel expressed his intense desire to obtain the commission. Herbert, Page, and Ezekiel then visited the Confederate section at Arlington National Cemetery and discussed the size and placement of the memorial. Ezekiel sketched out his idea <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> for the two men. He also {{made it clear that}} he would work in Italy, and would not accept any design input from the ACMA. The following day, the design committee held an emergency meeting. Dr. McKim could not attend, but advised the committee that he approved of Ezekiel's selection. Mrs. Keith also could not attend, but offered no proxy. At the emergency meeting, Ezekiel outlined his proposal for the memorial: a heroic female figure symbolic of the South with a wreath in one hand and the other resting on a plow, standing atop a circular base around which figures representing the sacrifices of the South were grouped.|$|E
25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E

25|$|Lange {{began the}} new decade {{in the light}} romp How to Beat the High Co$t of Living (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, but it {{received}} mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, she was contacted by director Bob Rafelson regarding a project on which {{he was working with}} Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for Goin' South (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater, and has famously recounted how he watched the budding actress conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided that he had found the lead for his film. After his meeting with Lange, he wrote her name down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was absolutely right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic film noir, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981). Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope in which he had placed the piece of paper with her name on it. Although the controversial film received mixed reviews, Lange was widely praised for her performance.|$|E

500|$|Bryan Cranston {{plays the}} role of Shannon. He {{was one of the first}} actors Refn looked to cast, as he was a fan of the TV series Breaking Bad.
