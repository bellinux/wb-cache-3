Everyone one meets seems {{to be not only}} in good health but in training; one rarely meets fat people, bald people, or bent or grey. People who would be obese or bent and obviously aged on earth are here in good repair, and as a consequence the whole {{effect of a}} crowd is livelier and more invigorating than on earth. The dress is varied and graceful; that of the women reminds one most of the Italian fifteenth century; they have an abundance of soft and beautifully-coloured stuffs, and the clothes, even of the poorest, fit admirably. Their hair is very simply but very carefully and beautifully dressed, and except in very sunny weather they do not wear hats or bonnets. There is little difference in deportment between one class and another; they all are graceful and bear themselves with quiet dignity, and among a group of them a European woman of fashion in her lace and feathers, her hat and metal ornaments, her mixed accumulations of [...] "trimmings," [...] would look like a barbarian tricked out with the miscellaneous plunder of a museum. Boys and girls wear much the same sort of costume--brown leather shoes, then a sort of combination of hose and close-fitting trousers that reaches from toe to waist, and over this a beltless jacket fitting very well, or a belted tunic. Many slender women wear the same sort of costume. We should see them in it very often in such a place as Lucerne, as they returned from expeditions in the mountains. The older men would wear long robes very frequently, but the greater proportion of the men would go in variations of much the same costume as the children. There would certainly be hooded cloaks and umbrellas for rainy weather, high boots for mud and snow, and cloaks and coats and furry robes for the winter. There would be no doubt a freer use of colour than terrestrial Europe sees in these days, but the costume of the women at least would be soberer and more practical, and (in harmony with <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> the previous chapter) less differentiated from the men's.|$|E

40|$|We discuss higher loop {{corrections}} {{to gauge}} coupling renormalization {{in the context}} of gauge coupling unification via Kaluza-Klein thresholds. We show that in the case N= 1 supersymmetric compactifications the one-loop threshold contributions are dominant, while the higher loop correction are subleading. This {{is due to the fact}} that at heavy Kaluza-Klein levels the spectrum as well as the interactions are N= 2 supersymmetric. In particular, we give two different arguments leading to this result - one is field theoretic, while the second one utilizes the power of string perturbation techniques. To illustrate <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> we perform explicit two-loop computations of various corrections to gauge couplings within this framework. We also remark on phenomenological applications of <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> the context of TeV-scale brane world.

40|$|The {{modelling}} {{of learning}} processes {{and its use}} in computer-supported learning scenarios attracted attention {{in a wide variety}} of research fields in the last years, e. g. in web based education, computer supported collaboration scripts, and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). Most of the discussion is either focused on the conceptual level of instructional design for exchange between designers or at the automated execution of predefined designs and learning scripts. In this chapter we will elaborate on the whole spectrum of different uses that visual learning modells provide for teachers, learners, and researchers. Based on <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> an international research project we identify desired properties for such modelling languages especially considering the needs of the practitioners.

40|$|I {{argue that}} {{rejection}} of “God of the gaps ” argumentation deviates from {{the mode of}} normal scientific discourse, it assumes a view of his-tory which is incorrect, and it tacitly implies a naive optimism about the abilities of science. I encourage apologists to point out gaps of explanation in atheistic theories whereever they see them, and expect atheists to return the favor. I have read the ASA journal and participated <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> of science and Christianity for over 15 years now, and during this time, I have found that while ASA members disagree over many things, certain unquestioned points of agreement flow through all <b>our</b> <b>discussions.</b> <b>In</b> particular, I have found {{that no matter what}} the discussion, one common premise seems 1 to reign supreme. This is the universal condemnation of God-of-the-gaps arguments [1].

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} emerging themes {{related to}} design culture of ageing {{or in other}} words ageing as design culture. By looking into existing experiment and exploration practices from different countries on ageing and design, this paper summarizes outcomes from a full day international expert’s workshop. The main outcome {{is a need for}} a broader understanding of ageing that goes beyond the definition of ageing by means of age, deficits and needs. We introduce four main issues that emerged from <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> workshop {{on how to deal with}} ageing as a subject of design experiments. These four themes can be considered as initial steps for building a framework for design culture of ageing. A theoretical framework of design and ageing could help designers to better understand the dynamic interrelations and different states of ageing. This discussion further can open up new creative spaces related to ageing as design culture...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging technologies {{provide us with}} the unprecedented ability to interface directly with activity in the human brain. Beyond traditional neuroscience work, researchers have begun to explore brain imaging as a novel input mechanism. This work has largely been targeted at allowing users to bypass the need for motor movement and to directly control computers by explicitly manipulating their brain signals. In our work, we use brain imaging to passively sense and model the user’s state as they perform their tasks. In this workshop, we will discuss how we are using brain imaging to explore human cognition in the real world, to evaluate interface design, and to build interfaces that adapt based on user state. We will ground <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> user studies we have conducted to perform task classification while users perform various tasks. We will also provide lessons learned {{as well as a}} general methodology so that other HCI researchers can utilize these technologies in their work...|$|R

40|$|Widening access was a {{strategy}} aimed at transforming tertiary education {{to ensure that}} it was inclusive and could serve as a broad base for social redress. For this purpose, Higher Education introduced intervention measures aimed at facilitating access for students, representative of the country’s demographics as well as their successful completion of their studies. However concerns become apparent when one balances the successes against the widened access. Twenty years into the expected transformation, issues such as, the extent of student under-preparedness, low retention and graduation rates, high unemployment levels of certain categories of tertiary graduates mean the idea of inclusiveness needs to be interrogated. The aim of this paper was to reflect on reasons why widening access has not resulted in academic success. This reflective paper shows that success has been negatively affected by endemic challenges arising from two sectors of the education system. These challenges were summarized as issues surrounding secondary schooling and policies and attitude of HEIs, government and society to tertiary education. These concerns formed the focus of <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> the subsequent sections of the paper...|$|R
