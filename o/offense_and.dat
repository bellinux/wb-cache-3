Although fellow Kansas alum John McLendon actually invented the four corners offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of Basketball: Multiple <b>Offense</b> <b>and</b> Defense, which is the best-selling technical basketball book in history.|$|E

Crash <b>and</b> <b>offense</b> rates from the Michigan Driver Database from 2001 - 2005 of CDL drivers and non-CDL drivers were compared; crashes <b>and</b> <b>offenses</b> from 2006 - 2007 were compared across groups of CDL drivers based on their crash <b>and</b> <b>offense</b> records from 2001 - 2005; and driver records from the Michigan Driver Database were matched with CMV crash records from the Michigan Vehicle Crash data file from 2001 - 2005, to compare circumstances of CMV crashes of CDL drivers to those of drivers of CMVs {{that do not require}} a CDL. Previous <b>offenses</b> <b>and</b> crashes in CDL drivers’ records were reasonable indicators of future <b>offenses</b> <b>and</b> crashes. CDL drivers who had no crashes or no crashes or offenses in the prior period also had the lowest crash involvement for crashes of all severities in the after period. Among crash-involved CMV drivers, non-CDL holders had significantly higher rates of coded hazardous actions than CDL holders. They also had poor prior driving records in terms of prior <b>offenses,</b> serious <b>offenses,</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-related crashes. CDL holders had slightly higher average numbers of prior crash involvements. The findings of this research can be useful to the CDL program to identify critical safety factors, and to the trucking industry to improve driver hiring, training, and retention policies...|$|R
