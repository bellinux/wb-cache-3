5|$|The First Lady of the United States is {{the hostess}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> The {{position}} is traditionally filled by {{the wife of}} the President of the United States, but, on occasion, the title has been applied to women who were not presidents’ wives, such as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when {{the wife of the}} president was unable to fulfill the duties of the First Lady herself.
