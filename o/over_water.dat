5|$|A {{waterspout}} is a columnar vortex forming <b>over</b> <b>water</b> that is, in {{its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado <b>over</b> <b>water</b> that is connected to a cumuliform cloud.

5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over {{a body of}} water. Some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado <b>over</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Norman's upgrade into {{a tropical storm}}, a tropical storm warning was issued for the coast from Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo on September 20. The warning was dropped after Norman made landfall the next day. No additional warnings were issued upon Norman's reemergence <b>over</b> <b>water</b> because it was never expected to restrengthen.|$|E

5|$|Late on November6, Ida re-emerged <b>over</b> <b>water,</b> {{entering}} the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Upon moving back <b>over</b> <b>water,</b> the storm quickly began to redevelop, with convection increasing around {{the center of}} circulation. Early on November7, Ida restrengthened into a tropical storm as it tracked just west of due north. Very warm sea surface temperatures ahead of the system would have allowed for substantial intensification; however, wind shear over the area quickly increased, resulting in modest strengthening. Later that day, the storm turned northwestward {{in response to a}} strong trough over Mexico and a mid-level ridge extending from the Southeast United States to Hispaniola. As Ida neared the Yucatán Channel, an eye redeveloped and the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane. By the morning of November8, the storm had attained Category2 status with winds of 100mph (155km/h).|$|E
5|$|Later in the month, another storm {{similar to}} Bernice existed. Tropical Storm Claudia formed on September20 to the {{southwest}} of Acapulco. It maintained a general northwest movement for its duration. On September23, Claudia crossed over the western portion of the Baja California peninsula, moved <b>over</b> <b>water,</b> and again struck the peninsula before dissipating.|$|E

5|$|The {{category}} {{listed for}} each state indicates the maximum category of sustained winds that was recorded or analyzed {{to have occurred}} in that state.

5|$|Tropical Storm Christine {{originated}} from a tropical wave over Africa in late-August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned a tropical depression at 14.0°W, {{over the country}} of Guinea, on August25. The formation of this depression was farther east than any other tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic hurricane basin, although storms may have gone undetected {{prior to the start}} of satellite imagery in the 1960s. This record would not be approached by any other storm until Hurricane Jeanne in 1998, which formed at 17.4°W. This was unlike most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles <b>over</b> <b>water</b> before spawning a depression. Tracking nearly due west, the depression moved <b>over</b> <b>water</b> several hours later and bypassed the Cape Verde Islands on August 27.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Bess, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Susang, was {{responsible}} for the disappearance of a United States Air Force weather reconnaissance aircraft. Developing out of a poorly organized system on October8 to the east of the Philippines, Bess featured two centers of circulation. Initially the southern low was monitored; however, a low to the north soon became the dominant center. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the storm gradually intensified before striking northern Luzon as a minimal typhoon on October11. Temporary weakening took place due to interaction with land. After moving back <b>over</b> <b>water</b> the following morning, Bess regained typhoon intensity. This was short-lived though, as conditions surrounding the cyclone soon caused it to weaken. Now moving due west, the weakening storm eventually struck Hainan Island as a tropical storm on October12 before diminishing to a tropical depression. The depression briefly moved back <b>over</b> <b>water</b> before dissipating in northern Vietnam on October14.|$|E

5|$|While it {{is often}} weaker than most of its land counterparts, {{stronger}} versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur. Most waterspouts do not suck up water; they are small and weak rotating columns of air <b>over</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur <b>over</b> <b>water,</b> when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed {{east of the}} Bahamas on September6. It moved slowly northwestward towards {{the coast of the}} United States and attained hurricane strength early on September9. The cyclone continued travelling northwest along the US coast, becoming a Category 2 hurricane whilst off the coast of Georgia on September 11. On September 13 the cyclone made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, but then quickly weakened to a {{tropical storm}} and turned eastward into the Atlantic on September14. Throughout September15, whilst <b>over</b> <b>water,</b> the storm regained hurricane strength and continued northward before becoming extratropical in the mid-Atlantic on September17.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone <b>over</b> <b>water,</b> {{the storm had}} relatively little impact over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. However, the losses were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict <b>over</b> <b>water</b> distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way or the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 27, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} below tropical storm status and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while moving over cooler waters. The system dissipated shortly after over open waters. Although the storm remained <b>over</b> <b>water</b> {{for the duration}} of its existence, the outer reaches of the system brought rain and light winds to Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. In Jacksonville, Florida, the storm produced 0.47 in (11.9 mm) of rain on August 25. Between August 26 and 27, Cape Hatteras received 2.06 in (52.3 mm) of rain from the storm.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 17thcentury, Robert Boyle proved that air is {{necessary}} for combustion. English chemist John Mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires {{only a part of}} air that he called spiritus nitroaereus. In one experiment, he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container <b>over</b> <b>water</b> caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.|$|E
5|$|Just {{six hours}} after moving inland, Longwang emerged over the Taiwan Strait with its {{circulation}} mostly intact; however, weakening continued as it approached eastern China. Remaining <b>over</b> <b>water</b> {{for less than}} 12hours, the typhoon made its second and ultimate landfall in Fujian Province late on October2. The storm quickly degraded over the following day, with winds decreasing below gale-force within 12hours. The former typhoon slowed and turned northward over western Fujian before dissipating late on October3.|$|E
5|$|Ladd's group {{soon found}} their {{business}} expertise {{in other areas}} did not apply as well to the iron industry. Their lack of experience, coupled with a dispute <b>over</b> <b>water</b> rights, caused the company to close in 1869. After a brief respite in which they filled an order for iron wheels for the Central Pacific Railroad from 1874 to 1876, the company closed for good in 1878 and the assets were sold off at a sheriff's auction.|$|E
