5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve (XII) exits the skull using the hypoglossal canal in the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> and reaches the tongue to control {{almost all of}} the muscles involved in movements of this organ.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve arises {{as a number}} of small rootlets {{from the front of the}} medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the preolivary sulcus, which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the subarachnoid space and pierces the dura mater near the hypoglossal canal, an opening in the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Lack of CSF {{pressure}} and volume can allow {{the brain to}} sag and descend through the foramen magnum (large opening) of the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone,</b> {{at the base of}} the skull. The lower portion of the brain is believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms. Nerves that can be affected and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right.|$|E

50|$|The sphenoid articulates {{with the}} frontal, parietal, ethmoid, temporal, zygomatic, palatine, vomer, and <b>occipital</b> <b>bones</b> {{and helps to}} connect the {{neurocranium}} to the facial skeleton.|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
25|$|In June 2003 {{a further}} {{research}} team with Ștefan Milota, Ricardo Rodrigo and Mircea Gherase discovered additional human {{remains on the}} cave's surface. Thus, an entire anterior cranial skeleton was found along with a largely complete left temporal bone {{and a number of}} frontal, parietal and <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> segments.|$|E
25|$|Variations {{occur in}} the {{extension}} over the face and over the clavicle and shoulder; it may be absent or interdigitate with the muscle of the opposite side {{in front of the}} neck; attachment to clavicle, mastoid process or <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> occurs. A more or less independent fasciculus, the occipitalis minor, may extend from the fascia over the trapezius to fascia over the insertion of the sternocleidomastoideus.|$|E
50|$|Twenty hominid fossils were {{discovered}} at Xujiayao, consisting of 12 parietal bones, 1 temporal <b>bone,</b> 2 <b>occipital</b> <b>bones,</b> 1 mandibular bone fragment, 1 juvenile maxilla, and 3 isolated teeth.|$|R

30|$|Skull-base {{osteomyelitis}} is a {{rare disease}} affecting the medulla of the temporal, sphenoid, and <b>occipital</b> <b>bones.</b> In general, it occurs due to external ear canal infections caused by malignant external otitis. Skull-base osteomyelitis usually affects elderly diabetic patients.|$|R
25|$|The skull {{is longer}} and more narrow {{than that of a}} {{domestic}} cat. When compared to the leopard cat's skull, the Iriomote cat's is roughly the same size but thicker. Because of this, the Iriomote cat's brain is smaller; a male leopard cat's brain is about 42 grams, whereas a male Iriomote cat's brain is about 30 grams. The <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> of the skull and the auditory capsule are not connected. The mandibular symphysis is short.|$|E
25|$|A {{newspaper}} reported that Kelly's body was dissected by medical students who removed {{his head and}} organs for study. Dissection outside of a coronial enquiry was illegal. Public outrage at the rumour raised real fears of public disorder, leading the commissioner of police to write to the gaol's governor, who denied that a dissection had taken place. (Saw cuts {{on a piece of}} his <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> recovered in 2011 confirm that a dissection had been done.) His head was allegedly given to phrenologists for study, then returned to the police, who used it for a time as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Syringomyelia* is a {{condition}} where a fluid filled sac develops in the spinal cord. The most important cause in dogs is by a Chiari I malformation, which is when an underdeveloped <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> interferes with spinal fluid circulation and results in fluid accumulation in the cervical spinal cord. This is a congenital disease most commonly found in small breeds such as the Brussels Griffon and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Other breeds known to be affected include the Bichon Frisé, Boston terrier, bull terrier, Chihuahua, French bulldog, Havanese, King Charles spaniel (the English toy spaniel), Maltese, miniature dachshunds, miniature and toy poodles, Papillon, Pomeranian, Pugs, Shih Tzu, Staffordshire bull terrier, and the Yorkshire terrier. Signs may include ataxia, weakness, and neck pain.|$|E
40|$|Selection for {{increased}} encephalization in humans necessitated extensive brain growth after birth. To estimate changes in rates {{of growth and}} corresponding shape changes during gestation and infancy, chord and arc distances {{were obtained from the}} frontal, parietal, and <b>occipital</b> <b>bones</b> of 44 human fetuses, neonates, and infants (one year old and younger). Rates of growth in chord and arc measurements were calculated and compared using linear regression of log-transformed variables, followed by ANCOVA. Curvature of bone lengths and widths were estimated by chord/arc indices. Fetal rates of cranial growth were significantly slower while the fetal frontal and <b>occipital</b> <b>bones</b> were significantly more curved than those of infants. Fetal rates of cranial growth decrease during the first six postnatal months, in conjunction with rapid changes in shape, except for parietal superior-inferior height where bossing of the bone is similar in fetuses and neonates...|$|R
30|$|Skull-base {{osteomyelitis}} is a {{rare disease}} affecting the medulla of the temporal, sphenoid, and <b>occipital</b> <b>bones.</b> In general, it occurs due to external ear canal infections caused by malignant external otitis that proceeds to skull base and becomes chronic; however, atypical skull-base osteomyelitis that arises independently of any history of external otitis has been reported as well [3].|$|R
5000|$|The {{outer surface}} of the skull {{possesses}} a number of landmarks. The {{point at which the}} frontal bone and the two parietal bones meet is known as [...] "Bregma". The point at which the two parietal and <b>occipital</b> <b>bones</b> meet is known as [...] "Lambda".Not only do these landmarks indicate the fontanelle in newborns, they also act as reference points in medicine and surgery.|$|R
500|$|The {{brainstem}} {{lies beneath}} the cerebrum {{and consists of}} the midbrain, pons and medulla. It lies in the back part of the skull, resting {{on the part of}} the base known as the clivus, and ends at the foramen magnum, a large [...] in the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone.</b> The brainstem continues below this as the spinal cord, protected by the vertebral column.|$|E
500|$|Then the head-tefillin {{is placed}} on the middle of the head just above the forehead, so that no part rests below the hairline. A bald or {{partially}} bald person's original hairline is used. The knot of the head-tefillin sits {{at the back of the}} head, upon the part of the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> that protrudes just above the nape, directly opposite the optic chiasm. The two straps of the head-tefillin are brought in front of the shoulders, with their blackened side facing outwards. Now the remainder of the arm-tefillin straps are wound [...] three times around the middle finger and around the hand to form the shape of the Hebrew letter of either a shin (...) according to Ashkenazim, or a dalet (...) according to Sephardim. There are various customs regarding winding the strap on the arm and hand. In fact, the arm strap is looped for counter-clockwise wrapping with Ashkenazi tefillin while it is knotted for clockwise wrapping with Sephardic and Chabad tefillin. On removing the tefillin, the steps are reversed.|$|E
500|$|The epoccipital is a {{distinctive}} bone found lining the frills of ceratopsians. The {{name is a}} misnomer, as they are not associated with the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone.</b> Epoccipitals begin as separate bones that fuse during the animal's growth to either the squamosal or parietal bones {{that make up the}} base of the frill. These bones were ornamental instead of functional, and may have helped differentiate species. Epoccipitals probably were present in all known ceratopsids {{with the possible exception of}} Zuniceratops. They appear to have been broadly different between short-frilled ceratopsids (centrosaurines) and long-frilled ceratopsids (chasmosaurines), being elliptical with constricted bases in the former group, and triangular with wide bases in the latter group. [...] Within these broad definitions, different species would have somewhat different shapes and numbers. In centrosaurines especially, like Centrosaurus, Pachyrhinosaurus, and Styracosaurus, these bones become long and spike- or hook-like. A well-known example is the coarse sawtooth fringe of broad triangular epoccipitals on the frill of Triceratops. When regarding the ossification's morphogenetic traits, it can be described as dermal. The term epoccipital was coined by famous paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the total}} cranial vault remodelling, {{which is the}} other widely used {{surgical}} procedure, the compensatory deformities are corrected during the operation, in addition to excision of the fused suture. Most of the bones that together form the cranial vault - i.e. the frontal, the parietal and the <b>occipital</b> <b>bones</b> - are removed and reshaped to normalize the contours. The bones are then replaced and fixated to form a cranial vault with a normalized shape.|$|R
40|$|A {{woman in}} labor and {{not wearing a}} seat belt {{sustained}} multiple fractures of the pelvis and femur while in an automobile accident. The fetus suffered fractures of the parietal and <b>occipital</b> <b>bones.</b> To minimize maternal pelvic and fetal injury, delivery by cesarean section was performed. The infant had generalized cerebral edema and intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage, diagnosed shortly after birth. Motor abnormalities and residual injury to the periventricular white matter were evident at age 4 months. Use of seat belts may significantly diminish or prevent such injuries...|$|R
5000|$|The petrous {{part of the}} {{temporal}} bone is pyramid-shaped and is wedged in {{at the base of the}} skull between the sphenoid and <b>occipital</b> <b>bones.</b> Directed medially, forward, and a little upward, it presents a base, an apex, three surfaces, and three angles, and houses in its interior, the components of the inner ear. The petrous portion is among the most basal elements of the skull and forms part of the endocranium. Petrous comes from the Latin word petrosus, meaning [...] "stone-like, hard". It is one of the densest bones in the body.|$|R
500|$|Burial E-27-A was a noble tomb in Structure 27, in Plaza A. The {{remains of}} three sacrificed adults were piled {{together}} {{face down in}} a [...] space. Under these sacrifices were the seated remains of another person. This individual wore a gold headband with a jade and turquoise mosaic and a necklace with ten representations of jaguar heads together with forty small gold beads. On each arm he wore a bracelet fashioned from the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> of a human skull and engraved with fine designs that included birds and stars hanging from a Mexican-style celestial band. A finely crafted piece of jade was found near the lower jaw and had probably been originally placed within {{the mouth of the}} deceased. There was also a copper nose ornament {{in the shape of the}} moon and some jade beads, one of which represented a deity similar to that represented on the incense burners found at Temple 3. The remains dated from the earlier phase of occupation of Iximche and the deceased had died in battle from a blow to the head from a blunt instrument. The burial has been tentatively identified as that of one of two sons of Wuqu-Batz' of the Xahil clan, who died in the Kaqchikel wars of expansion, either Chopena-Tz'i'kin Uka or Chopena-Tohin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two heads}} are {{separated}} from one another at their origins by a triangular interval (supraclavicular fossa) [...] but gradually blend, below {{the middle of the}} neck, into a thick, rounded muscle which is inserted, by a strong tendon, into the lateral surface of the mastoid process, from its apex to its superior border, and by a thin aponeurosis into the lateral half of the superior nuchal line of the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The skull is {{of medium}} length, {{and should be}} broad, {{especially}} between the ears. The forehead line is moderately arched {{as seen from the}} side, with the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> well developed without being conspicuous. The stop is well defined. The Rottweiler nose is well developed, more broad than round, with relatively large nostrils and always black. The muzzle should appear neither elongated nor shortened in relation to the cranial region. The nasal bridge is broad at the base and moderately tapered.|$|E
60|$|As Professor Schmerling observes, {{the base}} of the skull is destroyed, and the facial bones are entirely absent; but the roof of the cranium, {{consisting}} of the frontal, parietal, and the greater part of the <b>occipital</b> <b>bones,</b> as far as the middle of the occipital foramen, is entire or nearly so. The left temporal bone is wanting. Of the right temporal, the parts in the immediate neighbourhood of the auditory foramen, the mastoid process, and a considerable portion of the squamous element of the temporal are well preserved (Fig. 23).|$|R

50|$|During ontogeny, both Galesaurus and Thrinaxodon undergo {{changes in}} {{posterior}} {{projection of the}} postorbital, posterior sagittal crest, and external occipital crest. Ontogenetic changes that were unique to Galesaurus include a large shift in the relative position of the mandible within the temporal fenestra, {{a change in the}} ectocranial morphology of the nasal-nasal suture, fusion of the exocciptal with three surrounding <b>occipital</b> <b>bones,</b> and development of sexual dimorphism in adults. In contrast, the ontogenetic changes that were unique to Galesaurus include the presence of an interpterygoid vacuity in small juveniles, change in the ectocranial trace of the frontal-parietal suture, the changing shape of the parietal foramen, and obliteration of the posterior parietal-parietal suture.|$|R
2500|$|The {{transverse}} sinuses (left {{and right}} lateral sinuses), within the human head, are two areas beneath the brain which allow blood to drain {{from the back}} of the head.

2500|$|The {{striking}} segmented {{pattern of}} the spine is established during embryogenesis when somites are rhythmically added to the posterior of the embryo. Somite formation begins around the third week when the embryo begins gastrulation and continues until around 52 somites are formed. The somites are spheres, formed from the paraxial mesoderm {{that lies at the}} sides of the neural tube and they contain the precursors of spinal bone, the vertebrae ribs and some of the skull, as well as muscle, ligaments and skin. Somitogenesis and the subsequent distribution of somites is controlled by a clock and wavefront model acting in cells of the paraxial mesoderm. Soon after their formation, sclerotomes, which give rise to some of the bone of the skull, the vertebrae and ribs, migrate, leaving the remainder of the somite now termed a dermamyotome behind. This then splits to give the myotomes which will form the muscles and dermatomes which will form the skin of the back. [...] Sclerotomes become subdivided into an anterior and a posterior compartment. This subdivision {{plays a key role in}} the definitive patterning of vertebrae that form when the posterior part of one somite fuses to the anterior part of the consecutive somite during a process termed resegmentation. Disruption of the somitogenesis process in humans results in diseases such as congenital scoliosis. So [...] far, the human homologues of three genes associated to the mouse segmentation clock, (MESP2, DLL3 and LFNG), have been shown to be mutated in cases of congenital scoliosis, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in vertebral segmentation are conserved across vertebrates. In humans the first four somites are incorporated in the base of the <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> of the skull and the next 33 somites will form the vertebrae, ribs, muscles, ligaments and skin. The remaining posterior somites degenerate. During the fourth week of embryogenesis, the sclerotomes shift their position to surround the spinal cord and the notochord. This column of tissue has a segmented appearance, with alternating areas of dense and less dense areas.|$|E
6000|$|In {{reply to}} my {{questions}} Dr. Fuhlrott {{writes that the}} <b>occipital</b> <b>bone</b> [...] "is {{in a state of}} perfect preservation as far as the upper semicircular line, which is a very strong ridge, linear at its extremities, but enlarging towards the middle, where it forms two ridges (bourrelets), united by a linear continuation, which is slightly depressed in the middle." ...|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled.

Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all appeared to have been large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|R
40|$|A case of amniotic band {{syndrome}} (ABS) presenting with acalvaria is reported. ABS {{includes a}} spectrum of non-genetic anomalies, varying from simple digital band constriction to major craniofacial and visceral defects, and even fetal death. Acalvaria is a rare congenital malformation characterised {{by the absence of}} the dome-like superior portion of the cranium comprising the frontal, parietal, and <b>occipital</b> <b>bones</b> and dura mater, {{in the presence of a}} normal skull base and facial bones with complete cranial contents. No two cases are the same. Acrania or absence of the flat skull bones with disorganised cerebral hemispheres have been reported in the presence of amniotic bands. ABS is an aetiological factor in acalvaria. Appropriate counselling for affected families needs to be given after prenatal diagnosis. ...|$|R
