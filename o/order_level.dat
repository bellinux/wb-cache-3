40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} the problem <b>Ordered</b> <b>Level</b> Planarity which asks for a planar drawing of a graph such that vertices are placed at prescribed positions in the plane and such that every edge is realized as a y-monotone curve. This {{can be interpreted as}} a variant of Level Planarity in which the vertices on each level appear in a prescribed total order. We establish a complexity dichotomy with respect to both the maximum degree and the level-width, that is, the maximum number of vertices that share a level. Our study of <b>Ordered</b> <b>Level</b> Planarity is motivated by connections to several other graph drawing problems. Geodesic Planarity asks for a planar drawing of a graph such that vertices are placed at prescribed positions in the plane and such that every edge is realized as a polygonal path composed of line segments with two adjacent directions from a given set S of directions symmetric with respect to the origin. Our results on <b>Ordered</b> <b>Level</b> Planarity imply NP-hardness for any S with |S|> 4 even if the given graph is a matching. Katz, Krug, Rutter and Wolff claimed that for matchings Manhattan Geodesic Planarity, the case where S contains precisely the horizontal and vertical directions, can be solved in polynomial time [GD' 09]. Our results imply that this is incorrect unless P=NP. Our reduction extends to settle the complexity of the Bi-Monotonicity problem, which was proposed by Fulek, Pelsmajer, Schaefer and Štefankovič. <b>Ordered</b> <b>Level</b> Planarity {{turns out to be a}} special case of T-Level Planarity, Clustered Level Planarity and Constrained Level Planarity. Thus, our results strengthen previous hardness results. In particular, our reduction to Clustered Level Planarity generates instances with only two non-trivial clusters. This answers a question posed by Angelini, Da Lozzo, Di Battista, Frati and Roselli.

40|$|An elegant yet {{practical}} {{framework for}} the application of p- and h-Multigrid for DGFEM is first presented and analysed theoretically. After that a hybrid implicit-explicit p-Multigrid iteration strategy for the discretisation of the steady Euler equations with the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is presented and investigated experimentally. The implicit strategy consists of an inexact damped Newton iteration, using an ILU(0) -preconditioned matrix-free GMRES method for the solution of the linear system. The size of the ILU preconditioner grows very fast with interpolation order. As a result the method becomes impractical already for moderate orders of interpolation. Therefore it is embedded in a FAS p-Multigrid iteration scheme. In this framework, the implicit solver is used only on the lowest order interpolation space, while on the higher <b>order</b> <b>levels</b> a Runge-Kutta local timestepping method is used. The fast convergence of the solution on the lowest <b>order</b> <b>levels</b> speeds up the convergence of the mainly explicit multilevel iterations considerably with respect to a purely explicit p-Multigrid solver. ...|$|R

50|$|Hydrophylloideae is a {{subfamily}} of the Boraginaceae {{family of}} flowering plants. Their taxonomic position is somewhat uncertain. Traditionally, {{and under the}} Cronquist system, they were given family rank under the name Hydrophyllaceae, and treated {{as part of the}} order Solanales. More recent systems have recognised their close relationship to the borage family, Boraginaceae, initially by placing Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginaceae together in an order Boraginales, and most recently by demoting Hydrophyllaceae to a subfamily of Boraginaceae.

50|$|Molecular Signatures in {{the form}} of conserved {{signature}} indels (CSIs) and proteins (CSPs) have been found that are uniquely shared by all members belonging to the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum. These CSIs and CSPs are distinguishing characteristics that delineate the unique phylum from all other bacterial organisms, and their exclusive distribution is parallel with the observed differences in physiology. CSIs and CSPs have also been found that support order and family-level taxonomic rankings within the phylum. Some of the CSIs found to support <b>order</b> <b>level</b> distinctions are thought {{to play a role in}} the respective extremophilic characteristics. The CSIs found in DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta and DNA topoisomerase I in Thermales species may be involved in thermophilicity, while those found in Excinuclease ABC, DNA gyrase, and DNA repair protein RadA in Deinococcales species may be associated with radioresistance. Two CSPs that were found uniquely for all members belonging to the Deinococcus genus are well characterized and are thought to play a role in their characteristic radioresistant phenotype. These CSPs include the DNA damage repair protein PprA the single-stranded DNA-binding protein DdrB.|$|E

30|$|One {{hallmark}} of critical realist analysis is the ontological assumption that reality consists of hierarchically <b>ordered</b> <b>levels</b> where {{a lower level}} creates the conditions for a higher level.

5000|$|To be more specific, {{there has}} been {{convergence}} in word <b>order,</b> <b>level</b> of agglutination, and incorporation of Spanish grammatical particles and discourse markers in Nahuatl speech. For instance, whereas Nahuatl had an adjective-noun word order Mexicano follows Spanish in its noun-adjective word order (Flores Farfán, 2004). This {{may be due to}} the borrowing of phrases from Spanish incorporating the Spanish particle de, in phrases of the form NOUN + de + ADJ, e.g. aretes de oro meaning ‘gold earrings’ (Hill & Hill, 1986, 239). Furthermore, the incorporation of de in Nahuatl may have also influenced a parallel shift from modifier-head to head-modifier in possessive constructions. That is, Classical Nahuatl had a possessor-possessum/noun-genitive order, but infiltration of the Spanish particle de may have also driven the shift to possessum-possessor/genitive-noun order. Whereas previously possessive noun clauses in the Nahuatl were markedly introduced by an inflected possessum plus and adjunctor in and a possessor, or unmarkedly simply by an possessor and inflected possessum (that is, the in particle was inserted in front of the displaced element of a marked word order), Nahuatl speakers have analyzed the loan de as functioning in a parallel fashion to native in, and used it to create unmarked possessum/possessor constructions in the manner of Spanish, without genitive inflections.|$|E
5000|$|The four Early Middle Chinese (EMC) tones {{are nearly}} always {{presented}} in the <b>order</b> <b>level</b> ( [...] píng), rising ( [...] shǎng), departing ( [...] qù), entering ( [...] rù), and correspondingly numbered 1 2 3 4 in modern discussions. In Late Middle Chinese (LMC), each of the EMC tone classes split in two, depending {{on the nature of}} the initial consonant of the syllable in question. Discussions of LMC and the various modern varieties will often number these split tone classes from 1 through 8, keeping the same ordering as before. For example, LMC/modern tone classes 1 and 2 derive from EMC tone class 1; LMC/modern tone classes 3 and 4 derive from EMC tone class 2; etc. The odd-numbered tone classes 1 3 5 7 are termed dark ( [...] yīn), whereas the even-numbered tone classes 2 4 6 8 are termed light ( [...] yáng). Hence, for example, LMC/modern tone class 5 is known in Chinese as the yīn qù ("dark departing") tone, indicating that it is the yīn variant of the EMC qù tone (EMC tone 3). In order to clarify the relationship between the EMC and LMC tone classes, some authors notate the LMC tone classes as 1a 1b 2a 2b 3a 3b 4a 4b in place of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, where a and b correspond directly to Chinese yīn and yáng, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Larger fungi (usually {{referred}} to as macrofungi or macromycetes) are of particular interest because of their importance as food resources and {{as a component of}} traditional culture in many places in the world. Moreover, many basidiomycetes and ascomycetes with conspicuous sporocarps often play an important role as ectomycorrhizal mycobionts of trees and shrubs of boreal forests in the northern hemisphere and are important elements {{in many areas of the}} southern hemisphere. Although Guatemalan macrofungi have not been as yet extensively surveyed, a preliminary checklist encompasses some 350 species of macromycetes (31 ascomycetes and 319 basidiomycetes) occurring in 163 genera and 20 ascomycetous and basidiomycetous orders. Recently, 12 species of Ascomicetes where cited, with the new records, there are now 44 ascomycete species known from Guatemala Most available observations pertain to the highlands, in the departments of Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, El Quiché, Huehuetenango, and Quetzaltenango, while the wide lowland Petén region has been scantly explored, despite the fact that it accounts for about one third of Guatemala's area and, together with adjacent areas of Belize and southern Mexico, comprise the largest unbroken tract of tropical forest north of the Brazilian Amazon. At the <b>order</b> <b>level,</b> Agaricales was found to host the larger number of species (almost one third of the entire set), followed by Polyporales and Boletales. The most represented genera are Amanita, Russula, Lactarius, Laccaria, Suillus. Intriguingly, all these genera are ectomycorrhizal with the several Pinus and Quercus species that form extensive pine and mixed forests of the highlands, and/or with the endangered Abies guatemalensis (pinabete), most abundant between 2800-3200 m elevation on the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes in western Guatemala.|$|E
