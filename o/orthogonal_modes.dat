40|$|Abstract—This letter {{presents}} a 79 -GHz broadband reflection-type grid amplifier using spatial power combining {{to combine the}} power of 64 unit cells. Each unit cell uses a two-stage cascade configuration with InP HEMTs arranged as a differential pair. A broadband <b>orthogonal</b> <b>mode</b> transducer (OMT) separates two orthogonally polarized input and output signals over a 75 to 85 GHz range. In conjunction with the OMT, a mode converter with quadruple-ridged apertures was designed to enhance the field uniformity over the active grid. Measurements show 5 -dB small signal gain at 79 GHz and an 800 -MHz 3 -dB bandwidth. The amplifier generates an output power of 264 mW with little evidence of saturation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{circular polarization}} in pulsar radio emission through simultaneous observations of PSR B 1133 + 16 at two frequencies. In particular, we investigate {{the association of}} the handedness of circular polarization with the <b>orthogonal</b> polarization <b>mode</b> phenomenon at two different frequencies. We find the association to be significant across the pulse for PSR B 1133 + 16, making {{a strong case for}} <b>orthogonal</b> polarization <b>modes</b> determining the observed circular polarization. The association however is not perfect and decreases with frequency. Based on these results and assuming emission occurs in superposed <b>orthogonal</b> polarization <b>modes,</b> we present a technique of mode decomposition based on single pulses. Average profiles of the polarization of each mode can then be computed by adding the individual mode-separated single pulses. We show that decomposing single pulses produces different average profiles for the <b>orthogonal</b> polarization <b>modes</b> from decomposing average profiles. Finally, we show sample single pulses and discuss the implications of the frequency dependence of the correlation of the circular polarization with the <b>orthogonal</b> polarization <b>mode</b> phenomenon.

50|$|Dynamic mode {{decomposition}} (DMD) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm {{developed by}} Peter Schmid in 2008.Given a time series of data, DMD computes {{a set of}} modes {{each of which is}} associated with a fixed oscillation frequency and decay/growth rate. For linear systems in particular, these modes and frequencies are analogous to the normal modes of the system, but more generally, they are approximations of the modes and eigenvalues of the composition operator (also called the Koopman operator). Due to the intrinsic temporal behaviors associated with each mode, DMD differs from dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis, which computes <b>orthogonal</b> <b>modes</b> that lack predetermined temporal behaviors. Because its modes are not orthogonal, DMD-based representations can be less parsimonious than those generated by PCA. However, they can also be more physically meaningful because each mode is associated with a damped (or driven) sinusoidal behavior in time.|$|E

Here, we report an extraordinary spin specific beam shift of light and demonstrate its tunability in an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium exhibiting spatially varying retardance level. The spin specificity (shift occurs only for one circular polarization mode, keeping the other <b>orthogonal</b> <b>mode</b> unaffected) is shown to arise due to the combined spatial gradients of the geometric phase and the dynamical phase of light. The constituent two <b>orthogonal</b> circular polarization <b>modes</b> of an input linearly polarized light evolve in different trajectories, eventually manifesting as a large and tunable spin separation. The spin specificity of the beam shift and the demonstrated principle of simultaneously tailoring space-varying geometric and dynamical phase of light for achieving its tunability (of both magnitude and direction), may provide an attractive route towards development of spin-optical devices.
