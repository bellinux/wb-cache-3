5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot {{gases in the}} turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
5|$|The last B.2 XM657 was {{delivered}} in 1965 {{and the type}} served till 1984. Whilst in service the B.2 was continuously updated with modifications including rapid engine starting, bomb-bay fuel tanks, wing strengthening to give the fatigue life to enable the aircraft to fly at low level (a tactic introduced in the mid-1960s), upgraded navigation equipment, terrain following radar (TFR), standardisation <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> nuclear weapon (WE.117) and improved ECM equipment. The B.1As were not strengthened, thus all were withdrawn by 1968. Nine B.2s were modified for a maritime radar reconnaissance (MRR) role and six for an airborne tanker role.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E

50|$|A {{classic example}} of the tyranny of small {{decisions}} is the tragedy of the commons, described by Garrett Hardin in 1968 as a situation where a number of herders graze cows <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>commons.</b> The herders each act independently in what they perceive to be their own rational self-interest, ultimately depleting their shared limited resource, even though it is clear that it is not in any herder's long-term interest for this to happen.|$|R
5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. This {{is the result of}} a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the mimic is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive mimicry, the mimic benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E

Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas {{had agreed}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> strategy: Their armies would unite {{into a single}} massive force and march {{together}} towards Marienburg (Malbork), capital of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights, who took a defensive position, did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion—by the Poles along the Vistula River towards Danzig (Gdańsk) and the Lithuanians along the Neman River towards Ragnit (Neman). To counter this perceived threat, Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in Schwetz (Świecie), a central location from where troops could respond to an invasion from any direction rather quickly. Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of Ragnit, Rhein (Ryn) near Lötzen (Giżycko), and Memel (Klaipėda). To keep their plans secret and mislead the knights, Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories, thus forcing the knights to keep their troops in place.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the United States is primarily {{the responsibility of}} local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is {{the largest in the}} country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws. At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{attempts to}} establish homology between {{two or more}} polymer structures based on their shape and three-dimensional conformation. This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but {{can also be used}} for large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple structural superposition, where at least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, structural alignment requires no a priori knowledge of equivalent positions. Structural alignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques. Structural alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> tertiary structure.|$|E

5|$|The Presidency of the Council is not {{a single}} post, but is held by a member state's government. Every six months the {{presidency}} rotates between the states, in an order predefined by the Council's members, allowing each state to preside over the body. From 2007, every three member states co-operate for their combined eighteen months <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> agenda, although only one formally holds the presidency for the normal six-month period. For example, the President for the second half of 2007, Portugal, was the second in a trio of states alongside Germany and Slovenia with whom Portugal had been co-operating. The Council meets in various configurations (as outlined below) so its membership changes depending upon the issue. The person chairing the Council will always be the member from the state holding the Presidency. A delegate from the following Presidency also assists the presiding member and may take over work if requested. The exception however is the foreign affairs council, which has been chaired by the High Representative since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.|$|E
