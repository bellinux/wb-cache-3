[...] Rick Ingebritson of The Palm Beach Post said the episode [...] "was funny from start to finish", particularly praising Dwight Schrute's role and the Michael Scott roast. However, Ingebritson said he was disgusted by the Leachman nude scene from Mrs. Albert Hannaday.

He praised the Black/Leachman film, the trouble Dwight kept getting in, and the Jim and Pam subplot, which he called [...] "a rare Pam-Jim plot point that worked". However, he called the Michael roast [...] "yet another Michael-wanting-to-be-loved-and-still-be-the-Boss subplot that takes over the second half".|$|E
