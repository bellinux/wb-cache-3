The other end of the connection at the remote DTE is likely to have assigned a different <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> identifier.

40|$|This Operational Practice {{specifies}} {{the operational}} parameters {{for use of}} the logical_channel_descriptor for Australian free-to-air Digital Terrestrial Television transmissions and assigns the allocation of <b>Logical</b> <b>Channel</b> Numbers (LCNs) to be used to identify television and radio services carried on free-to-air DVB-T transmissions 1. This Operational Practice also makes recommendations to receiver manufacturers and broadcasters to cover situations where receivers find repeated LCNs in reception overlap areas with varied reception quality or where there is no LCN. The informative Appendix A gives some background and suggested scenarios on how LCNs are used in Australia. The logical_channel_descriptor specifications are in compliance with the detail in the Australian Digital TV Transmission standard, AS 4599 [1]. The Australian specification, while based on the original development of the <b>Logical</b> <b>Channel</b> Descriptor 2 by the UK DTG [2], has variations and extensions in its implementation similar to its use in Europe, such as the NorDig specification 3. 2. APPLICATION The intention of the <b>Logical</b> <b>Channel</b> Descriptor is to provide a broadcaster assigned virtual channel number or label, for each of the services available to the DTTB receiver. These services are defined by the "DVB triple " a combination of the original_network_id, transport_stream_id and service_id, whose values are allocated according to Free TV Operational Practice OP- 40 [3]. <b>Logical</b> <b>Channel</b> Numbers (LCNs) are used in Australia to identify services, some of which may not be present at all times.

40|$|For video {{communication}} over wireless ad hoc networks, multiple paths with different rates are common. This thesis considers {{the transmission of}} different summaries of an intra– coded video sequence through k bandwidth limited paths. The reconstruction of the joint summary of all k paths results in the smallest maximum distortion that can be achieved. We propose a framework which can solve this problem in an iteration with two steps. First, a rate-distortion optimal summary for a <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> is generated. The size of the <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> {{is the sum of}} all available channels. In a second step, this summary is tried to split into the k paths. If this is not possible a new summary for a <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> with lower size is generated until a solution is found that can be split. For k> 2 splitting algorithms have been examined but not implemented. For k = 2 a greedy suboptimal distribution algorithm and an optimal distribution algorithm, based on the knapsack theory, are shown. Results of extensive experimental test comparing the performance of the two splitting algorithms are presented. Acknowledgement Our first and most important acknowledge goes to our Professor Guido M.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, a {{differential}} space–frequency modulation (DSFM) {{scheme is}} proposed for multiple input multiple-output (MIMO) -orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in broadband wireless communications. We {{assume that the}} fading channels keep constant only within each OFDM block, and may change independently from one OFDM block to another. The differential schemes proposed for MIMO-OFDM systems in the literature cannot successfully decode with such a rapidly fading channel, since the successful decoding of the previously existing schemes relies {{on the assumption that}} the fading channel keeps constant within a period of several OFDM blocks, and it changes slowly from a period of several OFDM blocks to another. In our proposed DSFM scheme, the transmitted signals are differentially encoded in the frequency domain within each OFDM block. Thus, the differential decoding can be performed over subcarriers within each single OFDM block. Furthermore, if a statistical channel power-delay profile (PDP) is known at the transmitter, we propose to create a smooth <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> to improve the performance of the DSFM scheme. We obtain the smooth <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> by sorting the channel frequency responses over subcarriers from a statistical point of view. If the <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> is not smooth enough, we further consider a pruning process in which we use only the “good” part of the channel and get rid of the “bad ” part of the channel. Simulation results show that the proposed DSFM scheme over a smooth <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> (with pruning, if necessary) performs well for various channel PDPs.
