5|$|The {{producers}} <b>of</b> <b>Benefits</b> Street {{defended the}} series, {{arguing that the}} reaction to it demonstrated the importance of making such a documentary. The series was mentioned in the House of Commons, and prompted some political debate {{on the topic of}} welfare. A number of programmes were commissioned by other channels covering the same topic, while Channel 4 commissioned a follow up series provisionally titled Immigration Street that would follow the lives of immigrants living in the United Kingdom. Benefits Street gave Channel 4 their highest viewing figures for any show since 2012. In August 2014, Love Productions confirmed the second series <b>of</b> <b>Benefits</b> Street was being filmed in Kingston Road, Stockton-on-Tees, England, United Kingdom. Series two aired from 11 May 2015 for four episodes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} episode <b>of</b> <b>Benefits</b> Street, West Midlands Police said they had {{received}} a number of complaints {{from members of the}} public about alleged criminal activities that had been filmed, which they were considering whether to investigate. Alleged death threats by Twitter users against the residents were also being probed. Channel 4 said they would not provide investigators with any unbroadcast material from Benefits Street unless issued with a court order to do so.|$|E
40|$|To balance patient {{interests}} {{against the}} need for acquiring evidence, ongoing randomized clinical trials are formally monitored for early convincing indication <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> or lack <b>of</b> <b>benefit.</b> In lethal diseases like cancer, where new therapies are often toxic and may have limited preliminary efficacy data, monitoring for lack <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> is particularly important. We review the complex nature of stopping a randomized trial for lack <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> and argue that many cancer trials could be improved by a more aggressive approach to monitoring. On the other hand, we caution that some commonly used monitoring guidelines may result in stopping for lack <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> even when a nontrivial beneficial effect is observed...|$|R

5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis may be problems. The {{cost and}} {{difficulty}} of screening and assessment can delay diagnosis. Conversely, the increasing popularity of drug treatment options {{and the expansion}} <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> has motivated providers to overdiagnose ASD. There are indications AS has been diagnosed more frequently in recent years, partly as a residual diagnosis for children of normal intelligence who are not autistic but have social difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E
5|$|The Veterans Administration (VA), {{charged with}} {{implementing}} {{the provisions of}} the G.I. Bill, denied benefits to blue-discharge veterans, despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran. In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits. On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge. The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable.|$|E

During the week following the broadcasting of the third episode, West Midlands Police charged several James Turner Street residents with drugs-related offences in connection with a raid their officers had carried out in June 2013.

Moreover, the comparison of risk and <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> is difficult to make in any quantitative way, whether for a procedure in general or, even more so, for its application in any particular patient. Yet it must be ethically insecure to propose or to use a procedure without some assessment, however approximate, of the hazards involved, and without some indication of whether those hazards will be clearly offset by the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> that should result from use of the procedure...|$|R
5|$|In 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is {{not known}} what the boy's name was, but he died in {{childhood}} in 83. Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of Augusta upon Domitia, while their son was deified, appearing as such on the reverse of coin types from this period. Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly exiled Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia. Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir. By 84, Domitia {{had returned to the}} palace, where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident. Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited. From Suetonius, we know that she at least accompanied the Emperor to the amphitheatre, while the Jewish writer Josephus speaks <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> he received from her. It {{is not known}} whether Domitian had other children, but he did not marry again. Despite allegations by Roman sources of adultery and divorce, the marriage appears to have been happy.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} and review of the use <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> transfer approaches and data within Australasian policy making. The focus is on applications within {{the last two decades}} and the role of transfer methods within legal, policy and institutional structures. While there has been substantial interest in benefit transfer, the number of practical applications remains limited in both Australia and New Zealand. The limited pool of primary valuation studies and challenges in value transfer has meant that to date, understanding about the validity and reliability <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> transfer and the development of protocols to guide its use are still limited. Nonetheless, recent major policy issues and controversies such as conservation of the Great Barrier Reef and management of water in the Murray-Darling Basin have led to an increase in applications <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> transfer, and also to the potential for misuse. Included in this chapter is a discussion of the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> transfer approaches for various applications, the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> transfer, and the legal role <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> transfers within Australasian policy analysis. The chapter will also highlight the potential for benefit transfer to make benefit-cost analysis more useful to policy makers and more easily evaluated within Australasian policy contexts.
