5|$|In September 1277 King Ottokar II held in {{the border}} city of Opava a meeting of Polish princes. Sources doesn't specify either the exact date or the participants. Historians {{speculate}} <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be: Henryk IV Probus, Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black, Władysław of Opole with his sons, Henry III of Głogów and Przemysł II. Several political decisions were made during the meeting, most notably military actions against Germany.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} stage, the film underwent several name changes. Initially, the media {{reported that the}} film was titled Janam Janam Ka Saath Hamara Tumhara, shortened to Janam Janam Ka Saath, but later it became Teri Meri Kahaani. In November 2011, reports began that the film's name might be changed again to Muqtasar. At the time Kohli stated <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not yet decided {{the title of the}} film. Such speculation was believed to be a marketing choice to increase curiosity for the film.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{most likely}} {{realised}} that this situation presented {{them with an}} opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; {{they did not want to}} suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment. These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.|$|E

5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E
25|$|In the {{molecule}} , the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding. Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities. Thus, covalent bonding {{does not necessarily}} require that the two atoms be of the same elements, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> be of comparable electronegativity. Covalent bonding that entails sharing of electrons over more than two atoms {{is said to be}} delocalized.|$|E
25|$|Multistability (or multistable perception) is the {{tendency}} of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the Necker cube and Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion shown here. Other examples include the three-legged blivet and artist M. C. Escher's artwork {{and the appearance of}} flashing marquee lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, gestalt does not explain how images appear multistable, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do.|$|E

25|$|The word base of Esperanto was {{originally}} defined by Lingvo internacia, published by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. It contained some 900 root words. The {{rules of the}} language allow speakers to borrow words as needed, recommending <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> look for the most international words, and that they borrow one basic word and derive others from it, rather than borrowing many words with related meanings. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, Universala vortaro, which was written in five languages and supplied a larger set of root words.|$|E
25|$|A muzzle gag {{works in}} a similar way as an over-the-mouth gag, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are usually made of leather, are {{fastened}} around the head with buckles and straps, and cover {{the lower part of the}} face. It is so called because it resembles a muzzle used on animals, with a flexible pad which straps over the mouth, and sometimes also around the cheeks and chin. Muzzle gags have a strong psychological effect on some people, because of the association of being restrained in a way generally associated with animals. Restricting movement of the jaw and covering the cheeks can both increase the efficiency of a gag. It is difficult to draw the line between a muzzle gag and a head harness with an attached gag.|$|E
25|$|An {{elaborate}} fourteen-day {{period of}} mourning followed the cremation, {{during which the}} family performed various symbolic acts around the pyre and were regarded to be highly polluted in ritual terms, thus necessitating not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> took regular baths but also that any other Nair who might touch them must also take a bath. The period {{was followed by a}} feast and by participation in sports events, which also involved Nairs from nearby villages. Subsequently, the family stayed in mourning while one male member undertook a diksha, during which time he had to maintain a pure life. This involved him living with a Brahmin, bathing twice daily and desisting from cutting either his hair or his fingernails, as well as being prevented from speaking with or indeed even seeing women. In some cases the diksha might last for a year rather than the more usual forty-one days, in which case there would be considerable celebration at its end.|$|E

Nash Werner of GamePro said that the formation tools were wonderful, and complained <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not be assigned to naval units. Computer and Video Games generally agreed, stating that [...] "the controls are very user-friendly and well explained". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin wrote that despite the game's improved graphics, [...] "there's nothing foreign about its appearance" [...] and that most game features will be [...] "immediately recognizable if you've played a real-time strategy game before". PC Zone agreed, but in a negative sense—it argued that The Age of Kings [...] "is essentially an update of a two-year-old game".|$|E
500|$|In his [...] "Essay on the Poor Law," [...] Locke {{turns to}} the {{education}} of the poor; he laments that [...] "the children of labouring people are an ordinary burden to the parish, and are usually maintained in idleness, so that their labour also is generally lost to the public till they are 12 or 14 years old." [...] He suggests, therefore, that [...] "working schools" [...] be set up in each parish in England for poor children so that they will be [...] "from infancy [...] inured to work." [...] He goes on to outline the economics of these schools, arguing not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be profitable for the parish, but also that they will instill a good work ethic in the children.|$|E
500|$|Often {{credited}} with using fighting and intimidation as a tactic, Shero never coached players to fight. He valued team toughness {{and insisted that}} players take the body and follow through with their checks.

In fact, I have told my players if they ever hear me saying something like this, they can break a stick over my skull. I ask <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> play aggressively." [...] In an interview in the HBO documentary Broad Street Bullies Shero states that he had a team that liked fighting so he let them fight.

500|$|The front [...] of the aircraft, {{from the}} front of the cockpit to near the front of the {{first-class}} passenger cabin, was reconstructed. Information gained by this allowed investigators to determine the severity and limits of the fire damage, its possible origins, and progression. The cockpit voice recorder used a 1/4inch recording tape that operated on a 30-minute loop. It therefore only retained that half-hour of the flight before the recorders failed, six minutes before the crash. The CVR recording and transcript were covered by a strict privilege under section 28 of the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act and thus were not publicly disclosed, although the air traffic control recordings are less strictly privileged: section 29 of the same act provides <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may not be used in certain legal proceedings. The air traffic control transcripts were released within days of the crash in 1998 and the air traffic control audio was released in May 2007.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{generated}} huge {{controversy in}} Latin America: some Venezuelan and Colombian politicians described its depiction of Bolívar as [...] "profane". According to Stavans, they accused García Márquez of [...] "defaming the larger-than-life reputation {{of a historical}} figure who, during the nineteenth century, struggled to unite the vast Hispanic world". The novel's publication provoked outrage from many Latin American politicians and intellectuals because its portrayal of the General is not the saintly image long cherished by many. Mexico's ambassador to Austria, Francisco Cuevas Cancino, wrote a damning letter, which was widely publicized in Mexico City, objecting to the portrayal of Bolívar. He stated: [...] "The novel is plagued with errors of fact, conception, fairness, understanding of the historical moment and ignorance of its consequences... It has served the enemies of Latin America, who care <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can now denigrate Bolívar, and with him all of us." [...] Even the novel's admirers, such as the leading Venezuelan diplomat and writer Arturo Uslar Pietri, worried that some facts were stretched. García Márquez believes, however, that Latin America has to discover the General's labyrinth to recognize and deal with its own maze of problems.|$|E
500|$|Shipley {{was tried}} in 1784 by Mr Justice Buller and a {{specially}} convened jury at Shrewsbury. Edward Bearcroft, {{counsel for the}} prosecution, argued that {{on the basis of}} the existing system the jury could not decide on the nature of the pamphlet, while Erskine argued not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could, but that the material did not constitute seditious libel, containing as it did [...] "a solemn protest against all sedition". Persuaded by Erskine's arguments, the jury ruled that Shipley was neither [...] "guilty" [...] or [...] "not guilty", but instead [...] "guilty of publication only", a confusing and non-standard ruling which, after a long dialogue, Mr Justice Buller declared to mean [...] "guilty on all charges". Erskine appealed the decision to the Court of King's Bench on 8 November, where the judges again ruled that juries could not decide whether material was libellous, but nevertheless released Shipley on a technicality; his freedom was greeted with fireworks and bonfires, and Erskine was rewarded with the Freedom of the City of Gloucester. Still seeking to reform the law, Erskine sent the court records to Charles James Fox and Lord Camden, who, after much effort, passed the Libel Act 1792, which secured the right of juries to decide whether material was libellous.|$|E
