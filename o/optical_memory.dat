40|$|Abstract — The {{constructions of}} optical buffers {{is one of}} the most {{critically}} sought after optical technologies in all-optical packet-switched networks, and constructing optical buffers directly via optical Switches and fiber Delay Lines (SDL) has received a lot of attention recently in the literature. A practical and challenging issue of the constructions of optical buffers that has not been addressed before is on the fault tolerant capability of such constructions. In this paper, we focus on the constructions of fault tolerant linear compressors and linear decompressors. The basic network element for our constructions is scaled <b>optical</b> <b>memory</b> cell, which is constructed by a 2 × 2 optical crossbar switch and a fiber delay line. We give a multistage construction of a self-routing linear compressor by a concatenation of scaled <b>optical</b> <b>memory</b> cells. We also show that if the delays, say d 1, d 2, [...] ., dM, of the fibers in the scaled <b>optical</b> <b>memory</b> cells satisfy a certain condition (specifically, the condition in (A 2) given in Section I), then our multistage construction can be operated as a self-routing linear compressor with maximum delay � M−F even after up to F of the M scaled <b>optical</b> <b>memory</b> cells fail to function properly, where 0 ≤ F ≤ M − 1. Furthermore, we prove that our multistage construction with the fiber delays d 1, d 2, [...] ., dM given by the generalized Fibonacci series of order F is the best among all constructions of a linear compressor that can tolerate up to F faulty scaled <b>optical</b> <b>memory</b> cells by using M scaled <b>optical</b> <b>memory</b> cells. Similarly results are also obtained for the constructions of fault tolerant linear decompressors. I...|$|E
