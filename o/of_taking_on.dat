5|$|Joel (Troy Baker) is {{the protagonist}} of The Last of Us. Originally from Texas, Joel was a single father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps {{outbreak}} occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did whatever {{he had to do}} to survive. In the time spent in the brutal post-apocalyptic world, still bitter from his daughter's death, Joel became a hardened survivor, physically and mentally tough. He has a brutal fighting style and is capable <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> and defeating much younger men in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

40|$|The {{positive}} effect <b>of</b> perspective <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> favorable attitudes towards stigmatized individuals and outgroups {{is well established}} (Batson et al., 1997). We draw on the ingroup projection model (Mummendey & Wenzel, 1999) {{to better understand the}} processes underlying this effect. Based on their egocentric perspective, ingroup and outgroup members have different representations of the superordinate group (perspective divergence) so that the ingroup is perceived as more relatively prototypical of the superordinate group, leading to negative outgroup evaluation. We hypothesize that the {{positive effect}} <b>of</b> perspective <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> outgroup attitudes is due to a reduction of relative ingroup prototypicality. Across three studies with different manipulations <b>of</b> perspective <b>taking,</b> we found that participants who were <b>taking</b> the perspective <b>of</b> an outgroup member evaluated the outgroup more positively and were less inclined to perceive their ingroup as more relatively prototypical. The effect <b>of</b> perspective <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> outgroup attitudes was mediated by relative ingroup prototypicality...|$|R

5|$|On 28 July 2011, Stoke beat Hadjuk Split 2–0 {{over two}} {{legs in the}} third {{qualifying}} round of the Europa League. It was Stoke's first appearance in Europe in 37 years.

Stoke {{finished second in the}} group and were handed a glamour tie against Spanish giants Valencia in the round of 32, following the draw manager Pulis stated that he is relishing the prospect <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> one of Europe's top clubs.

Stoke ended the 2011–12 season in 14th position in what was perceived to be a disappointing season. The 2012–13 season saw Stoke make little progress, finishing in 13th position. Pulis subsequently left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E
