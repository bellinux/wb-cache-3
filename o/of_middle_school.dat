25|$|Until 1967, {{all schools}} {{in central and}} {{southern}} Somalia taught Italian. In 1972, the Somali language was officially declared the only national language of Somalia, though it now shares that distinction with Arabic. Due to its simplicity, {{the fact that it}} lent itself well to writing Somali since it could cope with all the sounds in the language, and the already widespread existence of machines and typewriters designed for its use, the government of Somali president Mohamed Siad Barre, following the recommendation of the Somali Language Committee that was instituted shortly after independence with the purpose of finding a common orthography for the Somali language, unilaterally elected to only use the Latin script for writing Somali instead of the long-established Arabic script and the upstart Osmanya script. During this period, Italian remained among the languages used in higher education. In 1983, nine out of the twelve faculties in the Somali National University used Italian as the language of instruction. Until 1991, there was also an Italian school in Mogadishu (with courses <b>of</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>school</b> and Liceum), later destroyed because of the civil war.|$|E

They also demanded that District Attorney Jill Ravitch issue an arrest warrant for Gelhaus or put together a grand jury, but she declined both, stating that the investigation would take time.|$|E

500|$|Francisco Rafael Arellano Félix {{was born}} in Culiacán, Sinaloa, [...] on 24 October 1949, to Benjamín Francisco Arellano Sánchez (father) and Norma Alicia Félix Zazueta (mother). His father was {{from the state of}} Durango but emigrated to Sinaloa, where he met his wife, in the 1940s. The couple had eleven children, Francisco Rafael being the eldest of his seven {{brothers}} (Benjamín, Carlos Alberto, Eduardo, Ramón Eduardo, Luis Fernando, Francisco Javier) and four sisters (Alicia María, Enedina, Norma Isabel and Leticia). He also had two half-brothers, Jesús and Manuel Arellano, but their second surnames remain confidential. Francisco Rafael grew up in a modest house in Miguel Hidalgo St. #566 in Culiacán, blocks away from the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, and lived there for about 20 years. Neighbors recall that the Arellano Félix brothers were [...] "cheerful boys" [...] without addictions and inclined to selling clothes, licor, and candy that they brought illegally from the United States. Francisco Rafael went to [...] "Álvaro Obregón" [...] elementary school a couple of streets away from their house. He later attended [...] "Emilio Obeso" [...] middle school in the same neighborhood. At a young age, Francisco Rafael dropped out <b>of</b> <b>middle</b> <b>school</b> to help out his father, a mechanic. Alongside his brothers Benjamín and Ramón, however, he also smuggled contraband from Tijuana. His affinity towards music led him and his two brothers to form a musical group known as [...] "Sonido Escorpión" [...] and later renamed as [...] "Los Escorpiones". By the 1970s, his family moved to Guadalajara, Jalisco, but Francisco Rafael stayed in Culiacán, where he owned an event center known as [...] "El Chaplín". He then moved years later to Mazatlán and created the discothèque Frankie Oh. Francisco Rafael's discothèque was a major nightlife attraction in Mazatlán during the mid-1980s. With an estimated US$5 million investment to build it, Frankie Oh had the capacity to host 2,500 people; it had an internal waterfall and a large dance floor surrounded by a fish tank. The nightclub's theme also mirrored a zoo because it had several exotic animals, including two lions, in the entrances and in the surroundings. The only non-living animal inside Frankie Oh was a scorpion, which was found as a giant metal statue at a water fountain and as the logo of the nightclub. Francisco Rafael usually carried a diamond-encrusted scorpion necklace in reference to his astrological sign, the Scorpio.|$|E
