The presidential standard is a square, blue field with a thin border of alternating red and white squares on each side. In the centre of the blue field is the main shield of the coat of arms <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> with the historical arms <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> surrounding the main shield. From left to right, these are the oldest known coats of arms <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> the Republic of Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria and Slavonia, adorned with bands of gold, red and white stripes extending down vertically. Atop the shield there is a Croatian tricolour ribbon with golden letters RH that stand for the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> executed in Roman square capitals. The presidential standard is flown on buildings of the Office of the President <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> the residence of the president, transportation vehicles when in use by the president, and in other ceremonial occasions. The presidential standard was designed by Miroslav Šutej in 1990.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kingdom of Bosnia into the Ottoman hands in 1463, the {{southern}} and central parts of the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. Decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, shook all <b>of</b> <b>Croatia.</b> However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the much larger enemy. A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> was conquered or pillaged.|$|E

5|$|The President <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> and the Government {{cooperate}} {{in the formulation}} and implementation of Croatia's foreign policy.

The president, following prior countersignature of the prime minister, appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives of the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> at the proposal of the Government and upon receiving the opinion of an applicable committee of the parliament. The president receives letters of credence and letters of recall from foreign diplomatic representatives.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the proposed conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>Croatia’s</b> regional economic development, Koncepcija regionalnong gospodarskog razvitka Republike Hrvatske (1999), addresses the challenges <b>of</b> <b>Croatia’s</b> uneven economic development. While the problems <b>of</b> <b>Croatia’s</b> lagging regions have been addressed, the conceptualization contains controversies regarding {{what should be}} the guiding principles of regional policy – targeted or balanced regional economic development. The proposed conceptualization represents a mixture of neoliberal thinking about the key actors in regional economic development, principles of European Union regionalism and the socialist-era legacies. Consequently, it lacks clarity in several key aspects. A specific challenge is the existing multiciplicity of regional and socials interests as well as the limitations of regional economic development based on rigid administrative-territorial units...|$|R
5|$|The Sabor, in {{its various}} forms, has {{represented}} the identity and opinions of Croats from the diets of the 9th century nobility to the modern parliament. The oldest Sabor whose records are preserved was held in Zagreb on 19 April 1273 as the Congregatio Regni totius Sclavonie generalis (General diet of the entire kingdom of Slavonia). Its decisions had legislative power. The 1527 Parliament decision was a decisive event of fundamental importance for the extension and confirmation of Croatian statehood, as described by the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>Croatia.</b> The parliament freely chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as the new ruler <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> after centuries of Croatian personal union with Hungary. Following the entry into the Habsburg Monarchy, the Sabor became a regular noble diet, and its official title gradually stabilised by 1558 to the Parliament of the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> and Slavonia. Since 1681 it has been formally styled as the Congregatio Regnorum Croatie, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae (Diet of Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> Dalmatia and Slavonia). In 1712, the Sabor once again invoked its prerogative to select the ruler, supporting what later became the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and electing Maria Theresa of Austria as monarch. This event is also specified by the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> {{as a part of}} the foundation of unbroken Croatian statehood from the Middle Ages to the present.|$|E
