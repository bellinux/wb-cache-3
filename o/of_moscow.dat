5|$|In the 15th century, Novgorodians {{started to}} {{establish}} permanent settlements on the peninsula. Umba and Varzuga, the first documented permanent settlements of the Novgorodians, {{date back to}} 1466. Over time, all coastal areas {{to the west of}} the Pyalitsa River had been settled, creating a territory where the population was mostly Novgorodian. Administratively, this territory was divided into Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts, which were governed by a posadnik from the area of the Northern Dvina. The Novgorod Republic lost control of both of these volosts to the Grand Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Moscow</b> after the Battle of Shelon in 1471, and the republic itself ceased to exist in 1478 when IvanIII took the city of Novgorod. All Novgorod territories, including those on the Kola Peninsula, became a part of the Grand Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Moscow.</b>|$|E

Only an aircraft currently in production {{could be used}} to satisfy the extremely tight deadline and the Pe-2 was selected for modification by the State Commissariat for Defence (—NKO) as the fastest twin-engined aircraft in service. The order only authorized four days to modify the aircraft's fuel, armament and radio systems, but this deadline was met when the modified aircraft made its first flight on 7 August and it passed its manufacturer's trials the following day.|$|E

5|$|As the war progressed and Germany's lighter {{tanks were}} {{replaced}} by the Panzer III, Panzer IV and heavier tanks, such as the Panther, the T-26 was gradually replaced through attrition by the vastly superior T-34. The remaining T-26s participated in battles with the Germans and their allies during the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Moscow</b> from 1941–42, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of the Caucasus from 1942–1943.

5|$|At {{the start}} of his reign, Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus' lands. In 1377–78, Andrei of Polotsk, the eldest son of Algirdas, {{challenged}} Jogaila's authority and sought to become Grand Duke. In 1380, Andrei and another brother, Dmitry, sided with Prince Dmitri <b>of</b> <b>Moscow</b> against Jogaila's alliance with emir Mamai, de facto khan of the Golden Horde. Jogaila failed to support Mamai, lingering {{in the vicinity of the}} battlefield, which led to Mamai's army's significant defeat at the hands of Prince Dmitri in the Battle of Kulikovo. The Muscovites' Pyrrhic victory over the Golden Horde, in the long term, signified, however, the beginning of a slow climb to power by the Grand Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Moscow,</b> which became within a century the most serious rival and threat to the integrity, well-being and survival of Lithuania. However, in 1380 Muscovy was greatly weakened by tremendous losses suffered during the battle and thus, in the same year, Jogaila was free to begin a struggle for supremacy with Kęstutis.|$|E
5|$|Casimir IV died on 7 June 1492. One of {{his younger}} sons, Alexander, succeeded him in Lithuania, and John Albert was elected king of Poland in late August.

As a result, Streltsov had a modest upbringing, the highlights of which were playing football and following his favoured team, Spartak Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann stated at {{his later}} interrogations that Heydrich told him in mid-September that Hitler had ordered that all Jews in German-controlled Europe {{were to be}} killed.

Around this time, Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel), the highest rank he achieved.|$|E
