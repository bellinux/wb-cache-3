50|$|Intentionally blank {{pages are}} usually the result of {{printing}} conventions and techniques. Chapters conventionally start on an <b>odd-numbered</b> <b>page</b> (recto page); therefore, if the preceding chapter happens to have an odd number of pages, a blank page is inserted at the end. Book pages are often printed on large sheets because of technical and financial considerations. Thus, a group of 8, 16, or 32 consecutive pages will be printed on a single sheet {{in such a way}} that when the sheet is mechanically folded and cut, the pages will be in the correct order for binding. This is called an even working, and the group of pages is called a section or signature. Books printed in this manner will always have a number of pages that is a multiple of the number in such a signature, such as a multiple of 8, 16, or 32. As a result, these books will usually have pages left blank, unless by chance or editorial ingenuity the exact number of pages are printed.|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} this work was to explore an {{additive}} working method {{as a way to}} generate building form. It was initiated without any preconceived ideas about the project's final outcome. Instead, it focused on observations, associations, and attitudes of existing experiences and information. Working from the position that "one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception," a decisions were made. The design of an elementary school was the vehicle for the process. by Mark Daley. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|During the Industrial Era, "dams, water towers, sewage systems, and {{the like}} were celebrated as glorious icons, {{carefully}} designed, ornamented, and prominently located in the city, testifying to the modern promise of progress. " When technology failed to meet society's expectations, "these icons lost their mobilizing powers and began to disappear from the cityscape. " These systems became material embodiments of disillusionment and emphasis shifted from the process of production to the product of production. As technological systems were visually severed from society and natural processes, water became re-conceptualized as a commodity that miraculously enters the "domestic sphere, coming from nowhere in particular. " This separation between process and product has transformed consumers' perception of water into a limitless and inexhaustible resource. This misconception has placed the world's freshwater supply {{is in a state}} of crisis. Dieter Grau explains that "water is wasted all over the world, in countries with rapidly growing cities that are in the early stages of industrialization, in industrialized countries growing at a moderate rate, in regions that have little water and regions that have a lot of water. " The thesis addresses these issues by re-evaluating the organizational strategy of a typical hotel design to emphasize the connection between the consumer and both active and passive water processes. The H₂Otel is a new model for coastal architecture that not only mitigates the effects of industrialization on water but also takes water out of its current status as a limitless commodity and, once again, transforms it into a valuable resource. by Danielle C.

40|$|Abstract. We {{indicate}} {{the means by}} which one may construct both snazzy-looking titles in LATEX, suitable for submission to honest-to-goodness math journals, and automatically cross-referencing bibliographic citations and en-tries. 1. Snazzification Now that you’ve had a chance to start playing with LATEX, you might want to know about a couple of built-in tools that’ll help make your final paper look all professional-like: (1) The command “”, and (2) automatic bibliographic indexing. Let’s take ’em one at a time, shall we? 2. Making a title The command“ ” enables to you input the following data concerning your paper, compile it all, and output it in the format demonstrated on this here first page: (1) “ ” This first command allows you to input a title. If you look at this raw text file, you’ll notice that there are two “options ” included with this command. The first, in square brackets, is truly optional; the text included here (in this paper, “A short title”) is called the “running title” that appears at the top of <b>odd-numbered</b> <b>pages.</b> Usually this is included if your actual title is too long to look nice (or even fit) at the top of individual pages. If you omit this optional option, the command just uses the actual title, included in curly braces, as the running title, too. As you can very well imagine, the actual title is the one that’s splayed largely across the front page, as above. (2) “ ” Here’s where you give yourself credit. Again, you’ve got the option of including a longer, standard, name to appear on the first page, and an optional “running title ” sort of name that’ll appear at the top of every even-numbered page. Generally I make this the same as my full name, though you could make it just your last name, or your last name with first initial (like “P. Bahls”), especially if you’re writing a multi-author paper. For multiple authors, you’ll need to include a separate “ ” command for each author...|$|R
