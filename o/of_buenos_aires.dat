5|$|The {{revolution}} of May 1810 in Buenos Aires, intended {{to win the}} independence of Argentina from Spain, also had the consequence of emancipating the province <b>of</b> <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> from Argentina or, rather, of imposing the authority of this province upon the whole nation emancipated from Spain.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Battle of Caseros the San Nicolás Agreement was signed. It {{was meant to}} comply with the {{constitutional}} mandate of the Federal pact that presided over the Argentine Confederation, convening a Constitutional Assembly to meet in Santa Fe. This agreement was not accepted by the province <b>of</b> <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> since it reduced its influence and power over the other provinces. Buenos Aires thereupon seceded from the confederation, thus Argentina got divided into two rival, independent states which fought to establish dominance. On the one side were the Federalists of the Argentine Confederation, led by Justo José de Urquiza. On the other, the Autonomists <b>of</b> <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> The civil war was only brought to an end with the decisive victory <b>of</b> <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> over the Federation at the 1861 Battle of Pavón.
