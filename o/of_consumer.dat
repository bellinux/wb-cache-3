5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres.

40|$|If {{the demand}} under price {{dispersion}} is formed by consumers with zero search costs and consumers with positive search costs, {{the law of}} one price holds at the equilibrium price level, where the lowest willingness to pay between consumers with zero search costs meets the willingness to accept or to sell <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> with positive search costs. Consumers with positive search costs maximize their utility {{with respect to their}} optimal decisions when marginal losses in labor income during the search are equal to marginal savings on purchase. Optimal decisions move their willingness to accept to the equilibrium price level. Suboptimal decisions <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> with positive search costs result in willingness to accept below the lowest willingness to pay <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> with zero search costs and arbitrage takes place. Arbitrage drops down the equilibrium price to the level where willingness to accept <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> with positive search costs meets the new lowest willingness to pay <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> with zero search costs and where purchasing decisions <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> with positive search costs become optimal...|$|R

5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion.

The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat.

5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes.

The group's most profitable business, however, was its monopoly on the export of coffee, which was the territory's most valuable cash crop. Indonesian entrepreneurs came to dominate non-Denok/military enterprises, and local manufactures from the Portuguese period made way for Indonesian imports.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.|$|E
50|$|Since a pair <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> {{connected}} via {{a relationship}} {{are more likely}} to be similar than an unconnected pair, information about such relationships can be used to infer characteristics <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> useful for targeting.For example, predictions of an individual's home location can be improved using geographic information about their peers.Existing advertising platforms can allow advertisers to explicitly target the peers (e.g., Facebook friends, Twitter followers) <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> who have a known affiliation with their brand. Thus, one way social advertising is expected to be effective is because social networks encode information about unobserved characteristics <b>of</b> <b>consumers,</b> including their susceptibility to adopt a product and to influence their peers to adopt.|$|R

Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer.
