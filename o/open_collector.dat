25|$|The one-bit SD {{protocol}} {{was derived from}} the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use <b>open</b> <b>collector</b> interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a pull-up resistor) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own chip select line to sense that the host device had selected it.|$|E

50|$|The implant is {{inserted}} through the trabecular meshwork, thus bypassing resistance of aqueous {{flow through the}} tissue. However, other glaucoma surgeries, such as canaloplasty, have shown that mechanical dilation of Schlemm’s Canal is also associated with a reduction in intraocular pressure.

The length of the Hydrus Microstent is thought to open approximately one quarter of Schlemm’s Canal, routing aqueous into <b>open</b> downstream <b>collector</b> channels.|$|R

Enhancement was similar for mixed stands, intermediate for deciduous stands, and lowest (except Cl and Na) at scrub and open sites. At Cadillac, enhancement was slightly lower for each ion, but the same pattern, coniferous ≈ mixed> deciduous>scrub/open, was observed. Seasonal differences were important, with highest deposition in fall and summer; however, wet deposition inputs of Cl and Na were highest in winter...|$|R

Under the trees, sodium concentrations increased as much as three times the amount found in the open, calcium was 13 to 16 times greater, magnesium concentrations doubled, and potassium increased as much as 50 times that which occurred in the open rainfall. Calcium was the only cation studied in which the leaching process was important.

40|$|A {{network of}} nine Fish Replenishment Areas (FRA) {{reserves}} was demarcated in West Hawai’i in 2000 {{in response to}} declines of reef fishes taken by aquarium collectors. In 1999, we established 23 study sites in FRAs, areas <b>open</b> to <b>collectors</b> and reference areas (existing protected areas) to collect data both prior to and after {{the closure of the}} reserve network in 2000.

Baseline surveys, done prior to reserve closure, document significant effects of aquarium collector harvesting on selected fishes. On average, aquarium fishes were 26 % less abundant in newly-established reserves (formerly open) than adjacent reference areas. Analysis of post-closure surveys in 2000 - 2003 using a Before-After-Control-Impact procedure provided evidence of a significant increase of aquarium fishes in reserves, primarily in the yellow tang (Zebrasoma flavescens), the most collected aquarium fish in Hawaii.

40|$|A {{research}} has been conducted on Solar Energy Utilization System for Water Heater using Trough Collector.

The highest temperature of collector occured at 1 PM, because the intensity of solar radiation at the time reached the maximum value.
