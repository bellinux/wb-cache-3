30|$|Metal forming {{processes}} are distinguished into sheet and bulk metal forming. This classification {{results from the}} prevailing stress state of the respective forming <b>operation.</b> <b>Sheet</b> metal forming {{is characterized by a}} two-dimensional stress state, whereas for bulk metal forming, three-dimensional stress states dominate. The recent sheet-bulk metal forming (SBMF) process, presented in [1], combines these two basic processes into a single more complex process. The underlying idea is to integrate individual functional elements, manufactured by bulk forming, into a component created by sheet forming. This novel technology is currently investigated with much rigor in a DFG 1 —funded collaborative research project: Manufacturing of complex functional components with variants by using a new sheet metal forming process—Sheet-Bulk Metal Forming (TR 73). Within this project in particular tailored blanks are studied, i.e. semi-finished products are a priorly adapted to the intended SBMF process. For this purpose, processes for material pre-distribution are used, see [2].|$|E

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 case notes, randomly selected {{from the department of}} general surgery, were reviewed. RESULTS: An 80 % compliance was achieved in 25 / 35 standards and 100 % was achieved in 6 (patient's name, date, surgeon's name and type of operation on the <b>operation</b> <b>sheet</b> and consent form signed and dated). The following fell short of 80 % compliance: PAS number on every page (75 %); entries timed (27 %); and clinician's name (16 %) and designation (27 %) printed.

40|$|Background and objective: Medical record documentation, {{often use}} {{to protect the}} {{patients}} legal rights, also providing information for medical researchers, general studies, education of health care staff and qualitative surveys is used. There {{is a need to}} control the amount of data entered in the medical record sheets of patients, considering the completion of these sheets is often carried out after completion of service delivery to the patients. Therefore, in this study the prevalence of completeness of medical history, operation reports, and physician order sheets by different documentaries in Jahrom teaching hospitals during year 2009 was analyzed. Methods and Materials: In this descriptive / retrospective study, the 400 medical record sheets of the patients from two teaching hospitals affiliated to Jahrom medical university was randomly selected. The tool of data collection was a checklist based on the content of medical history <b>sheet,</b> <b>operation</b> report and physician order sheets. The data were analyzed by SPSS (Version 10) software and Microsoft Office Excel 2003. Results: Average of personal (Demography) data entered in medical history, physician order and <b>operation</b> report <b>sheets</b> which is done by department's secretaries were 32. 9, 35. 8 and 40. 18 percent.

Moreover, anticipation of surgery is stressful for both patients and families, particularly if the patient is a child; additional anxiety posed by last-minute cancellation is, therefore, of primary concern.

40|$|Economists have {{grappled with}} the concept of money for centuries. For many, money is a {{complicated}} phenomenon which is difficult to define and which, in its modern form, seems almost impossible to explain. After all, what is money- a numeraire, a medium of exchange, a store of value, a means of payment, a unit of account, a measure of wealth, a simple debt, a delayed form of reciprocal altruism, a reference point in accumulation, an institution, or some combination of these? I will follow Minsky and treat the creation of money as a balance <b>sheet</b> <b>operation</b> 2 (1986). Money represents a debt-relation or a promise to pay that exists between human beings. It cannot be identified independently of its institutional usages, for money expresses a social relation (Foley 1987, Ingham 1996). Keynes also took this approach, noting that "[a] money of account comes into existence along with debts, which are contracts for deferred payment, and price lists, which are offers of contracts for sale or purchase " (1930, p. 3). Thus, when individuals enter into a forward contract, they are creating money. More specifically, "[m]oney is privately created when one party is willing to go into debt and another is willing to hold that debt " (Wray, 1990, p. 14). This debt (promise or IOU) is held as an asset by the creditor and as a liability by the debtor. The creation of money, then, is simply the balance <b>sheet</b> <b>operation</b> that records this social relation. It is because money is at once an asset and a liability that Minsky suggests treating it as a balance <b>sheet</b> <b>operation.</b> For Minsky, there is nothing special or elusive about money...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an original {{piece of work}} and contribution to knowledge by creating a new process planning system; Haptic Aided Process Planning (HAPP). This system {{is based on the}} combination of haptics and virtual reality (VR). HAPP creates a simulative machining environment where Process plans are automatically generated from the real time logging of a user’s interaction. Further, through the application of a novel usability test methodology, a deeper study of how this approach compares to conventional process planning was undertaken. An abductive research approach was selected and an iterative and incremental development methodology chosen. Three development cycles were undertaken with evaluation studies carried {{out at the end of}} each. Each study, the pre-pilot, pilot and industrial, identified progressive refinements to both the usability of HAPP and the usability evaluation method itself. HAPP provided process planners with an environment similar to which they are already familiar. Visual images were used to represent tools and material whilst a haptic interface enabled their movement and positioning by an operator in a manner comparable to their native setting. In this way an intuitive interface was developed that allowed users to plan the machining of parts consisting of features that can be machined on a pillar drill, 21 / 2 D axis milling machine or centre lathe. The planning activities included single or multiple set ups, fixturing and sequencing of cutting operations.
