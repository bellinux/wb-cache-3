50|$|An <b>outsert</b> is a four-page card {{wrapped around}} and {{attached}} {{to the outside of}} a magazine or other publication. Its purpose is to advertise a product (such as a subscription and/or free gift) and also to act as a flag for the publication to distinguish it from other titles on newsstand shelves. The <b>outsert</b> was first used on Running Magazine in the UK in 1981. The effect is to draw the attention of the browser to the magazine. Research shows the <b>outsert</b> increases sales of the publication. The best performing outserts use a single, bright colour to contrast with the magazine cover.|$|E

Regarding to this target, the WP 7. 4 (Very high field insert) in project EuCARD is to construct about 1 m long HTS dipole producing 6 T in background field of 13 T. Since the quench analysis of HTS coils is challenging e. g. due to slow propagation velocities and possibly ambiguous limit between the normal and superconducting state, two different strategies are developed in parallel {{to analyze the}} quench of the small prototype insert. The one is based on propagation velocities {{and the other on}} solving heat diffusion equation with finite element method. The very first steps of the development include benchmark calculations with the already existing programs for small Nb-Ti solenoid to guarantee similar starting points for the partners. After this, a quench analysis was performed for an HTS solenoid. In this paper we consider the results of these calculations...|$|R
50|$|The M17 Protective Mask is {{a series}} of gas masks that were {{designed}} and produced in 1959 (as a replacement of the M-9 gas mask) to provide protection from all types of known chemical and biological agents present. The M-17 was issued to troops in the Vietnam war, and was standard issue for the U.S. Military until it was replaced by the M40 Field Protective Mask for the U.S. Army and USMC in the mid 1990s while the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force replaced it for the MCU-2/P Gas Mask. The mask has different components including a filter, a face piece and <b>outserts.</b> Filter elements in the face piece prevent harmful agents from entering the mask. The M17 series includes three types of masks, the M17, M17A1 and M17A2. An experimental transparent-silicone model called the XM27 was designed in late 1966, but was turned down in favor of the XM28E4. Many countries have copied the M17 design. Notable copies include the Bulgarian PDE-1, Japanese Type-3, the Polish Mp-4 and the Czech OM10 or M10M.These protective masks have inbuilt voice emitter systems that facilitate communication, a tube for drinking water from the M1 canteen cap (A1 & A2), and a pair of <b>outserts</b> to protect eye lenses and an air pathway that reduced fogging. The mask is packed in a carrier that also contains other items like a nerve agent antidote kit (NAAK), a convulsive antidote for nerve agents (CANA) and an M-258A1 decontamination kit. It also contains a M1 waterproof bag to protect filter elements from water damage. Other components attached are mask hoods to protect the head and neck area, a winterization kit to prevent frost accumulation during cold weather conditions and optical inserts for soldiers with vision defects.The M17A1 was designed with intent to allow a masked soldier to provide artificial respiration to an unmasked casualty, the resuscitation tube was a noble idea gone wrong. The problem with it being the exposure of both soldiers to contamination, the soldier giving aid ran the risk of encountering resistance from the airway of the casualty, pushing air back into his mask and breaking the seal on it. The casualty would remain unmasked, and would continue absorbing the contaminated environment. It was for this reason that the resuscitation tube system was no longer issued for the A1 and was dropped on the M17A2.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Evidence on the {{effectiveness}} of printed educational messages in contributing to increasing evidence-based clinical practice is contradictory. Nonetheless, these messages flood physician offices, in an attempt to promote treatments that can reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. This study evaluated the ability of printed educational messages to promote the choice of thiazides as the first-line treatment for individuals newly diagnosed with hypertension, a practice supported by good evidence and included in guidelines, and one which could reduce costs to the health care system. Methods The study uses a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (randomized by physician practice group). Setting The setting involves all Ontario general/family practice physicians. Messages advising the use of thiazides as the first-line treatment of hypertension were mailed to each physician in conjunction with a widely read professional newsletter. Physicians were randomized to receive differing versions of printed educational messages: an “insert” (two-page evidence-based article) and/or one of two different versions of an “outsert” (short, directive message stapled to the outside of the newsletter). One <b>outsert</b> was developed without an explicit theory and one with messages developed targeting factors from the theory of planned behaviour or neither (newsletter only, with no mention of thiazides). The percentage of patients aged over 65 and newly diagnosed with hypertension who were prescribed a thiazide as the sole initial prescription medication. The effect of the intervention was estimated using a logistic regression model estimated using generalized estimating equation methods to account for the clustering of patients within physician practices. Results Four thousand five hundred four physicians (with 23, 508 patients) were randomized, providing 97  % power to detect a 5  % absolute increase in prescription of thiazides. No intervention effect was detected.

40|$|Abstract Background There are {{gaps between}} what family {{practitioners}} do in clinical {{practice and the}} evidence-based ideal. The most commonly used strategy to narrow these gaps is the printed educational message (PEM); however, the attributes of successful printed educational messages and their overall effectiveness in changing physician practice are not clear. The current endeavor aims to determine whether such messages change prescribing quality in primary care practice, and whether these effects differ with {{the format of the}} message. Methods/design The design is a large, simple, factorial, unblinded cluster-randomized controlled trial. PEMs will be distributed with informed, a quarterly evidence-based synopsis of current clinical information produced by the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Canada, and will be sent to all eligible general and family practitioners in Ontario. There will be three replicates of the trial, with three different educational messages, each aimed at narrowing a specific evidence-practice gap as follows: 1) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, hypertension treatment, and cholesterol lowering agents for diabetes; 2) retinal screening for diabetes; and 3) diuretics for hypertension. For each of the three replicates there will be three intervention groups. The first group will receive informed with an attached postcard-sized, short, directive "outsert. " The second intervention group will receive informed with a two-page explanatory "insert" on the same topic. The third intervention group will receive informed, with both the above-mentioned <b>outsert</b> and insert. The control group will receive informed only, without either an <b>outsert</b> or insert. Routinely collected physician billing, prescription, and hospital data found in Ontario's administrative databases will be used to monitor pre-defined prescribing changes relevant and specific to each replicate, following delivery of the educational messages. Multi-level modeling will be used to study patterns in physician-prescribing quality over four quarters, before and after each of the three interventions. Subgroup analyses will be performed to assess the association between the characteristics of the physician's place of practice and target behaviours. A further analysis of the immediate and delayed impacts of the PEMs will be performed using time-series analysis and interventional, auto-regressive, integrated moving average modeling.

HTS Roebel cables are assembled from meander shaped REBCO coated conductor tapes. In comparison with fair level of uniformity of current distribution in cables made out of round Nb-Ti or Nb 3 Sn strands, current distribution within the coils wound from Roebel cables is highly non-homogeneous. It results in nonuniform electromagnetic force distribution over the cable that could damage the very thin REBCO superconducting layer. This paper focuses on the numerical models to describe the effect of the non-homogenous current distribution on stress distribution in the demonstrator magnet designed for the EuCARD- 2 project. Preliminary results indicate that the impregnation bonding betweenthecableglassﬁberinsulationandlayer-to-layerinsulation plays a signiﬁcant role in the pressure distribution at the cable edges.

Metal plastic hybrid structures are an efficient solution to use the best material at every place. The current states of the art for the manufacturing of metal plastic composites are three technologies: the insert technology, the <b>outsert</b> technology and the metal plastic hybrid technology. In all technologies the metal parts were produced separately from the plastic parts. The injection moulding process is only used for forming the plastic parts and for joining. This process chains are very long. At the Fraunhofer IWU new process combinations are under development. The aim {{is a combination of}} metal forming and injection moulding in one die and one process. One part should be produced with every stroke of the press. In a first step deep drawing, injection molding and media based forming with the plastic melt have been successfully merged in one tool and one process. It was possible to integrate the injection moulding process in a deep drawing machine. In the next step hydroforming with gas and injection molding could be combined successfully. For this process combination the hydroforming process is integrated in an injection moulding press. Different surface structures of the metal pipes, such as sandblasting, knurling and laser structuring, were systematically tested regarding to their properties as an adhesion promoter. The goal is to establish a purely mechanical connection between the hydroformed metal component and the injection moulded component from glass fibre reinforced plastic instead of the previously often used chemical bonding agents, such as Vestamelt.

40|$|Abstract Background Evidence of the {{effectiveness}} of printed educational messages in narrowing the gap between guideline recommendations and practice is contradictory. Failure to screen for retinopathy exposes primary care patients with diabetes to risk of eye complications. Screening is initiated by referral from family practitioners but adherence to guidelines is suboptimal. We aimed to evaluate the ability of printed educational messages aimed at family doctors to increase retinal screening of primary care patients with diabetes. Methods Design: Pragmatic 2 × 3 factorial cluster trial randomized by physician practice, involving 5, 048 general practitioners (with 179, 833 patients with diabetes). Setting: Ontario family practitioners. Interventions: Reminders (that retinal screening helps prevent diabetes-related vision loss and is covered by provincial health insurance for patients with diabetes) with prompts to encourage screening were mailed to each physician in conjunction with a widely-read professional newsletter. Alternative printed materials formats were an ‘outsert’ (short, directive message stapled to the outside of the newsletter), and/or a two-page, evidence-based article (‘insert’) and a pre-printed sticky note reminder for patients. Main outcome measure: A successful outcome was an eye examination (which includes retinal screening) provided to a patient with diabetes, not screened in the previous 12  months, within 90  days after visiting a family practitioner. Analysis accounted for clustering of doctors within practice groups. Results No intervention effect was detected (eye exam rates were 31. 6 % for patients of control physicians, 31. 3 % for the insert, 32. 8 % for the <b>outsert,</b> 32. 3 % for those who received both, and 31. 2 % for those who received both plus the patient reminder with the largest 95 % confidence interval around any effect extending from − 1. 3 % to 1. 1 %). Conclusions This large trial conclusively failed to demonstrate any impact of printed educational messages on screening uptake. Despite their low cost, printed educational messages should not be routinely used in attempting to close evidence-practice gaps relating to diabetic retinopathy screening.
