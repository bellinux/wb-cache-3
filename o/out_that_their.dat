5|$|Nana is {{then asked}} to take Nunung out with her, {{in the hopes that}} the eldest sister will meet a marriageable young man. At a party, while Nana mingles with several men, Nunung sits out every dance and {{eventually}} leaves with Herman. Asked why she has returned home, Nunung tells her grandmother that she felt too old among the younger party-goers and asks why she was told to go. Nenny, again eavesdropping, shouts <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> grandmother is hoping to find her a husband. Though Nunung is initially angered, she understands her grandmother's good intentions.|$|E
5|$|Senate {{committees}} can {{be affected}} by the party composition of the Senate. The Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, argued that a government majority of seats in the Senate resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information. Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian Democrats have been used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government control of the Senate, particularly in respect of selection of topics for committee inquiry. However Senator Minchin, the leader of the government in the Senate in the mid-2000s, pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> political rivals had previously cut off debate on more bills in the Senate than had his government.|$|E

5|$|Mayor West {{passes a}} law to legalize the drug, and {{everyone}} starts smoking it; the town has improved as a result, with milestones such as an increase in productivity {{and a decrease in}} crime. However, Lois's father, Carter, begins to lose money in the timber industry since hemp is being used to manufacture many products, particularly paper, and he bribes Peter to help him with an anti-marijuana campaign. Lois, however, points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> methods are uninspired, explaining that Brian only succeeded because he was passionate about legalizing cannabis. Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love. Brian resists at first, but Stewie suggests he at least perform a number about the health risks of cannabis, since the book does not have enough merit to sell on its own. Brian reluctantly complies, and the drug becomes illegal once more.|$|E
25|$|The authors point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> {{analysis}} is completely {{consistent with the}} supposition that a non-black non-raven provides an extremely small amount of evidence although they do not attempt to prove it; they merely calculate {{the difference between the}} amount of evidence that a black raven provides and the amount of evidence that a non-black non-raven provides.|$|E

5000|$|According to a 1982 {{interview}} with lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh, {{the album was}} titled Oh, No! It's Devo because [...] "there are many people out there who, when they hear we're around again or have one more album coming <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> is <b>their</b> reaction." ...|$|R
25|$|Many creationists {{strongly}} oppose certain scientific {{theories in}} a number of ways, including opposition to specific applications of scientific processes, accusations of bias within the scientific community, and claims that discussions within the scientific community reveal or imply a crisis. In response to perceived crises in modern science, creationists claim to have an alternative, typically based on faith, creation science, or intelligent design. The scientific community has responded by pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> conversations are frequently misrepresented (e.g. by quote mining) in order to create the impression of a deeper controversy or crisis, and that the creationists' alternatives are generally pseudoscientific.|$|E
25|$|In December 2004 {{the band}} {{traveled}} to Iraq and played several shows for US {{troops in the}} area, with drummer Byron McMackin of Pennywise filling in for Freese. Some fans and contemporaries in the punk community criticized this decision, claiming that it implied the band supported the US-led war in Iraq. The band members defended their actions by pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> music is deliberately apolitical and that whatever their individual political views might be, they were eager to show support for the troops. This {{was followed by a}} tour of Europe, on which some dates were cancelled due to protests and picketing by groups who felt the band's actions constituted a pro-war stance.|$|E
500|$|Zhang {{wrote about}} the various love affairs of {{emperors}} dissatisfied with the imperial harem, going out into the city incognito to seek out prostitutes and sing-song girls. This {{was seen as a}} general criticism of the Eastern Han emperors and their imperial favorites, guised in the criticism of earlier Western Han emperors. Besides criticizing the Western Han emperors for lavish decadence, Zhang also pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> behavior and ceremonies did not properly conform with the Chinese cyclical beliefs in yin and yang. In a poem criticizing the previous Western Han Dynasty, Zhang wrote: ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his essay}} Din registrul ideilor gingaşe ("From the Register of Gentle Ideas"), where he satirizes the Romanian public's {{reception}} of literature, Zarifopol {{looks into the}} problems faced by Cerna in satisfying his readers. Using one of Cerna's own accounts {{as the basis for}} this analysis, he notes that a group of his young [...] "female admirers" [...] where unpleasantly surprised to find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> idol was [...] "short, pudgy, wide-necked and ruddy-faced." [...] He writes: [...] "the girls... were thus in full agreement with the philosophical tradition which, since the old days, has set as a supreme ideal a mosaic of perfections that is naive and unlikely." ...|$|E
500|$|Bret buys a new cup for $2.79 {{so that he}} and Jemaine {{no longer}} have to share one cup. A month later, they find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> check for the phone bill bounced because their account was short $2.79. The phone company charges them a $30 {{overdraft}} fee, causing the cheque for their gas bill to bounce, and both services are scheduled to be cut off. Immediately after finding this out, their power goes off. Bret ends up selling his guitar to pay the bills, and he performs on stage with Jemaine while playing air guitar and making guitar sounds. Murray writes up his negative opinion of the show in the New Zealand consulate newsletter, giving them [...] "two stars out of 100". When Bret asks Murray for some of the emergency band fund, Murray tells him that he invested the money with a Nigerian man named Nigel Seladu who contacted him over the internet. Nigel promised Murray his money back with [...] "a thousand percent interest" [...] and [...] "a share of his family fortunes". Jemaine and Bret are certain that this is merely a scam.|$|E
500|$|Although shy and {{insecure}} as a teenager, as {{an adult}} Chamberlain became well known for his womanizing. As his lawyer Seymour [...] "Sy" [...] Goldberg put it: [...] "Some people collect stamps, Wilt collected women." [...] Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette Tånnander, who met {{him when he was}} 40 and she 19, remembers him as a pick-up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful: [...] "I think Wilt hit on everything that moved... he never was bad or rude." [...] Many of Chamberlain's personal friends testified that he once had 23 women in 10 days, had no problems organizing a threesome (or more), and particularly enjoyed a TV skit on the television show In Living Color in which a mother and her daughter approach a Vietnam Wall-like list of women who slept with him, both of them pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> names are on it, as well as a 1991 Saturday Night Live sketch where MC Hammer played Chamberlain in [...] "Remembrances of Love", where Chamberlain spoofs a soap opera with romances with women that are usually over in five minutes. [...] However, Los Angeles Times columnist David Shaw claimed that during a dinner with Shaw and his wife, Chamberlain was [...] "rude and sexist toward his own date, as he usually was", adding that at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the phone number of an attractive woman at a nearby table.|$|E

The plot was evidently in execution, as Mr. Trotter had foretold.|$|R
500|$|Digital Dimension {{took charge}} of the visual effects of the film. CG {{supervisor}} Jason Crosby pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. [...] "They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG," [...] Crosby indicated. [...] "It began with R on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through windshields killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role." [...] Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. Digital artist Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also inputed for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a Douglas-fir were also considered.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{reception}} was mixed, review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} rating of 55%, based on a sample of 221 reviews; the site's consensus reading [...] "It's more entertaining than many sequels, but with Oliver Stone directing, a terrific cast, and a timely storyline that picks up where the original left off, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps should be better," [...] for comparison, Wall Street (1987) had achieved a 78% positive rating. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News awarded it five out of five stars {{saying that it is}} a sharp sequel that is worthy of its investment. He also saluted the cast's performance and noted that Douglas gives Gekko [...] "uncounted layers as he fakes, deals and fuels fire". Matthew Toomey of Australia's 612 ABC Radio Brisbane gave it a B-rating and said that Douglas is the film's [...] "biggest positive", finding LaBeouf to be unconvincing in his role. Christy Lemire, in The Canadian Press, claimed that the film ultimately [...] "goes soft and loses its way" [...] and described the contrast in its final scenes as being [...] "laughable". Furthermore, the subplot between LaBeouf and Mulligan's characters as unneeded and pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> relationship leads viewers to wonder why Winnie, who despises Gekko, would be involved with a man who does exactly the same thing as him, which she condemns; however, Lemire acknowledged that the movie is an uncommon sequel that seems to be both relevant and necessary and said that it proves that [...] "greed can still be good". Film critic Colin Newton of the Brisbane Sunday Mail felt that the plot lacked the enthusiasm of the first film. Along the same lines, Village Voice contributor Nick Pinkerton pointed out that the Wall Street sequel did not have the [...] "clean, fable-like arc" [...] formula of its predecessor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two groups}} mixed between 1,900 and 4,200 years ago (100 CE-2200 BCE), where-after {{a shift to}} {{endogamy}} took place and admixture became rare. Speaking to Fountain Ink, David Reich stated, [...] "Prior to 4,200 years ago, there were unmixed groups in India. Sometime between 1,900 to 4,200 years ago, profound, pervasive convulsive mixture occurred, affecting every Indo-European and Dravidian group in India without exception." [...] Reich pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> work does not show that a substantial migration occurred during this time.|$|E

The men accuse him of stealing food and he decides not to provide them with quality food. The men begin to appreciate him; however, Carter finds <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> mistrust in him remains.|$|E
2500|$|Vivian Sobchack {{argued that}} the film uses visual imagery {{to focus on the}} Joads as a family unit, whereas the novel focuses on their journey {{as a part of the}} [...] "family of man". She points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> farm is never shown in detail, and that the family members are never shown working in agriculture; not a single peach is shown in the entire film. This subtly serves to focus the film on the {{specific}} family, as opposed to the novel's focus on man and land together.|$|E
