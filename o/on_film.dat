5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be <b>on</b> <b>film</b> and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot <b>on</b> <b>film</b> on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} made {{as an attempt}} to capture the essence of The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo's live {{performances}} <b>on</b> <b>film,</b> and also as a means for both director Elfman to retire from music to work <b>on</b> <b>film</b> projects, and to serve as a transition between the group's former cabaret style and a new wave-based style.
