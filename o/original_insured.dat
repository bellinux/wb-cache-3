5000|$|The {{most severe}} damage was in Corpus Christi and Aransas Pass. Throughout the state, 8,950 homes were {{destroyed}} and damaged about 55,650 others. About 252 small businesses, 331 boats, and 310 farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed. Initially, losses were {{estimated to have}} reached $434 million. However, due to lower insurance rate of coverage, the <b>original</b> <b>insured</b> losses, $310 million, were tripled, rather than doubled. Thus, the damage toll was revised upward to $930 million in 2011. Damage to crops was slightly more than $8.8 million. In addition, Celia caused 15 fatalities and injured 466 others. The most severe damage occurred in the streaks of damage, not by tornadoes, but a series microbursts and downbursts, most of which occurred in a 15 minute span. Survivors of the storm described the downbursts as suddenly [...] "rocket shells" [...] exploding. However, areas between the streaks suffered surprisingly little damage, mainly ornamental due to debris from the homes nearby. Celia dropped heavy rains as it made landfall. However, due to the small size and fast movement of the storm, precipitation was not widespread. At the time of landfall, much of Texas was suffering from a drought. Most areas received 3 to 4 in.|$|E
40|$|Marine {{reinsurance}} is an indemnity {{relationship in}} which the marine reinsurer indemnifies the insurance company for losses paid. When a primary insurance company becomes insolvent, there may be insufficient funds in the estate to pay claims in full and it may take several years to distribute such funds. For this reason, some insureds and third-party claimants seek to collect reinsurance proceeds directly from reinsurers (direct actions). However, The indemnity nature of the reinsurance agreement prohibits direct actions against reinsurers for reinsurance proceeds by insureds and other claimants. Under a marine reinsurance contract, the reinsurer does not assume the liability of the reinsured insurance company. In other words, the <b>original</b> <b>insured</b> cannot enforce his insurer's contract of reinsurance {{and is not a}} third-party beneficiary to that contract. Therefore, no privity exists between the reinsurer and the insured or persons claiming through him under the contract of reinsurance. Absent an intent to benefit directly or create rights in insureds or other third parties, reinsurance proceeds are payable only to the reinsured insurance company or its domiciliary liquidator where the insurer becomes insolvent. The insolvency of the reinsured does not affect this fundamental premise. Yet, {{in the face of this}} well-established principle of law, the <b>original</b> <b>insured</b> and other claimants still seek to recover themselves by making direct claims on the insolvent's reinsurers. The persistence in pursuing the variety of theories upon which the claimants have proceeded suggests a continuing unwillingness to accept the balancing of interests stay in liquidation statutes and the need for reinsurers to clearly settle their rights and obligations in reinsurance contracts...|$|E
60|$|The copyists of {{pictures}} are very numerous, {{both in the}} Pitti and Uffizi galleries; and, unlike sculptors, {{they appear to be}} on the best of terms with one another, chatting sociably, exchanging friendly criticism, and giving their opinions as to the best mode of attaining the desired effects. Perhaps, as mere copyists, they escape the jealousy that might spring up between rival painters attempting to develop original ideas. Miss Howorth says that the business of copying pictures, especially those of Raphael, is a regular profession, and she thinks it exceedingly obstructive to the progress or existence of a modern school of painting, there being a regular demand and sure sale for all copies of the old masters, at prices proportioned to their merit; whereas the effort to be <b>original</b> <b>insures</b> nothing, except long neglect, {{at the beginning of a}} career, and probably ultimate failure, and the necessity of becoming a copyist at last. Some artists employ themselves from youth to age in nothing else but the copying of one single and selfsame picture by Raphael, and grow at last to be perfectly mechanical, making, I suppose, the same identical stroke of the brush in fifty successive pictures.|$|R
5000|$|For instance, in vehicle {{insurance}} {{a typical}} Personal Auto Policy will cover {{not only the}} <b>original</b> named <b>insured</b> that purchased the auto policy, but will also cover additional persons while they are driving the auto with permission of the named insured. This is a simple type of blanket additional insurance arrangement, {{because it does not}} identify the additional insured by name, but by a [...] "blanket" [...] general description that will automatically apply to many persons. Similarly, in liability insurance, all directors, officers, and employees of a named insured company will also enjoy the status of being an insured, so long as they are acting in their capacity of carrying out the business of the named insured company. These persons enjoy insured status only while they pursue the business of the named insured. If they deviate to pursue their own affairs, they lose this extension of coverage. This extension of coverage to people with a constant and close relationship to the named insured company is accomplished via the [...] "Who Is An Insured" [...] section of the liability policy. In other cases, the <b>original</b> named <b>insured</b> wishes to extend coverage to others who would not come within these standard categories. To extend coverage further, Additional Insured Endorsements are added to the policy.|$|R
5000|$|In US {{insurance}} policies, {{an additional}} insured {{is a person}} or organization that enjoys the benefits of being insured under an insurance policy, in addition to whoever originally purchased the insurance policy. The term generally applies within liability insurance and property insurance, but {{is an element of}} other policies as well. Most often it applies where the <b>original</b> named <b>insured</b> needs to provide insurance coverage to additional parties so that they enjoy protection from a new risk that arises out of the original named insured's conduct or operations. An additional insured often gains this status by means of an endorsement added to the policy which either identifies the additional party by name or by a general description contained in a [...] "blanket additional insured endorsement." ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Rothchild was {{established}} in the Los Angeles music scene, and his house on Lookout Mountain in Laurel Canyon was inhabited by many of the future musical superstars of the 1960s and 1970s. He produced the original song demo of Crosby, Stills, & Nash that landed the group a recording contract (it was actually Crosby, Stills and John Sebastian on the recording, with Sebastian later replaced by Graham Nash). Rothchild originated the concept [...] "LEDO" [...] ( [...] Leadered / Equalized / Dolby / <b>Original).</b> This format <b>insured</b> the final tape would represent Rothchild's sonic vision for future generations.|$|R
5000|$|The usual {{reasons for}} {{including}} other parties as additional insureds {{is due to}} the close relationship or legal requirements between the <b>original</b> named <b>insured</b> and the additional insured. In most cases it is beneficial for a party to be covered as an additional insured on the policies of other parties because this will reduce the loss history of the additional insured and lower its premiums. The losses will be posted against the policies of the party providing the additional insurance and their premiums will rise accordingly. Typically, a larger and more powerful business will require that smaller entities (desiring to do business) have the larger business named as an additional insured. For example, a landlord in a commercial building will often require that a tenant have the landlord named as an additional insured on the tenant's insurance policies. [...] In this manner, if there is an accident or loss on the tenant's premises (such as a fall or a fire), then the landlord will enjoy the benefits of the tenant's insurance coverage. Similarly, general contractors often require subcontractors to name the general and the owner on the subcontractor's policies. [...] In this way, if the general contractor or owner are sued due to accidents arising out of the work of the subcontractor, the subcontractor's insurance will protect the general contractor and owner.|$|R
40|$|Lean UI {{development}} in Feature Driven Development is achieved through right-first-time {{implementation of the}} interaction designer’s intent using David Harel’s Statechart notation to model the interaction design. Statechart notation can be directly mapped to an MVC Type-II architecture and Mediator Pattern. With a few minor extensions Statechart notation {{can be used to}} model complex application behavior such as exception handling and transactions. Statecharts can be mapped into UI Features for tracking using an FDD Knowledge Base. The Statechart can be drawn using a UML modeling tool, and imported into the JStateMachine engine which implements a table driven Mediator and Command pattern system in either a Web Servlet or JFC (Swing) environment. The result is reduced variation in UI development and precise implementation of the interaction designer’s intent.

5000|$|Fred Lasswell {{was one of}} {{the first}} cartoonists to create a digital image archive of all of his <b>original</b> drawings, to <b>insure</b> that his art could provide source {{material}} for future art students and to insure the continuation of his comic strips. His archive contains thousands of images of his characters, all of their expressions, costumes, poses and actions, interior and exterior background and seasonal scenes, cartoon drawings of county fairs, farms, farm animals, back-woods scenes and the critters who live there, cartoon depictions of leisure activities, pass times, sports; thousands of categorized and cartoon drawings of useful objects, tools, gadgets and props; and pictures of cartoony animals, birds, creepy critters and sea life. [...] "On the day he died he was twelve weeks ahead on his strips; he finished his last video for kids and schools; he called his patent lawyer with his new invention for animating comics on the internet; he spent the evening remembering wonderful times; he went to bed in a high spirited mood and passed away in his sleep. A gentle death for a wonderful, genuine man who spent his life making millions of people laugh every day. He was the cartoonists' cartoonist and his colleagues honored him many times with every industry award, some of which they awarded him twice. He left us with a Charitable Foundation for [...] "Learning and Laughter," [...] which, since 2001 has worked on programs for nutrition, recreation, arts education and advocacy for kids and is working on developing some of his brilliant ideas for teacher learning aids." ...|$|R
