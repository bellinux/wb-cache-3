50|$|Personnel {{management}} in the Valkeakoski paper mills community around 1924-1969 was dominated by Rudolf and Juuso Walden. This industrial community was managed in industrial paternalistic way. Although industrial paternalism had been abandoned in {{major part of the}} industry in the early 1900s. The central argument <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Rudolf and Juuso Walden created a paternalist hold on the Valkeakoski industrial community, even if other industrial plants had already abandoned this idea. Walden´s genuine goal was to create vibrant ideal communities around the factories. The problem was that the independent Finland was in its early stages and the nation was divided. After the Civil War of Finland the idea of ideal plant community was buried. United Paper Mills solution in this problem was to increase the satisfaction of the employees and give fatherly guidance to them. Rudolf Walden upheld a strong patriarchal tradition and Juuso Walden continued in his footsteps until he resigned.|$|E

An interesting finding <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> [...] "the two most common reasons cited (for engaging in mixed-orientation marriages) were that it 'seemed natural' (cited by65.4%), and that they 'wanted children and family life' (65.4%)."

[...] Though these and other findings are of great intrigue, there are limitations as to what can be extrapolated from the data {{and the author of the}} Deakin University study agrees, [...] "Further research with men, women and children of these 'mixed-orientation marriages' is needed to develop a theoretical understanding of the causes, processes and impactof marriage (and marriage-breakdown) in gay and bisexual men." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, a study {{compared}} {{sequences of}} 1,300 base pairs in length from the mtDNA control region for 18 wolves from the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park near Darjeeling in West Bengal, northern India. The {{study found that}} the wolves were basal to all other wolves and formed one haplotype, indicating that they shared a common female ancestor. The study did not ascertain if the zoo specimens were all related. The conclusion supported the 2004 study that the Himalayan wolf differed from other Tibetan wolves. A criticism <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was based on limited data with no samples collected from the Kashmir valley population, despite suggesting that Kashmir is an area of potential contact of the closely related wolf clades. Instead, the samples were collected from Indian zoos or museum specimens. Additionally, the areas under study are part of the same landscape, and the question of what ecological or behavioral barriers could be facilitating such strict divergence, particularly when no striking morphological differences occur between the wolves from Tibet and Indian Trans-Himalaya, remains unanswered.|$|E
5000|$|The major finding <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the human}} {{cognition}} contains three components, or three broad types of [...] "cultural rules of behavior", namely, Values, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Rules, {{each of which}} has a mutually conditioning relationship with behavior. The three cognitive components are different in terms of the scope and duration of their mutual shaping of behavior. Values are universal and enduring rules of behavior; Expectations, on the other hand, are context-specific behavioral rules; while Ad Hoc Rules are improvised rules of behavior that the human mind devises contingent upon a particular occasion. Furthermore, they need not be consistent, and frequently are not, among themselves. Metaphorically, they can be compared to a multi-carriage train, which allows for the relative lateral movements by individual carriages so as to accommodate bumps and turns in the tracks. In fact, they provide a [...] "shock-absorber mechanism", so to speak, which enables individuals in SW-ICCM contexts to cope with conflicts in cultural practices and values, and to accommodate and adapt themselves to cultural contexts where people from different national cultural backgrounds work together over extended time. It also provides a powerful framework which explains how interactions by individuals in SW-ICCM contexts give rise to emerging hybrid cultural practices characterized by both stability and change.|$|E

5000|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the proposed divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. [...] "The term basal taxon refers to a lineage that diverges early {{in the history of}} the group and lies on a branch that originates near the common ancestor of the group." [...] In 2004, a study compared sequences of 582 base pairs in length from the mtDNA control region for 27 wolves from the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. The phylogenetic tree generated from the sequences indicated that there were 5 related haplotypes formed a clade that was basal to all other wolves. This clade included one sequence from Ladakh in eastern Kashmir, nine from the Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh, four from Nepal, and two from Tibet. Seven wolves also from Kashmir did not fall into this clade. Hodgson (1847) described the Tibetan wolf as C. laniger. A study of the mitochondrial control region of the specimen that Hodgson collected (labelled BM58.6.24.61) was found to fall within the proposed Himalayan wolf clade. However, the 50% likelihood provided by the model on which this study rested provides only weak support for this proposal. A criticism <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was based on zoo specimens and it is known that all zoo specimens have been captive-bred from only two females. Therefore, the study did not provide a representative sample. Additionally, the wolf population in the Kashmir valley is known to have recently arrived in that area.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argue that}} while [...] "barebacking" [...] and [...] "UAI" [...] technically both mean the same thing, they have different undertones. With {{the increased use of}} the term [...] "barebacking", the term has been adopted for marketing purposes. This is because [...] "Unprotected Anal Intercourse" [...] makes a direct connection between unprotected sex and the risk of contracting diseases like HIV/AIDS. However, although [...] "bareback" [...] seems to have become the favorable term, studies show that both terms ultimately have equally negative implications. In a study where participants were shown two different scenes featuring anal sex, the significance of the words [...] "bareback" [...] and [...] "UAI" [...] became apparent. The first scene featured group sex in which several men were on top engaging in intercourse with one man on the bottom. The men on top were in their mid-30's and of varying ethnicities while the man on the bottom was around 18 years old. The second scene featured two men both in their 20's in a living room setting. During the interview, the participants were much more reluctant to classify the second scene as [...] "bareback" [...] or [...] "UAI", than they were for the first scene. Participants readily used [...] "bareback" [...] to describe the first scene in which there were clear contrasts in race, age, and power. The participants described the second scene as being more [...] "meaningful and romantic" [...] and hence more likely to use a condom to protect the other. The implication <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the term [...] "bareback" [...] ultimately does have a dark meaning as it relates to HIV/AIDS, regardless if it does not mention protection in its name. Thus, studies have shown that barebacking is decreasing in popularity within the gay subculture. Bareback pornography does not necessarily encourage more unprotected anal sex in reality, nor do all men who participate in anal sex necessarily want to have unprotected sex. What is clear is that there is still a sense of risk among participants of anal sex.|$|E
5000|$|One might {{consider}} the experiment Watson {{and his assistant}} Rosalie Rayner carried {{out to be one}} of the most controversial in psychology in 1920. It has become immortalized in introductory psychology textbooks as the Little Albert experiment. The goal of the experiment was to show how principles of, at the time recently discovered, classical conditioning could be applied to condition fear of a white rat into [...] "Little Albert", a 9-month-old boy. Watson and Rayner conditioned [...] "Little Albert" [...] by clanging an iron rod when a white rat was presented. First, they presented to the boy a white rat and observed that he was not afraid of it. Second, they presented him with a white rat and then clanged an iron rod. [...] "Little Albert" [...] responded by crying. This second presentation was repeated several times. Finally, Watson and Rayner presented the white rat by itself and the boy showed fear. Later, in an attempt to see if the fear transferred to other objects, Watson presented Albert with a rabbit, a dog, and a fur coat. He cried at the sight of all of them. This study demonstrated how emotions could become conditioned responses. As the story of [...] "Little Albert" [...] has made the rounds, inaccuracies and inconsistencies have crept in, some of them even due to Watson himself. Analyses of Watson’s film footage of Albert suggest that the infant was mentally and developmentally disabled. An ethical problem <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Watson and Rayner did not uncondition [...] "Little Albert". In 2009, Beck and Levinson found records of a child, Douglas Merritte, who seemed to have been Little Albert. They found that he had died from congenital hydrocephalus at the age of 6. Thus, it cannot be concluded to what extent this study had an effect on [...] "Little Albert"'s life. On 25 January 2012, Tom Bartlett of The Chronicle of Higher Education published a report that questions whether John Watson knew of cognitive abnormalities in Little Albert that would greatly skew the results of the experiment. [...] In 2014, however, the journals that initially endorsed Beck and Fridlund's claims about Albert and Watson (the American Psychologist and History of Psychology) published articles debunking those claims ...|$|E
