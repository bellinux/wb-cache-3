5|$|Ramprasad Sen is {{regarded}} as one of the notable figures of the bhakti movement in Bengal during the eighteenth century. He is credited with popularizing the bhakti Shakta tradition and Shyama Sangeet—devotional songs to the goddess Kali. Ramprasad was the first Shakta poet to address Kali with such intimate devotion, and to sing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tender loving mother or even as a little girl. After him, a school of Shakta poets continued the Kali-bhakti tradition.|$|E
5|$|In {{their attempt}} to create a world where humans and Tayutai can peacefully coexist, Yuri and Mashiro battle the members of the Three Mightiest in a successive, {{nonlinear}} order determined by the player's decisions. In one scenario, Nue, a young female Tayutai, begins to steal undergarments from the Flawless dormitories due to her curiosity in them. She is defeated by Mashiro and Mifuyu Kisaragi, and finds herself befriended by Mifuyu, who later begins to take care <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> guardian. Yumina Takanashi, Yuri's stepsister, also begins to take care of Hou, an exhausted bird Tayutai who begins to nest on Yumina's head. Yumina is later attacked by Ou, another Tayutai who makes up the Houou couple with Hou, before the couple reconciles with the help of Yuri and Mashiro. Lastly, Ameri allies herself with Ouryu, the last of the Three Mightiest, out of jealousy from the amount of attention Mashiro receives from Yuri. After Ameri reconciles with Yuri, Ouryu agrees to stop attacking humans, and acknowledges Mashiro's goal.|$|E

5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E
25|$|This {{information}} {{brings a}} lot of emotional turmoil for Hikari even more when she goes to Mao Natsukawa for support and he turns his back on her, tired of always coming to sloppy seconds to Ooishi. Natsukawa is frustrated with her, since Hikari is always focusing herself on Ooishi even though she always knew deep inside that Ooishi (while he was developing feelings for her at first) always thought <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> friend or a little sister.|$|E
25|$|Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is {{the mother}} of Tsarnaev and his brother. In photos <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> younger woman, she wore western-style clothing. After she arrived in the U.S. from Russia in 2002, she took classes at the Catherine Hinds Institute of Esthetics before {{becoming}} a state-licensed aesthetician and getting a job at a suburban day spa. After deciding she could no longer work in a business that served men, she started working from home, where clients saw her become more radical and promote 9/11 conspiracy theories.|$|E

25|$|After deactivation, John Rodgers was {{acquired}} by Beauchamp Tower Corp., a small non-profit foundation based in Florida, in late 2006 with the stated purpose of returning her to the States as a museum in Mobile, Alabama. But these plans fell through, and John Rodgers was moored unattended at a granary pier in Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico, accumulating more than $2 million in liens and penalties for unpaid towing and wharfage. The Mexican Government in 2008 announced plans to seize and dispose <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> derelict, and on 2 August 2010, declared that the ship was abandoned property, ordering her to be scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Through her back-story {{we learn}} that her {{religious}} vows didn't stop her physical urges, {{and she had a}} relationship with an evil aristocrat, Egidio, who pushed her to become his accomplice in the murder of a nun: this is her tormenting secret. The principal female characters, Agnese and Lucia, meet Gertrude (The Nun of Monza) while escaping from the villain Don Rodrigo. They shelter in her convent, looking for hospitality. Gertrude becomes close to Lucia. Egidio asks her to help him to kidnap Lucia on behalf of the bandit Innominato, who is working for Rodrigo. She at first refuses, then gives in, and later confesses her crimes. Her decision is difficult for her, emphasizing Manzoni's view <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weak tool of evil, unable to resist threats and temptations, but basically not cruel. Later in the novel, at the end of Chapter 37, Lucia learns of Gertrude's repentance, confession of guilt, and consequent sentence.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the teenaged Canaan—under {{the stage}} name Angel—joined the heavy metal band Equation, who until then had been intent on finding a male lead singer. Canaan's talent, personality, and stage {{presence}} gained her national popularity among Lebanese youth. The same year, she donned {{what would become}} her trademark, trend-setting look: revealing, studded leather outfits with dramatic capes and hip-length blonde-streaked hair. Off stage, Canaan's Alma Mater, Brummana High School (BHS), voted her “Best Dressed”. On stage, her provocative costumes contributed to the perception <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sex symbol. The Daily Star wrote: “On stage, with her daring looks and style, Canaan became a role model”. At the height of their success the band drew a crowd of over 15,000. Canaan's first original composition, “Why All The Hurt”, a tribute to a deceased friend that she wrote as a teenager, was a No. 1 hit on the radio charts in Lebanon.|$|E

25|$|Sarada Devi {{received}} the highest reverence from the Ramakrishna Order and its devotees. Ramakrishna had bade her continue his mission {{after his death}} and wanted his disciples not to make any distinction between himself and her. According to her devotees and traditional biographers, the hospitality of Sarada Devi was unique and was characterised by motherly care and solicitude. Traditional accounts recount the mystical experiences of her devotees. Some dreamt <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> goddess in human form though {{they had never seen}} her picture before. Others reportedly {{received the}}ir initiation from her in their dream. One such example is of Girish Chandra Ghosh, the father of Bengali drama, who reportedly saw Sarada Devi in a dream when he was nineteen years old and received a mantra. When he met her many years later, to his astonishment she was the same person in the dream.|$|E
25|$|Also {{referred}} to as Natasha. Natasha is a seventeen-year-old daughter of Dar’ya Mikhailovna. She is observant, well-read and intelligent, but also quite secretive. While her mother thinks <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> good-natured and well-mannered girl, she is not of a high opinion about her intelligence, and quite wrongly. She also thinks Natasha is ‘cold’, emotionless, but {{in the beginning of}} Chapter Five we are told by the narrator that “Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; even as a child she seldom cried, and now she seldom even sighed and only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her.” She engages in intellectual conversations with Rudin (which are not discouraged by her mother because she thinks that these conversations “improve her mind”); Natasha thinks highly of Rudin, who confides to her his ideas and “privately gives her books”, and soon falls in love with him. She also often compels him to apply his talents and act. Natasha is often thought of as the first of 'Turgenev maids' to feature in Turgenev's fiction.|$|E
25|$|As season 2 kicks off, Patricia is sinking {{further into}} {{depression}} after she overdoses on sleeping pills and Susan steps {{in to help}} take care <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> live-in nurse, while scheming Wayne tricks Patricia into signing her power of attorney over to him to give him power over his father, Gordon. Shortly after, Susan becomes {{the first of the}} main cast to depart the series as she leaves to be closer to her husband Bill's prison. John tracks down his real father Martin Healy- a prominent officer in the Air Force- and also manages to find Patricia's estranged sister Margaret (Ilona Rodgers). The reunion of Patricia with Martin and Margaret sparks off a series of dramatic storylines as old secrets are revealed and old tensions between Patricia and Margaret resurface. A major turning point in the series comes with the suicide of Martin Healy after past crimes catch up with him, and when Margaret removes his suicide note from beside the body, David comes under suspicion of Martin's murder.|$|E

25|$|Because her father, Robert Sidney, was {{governor}} of Flushing, Wroth {{spent much of her}} childhood at the home of Mary Sidney, and Penshurst Place, Baynard’s Castle in London. Penshurst Place {{was one of the great}} country houses in the Elizabethan and Jacobean period. It was a center of literary and cultural activity and its gracious hospitality is praised in Ben Jonson's famous poem To Penshurst. During a time when most women were illiterate, Wroth had the privilege of a formal education, which was obtained from household tutors under the guidance of her mother. With her family connections, a career at court was all but inevitable. Wroth danced before Queen Elizabeth on a visit to Penshurst and again in court in 1602. At this time a likeness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> girl in a group portrait of Lady Sidney and her children was painted by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger in 1596, and is now on display at Penshurst. As a young woman, Lady Mary belonged to Queen Anne’s intimate circle of friends and actively participated in masques and entertainments.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{critics have}} been hostile to Kay's poetry: {{reviewing}} a concert by the London Sinfonietta, Nicholas Williams refers to her [...] "arresting text". Whether positive or negative, the music critics only assessed part of Kay's original work. In considering the original television version of Twice, the literary critic Laura Severin, praised the contrasted voices {{and the use}} of repetition as an adaptation to a medium where listeners would be less attentive to the words than if they were attending a conventional poetry reading. She also saw Kay's portrayal of Rossiter as one that avoided both a conventional masculine representation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ruthless murderer and an overly simplistic feminist one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> passive victim.|$|E

Gaga was inspired by silent film and early horror films and explained that the concept behind the video is that of her passion for shape-shifting and transforming. She described it as [...] "Iconography in motion, as magic." [...] Gaga and her team decided to use several different looks for the video, with each being representative of different facets <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> performer.

500|$|Describing [...] as feminist is problematic, and I do it {{only after}} much consideration. The label {{is of course}} anachronistic... Treating Wollstonecraft's thought as an {{anticipation}} of nineteenth and twentieth-century feminist argument has meant sacrificing or distorting some of its key elements. Leading examples of this... have been the widespread neglect of her religious beliefs, and the misrepresentation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bourgeois liberal, which together {{have resulted in the}} displacement of a religiously inspired utopian radicalism by a secular, class-partisan reformism as alien to Wollstonecraft's political project as her dream of a divinely promised age of universal happiness is to our own. Even more important however has been the imposition on Wollstonecraft of a heroic-individualist brand of politics utterly at odds with her own ethically driven case for women's emancipation. Wollstonecraft's leading ambition for women was that they should attain virtue, and it was to this end that she sought their liberation.|$|E
