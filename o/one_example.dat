5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> is in Baudhayana Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (One who does not injure others with words, thoughts or acts is named Adrohi).|$|E

5|$|Exports {{and imports}} by air in 2005 were {{estimated}} at £62.7billion and £59.6billion respectively, {{with a significant}} majority of air freight operations being conducted with countries outside of the EU, and express freight operations transporting 5 per cent by value of all UK exports in 2004.

5|$|In 1834, King Ludwig I {{granted the}} city its old {{coat of arms}} again {{in the form of}} large and small crests. These {{embodied}} the small crest seal of 1304 and the large one of 1323.
