50|$|Steel {{that has}} been arc welded, gas welded, or welded in any other manner besides forge welded, is {{affected}} in a localized area by {{the heat from the}} welding process. This localized area, called the heat-affected zone (HAZ), consists of steel that varies considerably in hardness, from normalized steel to steel nearly as hard as quenched steel near the edge of this heat-affected zone. Thermal contraction from the uneven heating, solidification and cooling creates internal stresses in the metal, both within and surrounding the weld. Tempering is sometimes used in place of stress relieving (even heating and cooling of the entire object to just below the A1 temperature) to both reduce the internal stresses and to decrease the brittleness around the weld. Localized tempering is often used <b>on</b> <b>welds</b> when the construction is too large, intricate, or otherwise too inconvenient to heat the entire object evenly. Tempering temperatures for this purpose are generally around 205 C and 343 C.|$|E

The proposed prediction and correction method is used for determining the number of direct locators, and a pattern sorting method is developed for determining the number of total locators.

40|$|Quenched and {{tempered}} steels {{can combine}} high yield and tensile strengths with good notch toughness, ductility and weldability. These steels are particularly convenient whenever {{the increase of}} mechanical resistance {{gives rise to a}} proportional reduction of weight.

Bead-on-welds by manual arc welding process were deposited on trial plates, 10 mm thick. Experimental work included metallographic examination and microhardness test survey.

40|$|ABSTRACT. There is {{a strong}} {{interest}} in the use of aluminum alloy sheet for vehi-cle applications, particularly the body, where resistance spot welding is the prin-cipal joining method. It is important that the particular discontinuities that are often found in aluminum alloy spot welds do not adversely affect the weld properties. The objectives of this work were to provide information about the ef-fect of excessive porosity and surface in-dentation and the effect of weld size on the fatigue performance of spot welds in aluminum alloy sheet. Trials were conducted on 1. 2 -mm-thick 5182 - 0 aluminum alloy in the mill-finished condition. Static shear and fa-tigue tests were conducted <b>on</b> <b>welds</b> over a range of welding conditions to simulate severe weld discontinuities.

40|$|Quenched and {{tempered}} steels {{are required}} to combine high yield and tensile strengths with good notch toughness, ductility and weldability. However, toughness and soundness of these steels can be affected by welding operations, in particular Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) may undergo embrittlement and cracks through the heating cycles. In this paper, a preliminary investigation is done <b>on</b> <b>welds</b> of steel ASTM A 517 Gr. B, carried out by utilizing LBW process without any filler metal. Experimental work included metallographic examination and microhardness survey.

If compared to Shielded Metal Arc (SMAW) process, LBW technique gives rise to an advantageous reduction of areas of both fusion and heat affected zones, less distortion and residual stresses.

40|$|The 700 °C {{power plants}} {{currently}} under development will utilize Ni-base alloys such as alloy 617 for components {{to be operated}} at temperatures > 650 °C. Due to economic reasons for components or parts of components which are subjected to temperatures < 650 °C, 2 % Cr or 9 – 12 % Cr steels is used, depending on the required mechanical properties. This makes the dissimilar joining of Ni-base alloys and Cr steels a necessity in these plants. Experimental investigations show that these joints have {{to be identified as}} weak points with regard to damage development under creep and creep-fatigue loading. The present investigation focuses <b>on</b> <b>welds</b> between the alloy 617 and 2 % Cr steel. Under creep load the fracture occurs near the fusion line between the 2 % Cr steel base metal and alloy 617 weld metal. To explain the reasons for this fracture location, the microstructure of this fusion line was investigated using TEM and FIB techniques after welding and after creep loading. The TEM investigations have shown a small zone in the weld metal near the fusion line exhibiting chromium depletion and clearly reduced amounts of chromium carbides, leading to a weakening of this zone...|$|E
40|$|Weld flaws {{often require}} an {{engineering}} critical assessment (ECA) to {{judge on the}} necessity for weld repair. ECA is a fracture mechanics based prediction of the integrity of welds under operating conditions. Adding {{to the complexity of}} an ECA is the occurrence of local constitutive property variations in the weldment (‘weld heterogeneity’). Their quantification is important to allow for an accurate assessment. Hereto, hardness measurements are widely adopted given their theoretical relation with ultimate tensile strength. However, various standards and procedures report a wide variety of different hardness transfer functions and additionally recognize substantial scatter in predictions of strength. Within this context, this paper investigates the suitability of hardness mapping to perform an accurate weld ECA. A finite element analysis has been conducted <b>on</b> <b>welds</b> originating from steel pipelines to simulate their crack driving force response using single-edge notched tension (SE(T)) specimens. Vickers hardness maps and hardness transfer functions are combined to assign element-specific constitutive properties to the model. The resulting crack driving force curves are probed against experimental results. The variable agreement between simulations and experiments highlights the need for further research into the characterization of local constitutive properties of heterogeneous welds. A hardness transfer procedure based on all weld metal tensile testing appears to be particularly promising...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of governing metal thickness (GMT) and stack orientation <b>on</b> <b>weld</b> quality and mechanical behaviour of resistance spot welded (RSW) AA 5754 aluminium. Individual samples from 27 different joint stacks in three test geometries; lap-shear, coach-peel and cross-tension were evaluated for quasi-static and fatigue performance; micro examination was also conducted {{on some of the}} samples to assess weld quality. The results derived from over 1000 samples show that: the GMT has a significant effect <b>on</b> <b>welding</b> quality by controlling progression of weld nugget from underdeveloped to over penetrated. The GMT also determines the feasible quasi-static joint strength regardless of stacks in the three joint geometries tested, though the effect differs with respect to test geometry. The fatigue behaviour is dominated by the effect of GMT <b>on</b> attainable <b>weld</b> size, overall joint stiffness and stress concentration, providing good quality of weld nuggets is achieved. No notable effect of stack orientation <b>on</b> <b>weld</b> quality and joint strength was found with respect to the joint stack asymmetry and welding orientation to the electrodes. These fundamental relationships between weld qualities, joint strength, GMT and stack orientation for RSW of aluminium will have significant relevance to design and manufacturing communities.

Product development dimensions and estimates likelihood of failure, production monitors and develops process capability and quality/inspection assures measurement system accuracy and precision and estimates probability of detection. Their purpose is of course to avoid catastrophic failures on the field. This investigation reveals that the view and language on risk-based inspection <b>on</b> <b>welds</b> {{is not the same}} between industries and not the same across different functions within the same industry. The consequence is that the underlying problem to welding inspection of inner faults seems not to be a technical issue in first-hand, instead development rather is caught on difficulties on how to create overall consensus on how both root causes and risks with quality variation in the tolerance chain should be identified, assessed and mitigated. This displaces the issue from technical to managerial. This investigation supports an elevation of the issue in order to facilitate future interdisciplinary development to bridge horizontal and vertical fragmentation. Three explaining concepts and one hypothesis on root cause are introduced: •	Concepts for elevated problem characterization are: between industries differences, within industries range of perspectives, and a hierarchy of system levels related to WHY, WHAT and HOW. •	A hypothesis used for problem characterization is the difference between industries where NDT development is driven by the existence of public authority requirements and technical directions or not, which results in different prerequisites (will and need) to technically develop new NDT technology and procedures...|$|E

Preparing this spent fuel and nuclear waste for safe and permanent storage in a geological repository involves developing a robotic packaging system—a system that can accommodate waste packages of various sizes {{and high levels of}} nuclear radiation. During repository operation, commercial and government-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste will be loaded into casks and shipped to the repository, where these materials will be transferred from the casks into a waste package, sealed, and placed into an underground facility. The waste packages range from 12 to 20 feet in height and four and a half to seven feet in diameter. Closure operations include sealing the waste package and all its associated functions, such as welding lids onto the container, filling the inner container with an inert gas, performing nondestructive examinations <b>on</b> <b>welds,</b> and conducting stress mitigation. The Idaho National Laboratory is designing and constructing a prototype Waste Package Closure System (WPCS). Control of the automated material handling {{is an important part of}} the overall design. Waste package lids, welding equipment, and other tools must be moved in and around the closure cell during the closure process. These objects are typically moved from tool racks to a specific position on the waste package to perform a specific function. Periodically, these objects are moved from a tool rack or the waste package to the adjacent glovebox for repair or maintenance. Locating and attaching to these objects with the remote handling system, a gantry robot, in a loosely fixtured environment is necessary for the operation of the closure cell. Reliably directing the remote handling system to pick and place the closure cell equipment within the cell is the major challenge...|$|E
40|$|Increasing thermal loads, {{temperatures}} and pressures in boilers and steam systems {{is attractive to}} improve the efficiency and operational economy of power and process plants. The adoption of new high strength, modified 2 % Cr steels can be an option, provided that these will perform for the required component life. Challenges have arisen when using new high strength T/P 23 and T/P 24 steels for waterwalls, superheaters and steam lines. This paper reviews the recent understanding of the applicability and limitations of these steels in welded components. A range of causative reasons are proposed for the not entirely successful application of the P/T 23 and P/T 24 particularly in waterwalls and steam lines. The complexity of optimising weld properties is demonstrated in view of unforgiving material response especially at weld defects, {{as well as of}} high weldment hardness and limited ductility. Selection of filler metal type and composition is elucidated with respect to propensity to low weld metal ductility, such as low creep ductility damage or reheat cracking. The role of structural rigidity and actual constraint conditions in real components is discussed, as it comes to adopting filler metals with the aim of either increasing weld creep strength or ensuring adequate creep ductility, as well as to whether to conduct or omit the subsequent PWHT. One of the most persistent remaining challenging issues concerns welded thick-wall applications for high temperature headers, steam pipes or turbines, where the weld metal tends to show very limited creep ductility. More recently, setbacks have been seen in the attempts to use T 24 in welded water walls of large boiler plants. Multiple causes have been proposed for the observed early waterwall cracking, and again, the problems concentrate <b>on</b> <b>welds</b> that tend to exhibit reduced creep ductility. JRC.
