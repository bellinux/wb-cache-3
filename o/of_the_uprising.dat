5|$|Although the MDRM {{leadership}} consistently {{maintained its}} innocence, {{the party was}} dissolved by the French administration on 10 May 1947, and all other political parties, including PADESM, were temporarily suspended. The banning of MDRM further strengthened PADESM's prominence after the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising.</b> Between 1951 and 1956, PADESM candidates won three consecutive legislative elections.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising,</b> {{the army of}} Russia un{{successfully}} tried to capture the capital of Poland on two occasions. First in February 1831, forces under Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch stormed the eastern suburb of Praga. After a bloody battle at Grochów, the Polish Army successfully retreated to Warsaw, and the capital remained in Polish hands.|$|E
5|$|Rajab's {{human rights}} {{work has been}} {{recognized}} internationally but within Bahraini society he remains a figure of controversy. Labeled as the informal leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> and a hero to protesters, Rajab is viewed by government supporters as a troublemaker.|$|E

5|$|After Bardanes's retirement, Nikephoros {{formally}} dismissed him and confiscated {{much of his}} property. The other thematic generals {{who took}} part in the revolt were also dismissed from their posts, the metropolitan bishops of Sardis, Amorion and Nicomedia were punished for their support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> by exile to the small island of Pantelleria off Sicily, while the soldiers of the Anatolian armies were left unpaid for a year.|$|E
5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended to be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for the main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising.</b>|$|E

50|$|After <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wuchang Uprising, {{many other}} protests {{occurred}} {{throughout the country}} for various reasons. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprisings</b> restored imperial rule (光復). Other uprisings were a step toward independence, and some were protests or rebellions against the local authorities. Regardless the reason for <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> <b>the</b> outcome was that all provinces in the country renounced the Qing dynasty and joined the ROC.|$|R
5|$|Chiprovtsi {{is thought}} to have been founded in the Late Middle Ages as a mining and metalsmithing centre. Attracting German ore miners who {{introduced}} Roman Catholicism to the area, the town grew in importance as a cultural, economic and religious centre of the Bulgarian Catholics and the entire Bulgarian northwest during the first few centuries of Ottoman rule. The apogee of this upsurge was the anti-Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising of 1688. After the suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising,</b> some of the town's population fled to Habsburg-ruled lands; those unable to flee were killed or enslaved by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Phokas, the {{rebellion}} collapsed, and Xiphias was arrested and forced to become a monk. Released from the threat to his rear, Basil II swiftly and decisively defeated George I, and imposed his terms on him. The other supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> were imprisoned and released in 1025, after {{the death of}} Basil II and the succession of his younger brother, Constantine VIII. In 1026, however, Constantine VIII accused the last surviving member of the once great family, Bardas Phokas (possibly a son or nephew of Nikephoros Barytrachelos), of plotting against the throne, and had him blinded.|$|E
5|$|From 1833–36, {{he lived}} in Switzerland. A third volume of his poems, {{published}} in 1833 and containing works from the period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Uprising,</b> was far more nationalist in tone, and won more recognition in his homeland. At the same time, he wrote several works featuring romantic themes, and beautiful scenery, such as W Szwajcarii (In Switzerland), Rozłączenie (Separation), Stokrótki (Daisies) and Chmury (Clouds).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{central focus}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprisings</b> were mostly {{connected}} with the Tongmenghui and Sun Yat-sen, including subgroups. Some uprisings involved groups that never merged with the Tongmenghui. Sun Yat-sen may have participated in 8–10 uprisings; all <b>uprisings</b> prior to <b>the</b> failed Wuchang Uprising.|$|R

50|$|Engel {{reported}} {{extensively on}} the Arab Spring movement. He followed <b>the</b> <b>uprisings</b> in Egypt, Syria, Libya, Tunisia, Bahrain, and Yemen. His understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle East and profound awareness of its many complexities provided great depth to his reporting on the unrest in the region. In 2012, {{he was awarded the}} Alfred I. du-Pont-Columbia Award for his outstanding breaking news coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprisings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising.</b> The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|In 1595 Żółkiewski {{participated in}} the Moldavian {{campaign}} and the battle of Cecora near the Prut river. The following year he defeated the Cossack uprising of Severyn Nalivaiko. Żółkiewski was a known supporter of Cossack grievances, and generally favored peaceful negotiations with them. When the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and other leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> to him he guaranteed their fair treatment. But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in Warsaw, and a mob of Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners, {{which led to a}} deterioration in Polish-Cossack relations. In 1600 Żółkiewski returned to Moldova, where he took part in the victorious battle of Bukowo.|$|E
5|$|In September 1828 Balzac {{visited the}} home of a family friend and retired general, the Baron de Pommereul, in Fougères. He spent several weeks {{learning}} about the insurrection (which Pommereul had fought against). He pored over his host's books and interviewed the townspeople about their experiences during the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising.</b> Pommereul owned a castle which had been the headquarters of the Comte de Puisaye, a royalist leader involved with a failed invasion of royalist exiles at Quiberon. This incursion had been aided by the Chouans, and Balzac began collecting events and people as inspiration for his novel.|$|E
40|$|This article studies <b>the</b> 2011 Arab <b>uprisings</b> {{as social}} {{movements}} for political reform and regime change. Social media, particularly Facebook and Twitter, {{are perceived to}} be playing a central role in these events, which have even been described as 'Facebook' and 'Twitter revolutions'. Using diffusion theory, this article examines <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> social media {{and the extent to which}} they can be credited for the emergence and achievement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprisings.</b> It argues that while social media played important facilitation roles in terms of inter and intra-group communication as well as information dissemination, mainstream mass media are still highly relevant to the process. However, the success or failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprisings</b> largely depends on domestic factors and broader geopolitical contexts. This article demonstrates that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> social media in <b>the</b> Arab <b>uprisings</b> has significant implications for diffusion theory in terms of contact and identity among the social movements involved.

50|$|After <b>the</b> {{suppression}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprisings</b> <b>of</b> 1821, there {{followed a}} period of retrenchment. Intellectuals generally abandoned <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> revolution {{in favor of a}} more moderate, reformist program, and <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> progressive culture moved away from Milan to Florence, and from the magazine Il Conciliatiore to Antologia. <b>The</b> <b>uprisings</b> <b>of</b> 1831 would find the intellectuals absent altogether and even Giordani, as a consequence, found himself something of an outcast in Italian society.|$|R

5|$|Major Danuta Ślązak of the Home Army, hid {{out with}} a group of wounded {{patients}} whom she had saved from a hospital that had been set on fire by the Germans during the last days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising.</b> After the war she wrote a book about her experiences, Byłam Warszawskim Robinsonem (I was a Warsaw Robinson). A portion of her group left the hiding place after German troops called out for them to surrender and were immediately executed. The rest remained hidden and escaped detection. Eventually they used the corpses of their murdered companions to disguise the entry to their hiding place.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{hiding places}} and {{makeshift}} bunkers were prepared in advance by those anticipating the fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising.</b> As a result, the sequence whereby people became Robinsons closely followed the military {{developments of the}} insurrection. The first groups went into hiding in Wola during the Wola massacre and in Starówka (Warsaw Old Town), while fighting was still taking place {{in other parts of}} the city. The majority of the Robinsons hid when German forces captured the Żoliborz and Śródmieście (Warsaw City Centre) districts from the insurgents.|$|E
5|$|More men joined Stojanović's detachment, {{and at the}} end of 1941 it {{had over}} one {{thousand}} well-armed soldiers organised in three battalions of three companies each. The detachment established good relations with the Muslim population of the area, with a number of Muslims from Kozarac joining the Partisans. On 21December at Lisina, Pucar held a meeting with the communists of Kozara. At the meeting, Stojanović presented a short history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> in Kozara. Pucar stated that the 2nd Krajina was the best-organised detachment in Bosanska Krajina.|$|E

25|$|The {{third and}} final stage of armed {{resistance}} began with <b>the</b> Beipu <b>uprising</b> in 1907 in which Saisiyat Aboriginals and Hakka people revolted against the Japanese. Between this and the 1915 Tapani Incident thirteen smaller armed uprisings took place. In many cases, conspirators were discovered and arrested before planned uprisings could even occur. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> thirteen <b>uprisings,</b> eleven occurred after the 1911 Revolution in China, to which four were directly linked. Conspirators in four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprisings</b> demanded reunification with China, conspirators in six planned to install themselves as independent rulers of Taiwan, and conspirators in one could not decide which goal to pursue. <b>The</b> objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspirators {{in the other two}} cases remain unclear.|$|R
5|$|On 3 September 1843, the {{infantry}} led by Colonel Dimitris Kallergis and the respected Revolutionary captain and former President of the Athens City Council General Yiannis Makriyiannis assembled in Palace Square {{in front of}} the Palace in Athens. Eventually joined by much {{of the population of the}} small capital, the rebellion refused to disperse until the King agreed to grant a Constitution, which would require that there be Greeks in the Council, that he convene a permanent National Assembly and that Otto personally thank the leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising.</b>|$|E
5|$|Targowica confederates, who did {{not expect}} another partition, and the king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, who joined them near the end, both lost much {{prestige}} and support. The reformers, on the other hand, were attracting increasing support. In March 1794 the Kościuszko Uprising began. The defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Uprising</b> in November that year resulted in the final Third Partition of Poland, ending {{the existence of the}} Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|The Frenchmen {{were caught}} off guard and five were killed, with three seriously wounded. The mutineers managed to win over a few more tirailleurs from the 5th and 6th {{companies}} of the battalion, and even managed to raise {{the flag of the}} VNQDĐ on top of one of the buildings. They managed to capture the armoury and proclaimed victory. The leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> sent a patrol into the centre of the town to exhort the populace to join the insurrection, falsely claiming that they had already eliminated the entire French officer corps.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Revolution, <b>the</b> {{government}} <b>of</b> Montt began {{a program}} of political persecution against <b>the</b> instigators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uprisings,</b> led by his minister Antonio Varas, which included arrests and deportations. Dozens of notable government opponents were driven into exile, including Arcos, Bilbao, Lastarria and Vicuña Mackenna. Thousands more {{had died in the}} fighting.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} Royalist uprisings {{throughout}} England and a Scottish invasion occurred in <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 1648.
