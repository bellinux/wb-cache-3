40|$|In {{debates about}} the Humanities, {{historical}} references, more or less anecdotal, are requently used. The aim of this project is to present some facts about the Humanities’ academic environments and their main activities. To be more precise, we have scrutinised three Humanities disciplines and their development over time: 1900, 1950 and 2000. We have chosen Archeology, English and History with a special focus on Lund University and Uppsala University. Our main tasks have been to describe the existing staff resources {{at the time as}} well as the main activities undertaken. The empirical material used has been written sources in the form of catalogues, annual reports, protocols and phone books. The study shows that the three subjects were in a formation phase around 1900. There are single teachers in place in Archeology and English whereas History hosted a larger number of academic staff. By the turn of the millennium, there was a great diversity in terms of staff categories and the total number of staff has increased dramatically. For instance, the lone Archeology teacher in 1900 has become 75 by the year 2000 (Medieval Archeology included). However, the student numbers have increased even more. In 1900 there were in total 1, 000 - 1, 500 students at each university. That number was tripled in 1950 and the years after 2000 there was an enormous increase compared to the earlier years in this study. English alone had approximately 5, 000 students, i. e. the double total number of students at the universities in Lund and Uppsala in 1900. The publication patterns have changed during the period, but perhaps not to the extent one might expect. As far as type of publication is concerned, historians are most inclined to write monographs. The other subjects publish more articles. Around 2000, English has increasingly become the publication language of Archeology and, perhaps less surprising, English. Historians still prefer Swedish. However, this issue goes beyond English or Swedish. It is striking how broad the language skills were around the year 1900, {{at least in terms of}} publications. Beside Swedish, many researchers published scientific texts in French, German and English. <b>Outreach</b> <b>activities</b> <b>reported</b> in annual reports etc. show a great breadth during the whole period, e. g. committees, censorship, writing popular science or taking part in politics and societal debate. However, within the frames of this study, we have not been able to analyse the societal role of the Humanities to any great extent.

40|$|The {{accepted}} industrial skills shortage in {{the subjects}} of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in the United Kingdom {{has led to an}} increasing drive for universities to work with a wider pool of potential students. One contributor to this drive is the Lightwave Roadshow, a photonics-focused outreach program run by postgraduate students from the University of Southampton. The program has benefitted from the unique platform of the International Year of Light (IYL) 2015 for the development and support of hands-on and interactive <b>outreach</b> <b>activities.</b> In this <b>report</b> we review Lightwave activities facilitated by IYL that focused on widening participation for students aged 6 to 18 years from a multitude of societal categories; the roadshow has directly benefitted from the significance and investment into the IYL in conjunction with university recruitment strategies, local schools and the support of international organizations such as SPIE and OSA. Lightwave has used the foundation of the IYL to provide a wide range of activities for over 1, 200 UK students in 53 different schools; the assessment tools used to measure learning outcomes, reach and impact are also discussed. The program’s activities have been developed to make younger age groups the center of the <b>outreach</b> <b>activity</b> and create an environment which encourages youth pursuit of optics and science from a grassroots level upwards; to illustrate this we will outline a Lightwave project endorsed by the IYL steering committee to permit two 6 th form students to attend the IYL opening ceremony in Paris...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} and compared {{the learning environment}} perceptions of students, teachers and guides who participated in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) -based <b>outreach</b> <b>activities</b> in secondary education. In <b>outreach</b> <b>activities,</b> schools and teachers work together with companies and other external institutions in learning activities in order to motivate students for the STEM domain. In this study, we identified characteristics of <b>outreach</b> <b>activities</b> that explain variance in perceptions of students. Data were gathered from 729 high-school {{students as well as}} 35 teachers and guides in 12 activities both in the US and the Netherlands. A questionnaire was used to asses <b>outreach</b> <b>activities</b> based on subscales from validated questionnaires such as the What Is Happening In this Classroom, Constructivist Learning Environments Survey, Classroom Environment Scale and the Learning Climate Questionnaire. Teachers’ perceptions were more positive than students’ perceptions for most scales, while guides perceived the outreach learning environment in almost the same way as students. Student perceptions were very positive for <b>outreach</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>Outreach</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics such as teaching method and emphasis were found {{to be the most important}} factors in explaining variance in students’ perceptions between activities. Long-term problem-based activities and the perspective of new views of science and scientists were perceived as providing the most positive learning environments. Additionally, outreach learning environments can create opportunities to increase students’ motivation in STEM...|$|R

40|$|On {{behalf of}} the CIFOR Board of Trustees and Management, it is our {{pleasure}} to submit our response to {{the recommendations of the}} Second External Program and Management Review of the International Centre for Forestry Research (CIFOR), attached. The report is very encouraging to the Board, Management and Staff of CIFOR in its endorsement of CIFOR as a leading international forest research centre, in its recognition of the relevance and credible high quality of the Centre’s research, and in its acknowledgement of CIFOR as a lead CGIAR Centre with respect to communication strategies and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities.</b> The <b>report</b> thus provides us with a strong platform from which to further develop our research and communication agenda, with a strong pro-poor approach. The Panel has made 17 major recommendations, and an equal number of major suggestions. We appreciate that these recommendations and suggestions are clearly aimed at strengthening the research, governance and operations of the Centre, an objective which we share. The report also provides some important pointers in terms of developing a new strategy, priority setting, impact pathways and regionalization. In the main, we are pleased to accept and endorse these recommendations, with some explanation. We express our admiration to the EPMR panel, led by its able chair Dr. Niels Elers Koch, for its professionalism as well as our gratitude for its positive and constructive report. We thank you, the Secretariat and Science Council staff, particularly Sirkka Immonen, for your assistance in ensuring the success of CIFOR’s Second EPMR. And we look forward to the discussion of the report with you so that we might further enhance our collective efforts in the interest of forests and people who directly depend on them for their well-being.

40|$|This {{document}} {{proposes a}} conceptual framework for a five-stage process for conducting IFPRI's research and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities.</b> This framework is {{based in part on}} IFPRI's own research experiences, both good and bad, in the field over the past several years. Its main objective is to codify these experiences to provide a template for future research and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities.</b> Such a framework could provide a common point of reference for most Institute-wide research and outreach, and greatly enhance consistency, efficiency, and efficacy, in implementation of research and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities</b> across all divisions. The nature of IFPRI's work requires innovative and different methods of conducting research and outreach. There is a richness and diversity in IFPRI's current modus operandi which should not be lost by adhering to only one model or framework. The proposed framework is not intended to replace this richness and diversity, but it simply demonstrates how in a number of instances, elements of such a framework have served the Institute well in the past, as an integrated scheme for conducting research and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities</b> and is worthy of further consideration.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} number of {{findings}} from the Interests and Recruitment in Science (IRIS) study carried out in Australia in 2011. The findings concern the perceptions of first year university students in science, technology and engineering courses {{about the influence of}} museums/science centres and <b>outreach</b> <b>activities</b> on their choice of course. The study found that STE students in general tended to rate museums/science centres as more important in their decisions than <b>outreach</b> <b>activities.</b> However, a closer examination showed that females in engineering courses were significantly more inclined to rate <b>outreach</b> <b>activities</b> as important than were males in engineering courses or females in other courses. The implications of this finding for strategies to encourage more young women into engineering are discussed...|$|R
