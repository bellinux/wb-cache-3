40|$|Separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> is {{a useful}} {{problem-solving}} technique. Ideally, each program module should embody one (and only one) <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> the problem that the program is solving. In practice, this correspondence {{is limited by the}} constructs available in the programming language; some kinds <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> are easier or harder to separate in a given language, and crosscutting concerns are hard to separate in any currently popular language. Programming languages should provide support for separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> for as many kinds <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> as possible, and they can achieve this while remaining conceptually simple. I describe a language called Fred that attempts to meet these criteria, based on predicate dispatching, aspect-oriented programming, and units.

40|$|Despite the {{well-known}} benefits <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns,</b> {{and despite the}} presence of mechanisms to achieve separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> in all modern software formalisms, software artifacts continue to exhibit properties associated with poor separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns.</b> Comprehensibility degrades over time; impact of change is high; reuse and traceability are limited. We have hypothesized that these limitations are largely caused by the "tyranny of the dominant decomposition: " existing languages and formalisms generally provide only one, "dominant" dimension along which to separate concerns [...] e. g., by object or by function. Achieving many software engineering goals depends on the ability to separate all <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> importance.
