5|$|Meanwhile, the disembarked French units {{started to}} head for Marseille and Toulon. The initial plan was to capture the ports in succession, but the {{unexpected}} Allied advance allowed the French commander de Lattre de Tassigny to attack both ports almost simultaneously. He split his forces into two units, with Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert tasked to take Toulon from the east while Edgard de Larminat drove north to encircle the city at the flanks. The Germans had a significant force stationed in both cities, but they lacked the {{time to prepare for}} a determined defense. After heavy fighting around Hyères, which temporarily stopped the advance, French forces approached Toulon on 19August. At the same time, Monsabert swung around the city, enveloped it, and cut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> between Toulon and Marseille. On 21August, the French pressed into Toulon, and heavy fighting ensued. The heavy German resistance led to an argument between Larminat and deTassigny, after which deTassigny took over direct command of the operation, dismissing Larminat. By 26August the remaining German units had surrendered. The battle for Toulon cost the French 2,700 casualties, but they captured all remaining German forces who lost their entire garrison of 18,000 men.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} NY408 {{date back to}} the early 20th century when the portion of the route north of the village of Nunda became part of two {{unsigned}} legislative routes. One of the two, Route15, utilized the segment of modern NY408 northeast of Mount Morris, and this segment became part of the signed NY36 in the mid-1920s. Most of the route remained unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, however, at which time NY36 was moved <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> and all of what is now NY408 became part of NY63.
