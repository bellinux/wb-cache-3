In other words, as with much feminist work, this paper is grounded in my own experience, the experiences <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>student</b> colleagues that I observed and shared and in empirical work in and outside law classrooms. I aim to explore various teaching styles and pose tentative views on the effect they may have on student behaviour, particularly student cooperation, both in the classroom and outside it. The other related aim of the paper is to raise specific questions about women’s participation in law school classrooms. In order to do this, I set up various ideal types, which may not necessarily reflect actual classroom practices in either North America or Australia, but are used as a shorthand way of exploring the effect of teaching styles...|$|R
