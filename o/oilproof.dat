The oil emitted a strong odor and created a fire hazard. Federal meat inspectors advised Midland that their options were to <b>oilproof</b> the basement and discontinue {{the use of the}} water wells, or shut down the plant.|$|E

The effect of SSOS concentration, degree of substitution (DS) of octenyl group, as well as glycerol content, on the properties of SSOS films was studied including tensile strength, water vapor permeability (WVP), and oil permeability (OP). The {{results indicated that the}} tensile strength of SSOS film was up to 39. 4 +/- 1. 9 MPa when the concentration of SSOS was 0. 05 g/mL and DS was 0. 05. The increase of glycerol content resulted in a decrease of film tensile strength. WVP of SSOS films was relatively low. Meanwhile, study in OP showed that SSOS films were <b>oilproof.</b> (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 127 : 2922 - 2927, 201...|$|E
