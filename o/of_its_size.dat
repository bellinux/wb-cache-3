5|$|The musket, or musquet, {{originally}} {{a kind of}} crossbow bolt, and later a small cannon, was named after the male Eurasian sparrowhawk because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size.</b> The British Gloster Aircraft Company named one of their Mars series craft the Sparrowhawk.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Blyth A won a {{place in}} the Guinness Book of Records by setting the world record for total running hours in a plant <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> when all four {{generating}} units achieved 200,000running hours. With the privatisation of the UK's electricity supply industry in 1990, the station passed into the ownership of National Power. In 1991, the two 275MW units at Blyth B (units 5 & 6) were decommissioned on the grounds of economy, despite the station having been modernised in the early 1980s. This decommissioning resulted in 260 job losses.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand is a multiethnic society, {{and home}} to people of many {{different}} national origins. Originally composed solely of the Māori who arrived in the thirteenth century, the ethnic makeup of the population later became dominated by New Zealanders of European descent. In the nineteenth century, European settlers brought diseases for which the Māori had no immunity. By the 1890s, the Māori population was approximately 40 percent <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size</b> pre-contact. The Māori population increased during the twentieth century, though it remains a minority.|$|E

5|$|The East Riding has {{a larger}} than {{average number of}} {{residents}} aged 40 and above. There is a particularly strong deficit {{in the number of}} young adults. There is a higher-than-average level of car ownership. 36.4% of all households do not have a car. Less than 5% of the population travel to work by public transport compared with 15% nationally. The district is one of the lowest non-white populations, with the census reporting 98.8% of the inhabitants being white. Hull itself is also quite monoethnic for a city <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> with the census reporting 97.7% white.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Scotland {{is unusually}} varied {{for a country}} <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> {{with a large number}} of differing {{geological}} features. There are three main geographical sub-divisions: the Highlands and Islands is a diverse area which lies to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault; the Central Lowlands is a rift valley mainly comprising Paleozoic formations; and the Southern Uplands, which lie south of the Southern Uplands Fault, are largely composed of Silurian deposits.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray is not aggressive, and {{has been}} known to {{approach}} and investigate divers. However, if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine. This species has been responsible for at least one recorded fatality, of a diver who was stabbed while attempting to ride the ray. The round ribbontail ray is popular with ecotourist divers because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size</b> and spectacular appearance. Although displayed in public aquariums, it is not hardy and 81 days is the longest one has been kept in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Too little {{data has}} been {{gathered}} {{to assess the}} population size and trend of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. It has been reported as “moderately common”, although difficult to find because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size</b> and ability to blend into its surroundings. Its distribution across the British Virgin Islands seems to be limited, and development may affect it further.|$|E
5|$|When first discovered, Sedna {{was thought}} to have an unusually long {{rotational}} period (20 to 50 days). It was initially speculated that Sedna's rotation was slowed by the gravitational pull of a large binary companion, similar to Pluto's moon Charon. A search for such a satellite by the Hubble Space Telescope in March 2004 found nothing, and subsequent measurements from the MMT telescope suggest a much shorter rotation period of about 10 hours, more typical for a body <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size</b> were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> {{material or}} key. It could also uncover treasures {{buried in the}} ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size</b> and {{electrical}} defenses, the {{marbled electric ray}} does not often fall prey to other animals such as sharks. This species exhibits different defensive behaviors depending on whether a prospective predator grasps it by the disc or the tail. A ray touched on the disc will quickly turn toward the threat while producing electric shocks; {{this is followed by}} it fleeing in a straight line, after which it may re-bury itself. A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, the ray will curl into a ring with the belly facing outward, so as to present the area of its body with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these behaviors are accompanied by short, strong electric shocks. The ray tends to produce more electric bursts when protecting its tail than when protecting its disc.|$|E
5|$|Due to lost {{communications}} with Battalion and then Regimental headquarters, and the unit's subsequent capture, its disposition and success at delaying {{the advance of}} the 6th Panzer Army that day was unknown to U.S. commanders. Lt. Lyle Bouck considered the wounding of most of his men and the capture of his entire unit a failure. When the war ended five months later, the platoon's men, who were split between two prisoner-of-war camps, {{just wanted to get}} home. It was only after the war that Bouck learned that his platoon had prevented the lead German infantry elements from advancing and had delayed by about 20 hours their armored units' advance. On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying, a Congressional hearing, and letter-writing by Bouck, every member of the unit were finally recognized for their valor that day, making the platoon most decorated American unit <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size</b> of World War II.|$|E
5|$|New Melones was {{the focus}} of a long {{environmental}} battle during the 1970s and early 1980s; critics protested the flooding of a long scenic stretch of the Stanislaus River, which flowed over whitewater rapids through the deepest limestone canyon in the western United States. The protestors employed a variety of methods, some extreme, to prevent the filling of New Melones Lake until 1983, when record-setting floods filled the reservoir and nearly breached the dam's emergency spillway. The fight over New Melones galvanized the river conservation movement in California and influenced major water policy changes on the state and federal levels; since its completion, no other dams <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>size</b> or importance have been built in the United States.|$|E
