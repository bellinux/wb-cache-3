40|$|The Citizens, Not Suspects {{campaign}} aims {{to fight}} the proposals of mandatory data retention legislation in Australia. On 13 th October 2015, the mandatory data retention legislation comes into force in Australia, but the implementation process is in disarray. As the next election approaches {{we need to keep}} the pressure on to have this legislation reviewed. The government’s proposed extensions to National Security powers pose serious threats to the security, privacy and freedom of all Australians. Among these proposals are: mandatory retention for two years of data relating to the internet and telecommunications activity of all Australians. This data could include records <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> and texts, your location (if you use a mobile phone) and who you send emails to and who you receive them from. As Sir Tim Berners-Lee said when he was down under last year, retention of data on this scale “is so dangerous, you have {{to think of it as}} dynamite”. giving ASIO the power to ‘disrupt’ computers by adding, modifying or deleting files. giving ASIO the power to spy on a number of computers – including a whole computer network – under a single computer-access warrant. giving ASIS (Australia’s foreign intelligence agency) the power to collect intelligence on Australian citizens overseas. creating a new criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for revealing information about ‘special intelligence operations’. This comes with no exceptions and would apply to journalists, even if they were unaware that they were revealing information about such an operation. Taken together, these and the other proposals would create the potential for government surveillance on a massive and unprecedented scale, with serious implications for the privacy and civil liberties of all Australians. They could have a serious chilling effect on free speech by inducing people to self-censor. Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus has called the anti-whistleblower section of this legislation (section 35 P) ‘an unprecedented overreach’ by the government that the Labor Party will be opposing. We believe these proposals undermine the presumption of innocence and would create a situation where all Australians would be considered potential suspects, rather than enjoying the freedom from government surveillance and interference that we deserve as citizens of a democracy...|$|E

50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{personal}} computer technology in the 1980s, computer telephony integration (CTI) has progressively provided more sophisticated telephony services, initiated and controlled by the computer, such as making and receiving voice, fax, and data calls with telephone directory services and caller identification. The integration of telephony software and computer systems is a major development {{in the evolution of}} the automated office. The term is used in describing the computerized services of call centers, such as those that direct <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> to the right department at a business you're calling. It's also sometimes used to describe the ability to use your personal computer to initiate and manage <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> (in which case you can think <b>of</b> <b>your</b> computer as your personal call center). CTI is not a new concept and has been used in the past in large telephone networks, but only dedicated call centers could justify the costs of the required equipment installation. Primary telephone service providers are offering information services such as automatic number identification, which is a telephone service architecture that separates CTI services from call switching and will make it easier to add new services. Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) on a scale is wide enough for its implementation to bring real value to business or residential telephone usage. A new generation of applications (middleware) is being developed as a result of standardization and availability of low cost computer telephony links.|$|R

In brief, he realized that the attribute of a mobile phone could be delivered through the KakaoTalk service.

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{academic}} discussion of federated authentication, and quite some political manoeuvring about ‘e-ID’. The grand vision, which {{has been around for}} years in various forms but was recently articulated in the US National Strategy for Trustworthy Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), is that a single logon should work everywhere [1]. You should be able to use <b>your</b> identity provider <b>of</b> choice to log on anywhere; so you might use your driver’s license to log on to Gmail, or use your Facebook logon to file your tax return. More restricted versions include the vision of governments of places like Estonia and Germany (and until May 2010 the UK) that a government-issued identity card should serve as a universal logon. Yet few systems have been fielded at any scale. In this paper I will briefly discuss the four existing examples we have of federated authentication, and then go on to discuss a much larger, looming problem.

40|$|In {{the world}} we live in today, we have the option to lower costs by {{bundling}} multiple services into one. This may include bundling the cost <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>phone,</b> broadband, and cable services into one bill, or combining multiple school loans and/or purchasing homeowners insurance to include auto coverage. Similarly, this concept is taking place in the healthcare industry: Bundled Payment systems. What is a bundled payment? A “bundled payment ” allocates a single, negotiated payment to cover a group of treatment services (i. e. surgeries). Under this system, multiple providers are paid a certain amount for all services related to a treatment, condition or episode of care. This payment system pushes providers to provide both high quality care and cost-effective care. How may I learn more? The American Medical Association (AMA) Innovators Committee has proffered a great deal of information on the bundled payment concept including a physician payment reform manual. The manual concentrates on allocating fair payment between physicians, non-physician providers (NPPs) and facilities. The AMA Innovators focus on global budgets and episode-based bundles. Throughout the document, the AMA Innovators refer to new delivery and payment models as Fee-for-Value (FFV) arrangements. The manual provides you with a better understanding of: Building partnerships with other healthcare stakeholders Defining key components a FFV contract Identifying services and providers included in a FFV model Analyzing per-capita cost Analyzing the quality of care Rewarding staff for achieving all quality and cost benchmarks Aligning value and productivity The AMA Innovators recognize that new payment models will not completely replace Fee-For-Servic...|$|R

Many {{third parties}} desire to {{discover}} and disclose your location with the help <b>of</b> <b>your</b> cell <b>phone.</b> Using an embedded GPS, phone software will commonly reveal coordinates to carriers, advertisers, and applications. Can a remote party determine locational information absent explicit GPS information? For example, given a known starting or ending point, can a streaming music server distinguish the path you’ve taken through the physical world? We show that the path a cell phone and its owner take from or to a known location can be determined from remote observations of changes in TCP throughput. Empirically, our method can correctly determine with greater than 78 % accuracy the path taken by phone from one of four paths, and with 63 % accuracy the path taken from among eight paths. ...|$|R
