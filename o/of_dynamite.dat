5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} during construction of the 23rd Street subway station that caused the tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after a blast <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> in the subway tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{strike was}} {{characterized}} by firefights and use <b>of</b> <b>dynamite,</b> and ended after a standoff between the Colorado state militia and a private force working for owners of the mines. In the years after the strike, the WFM's popularity and power increased significantly through the region.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the {{fundamental}} data for preventive measure against accident bythe poisonous gas in a tunnel under construction, the authers determined and analysedthe poisonous gas from the detonation products <b>of</b> <b>dynamites</b> in the Shin-Fukazawa ra-ilway tunnel and Kiso closed conduit channel which were under construction. As {{the amount of carbon}} monoxide (CO) and nitrose (NO, NO, etc.) in a tunnelexceeds the respective allowable concentrations near the stage of blasting for some timeafter the last blasting the good ventilation should be provided. It must be note that, if the blasting effect is not sufficient, the amount of the poisonousgas produced by blasting increases very much due to incomplete detonation <b>of</b> <b>dynamites...</b>|$|R

5|$|The bombing had {{destroyed}} the north {{wing of the}} school. During the search, rescuers found an additional 500pounds (230kg) <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> which had failed to detonate in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices, and they found an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in {{the second set of}} bombs, preventing them from detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.|$|E
5|$|The {{impactor}} returned {{images as}} late as three seconds before impact. Most of the data captured was stored on board the flyby spacecraft, which radioed approximately 4,500 images from the HRI, MRI, and ITS cameras to Earth {{over the next few}} days. The energy from the collision was similar in size to exploding five tons <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> and the comet shone six times brighter than normal.|$|E
5|$|Almost simultaneously, an {{explosion}} devastated the north {{wing of the}} Bath Consolidated School building, killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers. Kehoe had used a timed detonator to ignite hundreds of pounds <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> and incendiary pyrotol, which he had secretly planted inside the school {{over the course of}} many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a rifle to detonate dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself, the school superintendent, and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500pounds (230kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a timing device set to detonate {{at the same time as}} the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended to blow up and destroy the entire school.|$|E
60|$|One {{thing the}} stool told me, before the guards removed him, showed how serious was this matter <b>of</b> the <b>dynamite.</b> <b>Of</b> course, I passed the word along, {{which was that}} not a wheel had turned in the prison all day. The {{thousands}} of convict-workers had remained locked in their cells, and the outlook was that {{not one of the}} various prison-factories would be operated again until after the discovery <b>of</b> some <b>dynamite</b> that somebody had hidden somewhere in the prison.|$|R

5|$|Dynamite Headdy was {{originally}} released in Japan on 5 August 1994 for the Sega Genesis, with North American and European releases following in September and October respectively. A port was released for the Game Gear, and a Master System port {{based on the}} Game Gear version was released exclusively in Brazil. The game was included along with Gunstar Heroes and Alien Soldier in Sega Ages 2500: Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box, a compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in 2006 in Japan. The compilation includes all versions <b>of</b> <b>Dynamite</b> Headdy released on all three Sega platforms across all regions. The game saw a digital re-release on the Wii via the Virtual Console in July 2007. It was also included in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and most recently was released on Steam on 2 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the field}} of comics, Adams has also {{provided}} illustrations for various magazines, such as , as well as toy designs, video games, and X-Men-themed cans of Chef Boyardee pasta. In 2016 he provided the illustration for a satirical piece in GQ magazine that imagined a number of controversial public figures as comic book supervillains, including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Sepp Blatter, Martin Shkreli and Kris Jenner. Later that year, Dynamite Entertainment announced it that would be producing limited edition poly-resin busts of female characters for its Women <b>of</b> <b>Dynamite</b> line, based on Adams' renditions of those characters and sculpted by Jason Smith. The first bust was a Red Sonja bust debuting in November, followed by a Vampirella bust in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} well defended and fortified, as Navarro had {{prepared}} a {{defense in depth}} with several concentric rings of trenches, barricades and fortifications. However, unknown to the defenders, the insurrectionists had with them significant supplies <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> and foreign experts from other guerrilla wars, including Boer Gen. Ben Viljoen and the grandson of the famous Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi II (news dispatches from the battle also mention {{the participation of the}} future star of many Hollywood Westerns, Tom Mix). In order to counteract the formidable defenses, the rebels developed an effective strategy that managed to circumvent Navarro's well-placed machine-gun nests and street barricades. Rather than attacking through the streets, the rebels used the dynamite to blow the walls of the adobe houses that were huddled up next to each other, which allowed them to proceed through the city house by house.|$|E

5|$|With the bow now irretrievably stuck, and {{the threat}} of even worse weather coming which could {{completely}} destroy the ship, White Star officials decided to attempt an unorthodox method of saving the stern half of the ship, which was not grounded nor damaged, by separating it from the damaged bow. Suevic, like other White Star liners, had been built with watertight compartments as a safety precaution. Depending on the integrity of this design, engineers used carefully placed charges <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> to sever the bow at a bulkhead just aft of the bridge on 4 April. This move was successful, and the aft half of the ship floated free. The watertight compartments held their integrity, and Suevic was able to steam under her own power, in reverse and guided by tugs, to Southampton. The damaged bow was left to break up on the rocks.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral reefs {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, {{because much of the}} organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{contributed to}} the Manhattan Project by helping {{initiate}} the effort to build the first atomic bombs in the United States during World War II, and helped carry it through to completion in August 1945 by supplying crucial expertise. Following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium, scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at the University of Birmingham calculated, in March 1940, that the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235 was as little as , and would explode {{with the power of}} thousands of tons <b>of</b> <b>dynamite.</b> The Frisch–Peierls memorandum prompted Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist working in Britain, was instrumental in making the results of the British MAUD Report known in the United States in 1941 by a visit in person. Initially the British project was larger and more advanced, but after the United States entered the war, the American project soon outstripped and dwarfed its British counterpart. The British government then decided to shelve its own nuclear ambitions, and participate in the American project.|$|E

5|$|Despite their advances, the Bone Wars {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact {{not only on the}} two scientists but also on their peers and the entire field. The public animosity between Cope and Marsh harmed the reputation of American paleontology in Europe for decades. Furthermore, the reported use <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> and sabotage by employees of both men may have destroyed or buried hundreds of potentially critical fossil remains. Joseph Leidy abandoned his more methodical excavations in the West, finding he could not keep up with Cope's and Marsh's reckless searching for bones. Leidy also grew tired of the constant squabbling between the two men, with the result that his withdrawal from the field marginalized his own legacy; after his death, Osborn found not a single mention of the man in either of the rivals' works. In their haste to outdo each other, Cope and Marsh haphazardly assembled the bones of their own discoveries. Their descriptions of new species, based on their reconstructions, led to confusion and misconceptions that lasted for decades after their deaths.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Steiger {{played a}} chauvinistic big game hunter, {{explorer}} and war hero opposite Susannah York in Mark Robson's Happy Birthday, Wanda June, before agreeing to star alongside James Coburn as Mexican bandit Juan Miranda in Sergio Leone's Duck, You Sucker!, which was alternatively titled A Fistful <b>of</b> <b>Dynamite.</b> Leone was initially dissatisfied with {{his performance in}} that he played his character as a serious, Zapata-like figure. As a result, tension grew between Steiger and Leone, including one incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan's stagecoach is destroyed. After the film's completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director. Steiger auditioned {{for the role of}} Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a film adaptation of Italian American author Mario Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, but Puzo felt that Steiger was too old for the part and rejected him.|$|E
5|$|Zorin, who {{had escaped}} in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, abducts Sutton, but Bond {{grabs hold of}} the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the {{framework}} of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sutton attacks Zorin, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin pursues them with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death in the waters of San Francisco Bay. An enraged Mortner attacks Bond using sticks <b>of</b> <b>dynamite,</b> but Bond cuts the airship cable free, which causes Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin. The dynamite explodes, killing Mortner and Scarpine and destroying the airship. General Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's strategy. Afterwards, Bond and Sutton make love in the shower of the Sutton home.|$|E

5|$|A giant {{meteoroid}} {{approaches the}} earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, while a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts {{the end of}} the world. The meteoroid misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, the Aurora, is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary, backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel; wherefore, the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick <b>of</b> <b>dynamite</b> on the Aurora, but it is found and thrown overboard. In the North Sea, the Aurora is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri, when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three then secretly run a hose from Chester's ship, Sirius, to the Aurora, and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need.|$|E
