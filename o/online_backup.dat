Soon after Soghoian first publicly voiced his concerns, Dropbox updated its terms of service and privacy policy to make it clear that the company does not in fact encrypt user data with a key only known to the user, and that the company can disclose users' private data if forced to by law enforcement agencies.|$|E
25|$|In {{part because}} of such long {{retention}} times, as well as growing Internet upload speeds, Usenet is also used by individual users to store backup data in a practice called Usenet backup, or uBackup. While commercial providers offer more easy to use <b>online</b> <b>backup</b> services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader {{does not have any}} control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, so there will be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.|$|E

She has also been hired by MTV and Dick Clark Productions to host online preshows for awards broadcasts. In April 2009, she had approximately 50,000 MySpace friends and the system limit of 5,000 Facebook friends. An April 2009, USA Today article credited her with 386,000 Twitter followers. By June 2009, she had 590,000 Twitter followers, 94,000 subscribers to the iJustine YouTube channel and 25,000 Facebook fans. The USA Today story goes on to describe how she has scaled down her lifecasting because of its deleterious impact on her life. Carl's Jr. has hired a team of YouTube stars, including Ezarik to produce made-for-web ads for their new Portobello Mushroom Six-Dollar Burger on the Carl's Jr. YouTube channel, each endorser's YouTube page, and other Google-related media outlets. Following the August 6, 2009, Twitter Denial-of-service attack, Ezarik was featured in The Wall Street Journal describing her coping mechanisms, such as repeatedly tapping the F5 function key (the refresh button), for Twitter outages. In December 2009, USA Today reported that Ezarik earns about $75,000 annually from YouTube, and claims she has nearly a million followers on Twitter and 300,000 YouTube subscribers. The same article estimated {{that she has been}} viewed on YouTube a total of 64 million times and that her spoof on The Black Eyed Peas' [...] "I Gotta Feeling" [...] drew 4.8 million viewers. The article notes that Ezarik does her work with a $400 Canon Powershot digital camera and a $12 green rug from IKEA to create her green screen.|$|E

40|$|Volume Snapshots provide {{instantaneous}} checkpoints of {{a complete}} filesystem. Whereas previous work on developing snapshot utilities has focused on satiating the need for <b>online</b> <b>backups,</b> modern trends encourage their deployment in expedited clone construction scenarios. Unlike their read-only counterparts, these clones {{are expected to be}} mutable and to some extent independent of their base images. We present RSnap, a volume manager that allows users to create mutable recursive snapshots of logical volumes. Storage is allocated to these snapshots in a Dedicate-on-Write fashion. Since unrestrained clone creation can quickly obscure sharing relationships between a set of volumes, RSnap includes an automatic garbage collector that can identify and reclaim unreferenced blocks. RSnap uses the radix tree data structure to implement recursive snapshots. We capitalize on kernel infrastructure to overcome some of the performance and consistency problems in using the radix tree. Our evaluations show that an in kernel radix tree implementation gives satisfactory performance and scales with the number of snapshots. ii Table of Contents Abstract [...] . i...|$|R
