5|$|Many Americans {{are living}} {{complicated}} lives now– few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> moved through {{life in a}} straight line. I think {{many of us would}} benefit from trying to gather and synthesize the difficult political lessons we've learned over the course of our lives.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>have</b> held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

6000|$|It {{all came}} back as they talked,--that buoyant {{world of the}} reaper and the binder, when {{harvesting}} {{was a kind of}} Homeric game in which, with rake and scythe, these lusty young sons of the East contended for supremacy in the field. [...] "None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> an extra dollar," [...] explained Stevens, [...] "but each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> what was better, good health and a faith in the future.

5000|$|The police faced {{severe and}} broad {{criticism}} for their reaction, with an American Civil Liberties Union spokesperson {{saying that it}} was [...] "nothing less than an orchestrated police riot." [...] Several primary witnesses reported unnecessarily violent actions and police abuses, including firing on reporters and people obeying police commands. Police responded that their response was [...] "outstanding" [...] and [...] "clearly disciplined." [...] De la Rocha said of the incident, [...] "I don't care what fucking television stations said, that the violence was caused by the people at the concert; those motherfuckers unloaded on this crowd. And I think it's ridiculous considering, you know, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> rubber bullets, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> M16s, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> billy clubs, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> face shields." ...|$|R

To which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> she given her promise? which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> she known and loved? which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> won her by long friendship and steady regard? and which <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> Mr. Flick, is attracted to the marriage by the lately assured wealth of the young woman? I never understood that Lord Lovel was my rival when Lady Anna was regarded as the base-born child of the deceased madman." ...|$|R
25|$|The film {{suggests}} Scotland {{had been}} under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace’s childhood, and {{in the run-up to}} the Battle of Falkirk Wallace says to the younger Bruce, “e'll have what none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> ever had before, a country of our own.” In fact Scotland had been invaded by England only the year before Wallace's rebellion; prior to the death of King Alexander III it had been a fully separate kingdom.|$|E
25|$|TV3 {{routinely}} {{disagrees with}} RTÉ Television's policy of purchasing US, Canadian and Australian imports which RTÉ subsequently broadcasts after midnight with low audience figures. TV3 {{argue that if}} made available, it could air such shows in prime-time slots. In the past such shows as Rookie Blue, Rescue Me, Big Love, United States of Tara, Tangle and The Secret Life <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>have</b> been purchased by RTÉ and aired between 00:00 and 06:00 on RTÉ Two. RTÉ has argued that TV3 has rarely gone after {{the same types of}} imported programming and that such shows perform better than when broadcast in prime time on TV3.|$|E
25|$|The {{crisis in}} health and welfare {{services}} in our nation today highlights for NASW what many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> been stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces {{of the same coin}} to be spent on more and better services for the people who need our help. It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E

25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E

O'Brien admitted that, [...] "the three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> come along in the same comedic environment," [...] and that, while [...] "our shows all probably have their distinct flavor, [...] this happened because {{the three of us}} knew we would like doing this with each other."

500|$|Deborah Annetts, CEO of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (VES), has {{praised the}} storyline. In 2004 she commented, [...] "It was a {{sympathetic}} portrayal. It demonstrated {{to a lot}} of people their own experiences. Lots <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> had conversations with someone, particularly our mothers and fathers, where they have said to us: 'If I get really ill, you will end it, won't you?' The Dot/Ethel storyline showed just what that conversation can entail and what happens to the other person after– the guilt and pain they have to live with." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{incorporates}} the song [...] "Wonderful! Wonderful!" [...] by musician Johnny Mathis. Having read the screenplay Mathis {{refused to allow}} his version to be used, owing to the episode's graphic content, and a cover version had to be created. Producer David Nutter, who had a background as a singer, intended to record the vocals {{but at the last}} minute another singer, who sounded more like Mathis, was used. Manners explained that he wanted to use the song because [...] "certain songs have a creepy, icky quality that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> really openly acknowledged".|$|E

500|$|Economic {{evidence}} indicates the crisis {{may have more}} to do with trade deficits (which require private borrowing to fund) than public debt levels. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March 2013: [...] "... the really strong relationship within the [...] is between interest spreads and current account deficits, which is in line with the conclusion many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> reached, that the euro area crisis is really a balance of payments crisis, not a debt crisis". A February 2013 paper from four economists concluded that, [...] "Countries with debt above 80% of GDP and persistent current-account [...] deficits are vulnerable to a rapid fiscal deterioration...." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Chen Yonglin, a {{political}} consul from the Chinese consulate in Sydney, and Jennifer Zeng, a Falun Gong {{victim of torture}} from China, both sought asylum in Australia while making claims that Chinese agents were engaged in large-scale operations to monitor, intimidate, and undermine support for Falun Gong outside China. Chen alleged that his primary function at the consulate involved efforts to monitor and harass Falun Gong and to minimize support for the practice from Australian media and elected officials. Zeng stated that [...] "espionage and intimidation against [...] practitioners overseas is so common that many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> become accustomed to it." ...|$|E
500|$|After a month's time, {{as early}} adopters started {{receiving}} their first monthly bills, stories of unusually large and expensive iPhone bills began to circulate. The 300-page bill was exceptional, but other heavy users received 50- to 100-page bills. One {{of the first}} to attract wider attention was from Ben Kuchera, gaming editor for the technology-related website Ars Technica, who described his 34-sheet, double-sided bill and another 104-page bill sent to a colleague, writing, [...] "While many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> had smart-phones for some time, we've never seen a bill like this." [...] However, it was the release of Justine Ezarik's video that acted as a catalyst to bring widespread media attention to this aspect of the iPhone story.|$|E

500|$|While Confessions {{was still}} in production, Usher promised [...] "real talk" [...] in it. He decided [...] "to let it all hang out by singing about {{some of his own}} little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets." [...] He explained: [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is [...] "very personal". Dupri {{expected}} people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.|$|E
500|$|The episode makes several {{references}} to the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2009 and the financial crisis of 2007–2010. When Liz asks why Jack is taking a bus to Washington he replies [...] "ever since these buffoons from Detroit took private planes the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> {{to put on a}} show," [...] a reference to controversial travel methods by several CEOs en route to a November 19 congressional hearing. The dilemma over bailout money also bears resemblance to federal bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler. In describing how he plans to destroy Jack's image, Devon says [...] "by the time I'm done you're going to make AIG look like the Lehman Brothers of microwaves," [...] a reference to two notable corporations from the financial crisis. Devon also says that in his search for an organization more powerful than GE he selected the American government because, [...] "American Idols not on until January." ...|$|E
500|$|On his {{official}} website, Williams {{wrote that he}} was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album; he described himself as [...] "buzzing" [...] and went on to call the album's sound [...] "Very, very big". Williams revealed that the new album would be titled Reality Killed the Video Star, a reference to the song [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star" [...] by Horn's former band The Buggles. The album was originally planned to be named Il Protagonista (Italian for The Protagonist) until Williams' management told him to change the title as it was [...] "too pretentious". In July 2009 Williams wrote on {{his official}} blog about the album: [...] "My album's a killer: old Robbie, new Robbie and a Robbie that neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> met...". The A.V. Club has also reported that during 2007, Williams had recorded an unreleased experimental album that, he later said, would have amounted to [...] "career suicide".|$|E
