The location was also ideal because of the sun was at the competitor's backs.

Cross-country races started and ended {{at the base of the}} ski hill. A switchboard was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor the progress of the competitors during the races. Most of the stands built for the ski jumping competition had to be removed for the cross-country races. As a result, there was little room for spectators to sit and watch the cross-country events. Spectators were therefore allowed to walk within the course.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} the race in 1927, the {{superstructure}} collapsed, caused by rot in combination with a heavy snowfall. This caused the introduction of public control with scaffolding and bleachers in Norway. By then, Holmenkollbakken was lagging behind internationally, and the world record at the time had exceeded 60meters. It was therefore decided that a new superstructure would be [...] tall and moved [...] further back. Besserudkjernet was partially drained in 1928, but the hotels, which received their water from the lake, would not allow draining the following years. In 1931, the lake was fully drained, which allowed the <b>out-run</b> to be longer. In the 1930s, talk of an 80-meter hill started, which would potentially be built in Rødkleiva, further out in Nordmarka. The Association for the Promotion of Skiing made a formal investigation into the matter in 1937. There was agreement that the venue was becoming too small for international competitions.|$|E

Bullard notes a degree of ambiguity with respect to defining the [...] "southern slopes". On 8 September, the 17th Army ordered Horii to assemble the 41st Regiment in the Kokoda area. Horii did draw back the main body of his force but continued to thrust forward. When, on the 19 September, Hyakutake became aware that Ioribaiwa had been occupied on 16 September, he [...] "issued strict orders for front-line troops to immediately occupy a position to the north of Mawai". An order of 23 September was to secure the Isurava–Kokoda area as [...] "a base for future operations". Horii had <b>out-run</b> his supply line and his force was faced with extreme rationing and unable to advance any further. On 24 September, the 2nd/144th Battalion withdrew from Ioribaiwa. The 3rd/144th Battalion formed the rearguard and withdrew during the night of 26 September.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Oslo {{was awarded}} the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1982, and further {{upgrades}} to the hill were necessary. The costs of the upgrades were NOK50 million, of which the Norwegian Ski Federation paid NOK5 million, and Oslo Municipality and the state split the rest. The large expenditures resulted in a public debate. The upgrades saw the introduction of electronics into {{most parts of the}} venue. The old system of manual distance measurement by people standing beside the hill was abolished, and replaced by the video-based system Robotron. Other new installations was an electronic result and scoreboard system, a new time-keeping and speed system, and a new central system to calculate scores. The in-run was expanded, and a mobile start platform was installed, but later removed and replaced by a bar. The knoll and landing slope were adjusted, and the straight section was moved [...] further down. In the transition to the <b>out-run,</b> [...] of earthwork was blasted away, and Besserudkjernet was sunk another [...] This allowed for additional grandstands to be built and the last wooden grandstands were removed. New structures were built for delegates, broadcasting and the jury.|$|E

60|$|It {{came to me}} instantly, as I {{looked at}} him. This was the terror of the northeast, of which the mystery of smoke was a token. Yet I was puzzled. Certainly he was nothing; of which to be afraid. Red-Eye or any of our strong men {{would have been more}} than a match for him. He was old, too, wizened with age, and the hair on his face was gray. Also, he limped badly with one leg. There was no doubt at all that we could <b>out-run</b> him and out-climb him. He could never catch us, that was certain.|$|E
60|$|The master {{was running}} up, but {{was too far}} away; and it was Collie that saved the hound's life. Before White Fang could spring in and deliver the fatal stroke, and {{just as he was}} in the act of {{springing}} in, Collie arrived. She had been out-manoeuvred and <b>out-run,</b> to say nothing of her having been unceremoniously tumbled in the gravel, and her arrival was like that of a tornado--made up of offended dignity, justifiable wrath, and instinctive hatred for this marauder from the Wild. She struck White Fang at right angles {{in the midst of his}} spring, and again he was knocked off his feet and rolled over.|$|E
60|$|I remember--but I <b>out-run</b> my story. First {{let me tell}} of Lop-Ear and our friendship. Very {{early in}} my life, I {{separated}} from my mother. Possibly this was because, {{after the death of}} my father, she took to herself a second husband. I have few recollections of him, and they are not of the best. He was a light fellow. There was no solidity to him. He was too voluble. His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it. His mind was too inconsequential to permit him to possess purpose. Monkeys in their cages always remind me of him. He was monkeyish. That is the best description I can give of him.|$|E
60|$|I thought now was our Time to {{show our}} selves; so taking them as they came by the Place where we lay in Ambuscade, we plac'd {{ourselves}} just in their Way, and as they were entring a little Thicket of Trees, we appear'd; and calling to them in English, told them they were our Prisoners; that if they yielded, we would use them very well, but if they offer'd to resist, they should have no Quarter: One of them looking behind, {{as if he would}} show us a Pair of Heels, I call'd to him, and told him, if he attempted to run for it, he was a dead Man, unless he could <b>out-run</b> a Musquet-Bullet; and that we would soon let him see we had more Men in our Company; and so giving the Signal appointed, our three Men, who lay at a Distance, shew'd themselves in the Rear.|$|E

On the Little Pelly, for instance, they come down that thick in the summer to feed on the salmon that you can't get an Indian or white man to go nigher than a day's journey to the place. And up in the Rampart Mountains there's a curious kind of bear called the 'side-hill grizzly.' That's because he's {{traveled}} on the side-hills ever since the Flood, and the two legs on the down-hill side are {{twice as long as}} the two on the up-hill. And he can <b>out-run</b> a jack rabbit when he gets steam up. Dangerous? Catch you! Bless you, no. All a man has to do is to circle down the hill and run the other way. You see, that throws mister bear's long legs up the hill and the short ones down. Yes, he's a mighty peculiar creature, but that wasn't what I started in to tell about.|$|E
60|$|They stopped suddenly, and squatted {{as low as}} possible. The lane {{was very}} narrow; the {{fishermen}} were close behind; they tumbled right over them, and fell heavily on their faces. While they were rising, our heroes knocked them both insensible, and hastily appropriating their coats and red caps put them on as they ran. By this time a crowd of fishermen, sailors, and others, among whom were a few soldiers and turnkeys with lanterns, were pursuing the fugitives as fast as was possible in so dark a night. Bill suggested that they should turn into a dark corner, and dodge them. The suggestion was acted on at once. They dashed round the first corner they came to, and then, instead of continuing their flight, turned sharp to the left, and hid in a doorway. The pursuers came pouring round the corner, shouting wildly. When the thickest of the crowd was opposite their place of concealment, Bill and Ben rushed into the midst of them with a shout, imitating the tones of the Frenchmen as nearly as possible, but taking care to avoid the use of word, and thus they joined in the pursuit! Gradually they fell behind, as if <b>out-run,</b> and, when they found themselves in rear, turned about, and made off in the opposite direction, then, diverging to the left, they headed again towards the shore, ran down to the beach, and leaped into the first boat they came to.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{because the}} {{spurious}} pulses which cause a Red and a Blue, do the one follow the clear pulse, {{and the other}} precede it, it usually follows, that those Saline refracting bodies which do dilute the colour of the one, do deepen that of the other. And this will be made manifest by almost all kinds of Purples, and many sorts of Greens, both these colours consisting of mixt colours; for if we suppose A and A in the ninth Figure, to represent two pulses of clear light, which follow each other at a convenient distance, AA, {{each of which has}} a spurious pulse preceding it, as BB, which makes a Blue, and another following it, as CC, which makes a Red, the one caus'd by tinging particles that have a greater refraction, the other by others that have a less refracting quality then the liquor or Menstruum in which these are dissolv'd, whatsoever liquor does so alter the refraction of the one, without altering that of {{the other part of the}} ting'd liquor, must needs very much alter the colour of the liquor; for if the refraction of the dissolvent be increas'd, and the refraction of the tinging particles not altered, then will the preceding spurious pulse be shortned or stopt, and not <b>out-run</b> the clear pulse so much; so that BB will become EE, and the Blue be diluted, whereas the other spurious pulse which follows will be made to lagg much more, and be further behind AA than before, and CC will become ff, and so the Yellow or Red will be heightned.|$|E
6000|$|... "It takes," [...] says Thoreau, in the noblest {{and most}} useful passage I {{remember}} to have read in any modern author,[4] [...] "two to speak truth--one {{to speak and}} another to hear." [...] He must be very little experienced, or have no great zeal for truth, who does not recognise the fact. A grain of anger or a grain of suspicion produces strange acoustical effects, and makes the ear greedy to remark offence. Hence we find those who have once quarrelled carry themselves distantly, and are ever ready to break the truce. To speak truth there must be moral equality or else no respect; and hence between parent and child intercourse is apt to degenerate into a verbal fencing bout, and misapprehensions to become ingrained. And there is another side to this, for the parent begins with an imperfect notion of the child's character, formed in early years or during the equinoctial gales of youth; to this he adheres, noting only the facts which suit with his preconception; and wherever a person fancies himself unjustly judged, he at once and finally gives up the effort to speak truth. With our chosen friends, on the other hand, and still more between lovers (for mutual understanding is love's essence), the truth is easily indicated by the one and aptly comprehended by the other. A hint taken, a look understood, conveys the gist of long and delicate explanations; and where the life is known even yea and nay become luminous. In the closest of all relations--that of a love well founded and equally shared--speech is half discarded, like a roundabout, infantile process or a ceremony of formal etiquette; and the two communicate directly by their presences, and with few looks and fewer words contrive to share their good and evil and uphold each other's hearts in joy. For love rests upon a physical basis; it is a familiarity of nature's making and apart from voluntary choice. Understanding has in some sort <b>out-run</b> knowledge, for the affection perhaps began with the acquaintance; and as it was not made like other relations, so it is not, like them, to be perturbed or clouded. Each knows more than can be uttered; each lives by faith and believes by a natural compulsion; and between man and wife {{the language of the}} body is largely developed and grown strangely eloquent. The thought that prompted and was conveyed in a caress would only lose to be set down in words--ay, although Shakespeare himself should be the scribe.|$|E
60|$|The {{advantages}} which rhyme {{has over}} blank verse are so many, that it were lost time to name them. Sir Philip Sidney, in his Defence of Poesy, gives us one, which, in my opinion, {{is not the}} least considerable; I mean the help it brings to memory, which rhyme so knits up, by the affinity of sounds, that, by remembering {{the last word in}} one line, we often call to mind both the verses. Then, in the quickness of repartees (which in discoursive scenes fall very often), it has so particular a grace, and is so aptly suited to them, that the sudden smartness of the answer, and the sweetness of the rhyme, set off the beauty of each other. But that benefit which I consider most in it, because I have not seldom found it, is, that it bounds and circumscribes the fancy. For imagination in a poet is a faculty so wild and lawless, that, like an high-ranging spaniel, it must have clogs tied to it, lest it <b>out-run</b> the judgment. The great easiness of blank verse renders the poet too luxuriant; he is tempted to say many things, which might better be omitted, or at least shut up in fewer words; but when the difficulty of artful rhyming is interposed, where the poet commonly confines his sense to his couplet, and must contrive that sense into such words, that the rhyme shall naturally follow them, not they the rhyme; the fancy then gives leisure to the judgment to come in, which, seeing so heavy a tax imposed, is ready to cut off all unnecessary expences. This last consideration has already answered an objection which some have made, that rhyme is only an embroidery of sense, to make that, which is ordinary in itself, pass for excellent with less examination. But certainly, that, which most regulates the fancy, and gives the judgment its busiest employment, is like to bring forth the richest and clearest thoughts. The poet examines that most, which he produceth with the greatest leisure, and which, he knows, must pass the severest test of the audience, because they are aptest to have it ever in their memory; as the stomach makes the best concoction, when it strictly embraces the nourishment, and takes account of every little particle as it passes through. But, as the best medicines may lose their virtue, by being ill applied, so is it with verse, if a fit subject be not chosen for it. Neither must the argument alone, but the characters and persons, be great and noble; otherwise, (as Scaliger says of Claudian) the poet will be ignobitiore materiâ depressus. The scenes, which, in my opinion, most commend it, are those of argumentation and discourse, on the result of which the doing or not doing some considerable action should depend.|$|E
60|$|He was {{resolved}} never {{to quit the}} Prince till he had seen him {{beyond the reach of}} any machination of his brother's, nor indeed was it easy to think of parting at all, for Edward, who had relaxed all coldness of manner towards him ever since the affair at Trapani, had now become warmly affectionate and confidential. The Prince was still far from having regained his usual health, his arm was still in a scarf, and was often painful, and the least exposure to the sun brought on violent headache, which some attributed to the poison in the scratch on his forehead, but the Hospitaliers, more reasonably, ascribed to a slight sun-stroke. Their character of infirmarers rendered them especially considerate hosts, and they never overwhelmed their guest with the stiff formalities of courtesy for his rank's sake, but allowed him to follow his inclination, and this led him to spend great part of his time in a pavilion, a thoroughly Eastern erection, which stood in the garden, {{at the top of the}} white marble steps leading to a fountain of delicious sparkling water, and sheltered from the sun by the dark solid horizontal branches of a noble Cedar of Lebanon, which tradition connected with the visit of the Empress Helena. Here, lying upon mats placed on the steps, the convalescent Prince would rest for hours, sometimes holding converse with the Grand Master, or counsel with his visitors from the camp; but more often in the dreamy repose of recovery, silent or talking to Richard of matters that lay deep within his heart; but which, perhaps, nothing but this softening species of waking dream would have drawn from him. He would dwell on those two hero models of his boyhood, so diverse, yet so closely connected together by their influence upon his character, Louis of France, and Simon of Leicester; and of the impression both had left, that judgment, mercy, faith, and the subject's welfare, were the primary duties of a sovereign--an idea only now and then glimpsed by the feudal sovereigns, who thought that the people lived for them rather than they for the people. And when, as in England, the King's good-nature had been abused by swarms of foreign-born relations, who had not even his claims on the people, no wonder the yoke had been galling beyond endurance. Of the end Edward could not bear to think--of the broken friendships--the enmity of kindred--the faults on either side that had embittered the strife, till he had been forced to become the sword in the hands of the royal party to liberate his father--and with consequences that had so far <b>out-run</b> his powers of controlling them. To make England the land of law, peace, and order, that Simon de Montfort would fain have seen it, was his present aspiration; and then, he said, when all was purified at home, it might yet be permitted to him to return and win back the Holy City, Jerusalem, to the Christian world. In the meantime, as a memorial of this, his earnest longing, he was causing, at great expense and labour, one of the huge stones of the Temple to be transported over the hills, and embarked on board a ship, to carry home with him. Richard, meantime, learnt to know and love his Prince with a more devoted love, if that were possible, and to grieve the more at the persistent hatred of his brothers, who, utterly uncomprehending their father's high purposes themselves, sought blindly to slake their vengeance for the ruin they had themselves provoked, and upon one who mourned him far more truly than they could ever do.|$|E
60|$|But {{the present}} {{question}} is one altogether transcending all limits of party and all theories of party policy. It {{is a question}} of national existence; it is a question whether Americans shall govern America, or whether a disappointed clique shall nullify all government now, and render a stable government difficult hereafter; it is a question, not whether we shall have civil war under certain contingencies, but whether we shall prevent it under any. It is idle, and worse than idle, to talk about Central Republics that can never be formed. We want neither Central Republics nor Northern Republics, but our own Republic and that of our fathers, destined one day to gather the whole continent under a flag that shall be the most august in the world. Having once known what it was to be members of a grand and peaceful constellation, we shall not believe, without further proof, that the laws of our gravitation are to be abolished, and we flung forth into chaos, a hurlyburly of jostling and splintering stars, whenever Robert Toombs or Robert Rhett, or any other Bob of the secession kite, may give a flirt of self-importance. The first and greatest benefit of government is that it keeps the peace, that it insures every man his right, and not only that, but the permanence of it. In order to this, its first requisite is stability; and this once firmly settled, the greater the extent of conterminous territory that can be subjected to one system and one language and inspired by one patriotism, the better. That there should be some diversity of interests is perhaps an advantage, since the necessity of legislating equitably for all gives legislation its needful safeguards of caution and largeness of view. A single empire embracing the whole world, and controlling, without extinguishing, local organizations and nationalities, has been not only the dream of conquerors, but the ideal of speculative philanthropists. Our own dominion is of such extent and power, that it may, so far as this continent is concerned, be looked upon as something like an approach to the realization of such an ideal. But for slavery, it might have succeeded in realizing it; and in spite of slavery, it may. One language, one law, one citizenship over thousands of miles, and a government on the whole so good that we seem to have forgotten what government means,--these are things not to be spoken of with levity, privileges not to be surrendered without a struggle. And yet while Germany and Italy, taught by the bloody and bitter and servile experience of centuries, are striving toward unity as the blessing above all others desirable, we are to allow a Union, that for almost eighty years has been the source and the safeguard of incalculable advantages, to be shattered by the caprice of a rabble that has <b>out-run</b> the intention of its leaders, while we are making up our minds what coercion means! Ask the first constable, and he will tell you that it is the force necessary for executing the laws. To avoid the danger of what men who have seized upon forts, arsenals, and other property of the United States, and continue to hold them by military force, may choose to call civil war, we are allowing a state of things to gather head which will make real civil war the occupation of the whole country for years to come, and establish it as a permanent institution. There is no such antipathy between the North and the South as men ambitious of a consideration in the new republic, which their talents and character have failed to secure them in the old, would fain call into existence by asserting that it exists. The misunderstanding and dislike between them is not so great as they were within living memory between England and Scotland, as they are now between England and Ireland. There is no difference of race, language, or religion. Yet, after a dissatisfaction of near a century and two rebellions, there is no part of the British dominion more loyal than Scotland, no British subjects who would be more loath to part with the substantial advantages of their imperial connection than the Scotch; and even in Ireland, after a longer and more deadly feud, there is no sane man who would consent to see his country irrevocably cut off from power and consideration to obtain an independence which would be nothing but Donnybrook Fair multiplied by every city, town, and village in the island. The same considerations of policy and advantage which render the union of Scotland and Ireland with England a necessity apply with even more force to the several States of our Union. To let one, or two, or half a dozen of them break away in a freak of anger or unjust suspicion, or, still worse, from mistaken notions of sectional advantage, would be to fail in our duty to ourselves and our country, would be a fatal blindness to the lessons which immemorial history has been tracing on the earth's surface, either with the beneficent furrow of the plough, or, when that was unheeded, the fruitless gash of the cannon ball.|$|E

50|$|The first hill had {{a length}} {{from the top}} of the in-run to the bottom of the <b>out-run</b> of 425 m and an {{elevation}} difference of 130 m. The in-run was 115 m long and had an elevation difference of 46 m. The hill was inaugurated on 29 January 1936 with a 50-meter jump by Birger Henriksen. The longest jump on the opening day was made by Reidar Andersen, who jumped 86 meters. At the most he was 10 to 12 m above the landing slope, so the take-off was lowered 40 cm from 6 to 11 degrees.|$|E
50|$|A {{ski jumping}} hill is a sports venue used for ski jumping. They vary {{in size from}} {{temporary}} handmade snow structures to permanent competition venues. At the top is an in-run where the jumper runs down to generate sufficient speed, before reaching the jump. The skier is then airborne until landing on the landing slope. The {{last part of the}} hill is the <b>out-run,</b> which may be either flat or even uphill, allowing the jumper to stop. The steepest point of the hill is the construction point, which is used to determine the score of a particular length. The size of a hill is measured in the hill size. Hills with a hill size exceeding HS185 are designated ski flying hills; there are five such hills in the world.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the Olympic legacy company ZOI'84, {{which owns}} the hills, {{launched}} plans to renovate the venue. Estimated to cost between €7 million and €10 million, the in-runs would have been completely rebuilt, {{as they are in}} too poor condition to be renovated. The large hill would be expanded to give a K-point of 120 m. Designs have been made by Austrian architect firm Hofrichter-Ritter and financing is planned through European Union or Austrian grants. The project includes natural stands {{on the sides of the}} landing slope and a combination of permanent and temporary stands around the <b>out-run.</b> At a later date, part of stands could be covered with a roof.

50|$|The hill {{consisted}} of three jumps with a common <b>out-run,</b> each with a construction point (K-point) of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. It was located in the central area of the Olympic resort, next to the skating rinks and the Olympic Village. Tall trees {{on both sides of}} the hill gave good protection against the wind. The location was also ideal because of the sun was at the competitor's backs. A judges' tower was constructed on the side, which was both accessible by stairs from the bottom of the hill or from the chairlift which ran to the top of the in-runs. The hill had an overall height of 140 m, the in-run had a length of 113 m. The largest jump had a take-off angle of 8.5 degrees and a landing angle of 38 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The ski jumping, {{cross-country}} skiing and Nordic combined events {{were held at}} Holmenkollbakken, 8 km from the city center. Although upgraded several times since its opening in 1892, the former wooden superstructure was replaced with a concrete tower and in-run ahead of the Olympics, with the <b>out-run</b> being extended to 87 m. Stands were erected to seat 13,000 people, with capacity for an additional 130,000 standing spectators {{at the base of}} the hill. Cross-country races started and ended {{at the base of the}} ski hill. A switchboard was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor the progress of the competitors during the races. Most of the stands built for the ski jumping competition had to be removed for the cross-country races. As a result, there was little room for spectators to sit and watch the cross-country events. Spectators were therefore allowed to walk within the course.|$|E
50|$|The {{day after}} the race in 1927, the {{superstructure}} collapsed, caused by rot in combination with a heavy snowfall. This caused the introduction of public control with scaffolding and bleachers in Norway. By then, Holmenkollbakken was lagging behind internationally, and the world record at the time had exceeded 60 meters. It was therefore decided that a new superstructure would be 19 m tall and moved 9 m further back. Besserudkjernet was partially drained in 1928, but the hotels, which received their water from the lake, would not allow draining the following years. In 1931, the lake was fully drained, which allowed the <b>out-run</b> to be longer. In the 1930s, talk of an 80-meter hill started, which would potentially be built in Rødkleiva, further out in Nordmarka. The Association for the Promotion of Skiing made a formal investigation into the matter in 1937. There was agreement that the venue was becoming too small for international competitions.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Damian Kulash {{said that}} the band had not {{produced}} the music videos as part of any overt [...] "Machiavellian" [...] marketing campaign. [...] "In neither case did we think, 'A-ha, this will get people to buy our records.' It has always been our position that the reason you wind up in a rock band {{is you want to}} make stuff. You want to do creative things for a living." [...] On the release of the band's video for [...] "The Writing's on the Wall" [...] in 2014, Kulash explained to Rolling Stone that the band continues to make such quirky videos as following their success after [...] "Here It Goes Again", the band worried about being considered a one-hit wonder: [...] "We could go in two directions: We could either try to out-cool it - try to <b>out-run</b> it like Radiohead did with 'Creep' - or just embrace it and go, OK, what really worked here." ...|$|E
5000|$|Linear plasma railguns place extreme {{demands on}} their insulators, as {{they must be}} an {{electrically}} insulating, plasma-facing vacuum component which can withstand both thermal and acoustic shocks. Additionally, a complex triple joint seal may exist at the breech of the bore, which can often pose an extreme engineering challenge. Coaxial accelerators require insulators only at the breech, but the plasma armature in that case {{is subject to the}} [...] "blow-by" [...] instability. This is an instability in which the magnetic pressure front can <b>out-run</b> or [...] "blow-by" [...] the plasma armature due to the radial dependence of acceleration current density, drastically reducing device efficiency. Coaxial accelerators use various techniques to mitigate this instability. In either design, a plasma armature is formed at the breech. As plasma railguns are an open area of research, the method of armature formation varies. However, techniques including exploding foils, gas cell burst disk injection, neutral gas injection via fast gas valve, and plasma capillary injection have been employed.|$|E
5000|$|Bullard reports {{orders to}} Horii of 28 August, [...] "to {{advance to the}} {{southern}} slopes of the Owen Stanley Range ... but amass your main strength {{on the north side}} of the range in preparation for future operations". Bullard notes a degree of ambiguity with respect to defining the [...] "southern slopes". On 8 September, the 17th Army ordered Horii to assemble the 41st Regiment in the Kokoda area. Horii did draw back the main body of his force but continued to thrust forward. When, on the 19 September, Hyakutake became aware that Ioribaiwa had been occupied on 16 September, he [...] "issued strict orders for front-line troops to immediately occupy a position to the north of Mawai". An order of 23 September was to secure the Isurava-Kokoda area as [...] "a base for future operations". Horii had <b>out-run</b> his supply line and his force was faced with extreme rationing and unable to advance any further. On 24 September, the 2nd/144th Battalion withdrew from Ioribaiwa. The 3rd/144th Battalion formed the rearguard and withdrew during the night of 26 September.|$|E

5000|$|The new {{hill was}} {{too large to}} be {{regarded}} as a large hill, but was not large enough to be categorized as a ski flying hill. In 1964, the club appointed a committee led by Ottar Grøtterud to consider an expansion of the hill. There was only to be built one ski flying hill in the Nordic Countries, with the main alternative being Renabakken in Rena. Construction cost NOK 445,000 and was in part financed with a NOK 75,000 grant and NOK 150,000 loan from Modum Municipality, NOK 20,000 from volunteer work, NOK 80,000 from the club, grants from companies and banks and from Buskerud County Municipality, and NOK 100,000 in betting funds. Construction was done by Entreprenør Gunnar Sterkebye. The hill received a new 23 m tall in-run and a new jury tower 70 m form the jump. On the landing slope and <b>out-run,</b> [...] of earthwork had to be moved. Work was made more difficult because of high snowfall and temperatures down to −28 C. The hill was inaugurated on 13 March 1966.|$|E
50|$|Trampolino Olimpico Italia is a {{ski jumping}} hill (K90), built in 1955 in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. It {{was the site}} of the ski jumping, Nordic {{combined}} (K90/15.0) and team events for the 1956 Winter Olympics. The Nordic combined event used a shorter in-run to allow average jumps between 60 and 70 meters while the upper starting points on the in-run were calculated to allow jumps of 70 to 80 meters. The 1956 profile had a safety limit of 14.5 m beyond the critical point of 72 m. (transition from the landing slope curve to the <b>out-run</b> begins at a distance of 86.5 m). Among many national and international competitions starting with the 1927 World Championships, was the inauguration of the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup in 1979. Since the venue lost its FIS-certification in 1990, the installation lies dormant. In its day, the Cortina Ski Jumping hill was {{regarded as one of the}} most innovative and still today as one of the most architecturally beautiful examples still in existence. The stadium holds a maximum of 40,000 spectators in the arena and an additional 10.000 in the stands on each side of the hill.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, Oslo {{was awarded}} the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1982, and further {{upgrades}} to the hill were necessary. The costs of the upgrades were NOK 50 million, of which the Norwegian Ski Federation paid NOK 5 million, and Oslo Municipality and the state split the rest. The large expenditures resulted in a public debate. The upgrades saw the introduction of electronics into {{most parts of the}} venue. The old system of manual distance measurement by people standing beside the hill was abolished, and replaced by the video-based system Robotron. Other new installations was an electronic result and scoreboard system, a new time-keeping and speed system, and a new central system to calculate scores. The in-run was expanded, and a mobile start platform was installed, but later removed and replaced by a bar. The knoll and landing slope were adjusted, and the straight section was moved 10 m further down. In the transition to the <b>out-run,</b> [...] of earthwork was blasted away, and Besserudkjernet was sunk another 7 m. This allowed for additional grandstands to be built and the last wooden grandstands were removed. New structures were built for delegates, broadcasting and the jury.|$|E
