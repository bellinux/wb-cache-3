5|$|Opening in late April 2009 was a film Downey {{finished}} in mid-2008, The Soloist. The film was pushed <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> November 2008 release by Paramount Pictures {{due to the}} studio's tight end-of-year release schedule. Critics who had seen the film in 2008 were mentioning it as a possible Academy Award candidate. Downey picked up an Academy Award nomination for the 2008 release year {{for his role in}} Tropic Thunder.|$|E
5|$|The flycatchers {{are small}} birds that fly <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> perch to catch insects {{in the air}} or from the ground. There are about 120 species worldwide, 11 {{of which have been}} {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|According to Bobby Darin's agent, Martin Baum, Paul Newman's agent {{turned down}} the part of Fast Eddie. Newman was {{originally}} unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless, being committed to star opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the film Two for the Seesaw. Rossen offered Darin the part after seeing him on The Mike Wallace Interview. When Taylor was forced {{to drop out of}} Seesaw because of shooting overruns on Cleopatra, Newman was freed up to take the role, which he accepted after reading just half of the script. No one associated with the production officially notified Darin or his representatives that he had been replaced; they found <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> member of the public at a charity horse race.|$|E

5|$|Rita finds <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{county sheriff}} that Paul, her abusive ex-husband who {{attacked}} her the night before, is pressing charges against her for assault. She talks with a lawyer, who tells her that since she invited Paul into her house, she cannot prove that her {{intent was to}} defuse the situation. At a hearing, it is revealed that Rita violated her and Paul's custody agreement, making Paul's case against her even stronger. When Paul drops by Rita's house to return their children, he threatens Dexter when the two are alone in the kitchen, and Dexter responds by hitting him with a frying pan. Paul loses consciousness, so Dexter drives his body back to Paul's hotel and frames him for drug abuse. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{bleeding}} <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> gunshot wound while Scully tends to him. They are {{revealed to be}} hostages in a bank holdup, and Scully attempts to reason with their captor (Darren E. Burrows), only to have him reveal a bomb strapped to his chest. The police begin to storm the building, prompting the gunman to detonate the bomb, seemingly killing them all.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Experiment led to two sequels, Quatermass II (1955) and Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59), both {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Cartier and written by Kneale. Both were successful and critically acclaimed, and Cartier's production work on them became increasingly ambitious. For Quatermass II, he pre-filmed {{a significant amount of}} material on location, using 35mm film, opening the drama <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> confined studio setting with the most ambitious location shooting yet attempted in British television. Cartier, with his previous experience as a film director, particularly enjoyed working on these cinema-style filmed scenes.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins in}} its {{principal}} setting with Swift and two backup musicians atop {{a stage in}} a crowded barn. Swift {{is dressed in a}} fitted pastel sundress and plays an acoustic guitar strapped over her shoulder. The backup musicians play the fiddle,the piano, the drum set, and the upright bass. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart staring <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> red car into the street, Brody swinging from a rope in a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple are slow dancing while Swift sings.|$|E
5|$|Bladin became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24November 1948; this {{position}} {{gave him a}} seat on the Air Board, which consisted of the RAAF's most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. He succeeded Joe Hewitt, and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated. RAAF Staff College was opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, providing an advanced defence course aimed at squadron leaders and wing commanders; various international facilities were also utilised to further officers' education. In October, Bladin became involved in the push for a Junior Equipment and Administrative Training Scheme to offer apprenticeships to clerical and supply staff, which was established two years later. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the King's Birthday Honours announced in June 1950. In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, he sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their degree qualifications with formal teaching credentials. Over the following year, in response to increased demands for aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the Malayan Emergency and the Korean War, pilot training was broken <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single all-encompassing course at No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS) in Point Cook, Victoria, into separate courses at the newly formed No.1 Initial Flying Training School at Archerfield, Queensland, No.1 Basic Flying Training School at Uranquinty, New South Wales, and No.1 Applied Flying Training School (re-formed from No.1 FTS) at Point Cook.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E

5|$|From September 2 to September 3, large waves, some {{as high as}} , {{impacted}} beaches throughout southern California, with Los Angeles and Orange Counties experiencing growing breakers, and Cabrillo Beach experiencing riptides for {{two days}} straight. Due to the Labor Day beach turnout, many reports of rescuing swimmers who were swept up by waves caused by the hurricane were received. On September 2, forty-seven swimmers in Zuma Beach had to be rescued despite warnings {{to stay out of}} deep water, and an additional 261 rescues were reported in Newport. More rescues were reported the next day, although no exact total from the second day is known. At the El Morro Beach Trailer Park near Laguna Beach, a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) were ripped from their supports by rough seas. Long Beach, in terms of damage, was particularly hit hard by Liza, with debris and sea foam from the heavy surf clogging storm drains. A group of tidal pools formed along an area of the beach, draining <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> parking lot on 72nd Street onto Ocean Boulevard, resulting in flooding that closed a section of the boulevard between 68th Place and 72nd Place to traffic. Various flower gardens were also reported to have been swamped by the flooding, but no damage to housing was reported. The weakened properties in West Newport Beach also sustained no additional damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 the Clifton Bridge Company {{was set up}} {{to oversee}} the final stages of {{completion}} and manage the operation of the bridge. They paid £50 each year to the trustees who gradually purchased the shares in the company. The revenues from tolls were minimal initially as there was not much traffic; however, this increased after 1920 with greater car ownership. In 1949 the trustees purchased all the outstanding shares and debentures. The bridge is managed by a charitable trust, originally formed by the Society of Merchant Venturers following Vick's bequest. The trust was authorised to manage the bridge and collect tolls by Acts of Parliament in 1952, 1980 and 1986. A toll of £0.50 has been levied on vehicles since 2007, but the £0.05 toll that the Act allows for cyclists or pedestrians is not collected. Human toll collectors were replaced by automated machines in 1975. The tolls are used to pay for the upkeep of the bridge, including the strengthening of the chain anchor points, which was done in 1925 and 1939, and regular painting and maintenance, which is carried <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> motorised cradle slung beneath the deck. By 2008 over 4 million vehicles crossed the bridge each year.|$|E
5|$|In December, UN Command {{temporarily}} switched some of {{the responsibilities}} of Task Element 95.11 and the US Fifth Air Force. Consequently, Sydney was required to provide air support for convoys between Japan and Korea amongst the other duties of her fifth patrol, which commenced on 7 December. On 8 December, a second RAN pilot was killed; although successfully bailing <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> flak-damaged Sea Fury, {{he was struck by}} the tail of his own aircraft, and died from wounds. Four other aircraft were damaged that day. Clear weather, which lasted until 14 December, allowed the carrier to maintain a high rate of attack against North Korean troop concentrations, railways, and coastal vessels, while providing air cover for the Task Element. Ending on 18 December, the fifth patrol was the most costly to Sydneys CAG, with one pilot killed, five aircraft destroyed, and another 25 aircraft heavily damaged. The carrier was in Kure for Christmas, and relieved USS Badoeng Strait on 27 December, the start of her sixth patrol. The remaining days of 1951 were spent providing air cover in the Inchon area for both UN ground forces and supply convoys returning to Japan. On New Year's Day 1952, Sydneys aircraft helped repel the North Korean invasion of the island of Yongho Do. The third RAN pilot to be lost in Korea died on 2 January while performing a combat air patrol around the carrier; personnel on the flight deck saw the aircraft fly into a cloud, but not emerge. No wreckage was found, and it was assumed that the plane dived into the Yellow Sea. For most of the patrol, RAN aircraft attacked artillery emplacements and concentrations of junks in the Cho Do-Sok To area, while also proving air support for South Korean Army and irregular forces.|$|E

5|$|Three days later, Admiral Coligny {{was walking}} back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> house and wounded him in the hand and arm. A smoking arquebus was {{discovered}} in a window, but the culprit had made his escape {{from the rear of}} the building on a waiting horse. Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon Ambroise Paré removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.• Frieda, 292. The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, Francis, Duke of Guise.• For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83–4. Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.|$|E
