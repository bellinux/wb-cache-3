5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of Dunedin's settlement, much of the city's growth was on two areas of {{reasonably}} flat land close to the harbour, separated by the large Bell Hill and an area of low swampy land. The northern of these two flat areas surrounded the floodplain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Water</b> of Leith, a small river that runs through Dunedin. As the city grew the swamp was drained to become the new city's centre, and the hill was lowered by excavation to allow access between the two areas of settlement. A street grid was set up with the main road split in two by the city centre (now The Octagon) - Princes Street to the south and George Street to the north. As with many of the city's other place names, both these names and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Water</b> of Leith reflect the names of places in Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and spin {{three or four times}} about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving across the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water {{more or less in}} the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> itself.|$|E
