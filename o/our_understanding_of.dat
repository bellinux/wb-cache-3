Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental to <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior.

A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{response}} to Valentine’s (2008) recent suggestion that the family is an absent presence within Geography. Persuaded by her argument, I explore other disciplinary approaches to theorizing families, and in particular how discursive appropriations of ‘the family’ and theories of family practices can enlarge <b>our</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> what families are and how they are done. I then argue that geographers can contribute to such studies by exploring the spaces and spacings that co-constitute family subjectivities. I put these ideas to work in the context of Birzeit, Palestine, where I argue particular family spaces and spacings offer more nuanced <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> this place, which challenge limited discursive constructions of the ‘Arab family’ and the ‘Western family. I situate these theoretical maneuvers within broader geographies of intimacies, while arguing that there is still a great deal {{of work to be done}} to further spatialize <b>our</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> families...|$|R
5|$|Viruses are {{important}} to the study of molecular and cell biology as they provide simple systems {{that can be used to}} manipulate and investigate the functions of cells.

5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades in <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One {{of the major}} unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that {{may be useful in}} the long run. (See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E
