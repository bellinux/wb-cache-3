25|$|In Islamic communities, {{the novel}} became {{instantly}} controversial, because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> Muslims considered blasphemous references. Rushdie {{was accused of}} misusing freedom of speech. By October 1988, letters and phone calls arrived at Viking Penguin from Muslims, angry with the book and demanding that it be withdrawn. Before {{the end of the}} month, the import of the book was banned in India, although possession of the book is not a criminal offence.|$|E

For several decades it provided the means through which American whites viewed black people. On the one hand, it had strong racist aspects; on the other, it afforded white Americans a singular and broad awareness <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> whites considered significant aspects of black culture in America.|$|E
25|$|The Sui dynasty was {{established}} over the Northern Zhou, whose throne was usurped by Yang Jian in 581. Yang Jian quickly enacted {{a series of}} policies to restore China's economy. His reunification of China marked the creation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> historians call the 'Second Chinese Empire', spanning the Sui, T'ang and Northern Song dynasties. Despite its brevity, the Sui reunified China, and its laws and administration {{formed the basis of}} the later Tang, Song and Ming dynasties.

25|$|Eliyahu {{was one of}} {{the spiritual}} leaders of the Religious Zionist movement, and was an outspoken {{opponent}} of the Gaza Disengagement of 2005. He was considered somewhat controversial for his decades-long support <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> characterize as the radical right of the Religious Zionist movement. Eliyahu was a supporter of Rabbi Meir Kahane, and friendly with his family. He officiated at the marriage of Kahane's son, Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane, and delivered the eulogy at Meir Kahane's funeral. He was a long-time supporter of Jonathan Pollard, and became Pollard's spiritual mentor while the latter served in prison.|$|E

25|$|This favored {{arrangement}} occurred {{primarily because}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> men considered their {{conflict with the}} matrilineal system. Under this kinship system, children were considered born into the mother's clan and took their status from her family. Generally her eldest brother served as mentor to her children, particularly for the boys. She was protected by her family. Some Ashanti men felt more comfortable taking a slave girl or pawn wife in marriage, as she would have no abusua (older male grandfather, father, uncle or brother) to intercede on her behalf when the couple argued. With an enslaved wife, the master and husband had total control of their children, as she had no kin in the tribe.|$|E
25|$|This, {{according}} to the oaths taken, made Margaret the heir at three years of age, but that same year Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale had rebelled {{with the aid of}} his son the Earl of Carrick. The Bruces captured strongholds in Galloway, and as well as bolstering their position in the south-west where their rivals the Balliols also had influence, may have been making a bid for the Crown. However, Robert Bruce seems to have overestimated his chances of successfully pressing his claim, as further support {{does not appear to have}} been forthcoming, and it is difficult to prove that even Bruce allies such as the Stewarts decided to back them, in spite <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> historians have inferred from the Turnberry Band of September 1286. The rebellion thus quickly fizzled out, though no drastic action was taken against the Bruces after they had handed back the castles they had seized. In this way, the Guardians possibly hoped to maintain the peace in Scotland between the competing claims of Robert Bruce and John Balliol, without jeopardising their ultimate loyalty to the realm, and probably to Margaret as the more generally accepted heir.|$|E

The Church of Scientology threatened legal action against various Internet service providers that host the site, demanding it be removed from the Internet for hosting information copyrighted by the Church of Scientology.|$|E
500|$|To Stanford's regret, many of {{his pupils}} who {{achieved}} eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke's conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> of these rebels have since achieved, {{one is tempted to}} wonder whether there is really anything better a teacher can do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, and to some extent elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E
500|$|After Hershiser reached 49 {{consecutive}} innings because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> sources {{describe as}} an umpire's favorable interference ruling on a double play, the sports media compared him to Drysdale, {{who had a}} similar incident occur during his streak. The Houston Chronicle noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers–Giants games. However, the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list. In addition to covering the record pursuit, some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race. Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record, some of the press continued {{to refer to the}} record as [...] innings. The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title. An Associated Press article noted that it was Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout. As Hershiser's last remaining start approached, the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all-time record. When the total reached 49, Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach. Not only were his teammates too superstitious {{to talk to him about}} the streak, Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of jinxing him. Hershiser was not superstitious about the record, saying, [...] "I'm pretty loosey-goosey about it... I talk about it all the time. I'm not superstitious." ...|$|E

500|$|Higgins {{ventured into}} real estate at [...] first, {{and with the}} money that he saved as a logger, he started the Higgins Manufacturing Company to {{manufacture}} bricks. The business sparked his interest in oil and gas, as he used it for his kilns to burn the bricks evenly. He decided to travel to Pennsylvania to learn about these fuels and study the geographical features that give signs {{to the presence of}} underground oil. Studying geology on his own, he dedicated himself to finding these clues by reading all the United States Geological Survey reports and books that he could find. The details he learned reminded him <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> Beaumont locals back home referred to as [...] "Sour Hill Mound", a place where he frequently brought his Sunday school students for outings. This mound was described as [...] "sour" [...] due to the unpleasant sulfur smell {{that came out of the}} springs around it. Convinced that this salt dome mound had oil below it, Higgins first partnered with George O'Brien, George Carroll, Emma John, and J.F. Lanier to form the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company in 1892. It was during this time that other formally trained geologists dismissed the idea of finding oil along the gulf coast region of the United States. Higgins' personal integrity was even challenged by the local newspaper. However, his informal training in geology influenced his belief that the Spindletop field contained oil below due to the presence of mineral water and gas seepage, and he managed to convince the partners to proceed with the venture. Work began the following year, but all three of the shallow drilling attempts failed to locate oil due to the shifting sands and unstable clay under the hill. Higgins held onto his ownership and leases of land over the salt dome, but resigned from the company.|$|E

2500|$|As Brown's {{campaign}} {{began to}} attract more members <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>some</b> more conservative commentators described as [...] "the fringe", including activists like Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, and Jesse Jackson, his polling numbers began to suffer. Brown received only 10 {{percent of the vote}} in the New Hampshire primary, and he was soon forced to announce that his decision to remain in the race would depend on a good showing in the Wisconsin primary. Although he had polled well there throughout the primary season, an attempt to film a live speech in Madison, the state's capital, into a special effects-filled, 30-minute commercial (produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola) was disastrous.|$|E

It is thus now possible again to reason about sets in a non-axiomatic fashion without running afoul of Russell's paradox, namely by reasoning about the elements of V. Whether it is appropriate to think of sets in this way is a point of contention among the rival points of view on the philosophy of mathematics.|$|E
