5|$|Only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> {{detachment}} of marines on board {{participated in the}} mutiny. While the half-dozen remaining were too outnumbered and taken by surprise to fulfill their role of shipboard police and oppose the mutineers, they did insist on being treated as prisoners of war by the Spanish and were accordingly exchanged six months later, along with the surviving warrant officers.|$|E
5|$|The first European dogs seen {{were those}} that {{accompanied}} Spanish explorers Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira and Pedro Fernandes de Queirós in 1595. While {{they were on}} Hiva Oa, the Marquesans attempted to steal <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> dogs on their ships. Anthropologist Katharine Luomala noted that nothing suggested that these dogs were left by the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Most other rivers arising on Exmoor flow {{north to}} the Bristol Channel. These include the River Heddon, which runs along the western edges of Exmoor, {{reaching}} the North Devon coast at Heddon's Mouth, and the East and West Lyn rivers, which meet at Lynmouth. Hoar Oak Water is a moorland tributary of the East Lyn River, the confluence being at Watersmeet. The River Horner, which {{is also known as}} Horner Water, rises near Luccombe and flows into Porlock Bay near Hurlstone Point. The River Mole arises on the south-western flanks of Exmoor and is the major tributary of the River Taw, which itself flows northward from Dartmoor. Badgworthy Water is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> rivers running {{north to the}} coast and is associated with the Lorna Doone legends.|$|E

5|$|Walsingham {{rose from}} {{relative}} obscurity to become <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> coterie {{who directed the}} Elizabethan state, overseeing foreign, domestic and religious policy. He served as English ambassador to France in the early 1570s and witnessed the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. As principal secretary, he supported exploration, colonization, the use of England's maritime strength and the plantation of Ireland. He worked to bring Scotland and England together. Overall, his foreign policy demonstrated {{a new understanding of}} the role of England as a maritime, Protestant power in an increasingly global economy. He oversaw operations that penetrated Spanish military preparation, gathered intelligence from across Europe, disrupted a range of plots against Elizabeth and secured the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> {{rooms of the}} temple—although the desservant {{who lives in the}} apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E
5|$|L'Hermite's {{three other}} ships all survived the {{hurricane}} relatively intact {{and were able}} to continue their journey to Europe unimpeded, the British squadrons in the area also dispersed by the summer storms. In late September the squadron broke up, Régulus sailing for Brest and arriving on 5 October, the only French ship of the line to enter or leave the port all year. Président was less successful: at 03:30 on 27 September, while sailing in the Bay of Biscay at , Captain Labrosse sighted six ships of the line. This overwhelming force was a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis, which had been sent to the Bay of Biscay to await the return of Willaumez from the Caribbean. Immediately giving chase, Louis found that his ships of the line were not fast enough to catch the French frigate, which began to outdistance {{the main body of the}} squadron. However <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> 18-gun sloops attached to the squadron, HMS Despatch under Captain Edward Hawkins was able to keep pace with the frigate, coming within firing range at 18:45.|$|E

25|$|Granulomatosis with polyangiitis {{is part of}} {{a larger}} group of vasculitic syndromes called {{systemic}} vasculitides or necrotizing vasculopathies, all of which feature an autoimmune attack by an abnormal type of circulating antibody termed ANCAs (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) against small and medium-size blood vessels. Apart from GPA, this category includes eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and microscopic polyangiitis. Although GPA affects small- and medium-size vessels, it is formally classified as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> vessel vasculitides in the Chapel Hill system.|$|E
25|$|As a Quaker, Harvey {{was placed}} in a {{difficult}} personal position by Britain's declaration of war in August 1914. Quakers traditionally took the view that all war is incompatible with the spirit and teachings of Christ. Harvey was a pacifist and profoundly wished to keep Britain out of the war and supported those elements in the government, particularly the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, who were working to prevent a general war. Harvey remained <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> band of Liberals, at that time still including Norman Angell and E D Morel, who had grave doubts about the war.|$|E

25|$|USAT Meigs was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> fleet the Army {{maintained}} {{during the}} inter-war years and operated in the Pacific as a freight and animal transport. In 1939, with USAT Ludington, Meigs {{was one of}} only two Army owned freight transports. Included in the requirement to transport army goods and personal possessions of personnel changing duty stations to the Pacific was transport of cavalry and personal horses of officers with occasional mention of the ship transporting notable horses or owners transferring between Pacific and continental postings. In July 1938 Meigs found an oil slick along the course of the lost Pan American flying boat Hawaii Clipper about 500 miles from Manila, took samples and stood by for further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Sim {{was born}} in Edinburgh, the {{youngest}} child and second son of Alexander Sim and his wife, Isabella née McIntyre. Sim senior was a Justice of the Peace and a successful tailor with a business on Lothian Road; his wife had moved to Edinburgh as a teenager from Eigg, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Small</b> Isles in the Hebrides, and at first spoke only Gaelic. Sim was educated at Bruntsfield Primary, James Gillespie's High School and George Heriot's School. He worked – probably part-time – in his father's shop and then for the men's outfitters Gieve's, displaying no talent for the retail trade. In 1918 he {{was admitted to the}} University of Edinburgh to study analytical chemistry, but was called up for army training.|$|E
25|$|Emery Molyneux and Petrus Plancius {{have also}} been cited as the first uranographers to {{distinguish}} Crux as a separate constellation; their representations date from 1592, the former depicting it on his celestial globe and the latter in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> celestial maps on his large wall map. Both authors, however, depended on unreliable sources and placed Crux in the wrong position. Crux was first shown in its correct position on the celestial globes of Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius in 1598 and 1600. Its stars were first catalogued separately from Centaurus by Frederick de Houtman in 1603. Later adopters of the constellation included Jakob Bartsch in 1624 and Augustin Royer in 1679. Royer is sometimes wrongly cited as initially distinguishing Crux.|$|E
