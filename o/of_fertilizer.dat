5|$|Norsk Hydro {{announced}} in 1963 a savings plan for its four plants in Norway; Chief Executive Officer Rolf Østbye {{made it clear}} that new technology in the production of ammonia would force the closure of the plant at Rjukan, {{and replace it with a}} petroleum-based process at Herøya. The Rjukan situation, as it was named in the press, became a source of conflict between the local community and Norsk Hydro; initially 250 jobs were to be moved to Herøya, but in 1964 Norsk Hydro applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Herøya—what would become the death sentence for the Rjukan Line. Permission for the construction of the power line was granted in 1968. Production <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was moved to Herøya and Glomfjord, and Rjukan transferred to production of kalkammonsalpeter in 1963 and ammonium nitrate in 1964.|$|E

5|$|The German {{raids on}} Nauru {{affected}} the Australian and New Zealand economies {{and were the}} greatest success achieved by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. It took ten weeks to resume phosphate shipments from Nauru, {{and the loss of}} ships and damaged infrastructure led to a significant decline in output. The resulting phosphate shortages forced the introduction <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> rationing in New Zealand from July 1941. Komets bombardment of the island also interfered with phosphate consignments to Japan, which caused the Japanese government to threaten to reduce the aid it was providing to Germany. The success of the attacks on Nauru led to rumours in Australia and New Zealand that the raiders had been aided by treachery in the islands. Several investigations were conducted into the rumours and proved them to be unfounded.|$|E
5|$|After its {{introduction}} from South America to Spain {{in the late}} 1500s, the potato became a staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The potato allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The increased supply of food reduced disease, increased births and reduced mortality, causing a population boom throughout the British Empire, the US and Europe. The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> {{in the form of}} guano imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, {{in the form of an}} arsenic compound used to fight Colorado potato beetles. Before the adoption of the potato as a major crop, the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed, including 17 major famines in England between 1523 and 1623. The resulting dependence on the potato however caused the European Potato Failure, a disastrous crop failure from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.|$|E
25|$|Soil Nitrogen Testing (N-Testing) is a {{technique}} that helps farmers optimize the amount <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> applied to crops.

25|$|In the 1920s farm {{production}} had increased dramatically thanks to mechanization, more potent insecticides and increased use <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Due to an overproduction of agricultural products farmers faced a severe and chronic agricultural depression throughout the 1920s.

25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> {{and organic}} waste that urban runoff often carries, {{eutrophication}} often occurs in waterways {{affected by this}} type of runoff. After heavy rains, organic matter in the waterway is relatively high compared with natural levels, spurring growth of algae blooms that soon consume most of the oxygen. Once the naturally occurring oxygen in the water is depleted, the algae blooms die, and their decomposition causes further eutrophication. Algae blooms mostly occur in areas with still water, such as stream pools and the pools behind dams, weirs, and some drop structures. Eutrophication usually comes with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Interrelationships among {{nutrient}} cycling, regeneration, {{and subsequent}} forest development on floodplains in interior Alaska were addressed by Van Cleve et al. (1980), who {{pointed out that}} the various stages in primary succession reflect physical, chemical, and biological controls of ecosystem structure and function. Thus, each successional stage has a species combination in harmony with site quality. Short-circuiting succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of nitrogen insufficiency. Without application of substantial amounts <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> use would have to be made of early successional alder and its site-ameliorating additions of nitrogen.|$|E
