25|$|Through a {{retrospective}} analysis of national administrative data, the association between mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the working week and on weekends.

This “weekday effect” has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer availability of services <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekend,</b> and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.|$|E

25|$|Under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, bank {{holidays}} are proclaimed {{each year by}} the legal device of a royal proclamation. Royal proclamation {{is also used to}} move {{bank holidays}} that would otherwise fall <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekend.</b> In this way, public holidays are not 'lost' in years when they coincide with weekends. These deferred bank holiday days are termed a 'bank holiday ' of the typical anniversary date. In the legislation they are known as 'substitute days'. The movement of the St Andrew's Day Scottish holiday to the nearest Monday when 30 November is a weekend day is statutory and does not require a proclamation.|$|E
25|$|Economic losses—from lost {{sales revenue}} and wages—are {{estimated}} between $500million and $3billion. Moody's Analytics indicated the highest losses, stating $2.5–3billion; however, the storm's occurrence <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekend</b> accounted for less losses than what {{would otherwise be}} expected. Planalytics placed losses at $850million and IHS Global Insight estimated losses between $500million and $1billion. Although an estimate was not provided, AON Benfield placed losses in the billions of dollars, noting similarities to the Blizzard of 1996 which inflicted $4.6billion in economic losses. Despite the expected major losses, the rush to buy supplies ahead of the storm's arrival may mitigate the overall impact. The airline industry suffered approximately $200million in lost revenue.|$|E
