5|$|Gutiérrez lost ninth {{position}} on lap 30 {{when he was}} passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water {{on the inside of}} the pit lane straight and used DRS. Vettel made his second pit stop for intermediate tyres that lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams cars. Button recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth {{position on}} the lap. Button made a second pit stop for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; it took longer than expected because his pit crew changed his steering wheel, and he came <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton; Rosberg made his second pit stop (for new intermediate tyres) on lap 33, and came <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced understeer and spun 360 degrees after running onto the run-off area. Hamilton made a pit stop at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36. Ricciardo took the lead until his pit stop during that lap and came <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> the two Mercedes drivers, Vettel and Button.|$|E

On 4 May, England became embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which England, Austria and the Dutch Republic fought against France and Spain. Charles II of Spain had died childless in 1700, and the {{succession}} was disputed by two claimants: the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria and the Bourbon Philip, Duke of Anjou.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton made a {{pit stop}} on lap 35, coming <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> his teammate, driving {{over the white}} pit exit line in the process. This handed him a five-second time penalty {{to be added to}} his {{finishing}} time. Sebastian Vettel came in two laps later, being stationary for more than 13 seconds due to a problem with the wheelnut of his rear right tyre and came <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> Felipe Massa in fourth place. Meanwhile, Romain Grosjean retired with gearbox issues. Vettel closed the gap to Massa in the last podium position, but was eventually unable to pass the Brazilian, handing Massa his first podium finish of 2015. Toward the end of the race, Pastor Maldonado was racing Max Verstappen for seventh place. Going past the start/finish straight, Maldonado almost lost the rear of his car coming out of the Toro Rosso's slipstream, while Verstappen locked up going into turn one, handing the position to the Lotus driver. Rosberg, who complained about vibrations in his front tyres during the last laps, crossed the finish line three seconds ahead of teammate Hamilton, taking his third victory of the season and the second consecutive one at Spielberg, reducing his championship gap to ten points.|$|E

5|$|Nico Rosberg {{made his}} pit stop shortly thereafter, {{putting on the}} soft {{compound}} tyre, while Hamilton stayed out. In the meantime, Vettel had moved up into third place, right behind his teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton came into the pitlane on lap 22, and problems with his stop saw him lose position to Rosberg. Räikkönen briefly led the race but followed suit one lap later and made a pit stop, only to come <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> both Red Bull drivers. More trouble was ahead for Ferrari, as Vettel, {{who was in the}} lead at that point, retired on lap 27, when he crashed into the barriers after his rear right tyre had exploded. This incident sent the safety car out, bringing the field back together. Rosberg was now leading the race from Hamilton, Verstappen, Ricciardo and Räikkönen.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{took his}} first pit stop on lap 28, {{emerging}} in seventh position. Barrichello pitted one lap later. Race leader Häkkinen took his pit stop on lap 31 and came <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> teammate Coulthard. Häkkinen regained the lead after Coulthard made his pit stop on lap 32, who came out in third position. Fisichella retired with further brake problems on lap 32. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:20.028 on lap 33, {{as he continued to}} stretch his lead over Michael Schumacher. Coulthard, who was on fresh tyres, gradually began to close the gap to Michael Schumacher by lap 39. Michael Schumacher increased the gap when Coulthard lost two seconds; the result of being held up by Genè who was later issued a 10-second stop-go penalty. Barrichello pitted for the second time on lap 47. Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher made their pit stops on lap 50, one lap ahead of Coulthard.|$|E
5|$|This new sail {{was much}} larger than the others sighted earlier in the day, and the {{detached}} squadron abandoned their former pursuit and turned towards the new arrival, Hercule. By 17:45, L'Héritier was in full flight with the British force strung <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> him, the rest of Bridport's fleet far to the west. Jason had the lead with Mars shortly behind, although Inman on Ramillies had lost his fore topmast and had dropped back. Hood, an experienced officer and a nephew of both Bridport and the veteran Admiral Lord Hood, pressed his ship forwards and gradually gained on both Jason and Hercule. L'Héritier knew that in open water he would be caught and overwhelmed, and sought instead to escape through the narrow and dangerous channel of the Raz de Sein, a rocky passage between the Île de Sein and the Pointe du Raz: during the Expédition d'Irlande the French ship of the line Séduisant had been wrecked in the Raz de Sein with 680 lives.|$|E

5|$|When {{the safety}} car {{came in on}} lap42, Hamilton led, while Heidfeld and Piquet were running second and third. Behind them were Massa, Kubica, Kovalainen, Trulli, Vettel, Alonso, Webber, Rosberg and Räikkönen. Webber's Red Bull had been {{dripping}} oil {{for a couple of}} laps after picking up debris from Glock's crash, and on lap40 he pulled out of the race. Räikkönen quickly passed Rosberg, and then overtook the squabbling Vettel and Alonso on {{the way down to the}} hairpin, while Hamilton desperately tried to pull away at the front. Räikkönen passed Trulli twolaps later, while Kovalainen overtook Kubica for fifth place. Coulthard and Barrichello collided on the 48thlap with both cars pitting for repairs. Barrichello retired threelaps later due to damage sustained as a result of the incident. Hamilton pitted on lap50, coming <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> Heidfeld, Piquet, Massa and Kovalainen. Kovalainen let his teammate past at the hairpin one lap later, meaning that Hamilton was now fourth. On lap52, Heidfeld set a new fastest lap time of 1:15.987. He was the only driver to go under one minute 16 seconds during the Grand Prix. At the end of the following lap, Heidfeld entered the pits with a sizeable gap over Piquet, returning to the field comfortably ahead of Kovalainen, but behind Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Alesi, {{the first}} front-runner {{to make a}} {{scheduled}} pit stop on lap 18, rejoined in tenth. During the next two laps Salo passed Irvine for twelfth, whilst Barrichello made a pit stop from sixth position and came out in eleventh. By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and {{during the next two}} laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made a pit stop from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit boards) to speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second pit stop on lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a pit stop, on lap 33.|$|E
5|$|At the start, several drivers {{made contact}} with one another into turn two. Sebastian Vettel {{was hit in the}} rear by Daniil Kvyat there and during turn three, the latter of which caused him to crash into the barrier and retire from the competition. Further back, Nico Hülkenberg was hit by Esteban Gutiérrez and {{collected}} Rio Haryanto, forcing both Hülkenberg and Haryanto into retirement as well. As the safety car came out to allow for the cars and debris to be cleared from the track, several cars headed to the pit lane to repair damage, among them Daniel Ricciardo, Daniil Kvyat and Sergio Pérez. The order at the restart on lap four was: Rosberg, Räikkönen, Bottas, Massa and Hamilton, who had stayed clear of the incidents to move up to fifth. On the restart, Bottas moved ahead of Räikkönen, while Hamilton made a successful move on Massa into fourth. Kvyat's early pit stop left him in 15th at that point, and he soon served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for his contacts with Vettel, dropping him to last. Meanwhile, Hamilton overtook Räikkönen to move into third on lap seven. Felipe Nasr came into the pit lane on lap 12 to replace a slow puncture on his tyres. The order at the front remained the same until Bottas became the first front runner to pit for fresh tyres on lap 17. Hamilton followed suit one lap later, but still emerged behind Bottas, overtaking him into turn two another lap later. On lap 20, Räikkönen made a pit stop as well, coming back <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> Hamilton, but ahead of Bottas. All the while, Rosberg led comfortably ahead of Max Verstappen, who made his first stop on lap 23 and dropped back.|$|E

5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|On lap 13, Felipe Massa passed Marcus Ericsson for ninth {{place and}} one lap later, Hamilton capitalised on a mistake by Vettel and overtook him to retake second {{position}}. Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen pass him on lap 16, the two being on different strategies. Meanwhile, Rosberg {{had built up}} a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to pass him, while Alonso came in for what was his third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created flatspots on his tyres when he locked up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29. With his teammate closing in, Rosberg made pit stops on lap 32, with Räikkönen following suit, whose pit stop was delayed, losing him around four seconds. Sergio Pérez was starting {{to close the gap}} to both Ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early. Vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to the super-soft tyres, coming <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> both Pérez and Ricciardo in sixth. One lap later, Hamilton came in for his second and final stop, having asked his team before if {{it would be possible to}} finish the race without stopping again. He emerged twelve seconds behind Rosberg and started to cut into his advantage immediately.|$|E

25|$|None of the 82nd's {{objectives}} of clearing areas {{west of the}} Merderet and destroying bridges over the Douve were achieved on D-Day.

25|$|Hamilton {{seemed to}} have found some pace but he pitted soon after on lap 37. He came in but his new tyres were still in their {{blankets}} {{and a lot of}} time was wasted. Barrichello came in three laps later on lap 40 and came out in first. Button came in on lap 41 along with Alonso leaving Webber to tackle a bit of traffic. Webber pitted and the traffic had cost him as he came <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> Button and Kubica leaving himself out of the points. Räikkönen also jumped Kovalainen {{in the second round of}} stops.|$|E

He played Minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire until 1985, by which time he had made 33 Minor Counties Championship appearances and two MCCA Knockout Trophy appearances. He made a final List A appearance for Bedfordshire in the 1985 NatWest Trophy against Gloucestershire. In this match he captained Bedfordshire, scoring a single run before being dismissed by Kevin Curran, with Gloucestershire winning by 141 runs.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} of the season started in Germany but the Schumacher fans went home {{disappointed}} as the Ferraris locked out the front row in qualifying. Berger took pole ahead of Alesi, Hill, Schumacher down in fourth, Katayama and Coulthard. At the start Katayama got ahead of Hill and Schumacher and then Schumacher got by Hill. There was mayhem behind as Häkkinen hit Brundle and spun off, taking out Frentzen, Barrichello and Irvine, as well as knocking Coulthard's front wing out of place. Brundle braked to avoid the mess but was hit by Herbert, taking Herbert <b>out.</b> <b>Behind,</b> there was a collision between Martini and Alex Zanardi, taking out de Cesaris and Alboreto in the process. A total of 10 cars were out by the first corner. Surprisingly, the race was not red-flagged.|$|E
25|$|E. M. Barry was the {{architect}} for the BMI building {{and it was}} hoped he could be retained as {{the architect}} for the adjoining library, however his plans were deemed too expensive for the Corporation. Martin & Chamberlain's plans were approved in October 1862 for a tender price of £8,600 with E. M. Barry's classical facade retained in the design. The Lending Library was opened on 6 September 1865 and the Reference Library was opened {{just over a year}} later on 26 October 1866. Initial use of the library was so heavy that the need for an extension was agreed in 1872 but deferred until 1878. On 11 January 1879 a fire broke <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> a wooden partition serving as a temporary wall during building operations.
