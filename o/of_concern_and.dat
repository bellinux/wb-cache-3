40|$|Abstract. Due {{to their}} {{increasing}} complexity, design of software systems is not becoming easier. Furthermore, modern applications ranging from enterprise to embedded systems require {{very high levels}} of correctness and dependability assurance. The most effective means to handle complexity is separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> incremental development, and assurance of correctness requires formal modelling and formal analysis. When separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> splits the model into several parts, an important issue is to ensure consistency among these parts. We propose an approach supporting separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> consistent and incremental modelling of requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to determine early childhood pre-service teachers' <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> solutions. One hundred early childhood pre-service teachers who were enrolled at Pamukkale University, Turkey, answered two open-ended questions by e-mail. In addition, six of these participants were interviewed for developing a deeper understanding <b>of</b> their <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> solutions. Five main areas <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> solutions were identified as: (1) children, (2) parents, (3) school principals and colleagues, (4) environmental conditions, (5) self-orientation. This paper {{draws attention to the}} underlying reasons given by pre-service teachers about their <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> elicits their ways <b>of</b> overcoming these <b>concerns,</b> in order to identify pre-service teachers' needs, in becoming effective teachers, and to integrate possible areas <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> in management <b>and</b> development of teacher education...|$|R

It has been a matter <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> controversy among political scientists for several decades. During this same period, other forms of political participation have also declined, such as voluntary participation in political parties and the attendance of observers at town meetings. The decline in voting has also accompanied a general decline in civic participation, such as church attendance, membership in professional, fraternal, and student societies, youth groups, and parent-teacher associations. At the same time, some forms of participation have increased. People have become {{far more likely to}} participate in boycotts, demonstrations, and to donate to political campaigns.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 the Soviet Union {{revealed}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 at the Domodedovo airfield near Moscow. The MiG-25 {{was designed as}} a high-speed, high-altitude interceptor aircraft and made many performance tradeoffs to excel in this role. Among these was the requirement for very high speed, over Mach 2.8, which demanded the use of stainless steel instead of aluminum in many locations on the aircraft. The added weight demanded a much larger wing to allow the aircraft to operate at the required high altitudes. However, to observers, it appeared outwardly similar to the very large F-X studies: an aircraft with high speed and a large wing offering high maneuverability, leading to serious concerns throughout the Department of Defense and the various arms that the US was being outclassed. The MiG-23 was likewise a subject <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> <b>and</b> it was generally believed to be a better aircraft than the F-4. The F-X would outclass the MiG-23, but now it appeared that that MiG-25 would be superior in speed, ceiling and endurance to all existing US fighters, even the F-X. Thus, an effort to improve the F-X followed.|$|E

40|$|Until lately {{decisions}} were regularly modelled {{as a part}} of the process model, negatively affecting the maintainability, comprehensibility and flexibility of processes as well as decisions. The recent establishment of the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard provides an opportunity for shifting in favour of a separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> between the decision and process model. However, this challenge <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> subsequently consistent integration has received limited attention. This work discusses difficulties and challenges in separating the <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> then integrating the two models. The most challenging scenario is when integrating decision models which entail the process holistically, rather than merely focusing the decisions on local decision points.

500|$|Silver coins {{continued}} to flow {{out of the}} U.S. in 1852, and the three-cent silver saw its highest mintage, 18,663,500, all from Philadelphia. The value of these pieces was larger than that of all other silver coins struck by the mints in 1852. The chaotic state of commerce, with no circulating federal coin valued between the three-cent piece and gold dollar, was a source <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> <b>and</b> mint officials and congressmen corresponded in 1852 concerning a reduction in weight of silver coins such as the half dime and half dollar. Congress at last responded by laws passed on February 21, 1853 and March 3, 1853. [...] These reduced the weight of all silver coins except for the silver dollar. [...] The three-cent piece had its weight reduced from [...]8 grams to [...]75, but its fineness increased to [...]900. Although the other reduced-weight silver coins were given legal tender limits of five dollars, that of the three-cent piece remained at thirty cents. [...] Carothers theorized, [...] "Congress, probably realizing that the 3 cent piece was a misfit at best, preferred to leave it with a discordant legal tender value". Pursuant to these congressional acts, mintage of the type 1 three-cent silver stopped on March 31, 1853. These changes to the silver coinage alleviated the problem of small change, as the new lightweight coins remained in circulation and were not then hoarded.|$|E
500|$|As Baalham {{made his}} inspection, others {{observed}} {{the extent of}} the damage, and a mood <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> anxiety began to develop as news spread. With the ship's four pumps working at full capacity, Luce attempted to stanch the leak by passing a large canvas sail over the ship's bow. [...] This, he hoped, could be fastened over the holes in the hull to lessen the inflow of water, but the jagged iron debris protruding from the hull quickly tore the sail apart. The ship's carpenter tried to stuff the breaches with mattresses and other materials, but the holes were by then too far below the waterline to be reached. Realizing that his ship was in serious danger of sinking, Luce decided to run for the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety while Arctic was still afloat; Cape Race was about four hours distant, if the ship could be kept moving. This decision meant abandoning Vesta, but Luce rationalized that the French vessel was likely to sink at any moment, and that remaining with her might well condemn his own passengers and crew to the same fate. After vainly attempting to signal his intention to Gourlay and his crew, who were being left to fend for themselves, Luce ordered full speed ahead. [...] A few minutes later, Arctic ploughed into a lifeboat that had been launched from Vesta. All but one of its dozen occupants were killed, mostly crushed under Arctics paddle wheels. [...] The single survivor was a fisherman, François Jassonet, who jumped clear and was hauled aboard Arctic by a rope.|$|E
