50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>leaks</b> in an {{air cooled}} system were fire hazards, as well as health safety hazards because when <b>oil</b> <b>leaks</b> onto the hot metal {{surfaces}} of the engine it creates smoke and could ignite causing severe damage to the automobile, and its occupants. Also, because of the burnt layer of oil, cooling would be drastically decreased. Kettering understood these concerns and continued to work on ways that would minimize {{the possibility of an}} <b>oil</b> <b>leak</b> on the hot cylinders. He found that the best solution was to have only one possible leak site above the cylinder heads. That is the joint between the crankcase and the cylinder. This left almost no oil above the cylinders, and only one possible place for a leak to spring. This significantly reduced the risk of an <b>oil</b> <b>leak,</b> as well as allowing automobile technicians to locate the possible <b>oil</b> <b>leak</b> much more efficiently.|$|R
