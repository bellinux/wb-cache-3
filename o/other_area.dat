50|$|The valley {{differs from}} <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> in Illawarra, as the {{escarpment}} heads inland forms several hills along with it, thus creating the {{area known as}} the Macquarie Valley. The area also experiences a greater range of temperature forecasts compared to <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> in Illawarra. The Macquarie Valley has had the Illawarra's hottest and coldest temperatures recorded and also experiences significant rainfall each year. It is also less populated compared to <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> in the LGA and Illawarra, with only roughly 20,000 {{people living in the}} valley, as compared to <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> in Shellharbour LGA.|$|R
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. It {{gradually}} decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290miles (490km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200miles (320km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the <b>other</b> <b>area</b> initially remained broad and ill-defined. However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220miles (355km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was {{dissolved}} and the Air Board again assumed {{full control}} of all its operational formations. Nos.1 and 2(Training) Groups, and No.5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded between January and March 1946. Northern Command, having been re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The <b>other</b> <b>area</b> commands continued to function with essentially the same boundaries as during the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{events in}} Spokane include the Spokane Interstate Fair, Lilac City Comicon, Japan Week, and the Spokane Pride Parade. The Spokane Interstate Fair is held {{annually}} in September at the Spokane Fair and Expo Center. Japan Week {{is held in}} April and celebrates the sister-city relationship with Nishinomiya, Hyogo, demonstrating the many commonalities shared between the two cities. Students from the Spokane campus of Mukogawa Fort Wright Institute, Gonzaga, Whitworth, and <b>other</b> <b>area</b> schools organize an array of Japanese cultural events. The gay and lesbian Spokane Pride Parade is held each June. There is an annual Renaissance fair and Civil War reenactment as well.|$|E

They continue this task today along with arranging public services (toilets, buses, security, medics) and scheduling live music and family-oriented games and contests. The event is still known to most as a festival oriented towards modern hippies. It now boasts an annual attendance in the thousands.|$|E
5|$|Litorea aurea {{is equally}} and most {{closely related to}} Li. castanes and L. ranaformis. A microcomplement {{fixation}} technique using serum albumins has indicated the species closest to L. aurea is L. ranifomis. Albumin immunological distance data suggest no differentiation between the two, and the green and golden bell frog evolutionally separated from the other two species about 1.1 million years ago. A 1995 study of protein variations showed four of 19 protein systems had variation and only two had differentiation. Scientists believe the different species can still hybridise, as their distribution areas still overlap, and both L. raniformis and L. aurea have been seen sharing ponds in the Gippsland area of Victoria. However, little evidence of hybridisation actually occurring has been found. Although {{there have been reports}} of frogs of mixed appearance in Gippsland, analysis of proteins and sera of the frogs showed two distinct species. Samples in <b>other</b> <b>area</b> of distribution have shown no evidence of hybridisation in spite of cohabitation.|$|E

2500|$|A not-so-stubby area (NSSA) {{is a type}} of stub {{area that}} can import {{autonomous}} system external routes and send them to <b>other</b> <b>areas,</b> but still cannot receive AS-external routes from <b>other</b> <b>areas.</b> NSSA is an extension of the stub area feature that allows the injection of external routes in a limited fashion into the stub area. A case study simulates an NSSA getting around the Stub Area problem {{of not being able to}} import external addresses. It visualizes the following activities: the ASBR imports external addresses with a type 7 LSA, the ABR converts a type 7 LSA to type 5 and floods it to <b>other</b> <b>areas,</b> the ABR acts as an [...] "ASBR" [...] for <b>other</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
