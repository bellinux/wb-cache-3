30|$|For EC, the {{threshold}} limit of 3 Â dS/m is selected because according to TableÂ  1, for EC above 3 Â dS/m, there is severe restriction <b>on</b> <b>use</b> {{of water for}} irrigation while for EC values below 3 Â dS/m, there is no (where EC is below 0.7 Â dS/m) and a slight to moderate restriction <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> SAR of irrigation water {{except for a few}} locations is below 6, so under this situation according to Ayers and Westcot (1994) if EC is below 0.3 Â dS/m, there is a severe restriction <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> As EC of groundwater is above 0.5 Â dS/m, there is no severe restriction <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> Also for SAR between 0 and 3, in about 90 Â % of study area, EC of groundwater is above 0.7 Â dS/m and therefore there is no restriction <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> For SAR between 3 and 6, where EC is above 1.2 Â dS/m, there is no restriction and where EC is between 0.3 and 1.2 Â dS/m, there is a slight to moderate restriction <b>on</b> <b>use</b> (Ayers and Westcot 1994). Therefore, we used a threshold limit of 3 for SAR. For both Na+ and Clâˆ’, a critical limit of 3 Â meq/L is considered for producing probability maps. According to Ayers and Westcot (1994) there is a slight to moderate restriction <b>on</b> <b>use</b> of irrigation water with Na+ and Clâˆ’ above 3 Â meq/L for sprinkler irrigation.
