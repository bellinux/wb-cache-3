5|$|The first {{railroad}} station in Erie {{was established in}} 1851 but was replaced with the Romanesque Revival-style Union Depot in 1866. Through a series <b>of</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions by competing railroad companies which started {{not long after the}} establishment of Erie's first railroads, Union Depot became jointly owned and operated by the New York Central and Pennsylvania railroads. To meet the changing needs of the rapidly growing city, planners designed a more modern structure to replace the original depot. The new Art Deco Union Station, dedicated on December3, 1927, was the first {{railroad station}} of that style in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> municipalities on the social welfare administration (hereafter SWA) through simulations of city models. In these models we use the general tendencies of relation between city size and SWA in view of costs/services/efficiency, based on recent Japanese data. The main results are as follows. (1) The effects <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> municipalities on the costs of SWA are plus in all models with just population as an explanatory variable, and are plus in almost all models with population and area as explanatory variables. (2) The effects <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> municipalities on the services of SWA are minus in almost models in the services for the aged, while are plus in all models in the services for the children. (3) The effects <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> municipalities on the efficiency of SWA are plus in all models of both of the aged and the children. (4) In all models, the smaller the municipality is, the larger the effects <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> municipalities on SWA are. (5) When we consider the <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> municipalities in resent Japan from point of SWA, it is important to stimulate the <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> small municipalities, especially smaller ones with fewer inhabitants than ten thousand...|$|R

In the neighborhood of free trade, for sufficiently low cost savings from merger, trade liberalization increases the desirability <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> whilst decreasing the profitability, implying that mergers should be actively encouraged by competition authorities.

Instrument analysis that used for knowing the influence between US Dollar value, mounth rate of interest of SBI and gold price toward price index <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> share is multiple regression analysis. For knowing what each independent variable influence dependent variable used partial test (T test) and for knowing the influence of whole independent variable together used F test (F test) while to know how big the contribution from independent variable toward fluctuation of dependent variable together used R test. Hypothesis test result show that in partially (T test) US Dollar kurs variable (X 1) in 5 % significance level is significance influencial toward price index <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> share because t account value > t table (2, 457 > 2, 037), SBI interest rate variable (X 2) in a same significance level is significance influencial toward price index <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> share because t account value > t table (4, 928 > 2, 037) and gold price (X 3) is significance influencial toward price index <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> share because t account > t table (2, 556 > 2, 037) while together (F test) US Dollar value variable (X 1), mounth rate of interest of SBI (X 2) and gold price (X 3) together influence price index <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> share because F account > F table (30, 902 > 2, 92).
