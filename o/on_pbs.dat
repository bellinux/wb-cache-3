40|$|Human {{influenza}} pandemics {{have historically}} been caused by reassortant influenza A viruses using genes from human and avian viruses. This genetic reassortment between human and avian viruses {{has been known to}} occur in swine during viral circulation, as swine are capable of circulating both avian and human viruses. Therefore, avian-to-swine transmission of viruses {{plays an important role in}} the emergence of new pandemic strains. The amino acids at several positions <b>on</b> <b>PB</b> 2, PB 1, and PA are known to determine the host range of influenza A viruses. In this paper, we track viral transmission between avian and swine to investigate the evolution on polymerase genes associated with their hosts. We traced viral transmissions between avian and swine hosts by using nucleotide sequences of avian viruses and swine viruses registered in the NCBI GenBank. Using BLAST and the reciprocal best hits technique, we found 32, 33, and 30 pairs of avian and swine nucleotide sequences that may be associated with avian-to-swine transmissions for PB 2, PB 1, and PA genes, respectively. Then, we examined the amino acid substitutions involved in these sporadic transmissions. On average, avian-to-swine transmission pairs had 5. 47, 3. 73, and 5. 13 amino acid substitutions <b>on</b> <b>PB</b> 2, PB 1, and PA, respectively. However, amino acid substitutions were distributed over the positions, and few positions showed common substitutions in the multiple transmission events. Statistical tests on the number of repeated amino acid substitutions suggested that no specific positions <b>on</b> <b>PB</b> 2 and PA may be required for avian viruses to infect swine. We also found that avian viruses that transmitted to swine tend to process I 478 V substitutions <b>on</b> <b>PB</b> 2 before interspecies transmission events. Furthermore, most mutations occurred after the interspecies transmissions, possibly due to selective viral adaptation to swine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of Zn <b>on</b> <b>Pb</b> toxicities. Proportion of abnormal sperm, percentage of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte (MPCE), serum thyroid hormones (T 3, T 4) and cortisol were measured. Rats received intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg Pb acetate, 4 mg/kg Zn acetate, both Pb acetate and Zn acetate, or normal saline as controls, once every two days, 7 times in total. No significant differences in whole blood Pb were detected between groups received Pb alone or both <b>Pb</b> and Zn. <b>On</b> the contrary, the concentration of whole blood Zn in the group given Zn alone {{was significantly higher than}} that in the group that received both Pb and Zn. In the groups given Pb alone or both Pb and Zn, proportion of abnormal sperm, frequency of MPCE and serum cortisol were significantly higher than those in controls, whereas serum T 3 and T 4 were significantly lower than in controls. In the group given both Pb and Zn, T 4 was decreased most obviously among the four groups. While the proportion of abnormal sperm was less in the group given both Pb and Zn than in the group given Pb alone. These findings suggest that Zn coadministration might alleviate toxic effects of <b>Pb</b> <b>on</b> the male reproductive system, whereas it could enhance the toxicity on thyroid function. Zn did not affect the toxicities of <b>Pb</b> <b>on</b> cytogenetic systems as indicated by MPCE percentage, and on serum cortisol levels under the dose of the present study. Our results suggested the double-edged effects of Zn <b>on</b> <b>Pb</b> toxicities in different organs.

Moreover, the effect of a new series of organic amines as suppressants of Pb corrosion in 0.3  M HCl solution was studied by Badawy et al. [12]. The used inhibitors were pyrazole derivatives, such as 3 (5) amino, 5 (3) phenyl pyrazole (PP), 3 (5) amino, 5 (3)[4 -methyl phenyl] pyrazole (MePP), 3 (5)amino, 5 (3)[4 -methoxy phenyl] pyrazole (MeOPP) and 3 (5)amino, 5 (3)[4 -chloro phenyl] pyrazole (CIPP). At the same concentration, the inhibition efficiency increases in the following order: MeOPP (20 %)[*]<[*]CIPP (36.52)[*]<[*]PP (58.26 %)[*]<[*]MePP (70 %).
