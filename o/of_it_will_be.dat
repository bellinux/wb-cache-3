This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation. An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time (called acquiescence). The owner can always reserve the right to take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner 'must' have been aware <b>of.</b> <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> for the third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights. In the US, owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights, trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press. Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application.|$|E

Hou also noted feminist influences in the scent with usual additions of orchid and masculine notes of autumn woods, cashmere, musk, and vetiver extract. She concluded her review by stating [...] "Maya Angelou-reading perfume sounds (and will surely smell) pretty good".

Dominique Leone wrote a 9.4 review of its 40th Anniversary edition for Pitchfork stating: [...] "Certainly, regardless of what I write here, the impact and 'influence' of the record will have been in turn hardly influenced at all. I can't even get my dad to talk about Pet Sounds anymore.... The hymnal aspect {{of many of these}} songs seems no less pronounced, and the general air of deeply heartfelt love, graciousness and the uncertainty that any <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> returned are still affecting to the point of distraction." [...] Music journalist Robert Christgau felt that Pet Sounds was a good record, but believed it had become looked upon as a [...] Composer Atticus Ross explains that the album has [...] "an element of cliché that's grown around it". He references a sketch from the television show Portlandia in which [...] "your classic hipster musicians... are building a studio and everything is like 'this is the mike they used in Pet Sounds.' This is exactly the same as Pet Sounds.'" [...] Commentator C.W. Maloney mused: [...] "The songs on Pet Sounds are great, but you have to wonder, given all the hype and mythology and our love of shallow nostalgia, what we mean when we call it a classic or Wilson a genius.

2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
