50|$|The German sixth (Gr+6 or Ger) is {{also like}} the Italian, but with an added tone 3: 6-1-3-4; A-C-E-F in C major and C minor. In Classical music, however, it appears {{in much the same}} places as the other variants, though perhaps less used because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contrapuntal <b>difficulties</b> {{outlined}} <b>below.</b> It appears frequently in <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> Beethoven, and in ragtime music. The German sixth chord contains the same notes or is enharmonic to a dominant seventh chord (enharmonically 4 is 5), though it functions differently.|$|R
