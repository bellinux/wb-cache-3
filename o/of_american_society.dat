Fulbright and other senators urged the White House {{to listen to his}} criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>society</b> and militarism was seen as more extreme than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E

25|$|These {{professionals}} typically conceptualize, create, consult, and supervise. As a result, {{upper middle}} class employees enjoy great autonomy {{in the work place}} and are more satisfied with their careers than non-professional middle class individuals. In terms of financial wealth income, the professional middle class fits in the top third, but seldom reach the top 5% <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>society.</b> According to sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, Joseph Hickey, and William Thompson, the {{upper middle class}} constitutes 15% of the population.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the Technical Assistance Program were not limited to {{improvements}} in productive efficiency. While the thousands of European leaders took their work/study trips to the United States, {{they were able to}} observe a number of aspects <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>society</b> as well. The Europeans could watch local, state, and federal governments work together with citizens in a pluralist society. They observed a democratic society with open universities and civic societies in addition to more advanced factories and manufacturing plants. The Technical Assistance Program allowed Europeans to bring home many types of American ideas.|$|E
25|$|Income {{and wealth}} {{statistics}} {{may serve as}} a helpful guideline as they can be measured in a more objective manner. In 2005, approximately one and a half percent (1.5%) of households in the United States had incomes exceeding $250,000 with the top 5% having incomes exceeding $157,000. Furthermore, only 2.6% of households held assets (excluding home equity) of more than one-million dollars. One could therefore fall under the assumption that less than five percent <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>society</b> are members of rich households. The richest 1% of the American population owns as much as the combined wealth of the bottom 90%, or perhaps even more.|$|E
