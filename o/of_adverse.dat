5|$|Argentina {{fell into}} a deep {{recession}} {{in the second half of}} 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E
5|$|In the {{treatment}} of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.|$|E
5|$|Over 50 {{temporary}} shelters {{were made}} available in flood-prone areas across various municipalities in Veracruz. Authorities in Tamaulipas prepared five shelters and mobilized of 10emergency teams to evacuate up to 20,000 people in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> weather conditions.

5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a {{potentially}} lethal condition {{commonly associated with}} clindamycin, but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well. Overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results {{in the production of}} a toxin that causes a range <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon.|$|E
5|$|Teenage pregnancies, {{especially}} among younger teens, are {{at greater risk}} <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> outcomes including early birth, low birth weight, and death of the infant.

Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett, King's Sedgemoor Drain, and River Brue systems, to try to ensure that the agricultural land benefited from a potable water supply in the groundwaters from the Quantock Hills to the coastline.|$|E

5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than systemic medication, with topical corticosteroids being the mainstay treatment. Systemic treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due to the risk <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention {{was found to be}} effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E
5|$|These {{polycyclic}} hydrocarbons also {{activate the}} AH receptor, {{but less than}} TCDD and only temporarily. Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor.

Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked to a number <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence {{is as high as}} 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
5|$|Bockscar {{had been}} flown by Sweeney and crew C-15 in three test drop rehearsals of inert Fat Man {{assemblies}} {{in the eight}} {{days leading up to}} the second mission, including the final rehearsal the day before. The Great Artiste, which was the assigned aircraft of the crew with whom Sweeney most often flew, had been designated in preliminary planning to drop the second bomb, but the aircraft had been fitted with observation instruments for the Hiroshima mission. Moving the instrumentation from The Great Artiste to Bockscar would have been a complex and time-consuming process, and when the second atomic bomb mission was moved up from 11 August to 9 August because <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> weather forecasts, the crews of The Great Artiste and Bockscar instead exchanged aircraft. The result was that the bomb was carried by Bockscar, but flown by the crew C-15 of The Great Artiste.|$|E

To his great surprise he met his friend in Castlebay again, who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they had last met because <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> sea conditions. Similar difficulties experienced by visiting priests or doctors bound for Mingulay were a constant source of concern to the islanders.|$|E

Aimed at increasing awareness, sharing information and co-ordinating responses to reduce the health effects of heat on vulnerable populations, the action plan is the first comprehensive plan in Asia to address the threat <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> heat on health. It also focuses on community participation, building public awareness of the risks of extreme heat, training medical and community workers to respond to and help prevent heat-related illnesses, and co-ordinating an interagency emergency response effort when heat waves hit.|$|E

5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues <b>of</b> <b>adverse</b> effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
