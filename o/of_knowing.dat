5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success of these drugs is proof of the importance <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> how viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|Orlando's father {{comes forward}} {{with a piece of}} evidence—his mailbox had been stuffed with {{shredded}} banknotes. That evening, Black and Gerlach visit a town meeting organised by Edward Petey (Josh Clark), where another of the residents, Bob Birckenbuehl (Terry David Mulligan), accuses Gerlach <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> more than he is letting on. Gerlach tells the assembly that the killer is from the community.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, with the goal <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how {{to try to get}} to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E

60|$|The {{transcendental}} philosopher {{does not}} inquire, what ultimate ground {{of our knowledge}} there may lie out <b>of</b> our <b>knowing,</b> {{but what is the}} last in our knowing itself, beyond which we cannot pass. The principle <b>of</b> our <b>knowing</b> is sought within the sphere <b>of</b> our <b>knowing.</b> It must be some thing therefore, which can itself be known. It is asserted only, that the act of self-consciousness is for us the source and principle of all our possible knowledge. Whether abstracted from us there exists any thing higher and beyond this primary self-knowing, which is for us the form <b>of</b> all our <b>knowing</b> must be decided by the result.|$|R
50|$|Procedural {{architecture}} {{is defined in}} Architectural Body (2002). Understanding procedural {{architecture is}} clarified by the notion <b>of</b> procedural <b>knowing,</b> i.e. the reduction of steps necessary to complete a routine, and making those steps a subroutine of that procedure. Walking, talking, and eating are examples <b>of</b> procedural <b>knowing.</b>|$|R
5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|After several {{seasons of}} {{struggling}} for runs, Kippax returned {{to form in}} 193334. Against Queensland at New Year, he hit 125 and shared a stand of 363 in only 135minutes with Bradman. Altogether, he made four centuries and averaged almost 72 to earn selection for the 1934 tour of England. Passed over for the vice-captaincy of the team in favour of Bradman, Kippax had the confidence <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> that the Australian Board of Control had reached {{an agreement with the}} MCC that the Australians would not have to face Bodyline during the tour.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

However, Padayappa saves her life when he {{prevents}} a bull from attacking her, {{while at the same}} time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was a result of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|En Liten Hushålls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances about the importance <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> household skills, and that girls {{should be allowed to}} partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that she should be accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E

5|$|In August 1970, Les Solomon, {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} were on vacation in the southwest and arranged to visit Mims, Roberts and their families. At that time, Dan Meyer and Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in Popular Electronics. Meyer had built a million dollar a year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts wanted to do the same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business. Solomon gave them some statistics but said there was no way <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> how many kits an article would sell, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He {{developed}} dementia, {{and became}} completely blind and increasingly deaf. He was incapable <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> or understanding either {{that he was}} declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, {{and for the last}} few weeks of his life was unable to walk. He died at Windsor Castle at 8:38pm on 29 January 1820, six days {{after the death of his}} fourth son, the Duke of Kent. His favourite son, Frederick, Duke of York, was with him. George III was buried on 16 February in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{and critics}} have also often {{associated}} {{the production of}} recent all-female metal acts to the sound and music of Girlschool, identifying them as a band that, just like The Runaways before them, helped in paving {{the way to the}} presence of women in rock music. However, Williams remembered in 2004 how, in her experience, Girlschool were more inspirational for young male musicians than for female ones in starting rock bands. Moreover, important female metal bands of the 2000s, such as Crucified Barbara and Drain STH, denied even <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> the music of Girlschool. Only the American all-female rock band The Donnas publicly acknowledged the influence of Girlschool on their music.|$|E

5|$|When Kukunoor was {{thinking}} of a character full of disguises, he first {{came up with an}} old man. When the thought of a scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would have no way <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He had no way <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was {{to strike a balance}} and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; {{but on the other hand}} he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E

5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means <b>of</b> <b>knowing.</b> Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|Helena, knowing Ruiz is soon {{scheduled}} to testify, makes {{a deal with}} Juan Obregón (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over his partner's death. During a phone conversation between Ayala and Metzger, Ayala deduces that it was Metzger who originally informed on Ruiz. Evidently in a bid for power with another drug cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala organization's downfall. Ayala says that Metzger was planning on taking over Ayala's empire completely. As Ayala hangs up the phone, Metzger {{looks up to see}} two hit men entering his office. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration. Bodyguards wrestle him to the ground, but Gordon is able to surreptitiously plant a listening bug under Ayala's desk. Gordon is forced from the property, with the satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> that there is now a new opportunity to trap Ayala.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British had no way <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
