40|$|Related to {{conventional}} carbon nanotubes in both shape and construction, fullerene nanowhiskers and fullerene nanotubes have received far less attention. The terms “fullerene nanowhisker ” and “fullerene nanotube ” refer to closely related cylindrical and tube-like structures, respectively. Thus, fullerene nanowhiskers are solid, cylindrical, single crystal structures with sub-micron <b>outside</b> <b>diameters</b> and varying lengths while fullerene nanotubes are hollow, tubular, single crystal structures, also with sub-micron <b>outside</b> <b>diameters</b> and varying lengths. Fullerene nanowhiskers {{were discovered in}} 2001 by Kun’ichi Miyazawa during the preparation of a sol-gel. 1 Following {{the addition of a}} toluene solution of [60]fullerene to a sol that contained isopropanol, thin fibrous structures were observed to grow and were named C 60 nanowhiskers. A liquid-liquid interfacial precipitation technique was subsequently developed 2 in which isopropanol was layered atop a saturated solution of [60]fullerene in toluene. In the same year, Zhu and co-workers reported a method to prepare the first [60]fullerene nanotubes using a porous alumina template. 3 The [60]fullerene nanotubes grown on an alumina template possessed <b>outside</b> <b>diameters</b> of 220 - 330 nm and a length of approximately 60 m.

25|$|Tank {{introduced}} a further refinement to this basic concept. He suggested placing {{most of the}} airflow components on the propeller, {{in the form of}} a oversized propeller spinner whose <b>outside</b> <b>diameter</b> was the same as the engine. The cowl around the engine proper was greatly simplified, essentially a basic cylinder. Air entered through a small hole at the centre of the spinner, and was directed through ductwork in the spinner so it was blowing rearward along the cylinder heads. To provide enough airflow, an internal cone was placed in the centre of the hole, over the propeller hub, which was intended to compress the airflow and allow a smaller opening to be used. In theory, the tight-fitting cowling also provided some thrust due to the compression and heating of air as it flowed through the cowling.|$|E
25|$|Lorica hamata was {{a type of}} mail armour {{used during}} the Roman Republic {{continuing}} throughout the Roman Empire as a standard-issue armour for the primary heavy infantry legionaries and secondary troops (auxilia). They were mostly manufactured out of iron, though sometimes bronze was used instead. The rings were linked together, alternating closed washer-like rings with riveted rings. This produced a very flexible, reliable and strong armour. Each ring had an inside diameter of between 5 and 7mm, and an <b>outside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 7 to 9mm. The shoulders of the lorica hamata had flaps that {{were similar to those}} of the Greek linothorax; they ran from about mid-back to the front of the torso, and were connected by brass or iron hooks which connected to studs riveted through the ends of the flaps. Several thousand rings would have gone into one lorica hamata.|$|E

50|$|Innerducts are {{typically}} small-diameter, semi-flexible subducts. According to Telcordia GR-356, {{there are three}} basic types of innerduct: smoothwall, corrugated, and ribbed. These various designs {{are based on the}} profile of the inside and <b>outside</b> <b>diameters</b> of the innerduct. The need for a specific characteristic or combination of characteristics, such as pulling strength, flexibility, or the lowest coefficient of friction, dictates the type of innerduct required.|$|R
25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the <b>outside</b> <b>diameter</b> (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E
25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an <b>outside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E
