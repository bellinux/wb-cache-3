5|$|The {{involvement}} of Dante and Petrarch {{in establishing the}} sestina form, together with the contributions {{of others in the}} country, account for its classification as an Italian verse form—despite not originating there. The result was that the sestina was re-imported into France from Italy in the 16th century. Pontus de Tyard was the first poet to attempt the form in French, and the only <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so prior to the 19th century; he introduced a partial rhyme scheme in his sestina.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Link restores the {{crystals}} {{to the six}} palaces, defeating a strong guardian within each <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, and enters the Great Palace. After venturing deep inside, Link must battle a flying creature known as Thunderbird, followed by a shadowy doppelgänger of himself known as Dark Link. Link then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda. The three triangles unite into the collective Triforce, and Link's wish awakens Zelda. The game ends as they (presumably) kiss under a falling curtain.|$|E

40|$|According to John Broome, akrasia {{consists}} in a failure <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that <b>one</b> believes <b>one</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and such akrasia is necessarily irrational. In fact, however, failing to intend something that one believes <b>one</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is only {{guaranteed to be}} irrational if one is certain of a maximally detailed proposition about what <b>one</b> ought <b>to</b> do; if <b>one</b> is uncertain about {{any part of the}} full story about what <b>one</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> it could be perfectly rational not <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that <b>one</b> believes <b>one</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> This paper seeks to remedy this problem, by proposing an anti-akrasia principle that covers cases of uncertainty (as well as cases of such complete certainty). It is argued that this principle is in effect the fundamental principle of practical rationality...|$|R

5|$|Grove took {{advantage}} of his place in Chicago's starting rotation by winning nine consecutive decisions to start his season and by not losing a game until a contest against the Yankees, which he lost {{as the result of}} a balk. At the time, Grove became the second member of the White Sox to win nine consecutive decisions to start a season. The first pitcher to win nine straight games for the team was Lefty Williams in 1917, and the only <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it since Grove was LaMarr Hoyt in 1982. On July 8, 1943, Grove nearly became one of the few pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter. In a game against the Yankees, he was one out away from pitching a no-hitter when Joe Gordon came up to bat. Gordon hit a double to left field that was fair by inches, ending Grove's closest bid for a Major League no-hitter. Grove finished the season with career bests in ERA (2.75), wins (15), and complete games (18). He led the White Sox that season in ERA, wins, innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts; at the time, Grove was the youngest pitcher on the team's staff. Grove's personal life improved along with his career. On January 8, 1944, he married Catherine Sloan, having met her at a party thrown for the White Sox by her father, Francis Sloan, a year and a half earlier.|$|E
5|$|Tom {{is arrested}} {{by the police and}} the guests prepare to leave. Lois goes to comfort Tom's co-anchor, Diane Simmons, only to {{intuitively}} realize she is the true murderer when Diane shows a dress for her solo debut on the news, even though she couldn't have known Tom would be leaving. Diane reveals that she had dated Woods until he dumped her upon her fortieth birthday, around which Tom arranged her to be replaced on the Channel 5 News. Seeking revenge, Diane bribed Priscilla to make James become a born-again Christian and throw the dinner party so she could murder Woods and frame Tom for the crime, but was forced to kill the other guests after her plan went awry upon Stephanie's accidental death. Priscilla woke up when she was removing the knife due to Joe pointing out her fingerprints were on it, so had her throat slit. When Diane was hiding the body in Tom's room, Muriel saw her so was stabbed. The murderess did not have time to conceal the knife, but was able to wipe her fingerprints clean. She killed Derek to stop the police getting involved. Diane then attempts to silence Lois by forcing her outside to a nearby cliff, only to be be shot down herself with a suppressed sniper rifle fired by Stewie, who proclaims if anyone were to kill Lois, he would be the <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.|$|E

25|$|Observe {{that the}} more {{fuel-efficient}} engines can use far less fuel; their mass is almost negligible (relative to {{the mass of the}} payload and the engine itself) for some of the engines.

He achieved this double {{for the first time}} in his third Test against West Indies in 2011 when he made 103 and took 5/156 in the first innings. He repeated the same feat in the Kolkata Test against West Indies in November 2013 where he took 2/52 in the 1st innings and 3/46 in the 2nd innings and scored 124 in India's 1st innings. This feat had only been achieved 26 times previously in world cricket, the last occasion being by Jacques Kallis in 2002. Ashwin also scored a hundred and took nine wickets when India played against West Indies at the Wankhede Stadium in 2011.

500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the episode was a one line concept card stating [...] "Lightning Boy" [...] {{that had been}} tacked to a board in series creator Chris Carter's office since the first season.

Writer Howard Gordon stated that the key moment in the episode's conception came {{when he decided to}} use the boy's power as a metaphor for disenfranchised adolescence. Gordon described the episode's concept as [...] "Beavis and Butt-head electrified". Gordon claimed that the episode suffered conceptually having come directly after a trilogy of mythology episodes. Story editor Frank Spotnitz claims that there were originally ideas on incorporating some of the events from that trilogy into this episode, but those ideas were eventually scrapped due to the producer's desire for each episode {{to be able to have}} its own integrity and stand alone. Spotnitz said the episode was a risky <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for a show with an adult audience due to the high school setting and the fact that the episode was about adolescence and violent impulses when one is a kid.|$|E
