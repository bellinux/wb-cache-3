A total of 13 parasitoid species were reared from 1, 350 larvae predominantly collected from red raspberries in western Oregon. The six most numerous were Apanteles aristoteliae Vier., Meteorus argyrotaenia Johan., Phytodietus vulgaris cress., Oncophanes americanus (Weed), Enytus eureka (Ash.), and Diadegma spp. The rate of parasitism averaged 20 % in two commercial fields which had large larval populations of A. citrana. Conversely, five fields with relatively low density A. citrana populations averaged 66 % apparent parasitism. This suggests that parasitoids may be important in maintaining <b>orange</b> <b>tortrix</b> populations at low levels. Three braconid Redacted for Privac...|$|E

40|$|The {{biological}} control potential of parasitic wasps {{in the field}} is expected to increase with the provisioning of sugar sources, which increase longevity and replenish carbohydrate reserves. Apanteles aristoteliae is an important parasitoid of Argyrotaenia franciscana, the <b>orange</b> <b>tortrix,</b> an economic pest in fruit crops. In the present study, the effect of sugar diet on the physiological status of A. aristoteliae is investigated in the laboratory, as well as the effects of nutritional status on short-term olfactory orientation and parasitism behaviour, and the association between olfactory orientation and immediate parasitism activity. Levels of glycogen, fructose, total sugars, proportional weight gain and volume consumed are higher among females fed 25 % sucrose solution than 10 % sucrose solution, and lowest for those fed water. Sugar feeding also affects behaviour: wasps with higher levels of fructose or weight gain have a lower probability of making a choice in the olfactometer. Wasps with intermediate fructose levels or weight gain have a higher probability of orienting towards hosts than wasps with low or high levels. Among wasps that make a choice in the olfactometer, wasps fed 10 % or 25 % sucrose significantly prefer host versus food cues, whereas starved wasps are just as likely to select food cues as host cues...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Benomyl, a {{systemic}} benzimidazole fungicide {{was incorporated into}} artificial diet and evaluated for its oral toxicity to nonparasitized and parasitized third instar <b>orange</b> <b>tortrix</b> larvae, Argyrotaeniae citrana (Fernald) and its food chain toxicity via the host to the solitary braconid endoparasite Apanteles aristoteliae Vierek. Concentrations of benomyl ≤ 300 ppm were sublethal to nonparasitized hosts. Increasing concentrations of benomyl resulted in significant decreases in the percent of nonparasitized larvae pupating. Parasitized hosts feeding on treated diet containing 300 ppm benomyl or its principal metabolite MBC, after parasitization, had significantly greater (P ≤ 0. 05) percentages of host larvae pupating and surviving to adulthood than controls. This chemotherapeutic effect was equivalent for hosts feeding on 300 ppm benomyl treated diet for only the first 24 hours after parasitization as compared to hosts feeding continuously. Increasing concentrations of benomyl resulted in decreased percentages of parasitized hosts pupating and increased percentages of hosts blocked in their larval development. Comparisons of parasitized and nonparasitized larval mortalities directly due to benomyl indicated that parasitized larvae (LC 50 = 2151 ppm) were less susceptable than nonparasitized larvae (LC 50 = 806 ppm). Parasite emergence from hosts was reduced by all fungicide treatments. However, only when hosts fed on benomyl treated media with concentrations ≥ 300 ppm and after exposure to parasites was parasite emergence significantly reduced (P ≤ 0. 05). The potential uses of benomyl or like substances to study parasite-host relationships and how benomyl may impact on field populations of these insects are discussed...|$|E
