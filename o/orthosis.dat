25|$|Starting {{from this}} principle, the {{development}} of upper-limb non-invasive ambulatory robotic exoskeletons {{is presented as a}} promising solution for patients who cannot benefit from medication to suppress the tremor. In this area robotic exoskeletons have emerged, in the form of orthoses, to provide motor assistance and functional compensation to disabled people. An <b>orthosis</b> is a wearable device that acts in parallel to the affected limb. In the case of tremor management, the <b>orthosis</b> must apply a damping or inertial load to a selected set of limb articulations.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian orthopedist Sydney Haje {{developed}} a non-surgical protocol for treating pectus carinatum {{as well as}} pectus excavatum. The method involves wearing a compressive <b>orthosis</b> and adhering to an exercise protocol.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is more {{beneficial}} {{in the short}} term to alleviate symptoms (up to six months) than wearing an <b>orthosis</b> for a minimum of 6 weeks. However, surgery and wearing a brace resulted in similar symptom relief in the long term (12–18 month outcomes).|$|E
25|$|It {{is used as}} a film {{interface}} patch {{for sports}} and medical applications, featuring a pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, which is installed in strategic high friction areas of footwear, insoles, ankle-foot <b>orthosis,</b> and other medical devices to prevent and relieve friction-induced blisters, calluses and foot ulceration.|$|E
25|$|Most hip {{fractures}} {{are treated}} surgically by implanting an <b>orthosis.</b> Surgical treatment outweighs {{the risks of}} nonsurgical treatment which requires extensive bedrest. Prolonged immobilization increases risk of thromboembolism, pneumonia, deconditioning, and decubitus ulcers. Regardless, the surgery is a major stress, particularly in the elderly. Pain is also significant, and can also result in immobilization, so patients are encouraged to become mobile as soon as possible, often {{with the assistance of}} physical therapy. Skeletal traction pending surgery is not supported by the evidence. Regional nerve blocks are useful for pain management in hip fractures.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there is}} no cure for muscular dystrophy. In terms of management, {{physical}} therapy, occupational therapy, orthotic intervention (e.g., ankle-foot <b>orthosis),</b> speech therapy, and respiratory therapy may be helpful. Low intensity corticosteroids such as prednisone, and deflazacort may help to maintain muscle tone. Orthoses (orthopedic appliances used for support) and corrective orthopedic surgery may be needed {{to improve the quality of}} life in some cases. The cardiac problems that occur with EDMD and myotonic muscular dystrophy may require a pacemaker. The myotonia (delayed relaxation of a muscle after a strong contraction) occurring in myotonic muscular dystrophy may be treated with medications such as quinine.|$|E
25|$|Since bone {{healing is}} a natural process that will occur most often, {{fracture}} treatment aims to ensure the best possible function of the injured part after healing. Bone fractures typically are treated by restoring the fractured pieces of bone to their natural positions (if necessary), and maintaining those positions while the bone heals. Often, aligning the bone, called reduction, in good position and verifying the improved alignment with an X-ray {{is all that is}} needed. This process is extremely painful without anesthesia, about as painful as breaking the bone itself. To this end, a fractured limb usually is immobilized with a plaster or fiberglass cast or splint that holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture. When the initial post-fracture edema or swelling goes down, the fracture may be placed in a removable brace or <b>orthosis.</b> If being treated with surgery, surgical nails, screws, plates, and wires are used to hold the fractured bone together more directly. Alternatively, fractured bones may be treated by the Ilizarov method which is a form of external fixator.|$|E
25|$|Treadmill {{training}} (more {{commonly known}} as body weight supported treadmill training) can be applied via manual (therapist) or robotic assistance. In manual treadmill training the therapists provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and foot, and a third therapist controlling the treadmill settings. In robotic-assisted treadmill training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait <b>orthosis</b> that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over a treadmill. In addition to a belt driven treadmill and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and knee joints) and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight unloading mechanism. Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work {{in conjunction with a}} treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted treadmill training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training.|$|E
2500|$|There is also {{adaptation}} {{associated with}} use of a prosthesis or an <b>orthosis.</b> [...] This operates similarly to adaptation due to fatigue; however, muscles can actually be fatigued or alter their mechanical contribution to a motor task {{as a result of}} wearing the <b>orthosis.</b> [...] An ankle foot <b>orthosis</b> is a common solution to injury of the lower limb, specifically around the ankle joint. [...] An ankle foot <b>orthosis</b> can be assistive or resistive. [...] An assistive ankle <b>orthosis</b> encourages ankle movement, and a resistive ankle <b>orthosis</b> inhibits ankle movement. [...] Upon wearing an assistive ankle foot <b>orthosis,</b> individuals have decreased EMG amplitude and joint stiffness over time while the opposite occurs for resistive ankle foot orthoses. [...] Additionally, not only can electromyography readings differ, but the physical path that joints travel along can be altered as well.|$|E
2500|$|Prostheses are {{specifically}} not orthoses, although given certain circumstances a prosthesis {{might end up}} performing {{some or all of}} the same functionary benefits as an <b>orthosis.</b> [...] Prostheses are technically the complete finished item. [...] For instance, a C-Leg knee alone is not a prosthesis, but only a prosthetic component. The complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system to the residual limb — usually a [...] "socket", and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device. Keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged.|$|E
2500|$|Non-invasive BCIs {{have also}} been applied to enable brain-control of {{prosthetic}} upper and lower extremity devices in people with paralysis. For example, Gert Pfurtscheller of Graz University of Technology and colleagues demonstrated a BCI-controlled functional electrical stimulation system to restore upper extremity movements in a person with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury. Between 2012 and 2013, researchers at the University of California, Irvine demonstrated {{for the first time}} that it is possible to use BCI technology to restore brain-controlled walking after spinal cord injury. In their spinal cord injury research study, a person with paraplegia was able to operate a BCI-robotic gait <b>orthosis</b> to regain basic brain-controlled ambulation.|$|E
2500|$|Pain {{is common}} and {{may result from}} the {{inherent}} deficits associated with the condition, along with the numerous procedures children typically face. Pain is associated with tight or shortened muscles, abnormal posture, stiff joints, unsuitable <b>orthosis,</b> etc. There is also a high likelihood of chronic sleep disorders secondary to both physical and environmental factors. [...] Children with cerebral palsy have significantly higher rates of sleep disturbance than typically developing children. [...] Babies with cerebral palsy who have stiffness issues might cry more and be harder to put to sleep than non-disabled babies, or [...] "floppy" [...] babies might be lethargic. [...] Chronic pain is under-recognized in children with cerebral palsy, even though 3 out of 4 children with cerebral palsy experience pain.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment has {{historically}} centered on removing mechanical {{pressure from the}} joint until the disease has run its course. Options include traction (to separate the femur from the pelvis and reduce wear), braces (often for several months, {{with an average of}} 18 months) to restore range of motion, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention when necessary because of permanent joint damage. To maintain activities of daily living, custom orthotics may be used. [...] Overnight traction may be used in lieu of walking devices or in combination. [...] These devices internally rotate the femoral head and abduct the leg(s) at 45°. [...] Orthoses can start as proximal as the lumbar spine, and extend the length of the limbs to the floor. [...] Most functional bracing is achieved using a waist belt and thigh cuffs derived from the Scottish-Rite <b>orthosis.</b> These devices are typically prescribed by a physician and implemented by an orthotist. Clinical results of the Scottish Rite <b>orthosis</b> have not been good according to some studies, and its use has gone out of favor. Many children, especially those with the onset of the disease before age 6, need no intervention at all and are simply asked to refrain from contact sports or games which impact the hip. [...] For older children (onset of Perthes after age 6), the best treatment option remains unclear. Current treatment options for older children over age 8 include prolonged periods without weight bearing, osteotomy (femoral, pelvic, or shelf), and the hip distraction method using an external fixator which relieves the hip from carrying the body's weight. [...] This allows room for the top of the femur to regrow. The Perthes Association has a [...] "library" [...] of equipment which can be borrowed to assist with keeping life as normal as possible, newsletters, a helpline, and events for the families to help children and parents to feel less isolated.|$|E
2500|$|Adaptation due to {{practice}} {{can be a}} result of intended practice such as sports or unintended practice such as wearing an <b>orthosis.</b> [...] In athletes, repetition results in muscle memory. [...] The motor task becomes a long-term memory that can be repeated without much conscious effort. [...] This allows the athlete to focus on fine-tuning their motor task strategy. [...] Resistance to fatigue also comes with practice as the muscle is strengthened, but the speed at which an athlete can complete a motor task is also increased with practice. [...] Volleyball players compared to non-jumpers show more repeatable control of muscles surrounding the knee that is controlled by co-activation in the single jump condition. [...] In the repeated jump condition, both volleyball players and non-jumpers have a linear decrease in normalized jump flight time. [...] Though the normalized linear decrease is the same for athletes and non-athletes, athletes consistently have higher flight times.|$|E

This <b>orthosis</b> usually has a strap which applies a binding force over {{the origin of}} the wrist extensors. The applied force by <b>orthosis</b> reduces the elongation within the musculotendinous fibers. Wrist extensor <b>orthosis</b> maintains the wrist in the slight extension. This position reduces the overloading strain at the lesion area.|$|E

50|$|Under the International Standard terminology, orthoses are {{classified}} by an acronym describing the anatomical joints which they contain. For example, an ankle foot <b>orthosis</b> ('AFO') {{is applied to}} the foot and ankle, a thoracolumbosacral <b>orthosis</b> ('TLSO') affects the thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions of the spine. It is also useful to describe the function of the <b>orthosis.</b> Use of the International Standard is promoted to reduce the widespread variation in description of orthoses, which is often a barrier to interpretation of research studies.|$|E

50|$|Peroneal nerve injury {{occurs when}} the knee is exposed to various stress. It {{occurs when the}} posterolateral corner {{structure}} of knee is injured. Relatively tethered location around fibular head, tenuous vascular supply and epineural connective tissues are possible factors that cause damage on the common peroneal nerve. Treatment options for nerve palsy include both operative and non-operative techniques. Initial treatment includes physical therapy and ankle-foot <b>orthosis.</b> Physical therapy mainly focuses on preventing deformation by stretching the posterior ankle capsule. A special brace or splint worn inside the shoe (called an Ankle Foot <b>Orthosis)</b> holds the foot {{in the best position}} for walking. <b>Orthosis</b> stretches posterior ankle structures.
