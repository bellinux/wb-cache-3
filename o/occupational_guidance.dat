40|$|Abstract Background Research {{indicates}} that work modifications can reduce sickness absence and work disability due to low back pain. However, {{there are few}} studies that have described modified work {{from the perspective of}} patients. A greater understanding of their experiences may inform future workplace management of employees with this condition. Methods Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-five employed patients who had been referred for back pain rehabilitation. All had expressed concern about their ability to work due to low back pain. Data was analysed thematically. Results Many participants had made their own work modifications, which were guided by the extent of control they had over their hours and duties, colleague support, and their own beliefs and attitudes about working with back pain. A minority of the participants had received advice or support with work modifications through occupational health. Access to these services was limited and usually followed lengthy sickness absence. Implementation largely rested with the manager and over-cautious approaches were common. Conclusions There was little evidence of compliance with <b>occupational</b> health <b>guidance</b> on modified work. There appears to be insufficient expertise among managers and occupational health in modifying work for employees with low back pain and little indication of joint planning. On the whole, workers make their own modifications, or arrange them informally with their manager and colleagues, but remain concerned about working with back pain. More effective and appropriate application of modifications may increase employees' {{confidence in their ability to}} work. </p...|$|R

40|$|Lack of {{awareness}} is common following stroke {{and is considered}} a hindrance in rehabilitation, therefore attempts to enhance clients awareness should be a cornerstone of the rehabilitation process. The aim {{of the present study}} was to describe occupational therapists experiences of interventions to enhance client’s awareness following stroke. A qualitative approach was used and data collection was carried out through interviews with six occupational therapists working within stroke rehabilitation. Data were analysed with qualitative content analysis and resulted in two categories with related subcategories. Those two categories were Strategies to enhance awareness and To adapt strategies to success and challenges in the process. The results show careful selection of activities, dialogue on the basis of <b>occupational</b> performance, <b>guidance</b> to bodily experiences and how strategies to visually demonstrate difficulties were used in order to enhance awareness among clients. The results showed the importance of being responsive, as to become aware often was a difficult process for the client with various conditions affecting it. A constant balancing act between challenging the client to raise awareness, while supporting success to strengthen and motivate, was described as a thread running through the process. This study may contribute to increased knowledge of successful factors in occupational therapy interventions to enhance awareness. The result may also contribute to increased understanding of how the process to achieve increased awareness may develop, and how occupational therapists need to take into account different conditions and aspects during the course of this development.

40|$|Although {{problems}} with motor performance {{in daily life}} are frequently mentioned in Noonan syndrome, the motor performance profile has never been systematically investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether a specific profile in motor performance in children with Noonan syndrome was seen using valid norm-referenced tests. The study assessed motor performance in 19 children with Noonan syndrome (12 females, mean age 9 years 4 months, range 6 years 1 month to 11 years and 11 months, SDS 1 year and 11 months). More than 60 % of the parents of the children reported pain, decreased muscle strength, reduced endurance, and/or clumsiness in daily functioning. The mean standard scores on the Visual Motor Integration (VMI) test and Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2, Dutch version (MABC- 2 -NL) items differed significantly from the reference scores. Grip strength, muscle force, and 6 min Walking Test (6 MWT) walking distance were significantly lower, and the presence of generalized hypermobility was significantly higher. All MABC- 2 -NL scores (except manual dexterity) correlated significantly with almost all muscle strength tests, VMI total score, and VMI visual perception score. The 6 MWT was only significantly correlated to grip strength. This is the first study that confirms that motor performance, strength, and endurance are significantly impaired in children with Noonan syndrome. Decreased functional motor performance seems to be related to decreased visual perception and reduced muscle strength. Research on causal relationships and the effectiveness of interventions is needed. Physical and/or <b>occupational</b> therapy <b>guidance</b> should be considered to enhance participation in daily life...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim was to}} {{gain insight}} into work {{experiences}} and problems of subjects with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) to develop more effective guidelines for preventing work disability and work loss. Methods: A total of 617 patients aged 45 - 60, recruited from pulmonary outpatient clinics and general practices, completed a questionnaire on (respiratory) health and work history. Results: Of the patients 43 % were female, 52 % were employed and more than half were less educated. Comorbidity was present in 52 % of the study group. Of those who stopped working (N = 260), 36 % stopped before the onset of COPD, 39 % stopped because of COPD and 25 %, although having COPD, had other reasons to stop. Of the patients with a work history 39 % had an invalidity benefit: 21 % of the working and 60 % of the non-working patients. For one-third of these patients COPD was not the reason for having an invalidity benefit. For 56 % of those who had a benefit because of COPD, comorbidity contributed to work disability. No difference in current smoking habit was seen between working patients and non-working patients. Yet, non-working patients were more often smokers at the moment they stopped working. Furthermore, former smokers who still worked stopped smoking at a younger age than former smokers who stopped working. Compared with workers and independent of smoking habit, former workers were more exposed to dust/irritants, had their work(place) less frequently modified and had more unfavourable (social) work experiences. Conclusion: For employees with COPD, work loss is often multi-factorial. Comorbidity is often present and an important cause for work loss. Therefore <b>occupational</b> health <b>guidance</b> has to take other interfering (health) factors than COPD into consideration as well.

Children’s occupational goal, shapers of career aspirations, and the process on how the career aspirations are developed were described {{from the perspective of}} 48 children of SOS Children’s Village-Lipa.

Career <b>Guidance</b> Advocacy Model (CGAM) offers framework of career helping for orphans and abandoned children through advocating affirmative life space with constructive authorities; career opportunity and familiarity; and sustained positive experiences.
