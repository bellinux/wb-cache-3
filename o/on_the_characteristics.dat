5|$|In 2013, a {{group of}} {{materials}} scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> of plasma were claimed {{to be difficult to}} obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.|$|E

5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} metals {{depend on the}} general {{characteristics}} of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy metals such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide heavy metals) that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide heavy metals from europium through thulium) {{that give rise to}} magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E

5|$|The most {{familiar}} uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for adornment, a use which dates back into antiquity, and as industrial abrasives for cutting hard materials.

In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the four Cs, are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are carat (its weight), cut (quality of the cut is graded according to proportions, symmetry and polish), color (how close to white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), and clarity (how free is it from inclusions). A large, flawless diamond {{is known as a}} paragon.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the {{prevailing}} wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E

Using unit-time map <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve of nilpotent singularity we define characteristic map and characteristic box {{dimension of the}} unit-time map. We study connection between the box dimension of discrete orbits generated by the unit-time map of planar vector fields <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> or invariant curves, and the multiplicity of singularities. Nilpotent singularities which are studied are nilpotent node, focus and cusp.
