25|$|The Reform Party's {{success in}} 1993 {{was related to}} the {{mobilization}} of people who were opposed to the welfare state, but this represents only one dimension of the party's appeal. Jenkins (2002) examines the effect of issues on Reform support during the campaign and considers the actual process by which issues affected party support. Although candidates can prime or stress certain issues for voters, the priming label is sometimes misused. Jenkins makes a distinction between campaign learning and priming. If voters do not know where a party stands on an issue, they cannot adequately employ this information in their overall evaluation. Evidence demonstrates that the increased importance <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> the welfare state was largely a function of the distribution of new information or learning, while the increased importance of cultural questions represented priming.|$|E

A battery of items was completed by 75 members of a Pagan Summer Camp. These items were reduced to produce a 21 -item scale that measured aspects of Paganism concerned with: the God/Goddess, worshipping, prayer, and coven.

2500|$|Society's {{treatment}} of victims {{has the potential}} to exacerbate their trauma. People who have been raped or sexually assaulted are sometimes blamed and considered responsible for the crime. This refers to the just world fallacy and rape myth acceptance that certain victim behaviors (such as being intoxicated, flirting or wearing sexually provocative clothing) may encourage rape. In many cases, victims are said to have [...] "asked for it" [...] because of not resisting their assault or violating female gender expectations. A global survey <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sexual violence by the Global Forum for Health Research shows that victim-blaming concepts are at least partially accepted in many countries. Women who have been raped are sometimes deemed to have behaved improperly. Usually, these are cultures where there is a significant social divide between the freedoms and status afforded to men and women.|$|E
2500|$|From the 4th to 16th Century AD, Christian philosophers, while {{maintaining}} the condemnation of abortion as wrong, had varying stances on whether abortion was murder. Under the first Christian Roman emperor Constantine, there was a relaxation <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> abortion and exposure of children. Bakke writes, [...] "Since {{an increasing number of}} Christian parents were poor and found it difficult to look after their children, the theologians were forced to take into account this situation and reflect anew on the question. This made it possible to take a more tolerant attitude toward poor people who exposed their children." [...] Saint Augustine believed that an early abortion is not murder because, according to the Aristotelian concept of delayed ensoulment, the soul of a fetus at an early stage is not present, a belief that passed into canon law. Nonetheless, he harshly condemned the procedure: [...] "Sometimes, indeed, this lustful cruelty, or if you please, cruel lust, resorts to such extravagant methods as to use poisonous drugs to secure barrenness; or else, if unsuccessful in this, to destroy the conceived seed by some means previous to birth, preferring that its offspring should rather perish than receive vitality; or if it was advancing to life within the womb, should be slain before it was born."(De Nube et Concupiscentia 1.17 (15)) St. Thomas Aquinas, Pope Innocent III, and Pope Gregory XIV also believed that a fetus does not have a soul until [...] "quickening," [...] or when the fetus begins to kick and move, and therefore early abortion was not murder, though later abortion was. Aquinas held that abortion was still wrong, even when not murder, regardless of when the soul entered the body. Pope Stephen V and Pope Sixtus V opposed abortion at any stage of pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|This thesis adds a new {{contribution}} to the tradition of empirical theology, concerned with individual differences in young people’s <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> religion and values. This thesis explores the correlates <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> Christianity (assessed by the Francis Scale <b>of</b> <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> Christianity) among 5, 199 13 - to 15 -year-old students in England and Wales {{who participated in the}} Young People’s Values Survey during 2002 to 2010. The Young People’s Values Survey was designed to draw together two independent strands of research within the tradition of empirical theology, the first concerned with charting the correlates of individual differences in <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> religion (operationalised originally by the Francis Scale <b>of</b> <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> Christianity), and the second concerned with individual differences in young people’s religion and values (operationalised originally by the Teenage Religion and Values Survey). This thesis reports on findings generated from the Young People’s Values Survey, the first study within the Teenage Religion and Values Survey series to include the Francis Scale <b>of</b> <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> Christianity. This thesis comprises main two parts. Part one locates this study within the tradition of empirical theology by collating, reviewing and assessing the two bodies of knowledge (or strands of research) on which it builds. Part two presents new empirical analyses exploring the correlates <b>of</b> young people’s <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> Christianity during {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century. These analyses explore first, the psychometric properties of the short-form Francis Scale <b>of</b> <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> Christianity and second, the relationship between <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> Christianity and: sex differences, purpose in life, suicidal ideation, immortality beliefs (belief in life after death), and implicit religion (attachment to Christian rites of passage). This thesis concludes by discussing how the findings of this study may shape future empirical research within the tradition of empirical theology concerned with assessing young people’s <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> religion and values...|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} {{demonstrates a}} {{negative relationship between}} <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> alcohol and religiosity.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore the impact of personality and the relative efficacy of different markers of religiosity in predicting <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> alcohol among a sample of 16 – 18 year olds in Northern Ireland. Method: The Francis Scale <b>of</b> <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> Alcohol (Francis, 1992 c. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 31, 45 – 50) was administered alongside the Abbreviated Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Francis, Brown, & Philipchalk, 1992.
