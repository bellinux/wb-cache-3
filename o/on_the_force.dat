5|$|The City of London police {{informed}} the Metropolitan force, as their protocol demanded, and both services issued revolvers to the detectives {{involved in the}} search. The subsequent investigation was challenging for the police because of the cultural differences between the British police and the largely foreign residents of the area covered by the search. The police {{did not have any}} Russian, Latvian or Yiddish speakers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals scored {{again in}} the top of the seventh inning. Thevenow again led the inning by hitting a single into left field. Alexander bunted right in front of the plate. Yankees catcher Hank Severeid made the throw to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, but Lazzeri made an error on the play, and both runners were safe at their {{respective}} bases. Holm followed by hitting a weak grounder that led to a force out of Thevenow at third base. With runners at first and second base, Southworth lined a double right by Ruth, scoring Alexander and sending Holm to third base. Urban Shocker, the starter in Game2, then came in to relieve Shawkey as pitcher. Shocker gave up a single to Hornsby into center field, allowing Holm and Southworth to score. Bottomley then hit a grounder to shortstop Mark Koenig, who stepped on second base to get Hornsby out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> play. Bell followed with a two-run home run, extending the Cardinals' lead to 9–1. Chick Hafey lined a double into left field, but Bob O'Farrell ended the inning by striking out. In the bottom of the seventh inning, the Yankees scored one run on an Earle Combs single to cut the Cardinals' lead to seven runs.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{influenced}} {{the creation of}} other imperial units during the conflict. Lord Strathcona, the Canadian High Commissioner in London, raised a unit of mounted infantry modelled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> believing this would be particularly suitable for taking on Boer scouting parties. Thirty-three serving members of the police joined the unit, including Superintendent Samuel Steel, who became their commanding officer. The Strathconas wore the mounted police's Stetson hat {{as part of their}} uniform, while in turn their distinctive boots were adopted by the police as their official footwear in 1901. The South African Constabulary was created in October 1900 to police the recaptured territories; it mirrored the mounted police, with its members again wearing the force's Stetson hat; it incorporated forty-two members of the mounted police and one of its divisions was commanded by Steele. The mounted police volunteers suffered seven casualties during the conflict. Sergeant Arthur Richardson, a member of the Strathconas, won the Victoria Cross for rescuing a Canadian soldier under heavy fire at Wolve Spruit. In 1904, the Crown renamed the force the Royal North-West Mounted Police to honour its contributions in the war.|$|E

25|$|Roy Olmstead (September 18, 1886 – April 30, 1966) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} and best-known bootleggers in the Pacific Northwest region during American Prohibition. A former lieutenant in the Seattle Police Department, he began to bootleg part-time while still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force.</b> Following his arrest for that crime, he lost his job in law enforcement and turned to illegally importing and distributing alcohol from Canada as a full-time and highly profitable occupation. Eventually, wiretaps of his phones provided sufficient evidence for his arrest and prosecution, despite an appeal that reached the Supreme Court regarding the legality of the wiretap.|$|E
25|$|Enright {{was also}} able to {{institute}} a number of reforms and was greatly able to improve working conditions for police officers while in office. He allowed a day off for officers after every six days on duty, oversaw the buildup of large police relief funds and improved the pension system. He also {{reduced the number of}} precincts for better management, set up a special police unit to handle vice and gambling on a city-wide basis, reorganized the arrest-quota based merit system and established the first NYPD police camp at Tannersville, New York where ill or wounded officers could recover until they were able to return to duty. Other reforms he made included successfully petitioning the federal government to exempt police officers from being drafted, established the Missing Persons Bureau as a 24-hour service, and increased the number of policewomen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force.</b> He would, however, encounter heavy resistance in attempting to rid the department of corrupt and inefficient officers.|$|E
25|$|He {{responded to}} these criticisms by attacking his detractors {{in the pages}} of Murray's Magazine, {{supporting}} vigilante activity, which the police on the streets knew was a bad idea, and publicly complaining about his lack of control of CID, which brought an official Home Office reprimand for discussing his office publicly without permission. Warren finally had enough and resigned – coincidentally right before the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November 1888. Every superintendent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> visited him at home to express their regret. Warren's resignation hindered the investigation. He had given an order that if another murder occurred, nobody was to enter the scene – a strange turn of phrase as the four previous victims had all been found in the open street – until he arrived to direct the investigation. Consequently, when the murder of Kelly was discovered by a rent collector who looked in through the window of her room in a Spitalfields lodging house, the police did not enter the room for some three hours because, unaware of his resignation, they were waiting for Warren to arrive. He returned to military duties.|$|E

25|$|In 1886, the {{department}} hired {{its first two}} black officers, Robert William Stewart and Roy Green.. The LAPD {{was one of the}} first two police departments in the country to hire an African-American woman officer, Georgia Ann Robinson in 1919. Despite this, {{the department}} was slow at integration. During the 1965 Watts riots, only 5 of the 205 police assigned to South Central Los Angeles were black, despite the fact that it was the largest black community in Los Angeles. Los Angeles' first black mayor Tom Bradley was an ex-police officer and quit the department after being unable to advance past the rank of lieutenant like other black police officers in the department. When Bradley was elected mayor in 1972, only 5% of LAPD officers were black and there was only one black captain in the department, Homer Broome. Broome would break down racial barriers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> going on to become first black officer to obtain the rank of commander and the first black to command a police station, the Southwest Division which included historically black neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles in 1975.|$|E

500|$|Writing {{the story}} {{involved}} extensive research on {{a plethora of}} pseudo-scientific books. Inspiration for the mythology in the game, such as {{the description of the}} city and the appearance of the metal orichalcum, was primarily drawn from Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias, and from Ignatius Loyola Donnelly's book [...] that revived interest in the myth during the nineteenth century. The magical properties of orichalcum and the Atlantean technology depicted in the game were partly adopted from Russian spiritualist Helena Blavatsky's publications <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> vril.

500|$|Cyathus olla is {{a species}} of {{saprobic}} fungus in the genus Cyathus, family Nidulariaceae. The fruit bodies resemble tiny bird's nests filled with [...] "eggs" [...] – spore-containing structures called peridioles. Like other bird's nest fungi, C.olla relies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of falling water to dislodge peridioles from fruiting bodies to eject and disperse their spores. The life cycle of this fungus allows it to reproduce both sexually, with meiosis, and asexually via spores. C.olla is a relatively common fungus, with a worldwide distribution. It {{is the subject of}} agricultural research to determine its potential as a means to accelerate the breakdown of crop residue, and reduce the population of plant pathogens.

He was turned down, but found another way to earn money. The Dragnet radio series and 1951 television series sourced their stories from the LAPD, and Roddenberry gathered stories from his colleagues <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> and wrote them up for submission to the show, splitting the $100 payment evenly if they sold.

500|$|After resupplying, French {{led some}} of his force back east, leaving Assistant Commissioner James Macleod to advance on Fort Whoop-Up with the three {{remaining}} divisions, approximately 150 men. When the police reached the fort on October 9, they were prepared for a confrontation, but the whiskey traders were aware that they were approaching and had long since moved <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> <b>force</b> received new orders from Ottawa to garrison the area and settled down to build Fort Macleod on an island in Old Man's River. The expedition had been badly planned and executed, and almost failed; the historian William Baker describes it as [...] "a monumental fiasco of poor planning, ignorance, incompetence, and cruelty to men and beasts". Nonetheless, it rapidly became portrayed by the force as epic story of bravery, endurance and determination.|$|E
500|$|The {{language}} and commentary on language {{is of particular}} emphasis in Jubilate Agno. To Alan Jacobs, Smart's use of language represents his attempt to connect to the [...] "Ur language", allowing Smart to connect to [...] "the Word calling forth the world." [...] This is similar to David and Orpheus's ability as poets to create through their song. In his constant emphasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of poetry, Jubilate Agno takes on the qualities of the Ars Poetica tradition. As such, Smart is attempting to develop a poetic language that will connect him to the [...] "one true, eternal poem." [...] The poetic language that he creates is related to Adam's [...] "onomathetic" [...] tradition, or the idea that names hold significant weight in the universe and that Adam was able to join in with creation by naming objects.|$|E
