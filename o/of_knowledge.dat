40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis study {{described}} the knowledge upper elementary teachers {{used to teach}} students to comprehend informational text comprehension. Teachers were observed for two lessons and participated in interviews following each observation. During the interviews, teacher-participants described how they planned for the lesson and recalled their thinking as they watched segments of their video recorded lesson. Analysis focused on seven knowledge domains adapted from the literature on teacher <b>knowledge,</b> namely <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Students, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Reading, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the Genre <b>of</b> Informational Text, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> General Teaching Practices, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Context, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Curriculum, and <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Topical Content. Analysis of teachers' interviews led to four major findings: first, for some teachers, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Students was well-developed, and in turn, influential in their instructional decision-making; second, for others, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Context was well-developed and influential, but, in this study, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Context was primarily related to test accountability; third, content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge related to teaching comprehension of informational texts were, at times, incomplete; and fourth, there was wide variability how teachers applied their pedagogical content knowledge related to the authenticity <b>of</b> the literacy <b>knowledge</b> goals and the topical knowledge goals...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to elucidate Calvin's high {{view of the}} function of Scripture in the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God. Two conclusions emerge:- The first is that the statement 'Scripture is the Word of God' Is not a premise with which Calvin's theological exposition begins, but a position to which the Reformer comes {{as a corollary of}} his understanding of the grace of God. - The second Is that Calvin's contention that the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God is mediated In Scripture rests upon his view that the nature of God is such that its most adequate form of self-expression is as Word. There are three parts to the thesis. - Part I Is an examination of The Actuality <b>of</b> the <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God In the Word of God. This section is concerned with the actual content <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God as it is mediated by the Word of God. The mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God In Scripture is set {{in the context of the}} mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God by the Eternal Word of God and the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God by the Incarnate Word of God. - Parts II and III explore The Possibility <b>of</b> the <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God in the Word of God. Part II asks how it is possible for the Word of God to be spoken, and answers the question In terms of Calvin's use of the principle of Accommodation. Part III considers how It Is possible for the Word of God to be heard, and answers the question in terms of Calvin's consistent correlation of Word and Spirit. In both cases the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God in Scripture is again set in the context of the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God by the Eternal Word of God, and the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God by the Incarnate Word of God...|$|R

40|$|Shulman’s notations <b>of</b> {{subject matter}} <b>knowledge</b> (SMK) and {{pedagogical}} content knowledge (PCK) {{have been very}} influential in education research on teachers’ knowledge for teaching.

Furthermore, attempts to distinguish SMK and PCK highlight the complex and multidimensional nature <b>of</b> teachers’ <b>knowledge</b> and hence the difficulty of separating SMK and PCK. The author adopts the notion of mathematics-for-teaching (MfT) and argues that teachers’ knowledge for teaching annuities comprises <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> mathematical aspects, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> pedagogical aspects and contextual <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> finance. Drawing from a larger study in which the author taught a financial mathematics course to pre-service secondary mathematics teachers, four examples <b>of</b> teachers’ <b>knowledge</b> for teaching annuities are identified, each of which illustrates how <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> mathematics, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> pedagogy and contextual <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> finance are intertwined...|$|R
