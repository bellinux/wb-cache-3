5|$|As {{this tournament}} takes {{place during the}} same time period as the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs, NHL players {{generally}} only become available if their respective NHL team did not make the playoffs, or <b>once</b> <b>they</b> have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention. It is therefore common for several NHL players to join the World Championships while the tournament is already in progress.|$|E

5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; <b>once</b> <b>they</b> return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as <b>once</b> <b>they</b> select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E
5|$|Expert systems {{restricted}} {{themselves to}} a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified <b>once</b> <b>they</b> were in place.

5|$|In harmony it {{is often}} better {{for the sake of}} {{consistency}} to maintain a whole succession of clusters, <b>once</b> <b>they</b> are begun; since one alone, or even two, may be heard as a mere effect, rather than as an independent and significant procedure, carried with musical logic to its inevitable conclusion.|$|E

However, Atlanta fought hard against the Boston Celtics, with Maravich averaging 27.7 points in the series.|$|R
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. <b>Once</b> <b>they</b> reach {{the limit of}} their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but <b>once</b> <b>they</b> bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Once</b> <b>they</b> {{arrive at}} Illium, {{the crew is}} {{attacked}} a group of mercenaries including Commander Jacobus, hired by Saren, leaving Tali and Keenah the only survivors.

Though they try to tell of the evidence they have found, they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel. Later, they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus, injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah. After being chased through the Citadel, Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator, killing him, though Keenah collapses and dies.|$|E
