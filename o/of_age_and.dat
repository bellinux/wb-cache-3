5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> the majority of incidents occur {{in the first year}} of life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

40|$|This hermeneutical study interprets and {{describes}} the phenomena <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> living with disability. The lived experiences of 14 older {{men and the}} horizon of this researcher developed {{an understanding of what}} it is like for men to grow old and, for some, to live with the effects of a major disability. The study is grounded in the philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer and framed in the context of embodiment, masculinity, and narrative. I conducted multiple in-depth interviews with older men aged from 67 to 83 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Seven <b>of</b> the participants had experienced a stroke and I was able to explore the phenomenon of disability with them. Through thematic and narrative analyses of the textual data interpretations were developed that identified common meanings and understandings of the phenomena <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> disability. These themes and narratives reveal that the men's understandings are at odds with conventional negative views <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> disability. These older men are 'alive and kicking', they voice counternarratives to the dominant construction <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> as decline <b>and</b> weakness, and have succeeded in remaking the lifeworld after stroke. Overall I have come to understand an overarching meaning of older men 'working it out' as illustrative of a strong face <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> disability. Older men seek out opportunities to participate actively in community life and, despite the challenges <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> disability, lead significant and meaningful lives. These findings challenge and extend our limited understandings of men's experiences <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> living with disability.

40|$|Ageing is {{accompanied}} by a decline in cognitive functions; along with a variety of neurobiological changes. The association between inflammation <b>and</b> <b>ageing</b> is based on complex molecular and cellular changes that we are only just beginning to understand. The hippocampus is one of the structures more closely related to electrophysiological, structural and morphological changes during ageing. In the present study we examined the effect <b>of</b> normal <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> LPS-induced inflammation on astroglia-neuron interaction in the rat hippocampus <b>of</b> adult, normal <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated adult rats. Astrocytes were smaller, with thicker and shorter branches and less numerous in CA 1 Str. radiatum <b>of</b> <b>aged</b> rats in comparison to adult and LPS-treated rats. Astrocyte branches infiltrated apoptotic neurons <b>of</b> <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats. Cellular debris, which were more numerous in CA 1 <b>of</b> <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats, could be found apposed to astrocytes processes and were phagocytated by reactive microglia. Reactive microglia were present in the CA 1 Str. Radiatum, often in association with apoptotic cells. Significant differences were found in the fraction of reactive microglia which was 40 % of total in adult, 33 % in <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> 50 % in LPS-treated rats. Fractalkine (CX 3 CL 1) increased significantly in hippocampus homogenates <b>of</b> <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats. The number of CA 1 neurons decreased in aged rats. In the hippocampus <b>of</b> <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats astrocytes and microglia may help clearing apoptotic cellular debris possibly through CX 3 CL 1 signalling. Our results indicate that astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus <b>of</b> <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-infused rats possibl...|$|R
