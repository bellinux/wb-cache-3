50|$|Ponds {{can result}} {{from a wide range}} of natural processes. Any {{depression}} in the ground which collects and retains a sufficient amount of precipitation can be considered a pond, and such depressions can be formed by a variety of geological and ecological events. Rivers often leave behind ponds in natural flood plains after spring flooding, and these can be very important to breeding fish, particularly in large river systems like the Amazon. Retreating glaciers can leave behind landscapes filled with small depressions, each developing its own pond; an example is the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. Many areas of landscape contain small depressions which form temporary ponds after spring snow melt, or during rainy seasons; these are called vernal ponds, and may be important sites for amphibian breeding. Some ponds are created by animals. Beaver ponds are the best known example, but alligators also excavate ponds as well. In landscapes with <b>organic</b> <b>soils,</b> <b>fires</b> can also create depressions during periods of drought; these become open water when normal water levels return.|$|R
40|$|Vegetation fires {{influence}} the properties and turnover of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> matter in numerous ecosystems. Thermal alteration tends {{to increase the}} stability of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> matter. <b>Fire</b> induces the destruction of above-ground biomass, which {{is associated with a}} large production of new partially-charred litter. Plant regeneration is directly affected by the fire itself, and by the ensuing modifications to the C, N and nutrient cycles associated with <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> matter transformations. The objectives of the present study were to determine 1) changes in <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> matter composition induced by fire, and 2) the dynamics of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> matter recovery in the first two decades following a fire event [...] In a Florida scrub oak ecosystem, a chronosequence of soils protected from vegetation fire for 1 to 20 years was studied. The bulk organic matter and oxidation resistant elemental carbon were quantified in depths 0 - 5 cm, 5 - 15 cm, and 15 - 25 cm. The <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> matter was characterized by solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy and Curie point pyrolysis. The combination of these techniques allowed us to identify three steps in <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> matter evolution: first the un-charred litter brought by the fire degraded between 1 and 4. years after fire; second the contribution of aryl carbon, and most probably the pyrogenic carbon, significantly decreased between 4 and 11. years after fire; Thirdly, after 11. years, the <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> matter quality appeared driven again by the fresh litter input from regenerating plant ecosystem. In this study, the <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> matter did not appear strongly modified by the fire.

40|$|Peat {{fires in}} boreal and tundra regions can {{potentially}} cause a high CO 2 release, {{because of their}} large soil carbon stocks. Under current and future climate warming the frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing and will cause the plant community and <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> to become more susceptible to <b>fire.</b> The <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> consumption by <b>fire</b> is commonly used {{as a proxy for}} fire severity and is a large source of carbon release. However, the role of <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> in both above- and belowground fire behavior has only rarely been studied. In this study we collected soil and branches from Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies/obovata from the taiga/tundra ecotone across a large spatial scale. In laboratory fire experiments we burned different fuel type combinations to examine the fire spread through fuel ladders both from branches to soil and vice versa. We found that the tree species identity influences the fire spread from branches to soil and vice versa. The combination of chemical and structural plant traits could explain the stronger interaction between soil and coniferous spruce and pine fuels in a fire ladder compared to the deciduous birch. Therefore, total carbon emission from a boreal forest fire may not only depend on burned plant fuel, but also on the species-specific potential of the trees to ignite the soil. Carbon emission models and forest management could be improved if not only the aboveground plant fuel consumption is considered, but also the interaction between fuels in a fuel ladder and the probability of soil ignition by a forest crown fire and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|The character, {{extent and}} {{location}} of Tasmanian <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> have been largely overlooked in Australian soil classification and taxonomy, with only a loose interpretation of northern hemisphere <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> classifications applied. The aim of present work is to produce a classification of the <b>organic</b> <b>soils,</b> based on measurable soil properties and to then relate the characteristic <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> properties to environmental factors. The relationship between <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> characteristics and environmental factors will enable predictive mapping of the occurrence and organic content of <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> in Tasmania. Tasmanian <b>organic</b> <b>soils</b> were sampled across 127 sites yielding a total of 1159 soil pits. Soil and environmental characteristics were recorded for each soil pit. Unsupervised clustering of the soil characteristics from each soil pit distinguished 23 <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> groups. A classification key for identifying the 23 clusters was produced using the <b>soil</b> characteristics, <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon, humification, <b>soil</b> total nitrogen and <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> depth. Dominant environmental factors influencing the 23 clusters were found, through vector analysis, smooth plate spline contouring and multinomial log-linear modelling to be: vegetation, burn frequency, topography, geology, altitude and climate. In order to predict the location and occurrence of the soils and soil characteristics produced through unsupervised clustering, the dominant environmental factors were subsequently used to provide cluster centroids for a supervised clustering. The resulting 41 soil groups {{were found to be}} distinguishable in terms of vegetation type, geology, topography and microtopography. The supervised clusters were found to perform better than the available vegetation classifications in predicting the unsupervised clusters. <b>Organic</b> <b>soil</b> carbon, bulk density and depth were used to model <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> carbon stocks in Tasmania and provide a geographic context for the supervised and unsupervised soil clusters. Stepwise regression of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon, showed slope as the dominant predictor across <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> producing vegetation types. The regression models allowed for mapping of <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> areal extent and <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon stocks in Tasmania, producing a value of 3, 072 Tg of <b>soil</b> <b>organic</b> carbon over 8, 974 km 2. Suggested changes to the Australian Soil Classification for the order organosol include the addition of folic, lignic, arenic and argyllic to the differentiae.

40|$|Inoculation of {{soil with}} {{bacteria}} (a Gram-negative rod [PD 2] and a 4 - membered consortium [DC 1]) accelerated mineralization of phenanthrene and pyrene (but not naphthalene) added individually to a pristine sand and a pristine <b>organic</b> <b>soil.</b> The half-life of naphthalene was 3. 5 days in both soils whether inoculated or non-inoculated. However, the half-life of phenanthrene decreased from 86 days in non-inoculated sand soil and 80 {{days in the}} non-inoculated <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> to 3. 6 days {{in the sand and}} 3. 1 days in <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> when inoculated with PD 2, and to 6. 6 days in the sand and 8. 7 days in the <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> when inoculated with DC 1. Phenanthrene mineralization ceased after 23 days in DC 1 -inoculated soil and was 71. 3 ± 3. 6 % (sand) and 63. 3 ± 2. 8 % (organic). This compared with 96. 8 ± 3. 8 % (sand) and 102. 8 ± 2. 5 % (organic) after 8 days in PD 2 -inoculated soil. Inoculation with DC 1 (but not PD 2) also accelerated mineralization of pyrene, where the half-life decreased from 155 days to 18 days in the sand soil, and from 216 days to 33 days in <b>organic</b> <b>soil...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} few years, the use of {{bacterial}} calcium carbonate precipitation has become popular as a ground-improvement technique for sandy soil. However, this technique has not been applied to <b>organic</b> <b>soil.</b> This study focused on bacterial calcium carbonate precipitation {{and its effect on}} the compressibility and strength of <b>organic</b> <b>soil.</b> A special injection system was prepared for inducing a bacterial solution into several samples. The bacterial solution was supplied to the samples by gravity for 4 days in specific molds designed for this work. Calcite precipitation was observed by monitoring the changes in the pH value and by measuring the amount of calcium carbonate in the <b>organic</b> <b>soil.</b> The changes in compressibility and strength were measured before and after the bacterial treatment. The test results showed that the pH values in the treatment medium reached the ideal values that are appropriate for calcite precipitation. It was found that the amount of precipitated calcium carbonate in <b>organic</b> <b>soil</b> increased by about 20 % in the treated samples compared to that in the untreated samples. Moreover, the test results indicated that the bacterial treatment influenced the compressibility and shear strength of the <b>organic</b> <b>soil.</b> The results were supported by an energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis...|$|R
