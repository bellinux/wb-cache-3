40|$|Many {{national}} statistical {{systems in}} developing countries face problems in finding adequate resources for censuses and <b>other</b> <b>data</b> <b>collections.</b> There is also an increasing demand {{to reduce the cost}} of <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> and provide more frequent and timely data. Many countries in all regions, but particularly in small island developing states, already include some questions on agriculture in their population censuses. However, this is often ad hoc and does not provide adequate information about the structure of agriculture for use by the ministries of agriculture, nor realize other benefits of coordination such as reduced cost and development of a reliable sample frame for agricultural surveys are often not realized. The paper will look at the recommendations of the FAO/UNFPA Guidelines for Linking Population and Housing Censuses with Agricultural Censuses and how integration has been achieved in practice during the 2010 round of population censuses, using case studies from countries. It will cover the areas of integration relevant to census data collection: items recommended, common definitions, development of a module for the population census questionnaire, approaches to integration and various considerations for the field wor...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: While {{the size}} and number of biobanks, patient {{registries}} and <b>other</b> <b>data</b> <b>collections</b> are increasing, biomedical researchers still often need to pool data for statistical power, a task that requires time-intensive retrospective integration. Results: To address this challenge, we developed MOLGENIS/connect, a semi-automatic system to find, match and pool data from different sources. The system shortlists relevant source attributes from thousands of candidates using ontology-based query expansion to overcome variations in terminology. Then it generates algorithms that transform source attributes to a common target DataSchema. These include unit conversion, categorical value matching and complex conversion patterns (e. g. calculation of BMI). In comparison to human-experts, MOLGENIS/connect was able to auto-generate 27 % of the algorithms perfectly, with an additional 46 % needing only minor editing, representing {{a reduction in the}} human effort and expertise needed to pool data.
