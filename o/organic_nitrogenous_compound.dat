In the present study, we explore the underlying mechanism regarding how melamine compromises fertility in the mouse. The data showed that melamine exposure significantly impaired the fertilization capability of the egg during in vitro fertilization. To further figure out the cause, we analyzed ovastacin localization and protein level, the sperm binding ability of zona pellucida, and ZP 2 cleavage status in unfertilized eggs from melamine fed mice, and no obvious differences were found between control and treatment groups. However, the protein level of Juno on the egg plasma membrane in the high-dose feeding group indeed significantly decreased compared to the control group. Thus, these data suggest that melamine compromises female fertility via suppressing Juno protein level on the egg membrane...|$|E

Compared to the knowledge of nitrogen transformation of nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidization, nitrate and nitrite reduction mediated by sponge-associated microbes, our knowledge of urea utilization in sponges and the phylogenetic diversity of sponge-associated microbes with urea utilization potential is very limited. In this study, Marinobacter litoralis isolated from the marine sponge Xestospongia testudinaria and the slurry of X. testudinaria were found to have urease activity. Subsequently, phylogenetically diverse bacterial ureC genes were detected in the total genomic DNA and RNA of sponge X. testudinaria, i. e., 19 operative taxonomic units (OTUs) in genomic DNA library and 8 OTUs in cDNA library at 90 % stringency. Particularly, 6 OTUs were common to both the genomic DNA library and the cDNA library, which suggested that some ureC genes were expressed in this sponge.

Exposing 7 -day old bean seedlings for 5 days continuously to 0. 02 to 0. 5 parts per million NO 2 increased plant height, fresh weight, chlorophyll, carotenoid, organic N and nitrate contents, and nitrate reductase and glutamate synthase activities in the leaves of seedlings supplied with no external N. At 20 millimolar nitrate, most of the parameters examined were inhibited except for organic N and nitrate contents and glutamate synthase activity which increased in most cases. Generally, with an increase in NO 2 concentration, the stimulatory effect declined and/or the inhibitory effect increased. A 3 -hour exposure of 12 -day-old bean seedlings to 0. 1 to 2. 0 parts per million NO 2 increased nitrate content and nitrate reductase activity at each nutrient nitrate level except for a slight inhibition of enzyme activity during exposure to 2. 0 parts per million NO 2 at 20 millimolar nitrate.

Tyramine {{is one of the most}} active and common BAs found in cheeses. This article reports the design of an real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) qPCR method for the detection and quantification of the microorganisms responsible for tyramine production in cheeses. A good linear relationship was obtained between the quantity of tyramine-producer DNA used in PCR reactions and the Ct (threshold cycle) value. The method was validated using 57 cheese samples in which the tyramine concentration was analysed by HPLC. Tyramine-producing bacteria were detected in different numbers in all samples, although tyramine itself was only detected in 56. 1 % of the samples. The results suggest that, independent of technological conditions such as pasteurisation or the ripening period, the presence of tyramine-producing bacteria over a threshold limit of 104 cfu g- 1 - easily detected by the proposed qPCR method - leads to the accumulation of tyramine beyond recommendable limits. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{study of}} the {{inhibitive}} effect of aniline {{and some of its}} derivatives and of the triphenylmethane dyes on certain bacteria warrants the following tentative conclusions: 1. The composition and reaction of the medium exert a marked influence on the behavior of the antiseptic. The higher the concentration of <b>organic</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds</b> (peptone) in the medium, the lower is the effective concentration of the dye. The reaction of the medium modifies the specific action of the antiseptic, owing probably to an alteration in the bacterial cell. 2. The germicidal action of the compounds {{is a function of the}} benzene nucleus, the added elements or radicals, their number, and, in the case of the dyes, probably the quinoid structure of the nucleus. 3. As far as tested, the increase in the number of alkyl radicals increases the antiseptic power. Methyl green is an interesting exception to this rule, for the change of one of the nitrogens to the quaternary salt is accompanied by an almost complete loss in inhibitive action. 4. The antiseptic power is enhanced to a greater extent by an ethyl than a methyl group, and the second alkyl produces a proportionately greater increase than the first. It appears that the relative position of the introduced group may be a factor in determining the relative improvement in the effectiveness of the compound. 5. The introduction of a methyl group in the nucleus consistently enhances the inhibitive action of the compound and its alkyl derivatives. This is evident from a comparison of the action of aniline and its derivatives with that of toluidine and its corresponding derivatives. 6. The simple aniline derivatives, as well as the dyes, are more toxic for the Gram-positive than the Gram-negative bacteria. Of the former, Bacillus subtilis is more sensitive to the dyes than Staphylococcus aureus, while the reverse is true in the case of the aniline compounds. 7. The most marked specific selective effect is manifested by the triphenylmethane dyes. Bacillus aerogenes and Bacillus typhosus possess a higher resistance to these substances than Bacillus coli or Bacfflus dysenterice. The last is exceedingly sensitive.

Field characterization of N 2 O-emitting processes being time-consuming due to great variability, laboratory determination of potential denitrification (upon incubation) is often used as a valuable test. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is a time- and cost-effective approach that has been reported to allow accurate determination of several soil properties. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the interest of NIRS for determining potential denitrification over a set of 460 topsoils sampled under crops, tree plantations, savanna or rainforest, originating from Madagascar, Congo-Brazzaville, Brazil, and French Guiana. Prediction of potential denitrification using NIRS was satisfying over the total set, especially with LOCAL calibration, which builds a model for each sample separately using its spectral neighbours in the calibration subset (R 2 = 0. 79 for validation). For the other sets, either textural or geographical, global calibration only was performed, involving for each set a unique prediction model built with all calibration samples. The accuracy of NIRS determination depended on the sample set, decreasing in the following order: Malagasy clayey set > total set ? Brazilian sandy loam set > coarse-textured set (Congo-Brazil) ? Guianese sandy clay loam set ? Congolese sandy set > non-clayey set (Congo-Brazil-Guiana), with cross-validation R 2 ranging from 0. 88 to 0. 44 (external validation was not carried out for small-sized sets). Thus NIRS prediction was more accurate over the clayey homogeneous set than over the non-clayey heterogeneous set. As a result of global calibration, potential denitrification was expressed as a linear combination of absorbance at every wavelength. Wavelengths that contributed most to NIRS prediction of soil potential denitrification corresponded to wavelengths that literature has assigned to <b>organic</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds,</b> amide-containing ones especially, and to carbonaceous compounds such as cellulose or including CH 3 or CH 2 groups. This related to the importance of amides in soil organic nitrogen and microbial biomass, and to the dependence of denitrification on soil organic matter. In short, NIRS is a time- and cost-effective approach that proved relevant for determining soil potential denitrification with acceptable accuracy, especially for clayey samples or when LOCAL calibration was performed.

The main objective of this thesis was to investigate atmospheric N deposition through the use of different monitoring approaches, both physical and biomonitor-based ones, paying special attention to those issues that currently remain poorly understood. The first work was focused on the study of the <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>organic</b> fraction of rain samples. Both canopy throughfall and bulk deposition samples from four holm oak forests of the Iberian Peninsula were analyzed for their dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content. The results showed that the contribution of the organic fraction to the total N budgets ranged in BD from 34 % to 56 %, and in TF from 38 % to 72 %. Data also revealed that agricultural activities and traffic-related pollutants generated in metropolitan areas may play an important role as potential sources of <b>organic</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds.</b> Finally, it was found that DON might be an additional nutrient for this forests type (canopy uptake). In the other chapters we studied N atmospheric pollution by using mosses as biomonitors. Firstly, we evaluated the feasibility of Pleurochaete squarrosa (Brid.) Lindb. (PS) as an alternative species for heavy metals and N deposition surveys in a Mediterranean area of southern Europe. To that end we compared the response of this species to that of Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. (HC), a commonly used and validated species in biomonitoring surveys. Both bryophytes showed similar spatial distribution patterns for N. Similarly, the two species discriminated sites both highly and scarcely affected by trace element deposition. Regarding Ô 15 N, PS gave a more congruent picture with the location of the main sources of N emissions in the area. All these data suggested that PS may be a suitable biomonitor in Mediterranean areas. Besides, bryophytes are among the most vulnerable organisms to N pollution. Thus, in our third study we evaluated the physiological response of Hypnum cupressiforme to an NH 3 concentration gradient from a comprehensive and temporal perspective, to better understand the mechanisms implied when mosses cope with this pollutant. We aimed at identifying which variables are the most responsive, and therefore, which ones are the most promising for the use of HC in ecosystem surveys as early warning indicators of NH 3 toxicity. The results showed that N accumulation and NH 3 -induced oxidative stress were the most important drivers of the physiological functioning of HC along the gradient. Moreover, the sampling season was determinant in the responsiveness of certain physiological variables. Finally, in the last research work we investigated the use of isotopic ratios to provide supplementary information {{about the nature of the}} atmospheric pollutants in biomonitoring surveys carried out at the European scale. To that end, more than 1300 samples of mosses from 15 countries, all of them participants of the ICP-Vegetation programme 2005 - 2006, were analyzed for their C and N content and Ô 15 N and Ô 13 C.

40|$|Inoculating grape musts {{with wine}} yeast and lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) concurrently in order to induce simultaneous alcoholic fermentation (AF) and malolactic fermentation (MLF) can be an efficient alternative to overcome potential inhibition of LAB in wines because of high ethanol concentrations and reduced nutrient content. In this study, the simultaneous inoculation of yeast and LAB into must was compared with a traditional vinification protocol, where MLF was induced after completion of AF. For this, two suitable commercial yeast-bacterium combinations were tested in cool-climate Chardonnay must. The time courses of glucose and fructose, acetaldehyde, several <b>organic</b> acids, and <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds</b> were measured along with the final values of other key wine parameters. Sensory evaluation was done after 12 months of storage. The current study could not confirm a negative impact of simultaneous AF/MLF on fermentation success and kinetics or on final wine parameters. While acetic acid concentrations were slightly increased in wines after simultaneous AF/MLF, the differences were of neither practical nor legal significance. No statistically signif-icant differences were found {{with regard to the}} final values of pH or total acidity and the concentrations of ethanol, acetaldehyde, glycerol, citric and lactic acids, and the nitrogen compounds arginine, ammonia, urea, citrulline, and ornithine. Sensory evaluation by a semiexpert panel confirmed the similarity of the wines. However, simultaneous inoculation led to considerable reductions in overall fermentation durations. Further...|$|R

Indeed, the majority of field studies have confirmed this response, at least within the first years after onset of warming. Nevertheless, longer-term studies have reported reductions in the warming effect over time. One mechanism for this decline is thermal adaptation of fungal communities, in which mass-specific respiration rates decrease following long-term exposure to warming, possibly owing to changes in efficiencies of enzymes. In addition, evolutionary trade-offs could reduce the ability of warming-adapted strains to use particular carbon substrates or to tolerate drier conditions that often coincide with warming. In respect to N deposition, recent coupled C-N models either (1) allow inorganic N availability to increase decomposition rates overall, or (2) do not include a direct effect of N availability on decomposition. However, meta-analyses indicate that microbes typically become less abundant following N enrichment, with corresponding reductions in respiration rates. In addition, turnover rates of recalcitrant material can decrease. These declines in microbial abundance and activity could result from sensitivity of microbial taxa (particularly white rot fungi) to toxins produced via &#x 201 c;browning&#x 201 d; of <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> by <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds.</b> Moreover, mycorrhizal fungi decrease under N enrichment owing to reduction in investments by host plants. Any decomposition of soil organic matter by mycorrhizal fungi could likewise be|$|R
40|$|Formation of {{nitrogenous}} disinfection by-products (N-DBPs) of {{cyanogen chloride}} (CNCl), dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and chloropicrin was evaluated during chloramination of several selected groups of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>organic</b> (organic-N) <b>compounds,</b> including alpha-amino acids, amines, dipeptides, purines, and pyrimidines, The intermediates generated, reaction pathways, and nitrogen origin in N-DBPs were explored as well. CNCl {{was observed in}} chloramination of all tested organic-N compounds, with glycine giving the highest yields. DCAN was formed during chloramination of glutamic acid, cytosine, cysteine, and tryptophan. Chloramination of most organic-N compounds except for cysteine and glutamic acid generated chloropicrin. Aldehydes and nitriles were identified as the intermediates by negative mode electrospray ionization mass spectrometry during reactions of NH 2 Cl and organic-N compounds. Labeled N- 15 -monochloramine ((NH 2 Cl) -N- 15) techniques showed that nitrogen in N-DBPs may originate from both NH 2 Cl and organic-N compounds and the nitrogen partition percentages vary as functions of reactants and pH.

30|$|The {{increased}} {{yield of}} HCN for the CMHR-FPUR between 650  °C and 850  °C is {{likely due to}} the increased fragmentation of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in the flame, similar to the behaviour during non-flaming combustion in air reported by Woolley et al. (1972). Michal (1982) reported a similar trend at a fixed air flow rate. A sample of rigid polyurethane foam was heated in a static tube furnace with an air flow of 50  ml min− 1 at a range of temperatures from 600 to 1200  °C and the yield of HCN was quantified. The results showed a HCN yield of 15.8  mg g− 1 at 600  °C. The yield was much lower at 800  °C with 7.4  mg g− 1 but at 1000  °C and 1200  °C the yield increased significantly to 33.9  mg g− 1 and 48.1  mg g− 1 respectively. The specific mass of the polyurethane sample was not provided by the author and the ventilation conditions were not clear {{as a result of}} this. The significant increased yields at 1000  °C and 1200  °C could also be attributed to pyrolysis of the nitrogenous combustion products into HCN due to the low air flow rate.|$|R
40|$|Pilot-scale {{tests were}} {{performed}} to reduce {{the formation of a}} range of carbonaceous and nitrogenous disinfection by-products (C-, N-DBPs), by removing or transforming their precursors, with an integrated permanganate oxidation and powdered activated carbon adsorption (PM–PAC) treatment process before conventional water treatment processes (coagulation–sedimentation–filtration, abbreviated as CPs). Compared with the CPs, PM–PAC significantly enhanced the removal of DOC, DON, NH 3 +–N, and algae from 52. 9 %, 31. 6 %, 71. 3 %, and 83. 6 % to 69. 5 %, 61. 3 %, 92. 5 %, and 97. 5 %, respectively. PM pre-oxidation alone and PAC pre-adsorption alone did not substantially reduce the formation of dichloroacetonitrile, trichloroacetonitrile, N-nitrosodimethylamine and dichloroacetamide. However, the PM–PAC integrated process significantly reduced the formation of both C-DBPs and N-DBPs by 60 – 90 % for six C-DBPs and 64 – 93 % for six N-DBPs, because PM oxidation chemically altered the molecular structures of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> and increased the adsorption capacity of the DBP precursors, thus highlighting a synergistic effect of PM and PAC. PM–PAC integrated process is a promising drinking water technology for the reduction of a broad spectrum of C-DBPs and N-DBPs...|$|R

Putrescine, spermidine and spermine are essential {{for the development of}} the gut and immune system of newborns, and are all found in human milk. Little is known, however, about the role of histamine, tyramine or cadaverine in breast milk. Nor is it known whether mastitis alters the BA composition of milk. The BA profile of human milk, and the influence of mastitis on BA concentrations, were therefore investigated. Putrescine, spermidine and spermine were the main BAs detected. In mastitis-affected milk, the concentrations of putrescine, spermine and histamine were higher.
