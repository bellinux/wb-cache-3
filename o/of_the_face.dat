30|$|The {{failure modes}} {{observed}} in the experiments are qualitatively the same for compression and shear. The first failure mode is buckling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell <b>faces.</b> <b>The</b> main mechanism which drives buckling is plasticization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folding edge. If this happens, <b>the</b> “clamping” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> gets weaker and the critical buckling load <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> is decreased. Buckling defines <b>the</b> peak stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stress-strain curve. At this point, there is no rupture in the material.|$|R

5|$|ASL signs have {{a number}} of phonemic components, {{including}} movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime, but iconicity does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.|$|E

5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|DVD film reviews have {{suggested}} the film influenced director John Woo; critics have compared the graphic detail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> transplant scene in Woo's action film Face/Off (1997) {{to the face}} transplant scene in Eyes Without a Face and noted the similarity. Another resemblance is Woo's trademark use of white doves in his films {{that is similar to}} the character Christiane's dove-laden escape in the film's finale.|$|E
5|$|During {{human and}} all {{vertebrate}} development, {{a series of}} pharyngeal arch pairs form in the developing embryo. These project forward {{from the back of}} the embryo towards the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and neck. Each arch develops its own artery, nerve that controls a distinct muscle group, and skeletal tissue. The arches are numbered from 1 to 6, with 1 being the arch closest to the head of the embryo, and the fifth arch only existing transiently.|$|E

5|$|Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian {{consul-general}} in Egypt, {{was able}} to inspect a fragment of the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported {{that it had a}} pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded.

5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E

5|$|Telangiectasia (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in the skin and mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, the nose and the fingers, and on the skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> is exquisitely painful, {{is thought to be}} {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E

Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis). The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} much debate about the {{symbolic}} meaning of the helmet's design. The griffin was the companion of Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance and fate. They were both seen as agents of death and were often linked with gladiatorial combat. The meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and headpiece are less clearly identifiable. Suggestions have ranged from the Greek god Attis and the hero Perseus, to the Roman gods Mithras and Jupiter Dolichenus, to a more general Eastern Mediterranean appearance that could possibly have been meant to suggest a Trojan identity. The Phrygian cap was often used by the Romans as a visual motif representing the Trojans.|$|E
