40|$|Industrial steam users {{recognize}} the need to reduce system cost {{in order to remain}} internationally competitive. Steam systems are a key utility that influence cost significantly, and represent a high value <b>opportunity</b> <b>target.</b> However, the quality of steam is often taken for granted, even overlooked at times. When the recent global recession challenged companies to remain profitable as a first priority, the result was that maintenance budgets were cut and long term cost reduction initiatives for steam systems set aside due to more pressing issues. One of the regrettable results of such actions is that knowledgeable personnel are re-assigned, retired, or released when necessary steam system cost reduction programs are eliminated. When the time arrives to refocus on long term cost reduction by improving the steam system, some programs may have to start from the beginning and a clear path forward may not be evident. New personnel are often tasked with steam improvements when the programs restart, and they may experience difficulty in determining the true key factors that can help reduce system cost. The urgency for lowering long term fuel use and reducing the cost of producing steam is near for each plant. Population growth and resultant global demand are inevitable, so the global economy will expand, production will increase, more fossil fuel energy will be needed, and that fuel will become scarce and more costly. Although fuel prices are low now, energy costs can be expected to trend significantly upward as global production and demand increase. Now is the time for plants to make certain that they can deliver high quality steam to process equipment at lowest system cost. There are three stages to help optimize plant steam for best performance at a low system cost; Phase 1 : Manage the condensate discharge locations (where the steam traps & valves are located), Phase 2 : Optimize steam-using equipment, and Phase 3 : Optimize the entire steam system. This presentation will focus primarily on management of the condensate discharge locations (CDLs) and show sites how to use readily available data to more efficiently achieve goals; but will also provide insight into how the three stages interact to reduce system cost and improve process performance...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyIndustrial {{relations}} in Australia has undergone tumultuous changes since 2005, commencing with the Family Provisions test case decision which granted federal award-covered employees {{a range of}} important new family-friendly provisions, centring on unpaid parental leave. This was followed by Work Choices which largely prevented access to the new entitlements and then the Fair Work Act 2009, which improved family friendly entitlements by legislative change. Both these statutes impacted on how unions could engage in collective bargaining for family provisions. This thesis answers several research questions arising from these developments which are of critical importance to industrial relations practitioners, policy makers and researchers: Would selected Australian unions negotiate for family provisions in a changing industrial relations and social policy environment? If so, does this constitute ‘equality bargaining’? What are the facilitative or inhibitive factors which impact on the equality bargaining processes and outcomes? The theory and concept of equality bargaining, applied and developed in the EU, UK and Canada by key authors such as Dickens (1998), Heery (2006 b) and Briskin (2006) can explain how bargaining for family provisions and other equality items is undertaken. Based on five rich case studies of bargaining undertaken by four key Australian unions, collective negotiations for new or increased family provisions are followed in diverse sectors using equality bargaining theories. This thesis makes two important contributions to existing research on equality bargaining. First, the case studies show that there are different types of equality bargaining, which form a continuum ranging from ‘narrow’, where only {{one or a few}} gender equality items are negotiated, to ‘transformational’ equality bargaining, which seeks to achieve substantive equality for a range of equal <b>opportunity</b> <b>target</b> groups. Second, the research reveals a range of facilitative and inhibitive factors which impacted on the equality bargaining, some of which are new, others which reinforce previous findings. Four significant findings arise from the Australian case studies. First, the union negotiators mostly engaged in narrow equality bargaining which was symbolic of a commitment to gender equality, with the most common symbol being a paid maternity leave clause of some form. The negotiations, however, did not progress towards making real changes within the workplace to achieve substantive gender equality. Nevertheless, the negotiations undertaken indicate that equality bargaining is occurring in Australia. Second, the external environment has a profound impact on equality bargaining. The wider economic, industrial relations and related social policy environment all {{had a significant impact on}} the equality bargaining undertaken. The main external factor which impacted on all the case study negotiations was the Productivity Commission’s paid parental leave inquiry and the associated campaign conducted by unions and community groups. Third, industry and organisational level factors are critical for equality bargaining. The use of a common or ‘core’ claim for an industry, developed by union leaders and members and used throughout all negotiations, has been shown to be an effective way to progress equality bargaining. While union leadership is essential in the development of a core claim, strong union leadership is also necessary to progress gender equality issues throughout the negotiations and overcome any dissent from union members as well as employers. Fourth, two main inhibitive factors for equality bargaining are identified. The first is the government’s new paid parental leave scheme, as both employer and union negotiators reasoned that possible government action on this front made it unnecessary to introduce or increase this entitlement through collective bargaining. The second inhibitive factor was ‘majoritarianism’ (Blackett and Shepperd, 2003), where items of benefit to women are traded off for items to benefit the whole workforce. Majoritarianism emanated from both union delegates and union leadership within separate unions. This thesis shows that equality bargaining is a useful concept to improve understanding of collective bargaining in 21 st century Australia, where women make up almost 50 per cent of the workforce and where family responsibilities have a significant bearing on employment capabilities. In an applied sense, the thesis shows the need – and potential – for equality bargaining in Australia is significant. Equality bargaining is a vital area not only to ensure that unions fully represent the needs of their members and secure relevant provisions, but also to ease the strains of working life for both male and female employees. The unions featured in this thesis have started to move in this direction, demonstrating that even while equality bargaining is currently narrow and symbolic, it is also emerging as a highly relevant framework for collective bargaining...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} {{a wealth of}} research into the concept of career stages {{and the relationship between}} these stages and the needs, attitudes and behaviours of individuals in the workforce. This high level of research interest has been fuelled by the belief that the human factor is the most critical factor in the success of organisations today and if organisations are to remain competitive in a rapidly changing environment they need to better understand the development needs, work-related attitudes and career concerns of their employees. Whilst a diverse range of career stage models have been put forward over the past fifty years, the models proposed by Super, Crites, Hummel, Moser, Overstreet and Warnath (1957) (psychological fit) and Levinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson and McKee (1978) (age) have received considerable research attention and are generally considered to be the most useful in explaining the needs, attitudes and behaviours of individuals over the course of their career. Research into career stages has been conducted using a wide range of occupational groups. Only a limited number of researchers, however, have sought to test the utility of career stage concepts using a police sample. Despite their popularity and strong theoretical and empirical grounding, there is no known research that has tested the utility of Super et al. (1957) and Levinson et al. ’s (1978) models of career stage using a police sample. The purpose of this study therefore was to contribute to the literature on career stage theory by testing the utility of these models of career stage in explaining the job satisfaction and work commitment of Queensland police officers. The study also explored the influence of other background variables that may also impact on job satisfaction and work commitment. The sample consisted of 246 police officers from the Metropolitan South Region of the Queensland Police Service. A cross sectional design was used to gather the data for the study. The Adult Career Concerns Inventory (ACCI) was used to group respondents into a career stage according to Super et al. ’s conceptualisation of career stage. Respondents were also grouped into age-based career stages according to Levinson et al. ’s conceptualisation of career stage. The study used established survey instruments to collect data on five facets of job satisfaction, these being satisfaction with pay, promotion, supervision, co-workers and work and five facets of work commitment, these being organisational commitment, job involvement, Protestant work ethic, career commitment and union commitment. Data was also collected on the background variables of organisational and occupational tenure, rank, gender, education level and type, type of duty performed, marital status, completion of the Queensland Police Service’s Management Development Program and membership of an Equal Employment <b>Opportunity</b> <b>target</b> group. A series of MANOVAs were used to explore the relationship between the career stage and other background variables and the various facets of job satisfaction and work commitment. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine if the results were being confounded by relationships with other independent variables. The current study failed to find any evidence to support the utility of Levinson et al. ’s model in explaining job satisfaction and work commitment for Queensland Police officers. Whilst some significant differences in job satisfaction and work commitment between Levinson et al. ’s age groupings were identified, none of the findings were consistent with the assumptions of their model. In fact, there was some evidence of differences in job-related attitudes across age groupings that directly contradict the assumptions of the Levinson et al. model. The current study also found no support for the utility of Super et al. ’s model in explaining the job satisfaction of police officers. Some limited support, however, was found for the utility of Super et al. ’s model in predicting work commitment, most notably with respect to organisational commitment, job involvement and career commitment. Differences in mean organisational commitment, job involvement and career commitment scores generally supported the propositions of Super et al., however, only the results for the exploration and disengagement stages reached statistical significance. Statistically significant relationships were found for the background variables of organisational tenure, rank, gender and type of duty. Statistically significant relationships were found for several facets of job satisfaction and work commitment. Work-related attitudes were generally found to peak {{in the first two years}} of a police officer’s tenure and then decline as tenure increased. The reason for this decline is complex and not completely clear, but may be at least partially explained by: the structural characteristics of police services; the distinct lack of support and confidence in officers; the influence of the police sub-culture; and the existence of a phenomenon known as police ‘bullshit’. Commissioned officers were found to be significantly more satisfied with promotions and constables were found to have significantly higher levels of organisational commitment than senior constables and sergeants and significantly higher levels of career commitment than sergeants. Other statistically significant relationships found in the current study include female officers reporting significantly higher levels of satisfaction with promotions than male officers and general duties officers reporting significantly higher levels of satisfaction with promotions than officers performing specialist duties and significantly higher levels of loyalty to the union than plain-clothes officers. The study concluded by highlighting the pioneering nature of the current study. It was suggested that considerably more research is necessary in order to clarify and refine the conceptualisation and measurement of police career stages and the relationship between these stages and work-related attitudes. It was recommended that future research should verify and extend the results of the current study, particularly with respect to the influence of tenure as a career stage variable and the nature and role of disengagement in any conceptualisation of career stage for police...|$|E

50|$|Control, {{sometimes}} called tactical fire control, is {{primarily concerned with}} 'targeting' and the allotment of fire units to targets. This is vital when a target is within range of many fire units {{and the number of}} fire units needed depends {{on the nature of the}} target, and the circumstances and purpose of its engagement. Targeting is concerned with selecting the right weapons in the right quantities to achieve the required effects on the target. Allotment attempts to address the artillery dilemma—important targets are rarely urgent and urgent targets are rarely important. Of course importance is a matter of perspective; what is important to a divisional commander is rarely the same as what is important to an infantry platoon commander.Broadly, there are two situations: fire against <b>opportunity</b> <b>targets,</b> and targets whose engagement is planned as part of a particular operation.

50|$|Control of fire against <b>opportunity</b> <b>targets</b> is an {{important}} differentiator between different types of artillery system. In some armies, only designated artillery HQs have the tactical fire control authority to order fire units to engage a target, all 'calls for fire' being requests to these HQs. This authority may also extend to deciding the type and quantity of ammunition to be used. In other armies, an 'authorised observer' (for example, artillery observation team or other target acquisition element) can order fire units to engage. In the latter case, a battery observation team can order fire to their own battery and may be authorised to order fire to their own battalion, and sometimes to many battalions. For example, a divisional artillery commander may authorise selected observers to order fire to the entire divisional artillery. When observers or cells are not authorised, they can still request fire.|$|R
