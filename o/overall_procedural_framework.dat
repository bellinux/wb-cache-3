The amendment introduced other requirements, such as knowledge of Dzongkha and adherence to Ngalop customs. The amendment also introduced a <b>procedural</b> <b>framework</b> for citizenship and naturalization; namely it codified procedural requirements for census registration and births abroad and designated the Ministry of Home Affairs as the government agency to oversee immigration matters.

40|$|Rule-application {{skills such}} as simple {{arithmetic}} are often used as components ofcomplex, goal-directed routines, and evidence suggests that goals to perform such skills can be instantiated in advance of information about specific operands. The <b>procedural</b> <b>framework</b> hypothesis is that goal instantiation evokes frameworks that guide the application of procedural knowledge, suggesting distinct processing roles for operator and operand symbols. In contrast, he uniform role hypothesis suggests that both types of symbols erve only as retrieval cues. Participants in 4 experiments solved simple Boolean or standard arithmetic problems. Serial display of problem elements showed a consistent solution-time benefit for operator-first displays compared with operands-first displays, supporting the <b>procedural</b> <b>framework</b> hypothesis for both new and highly practiced skills.

40|$|Service Oriented Virtual Organizations (SOVOs) {{business}} processes {{and services are}} subject to change to meet the internal and external requirements of the competitive, complex and rapidly changing environment they operate in. More practical and efficient ways of change management are needed to allow different partners to initiate changes to their business process and services in a faster and user-transparent manner. This thesis proposes a Change Management Framework for service oriented virtual organizations including a structural and a <b>procedural</b> <b>framework.</b> The structural framework categorizes changes in the SOVO into three layers of change; which include the value network layer, the collaborative process layer and the service providers’ layer, and identifies the impact of change on each layer. Furthermore, the structural framework identifies various triggers of changes which eventually lead to actions taken at the three layers. The change management <b>procedural</b> <b>framework</b> is derived from the ITIL V 3, ECM and ECOLEAD best practices and recommendations, customized to fit the SOVO change requirements. It provides different components including the six layers for change processes, change control, change actors and related management processes. The change management <b>procedural</b> <b>framework</b> provides a sequence of steps and methods that the SOVO and its participated organizations can follow in initiating changes to their {{business processes}} or services. We design an implementation architecture and a prototype for building the change management console which enables the SOVO change management participants to initiate, assess, collaborate, monitor and authorize changes. The prototype is developed to realize and validate the change management process of change in the SOVO environment. We employ the various capabilities of the IBM Business Process Management (BPM) (including its recent Web 2. 0 capabilities) to increase the collaboration between partners in the process of change. We demonstrate that the proposed solutions facilitate and enhance the process of change by effectively engaging the SOVO partners in the process of change...|$|R
