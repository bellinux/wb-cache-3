5|$|On 15 July 2007, Kelly Johnson died of spinal cancer, {{after six}} years <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> therapy and {{treatment}} of her illness. At Kelly’s memorial, Tracey Lamb read the eulogy she had written for her. The band performed a tribute gig on 20 August 2007 at the Soho Revue Bar in London, with many of Johnson’s friends and former Girlschool’s members and a concert for Cancer Research UK at Rock of Ages Fest in Tamworth on 8 September 2007.|$|E

25|$|Pain is {{studied in}} a {{laboratory}} setting due to the greater amount of control that can be exerted. For example, the modality, intensity, and timing <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> stimuli can be controlled with much more precision. Within this setting {{there are two main}} ways that referred pain is studied.|$|E
25|$|Toxic effects {{occur with}} {{prolonged}} high intake. The specific toxicity {{is related to}} exposure time and the exposure concentration. A medical sign of chronic poisoning is the presence <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> tender swellings on the long bones. Anorexia, skin lesions, hair loss, hepatosplenomegaly, papilloedema, bleeding, general malaise, pseudotumor cerebri, and death may also occur.|$|E

25|$|According to Ward and Ogden's {{qualitative}} {{study on the}} experience of vaginismus (1994), the three most common contributing factors to vaginismus are fear <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> sex; the belief that sex is wrong or shameful (often the case with patients who had a strict religious upbringing); and traumatic early childhood experiences (not necessarily sexual in nature).|$|E
25|$|Many Swedish {{children}} {{are allowed to}} eat sweets only on Saturdays - lördagsgodis ("Saturday Candy").

25|$|Common {{causes of}} oral {{ulceration}} include rubbing on sharp edges of teeth, fillings, crowns, false teeth (dentures), or braces (orthodontic appliances). Accidental biting {{caused by a}} lack of awareness <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> stimuli in the mouth (e.g., following local anesthetic used during dental treatment) may cause ulceration which the person becomes aware of as the anesthetic wears off and the full sensation returns.|$|E
25|$|One line of {{research}} consistently finds that supposedly different forms of psychotherapy show similar effectiveness—historically dubbed the Dodo bird verdict because all win. Further analyses seek to identify the factors that the psychotherapies have in common that seem to account for this, known as common factors theory; for example {{the quality of the}} therapeutic relationship, interpretation of problem, and the confrontation <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> emotions.|$|E
25|$|Some {{confusion}} {{was introduced}} when Smith and Allen suggested changing {{the name to}} erythermalgia in order to emphasise the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> inflammation and warmth. In their paper they showed {{for the first time}} that when their patients used aspirin, this promptly relieved the burning pain for about three days. They also suggested a distinction between primary (idiopathic) erythromelalgia and secondary erythromelalgia (due to underlying neurologic, hematologic, or vascular problems).|$|E

25|$|In 1814 noblemen {{were leading}} when a {{constitutional}} monarchy and a parliament {{were established in}} Norway. Among them were the Count of Wedel-Jarlsberg, Peder Anker, and Christian Magnus Falsen. The Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway of 1814, which is still in function, was written by a nobleman, namely by Falsen. This constitution grants, among other things, freedom of speech, protection of private property, and prohibition <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> search and seizure.|$|E
25|$|Nearly {{all people}} with Behçet's disease present with some form <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> ulcerations inside the mouth. They are {{a form of}} aphthous ulcers or non-scarring oral lesions. The oral lesions {{are similar to those}} found in {{inflammatory}} bowel disease and can be relapsing. Painful genital ulcerations usually develop around the anus, vulva, or scrotum and cause scarring in 75 percent of the patients. Additionally, patients may present with erythema nodosum, cutaneous pustular vasculitis, and lesions similar to pyoderma gangrenosum.|$|E
25|$|Overall, Rivers {{attributed}} the neuroses to both (i) the escape <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> instincts and their associated emotions from the unconscious and (ii) the mind's unsuccessful efforts to force such instincts and their emotions {{back into the}} conscious. While Rivers' theory contains some Freudian elements, {{it is not simply}} a restatement of psychoanalytic theory; Rivers' theory of the neuroses draws heavily on the neurological observations and conclusions Rivers and Henry Head drew from their work on nerve regeneration.|$|E

25|$|Central neuropathic pain {{is found}} in spinal cord injury, {{multiple}} sclerosis, and some strokes. Aside from diabetes (see diabetic neuropathy) and other metabolic conditions, the common causes <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> peripheral neuropathies are herpes zoster infection, HIV-related neuropathies, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, remote manifestations of malignancies, immune mediated disorders and physical trauma to a nerve trunk. Neuropathic pain is common in cancer {{as a direct result}} of cancer on peripheral nerves (e.g., compression by a tumor), or as a side effect of chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), radiation injury or surgery.|$|E
25|$|In 660, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu toured Bian Prefecture (modern day Taiyuan), and Empress Wu had the {{opportunity}} to invite her old neighbors and relatives to a feast. Later that year, Emperor Gaozong began to suffer from an illness that carried the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> headaches and loss of vision, generally thought to be hypertension-related, and he began to have Empress Wu make rulings on petitions made by officials. It was said that Empress Wu had quick reactions and understood both literature and history, and therefore, she was making correct rulings. Thereafter, her authority rivalled Emperor Gaozong's.|$|E
25|$|If fetal {{hemoglobin}} remains the predominant form of hemoglobin after birth, the number <b>of</b> <b>painful</b> episodes decreases {{in patients with}} sickle-cell disease. Hydroxyurea promotes the production of {{fetal hemoglobin}} and can thus be used to treat sickle-cell disease. The fetal hemoglobin's reduction in {{the severity of the}} disease comes from its ability to inhibit the formation of hemoglobin aggregates within red blood cells which also contain hemoglobin S. Combination therapy with hydroxyurea and recombinant erythropoietinrather than treatment with hydroxyurea alonehas been shown to further elevate hemoglobin F levels and to promote the development of HbF-containing F-cells.|$|E
