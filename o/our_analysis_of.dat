The laws of mind as {{characterized}} in {{the preceding}} chapter, compose the universal or abstract portion of the philosophy of human nature; and all the truths of common experience, constituting a practical knowledge of mankind, must, {{to the extent to}} which they are truths, be results or consequences of these.

60|$|Enough has, I hope, {{been said}} {{to show that}} {{consciousness}} is far too complex and accidental to be taken as the fundamental characteristic of mind. We have seen that belief and images both enter into it. Belief itself, {{as we saw in}} an earlier lecture, is complex. Therefore, if any definition of mind is suggested by <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, images are what would naturally suggest themselves. But since we found that images can only be defined causally, we cannot deal with this suggestion, except in connection with the difference between physical and psychological causal laws.|$|E

60|$|In Lecture I we {{criticized the}} {{analysis}} of a presentation into act, content and object. But <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> belief contains three very similar elements, namely the believing, what is believed and the objective. The objections to the act ({{in the case of}} presentations) are not valid against the believing in the case of beliefs, because the believing is an actual experienced feeling, not something postulated, like the act. But it is necessary first to complete our preliminary requisites, and then to examine the content of a belief. After that, we shall {{be in a position to}} return to the question as to what constitutes believing.|$|E
60|$|A {{very common}} causal group {{consists}} of volitions {{and the consequent}} bodily acts, though exceptions arise (for example) through sudden paralysis. Another very frequent connection (though here the exceptions are much more numerous) is between a bodily act and the realisation of the purpose {{which led to the}} act. These connections are patent, whereas the causes of desires are more obscure. Thus it is natural to begin causal series with desires, to suppose that all causes are analogous to desires, and that desires themselves arise spontaneously. Such a view, however, is not one which any serious psychologist would maintain. But this brings us {{to the question of the}} application of <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> cause to the problem of free will.|$|E
60|$|It {{is a true}} {{analysis}} of the atmosphere, so far as regards the quantity of oxygen and the quantity of nitrogen present. By our analysis, we find that 5 pints of the atmosphere contain only 1 pint of oxygen, and 4 pints, or 4 parts, of nitrogen by bulk. That is <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere. It requires all that quantity of nitrogen to reduce the oxygen down, {{so as to be}} able to supply the candle properly with fuel, so as to supply us with an atmosphere which our lungs can healthily and safely breathe; for it is just as important to make the oxygen right for us to breathe, as it is to make the atmosphere right for the burning of the fire and the candle.|$|E

6000|$|If we {{have been}} right in <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> mind, the {{ultimate}} data of psychology are only sensations and images and their relations. Beliefs, desires, volitions, and so on, appeared to us to be complex phenomena consisting of sensations and images variously interrelated. Thus (apart from certain relations) the occurrences which seem most distinctively mental, and furthest removed from physics, are, like physical objects, constructed or inferred, {{not part of the}} original stock of data in the perfected science. From both ends, therefore, the difference between physical and psychological data is diminished. Is there ultimately no difference, or do images remain as irreducibly and exclusively psychological? In view of the causal definition of the difference between images and sensations, this brings us to a new question, namely: Are the causal laws of psychology different from those of any other science, or are they really physiological? ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. In all {{branches}} of practical business {{there are cases}} in which individuals are bound to conform their practice to a pre-established rule, while there are others {{in which it is}} part of their task to find or construct the rule by which they are to govern their conduct. The first, for example, is the case of a judge, under a definite written code. The judge is not called upon to determine what course would be intrinsically the most advisable in the particular case in hand, but only within what rule of law it falls; what the legislature has ordained {{to be done in the}} kind of case, and must therefore be presumed to have intended in the individual case. The method must here be wholly and exclusively one of ratiocination, or syllogism; and the process is obviously, what in <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the syllogism we showed that all ratiocination is, namely the interpretation of a formula.|$|E

Instead of restricting programmers' freedom, we extend Java language to support multithreaded exception handling and propose a tool to detect uncaught exceptions in the input programs. <b>Our</b> <b>analysis</b> consists <b>of</b> two steps. The analysis firstly estimates concurrently evaluated expressions of the multithreads in Java programs by the synchronization relation among the threads. Using this concurrency information, program's exception flow is derived as set-constraints, whose least model is <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> result.

60|$|We {{found that}} <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the organic world, whether animals or plants, showed, {{in the long}} run, that they might both be reduced into, and were, in fact, {{composed}} of, the same constituents. And we saw that the plant obtained the materials constituting its substance by a peculiar combination of matters belonging entirely to the inorganic world; that, then, the animal was constantly appropriating the nitrogenous matters of the plant to its own nourishment, and returning {{them back to the}} inorganic world, in what we spoke of as its waste; and that finally, when the animal ceased to exist, the constituents of its body were dissolved and transmitted to that inorganic world whence they had been at first abstracted. Thus we saw in both the blade of grass and the horse but the same elements differently combined and arranged. We discovered a continual circulation going on,--the plant drawing in the elements of inorganic nature and combining them into food for the animal creation; the animal borrowing from the plant the matter for its own support, giving off during its life products which returned immediately to the inorganic world; and that, eventually, the constituent materials of the whole structure of both animals and plants were thus returned to their original source: there was a constant passage from one state of existence to another, and a returning back again.|$|E
60|$|It was shown, however, in <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> {{the effects}} of {{international}} trade, {{as it had been}} often shown by former writers, that the importation of foreign commodities, in the common course of traffic, never takes place except when it is, economically speaking, a national good, by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country. To prohibit, therefore, this importation, or impose duties which prevent it, is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be, and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad. The amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported. In the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor, or of the capital which supports that labor. Those who are supposed to be benefited, namely, the makers of the protected articles (unless they form an exclusive company, and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners), do not obtain higher profits than other people. All is sheer loss to the country {{as well as to the}} consumer.|$|E
