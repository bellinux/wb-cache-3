40|$|Tongue coating is {{the most}} common cause of oral {{halitosis}} and eating results in its reduction. Only limited data are available on the effect of different food items on tongue coating and halitosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single consumption of food with high fiber content versus low fiber content on halitosis parameters. Based on a randomized clinical cross-over study, 20 subjects were examined over a period of 2. 5 hours after consumption of a high-fiber and a low-fiber meal. The determination of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) was performed using a Halimeter, and the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> of halitosis was done on the basis of a distance index. The tongue coating was determined using a modified Winkel index, and the mouth sensation was evaluated subjectively by the subjects. In both the test and the control phase, a statistically significant reduction of all selected parameters was detected (p< 0. 05). Only for the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> of halitosis was a statistically significantly higher reduction found after consumption of a high-fiber meal compared to the control meal (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, the consumption of the meals in this study resulted in an at least 2. 5 -hour reduction of oral halitosis. The chewing-intensive (high-fiber) meal even resulted in a slightly higher reduction of oral halitosis in terms of <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> (p< 0. 05) ...|$|E

40|$|An <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> of an odor {{is defined}} as a method that can measure the {{strength}} of target odors and expresses the value in terms of a point or number with reference to a pre-defined organoleptic scale. Organoleptic assessments are performed using different scales and are used widely in industry (e. g. for measuring the effectiveness of anti-odor agents), in research (to discover relationships between bad breath and microbiology of the tongue, or the generation of particular volatile compounds), {{but it is also a}} prerequisite for the diagnosis of halitosis in individual patients required before directing appropriate treatment. An <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> of halitosis patients may be carried out in specialized institutions but [...] based on the fact that in most cases the odor originates from oral structures [...] also by dental professionals including general dental practitioners (GDPs). Thus, this paper describes the scientific background for recommendations on how a GDP or dental hygienist or general practitioner with cases of bad breath should use organoleptic methods as a valid approach to assess malodor in patients, with a view to diagnosis and treatment, and subsequent treatment monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological data on {{halitosis}} are rare. In {{this study}} we evaluated the prevalence of halitosis in {{the population of the}} city of Bern, Switzerland, using a standardized questionnaire and clinical examination. First of all, a standardized questionnaire was filled out by all 419 participants. In the clinical examination, 'objective' values for halitosis were gathered through two different <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessments</b> and by the measurement of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). Additionally, tongue coating and the modified periodontal screening index (PSI) were evaluated for each participant. The questionnaire revealed that 32 % of all subjects sometimes or often experienced halitosis. The organoleptic evaluation (grade 0 - 5) identified 48 persons with grade 3 and higher. Measurement of VSC identified 117 subjects (28 %) with readings of >or= 75 parts per billion (ppb). Tongue coating, modified PSI, and smoking were significantly associated with higher organoleptic scores, and tongue coating and smoking were associated with higher VSC values. For about one-third of the Bernese city population, halitosis seems to pose an oral health problem.

Subjects and MethodsOne hundred and fifty-one caries-free children were included. After clinical evaluation, halitosis was determined by <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> and sulphide monitoring. Then, 69 children {{with high levels of}} volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) were randomly assigned into two groups (group 1 : scaling-polishing + tooth brushing + tongue brushing and group 2 : scaling-polishing + tooth brushing), and tongue coating samples were collected for microbiological analysis. After 2 weeks, VSC measurements, <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment,</b> clinical evaluations and sample collection were repeated. ResultsIn both groups, organoleptic scores, VSC levels, gingival index, plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing and Winkel tongue coating index (WTCI) scores decreased after 15 days. However, only the change in WTCI and PI scores showed a statistically significant intergroup difference. The most prevalent anaerobic bacteria were Veillonella spp., Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium spp., and no intergroup difference was observed in terms of colony counts of bacteria. ConclusionsTongue brushing did not provide an additional benefit to the treatment for malodour.

Patients were {{selected on the basis of}} (1) halitosis of oral origin, (2) full-mouth organoleptic score > 1, using an arbitrary 0 - 5 scale, (3) level of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) > 170 parts per billion (ppb) and (4) Winkel tongue coating index (WTCI) > 4 (0 - 12). Intervention included gargling with a mouthrinse containing chlorhexidine (0. 05 %), cetylpyridinium chloride (0. 05 %) and zinc-lactate (0. 14 %) or with a placebo mouthrinse without active ingredients. At days 0 and 14 clinical variables were assessed in order of performance: (1) <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessments,</b> (2) levels of VSC, and (3) WTCI. Results: Treatment with the active mouthrinse resulted in a significant mean reduction in the organoleptic score from 2. 8 to 1. 5 (p < 0. 005). In the placebo group, no significant reduction in the mean organoleptic score occurred. Consequently, this resulted, after 2 weeks, in a greater change of the organoleptic scores in the test group in comparison to the placebo group (p < 0. 005). The mean VSC scores were reduced from 292 to 172 ppb in the test group (p < 0. 005), whereas no reduction was observed in the placebo group.

40|$|Introduction: Halitosis can {{be tested}} using two main methods, <b>organoleptic</b> and <b>assessment</b> of {{volatile}} sulfur compounds (VSCs), using an electronic meter like Halimeter. Therefore, {{the present study was}} conducted to measure the oral malodor of volunteers by means of the organoleptic method and VSCs monitoring and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the Halimeter in the diagnosis of halitosis. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted to compare the two diagnostic aids for halitosis. The study population included 110 volunteers, all males, between the ages of 18 and 45 years selected from academic staff, students, and patients of college. Evaluation and comparison of two main methods for halitosis were done, namely, organoleptic and Halimeter. Specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and disease prevalence were calculated for the sulfide monitor test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the diagnostic values of Halimeter to differentiate individuals with and without halitosis. Results: The correlation coefficient between VSC grading and organoleptic score (Kendall′s tau-b) was − 0. 1090, which was not significant (P = 0. 2170). Sensitivity and specificity of sulfide monitor grades for detecting individuals with and without halitosis were 20. 75 % and 66. 67 %, respectively. The PPV for the Halimeter was 36. 67 %, and the NPV was 47. 50 %. A total of 48. 18 % of all subjects were accurately identified and differentiated.

The apoform of egg white riboflavin binding protein (RfBP) was more efficient in reducing radical formation than an apo-flavodoxin protein isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii. <b>Organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> clearly indicated that the addition of apo-RfBP to model beer solutions, containing stiochiometric amounts of riboflavin as well a...|$|E

A total of one hundred and four live catfish (average weight 700. 07. 0 g) was slaughtered and smoked. Ten freshly slaughtered fish samples were selected for <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> at 0, 4, 8 and 12 h post-slaughter respectively. Three fresh and smoked fish samples each were selected for chemical and microbial analyses using standard analytical procedures. Microbial load on both fresh and smoked fish samples increased significantly (p - 1 for fresh fish samples and lowest and highest values of 2. 040. 02 and 3. 090. 10 Log Cfu g - 1 respectively for smoked fish samples. Bacteria isolates identified from fresh samples included: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus spp and Staphylococcus aureus; while E. coli, S. aureus and Bacillus spp. were isolated from smoked fish samples. Protein and ash contents of fresh fish samples increased progressively with increasing PSI while moisture content decreased; and lipid content remained unchanged. Protein, lipid and ash contents of smoked C. gariepinus significantly (p C. gariepinus should be smoked immediately after slaughter for best quality hot-smoked fish products...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is The effect of feeding wheat with a high content of lutein on sensory meat quality of broiler chickens. The work deals with the {{importance}} and quality of poultry meat. It describes {{the evaluation of the}} quality of poultry meat and principles for the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment.</b> An attempt was made to brojlerovými chickens Ross 308. The chickens were divided into groups and fed with a feed mixture which was represented from 60 % and 30 % wheat. The experimental groups were included the wheat Citrus, in control groups the common wheat. This was followed by a 14 -day experiment with chickens fed only wheat meal 100 %. After the sloughtering of all chickens was monitored the carcass yield and the parameters of meat quality (dry matter, fat, N* 6, pH). When determining the effect of feed on meat quality were subjected to sensory evaluation of breast and thigh meat. By the descriptor juiciness of the breast meat was scored the group 60 % Citrus as the best. The groups of chickens fed only wheat meal were evaluated negatively in all sensory parameters...|$|E
40|$|The Australasian {{section of}} the American Oil Chemists Society (AAOCS) held their {{biennial}} meeting in Adelaide, Australia on 8 – 11 November 2011. Over 70 scientists, researchers and industry representatives gathered for three days of talks and discussions on lipid related topics. A highlight was the hot topic symposium on the new olive oil standard being introduced in Australia. Paul Miller, Australian Olives Association, gave a compelling address on why the standard was needed. He demonstrated {{that the increase in}} price and demand for high quality olive oils has led to products falsely or misleadingly labelled. Furthermore, the genetic and seasonal variation in minor components of olive oil has led to misclassifications. An extensive scientific and political process in Australia and overseas led to development of this new standard. Dr. Leandro Ravetti, Mordern Olives, demonstrated the development of two new methods, for analysis of pyropheophytins and diacylglycerols, are good indicators of modification by deodorisation of oils and show excellent correlation with <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> with aging/degradation of extra virgin olive oils. Professor Rod Mailer finished this session with studies of actual adulteration cases in Australia and overseas, further highlighting the need for this new standard. [ [...] . ...|$|E

This research used Complete Randomized Design (CRD) with four treatments and four replications. The treatments were P 1 (65 % pumpkin flour, 5 % tempe flour), P 2 (60 % pumpkin flour, 10 % tempe flour), P 3 (55 % pumpkin flour, 15 % tempe flour) and P 4 (50 % pumpkin flour, 20 % tempe flour). Data were analized using ANOVA and DNMRT at 5 % level. The result showed that cookies from different pumpkin flour and tempe flour gave the significant effect to the moisture content, ash content, protein content, β-caroten content, valuation of description organoleptic and valuation of hedonic organoleptic to the colour, flavor, taste, total value, but non significant to texture in hedonic value and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> to the level of children like of cookies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether patients with diagnosed erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (ERD) have an increased probability of halitosis and tongue coating compared to patients with nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (NERD). MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-six patients (33 males and 33 females) were recruited for the study and received an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The presence of ERD (n[*]=[*] 31) and NERD (n[*]=[*] 35) was classified based on the Los Angeles classification for erosive changes in the esophagus. Additionally, the patients filled in a questionnaire regarding their subjective assessment of halitosis, and an <b>organoleptic</b> <b>assessment</b> of halitosis, a measurement of oral volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) with the Halimeter, and a tongue coating index were performed. ERD and NERD subjects were compared with regard to Halitosis-related clinical and anamnestic findings. RESULTS No statistically significant difference could be found between ERD and NERD patients regarding tongue coating index, organoleptic scores, and VSC values as well as self-perceived bad taste, tongue coating, and bad breath. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that halitosis is not typically associated with erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease and the presence of esophageal mucosal damage (ERD patients). CLINICAL RELEVANCE The data of this investigation support the findings of interdisciplinary bad breath clinics that gastroesophageal reflux disease is not a leading cause for halitosis...|$|E
