5|$|Vegetables can {{be eaten}} either raw or cooked and play an {{important}} role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber.

5|$|Dyer {{took his}} role as a {{physical}} culture expert very seriously and insisted on managing the diet of his boxers. He was also at the forefront of a fad in the mid-1920s which was based on a diet <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable drinks, a lifestyle choice that he believed could cure all illnesses. Dyer continued in his career as a physical culture expert into the next decade and was still working out of London in that capacity in 1939.|$|E
40|$|Minority {{communities}} across the United States have limited numbers of stores that offer a variety <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables, creating major barriers to good eating habits and nutritional practices among minority groups such as African Americans. Factors like environmental availability of healthy food options have not been fully investigated as possible sources of current cross-population differences in disease. The present study examined whether a predominantly African American neighborhood had disproportionately less availability <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables than a predominantly non-Hispanic White neighborhood. Availability was judged on the bases {{of the types of}} stores available in each community and the specific types <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables made available in each store. The availability <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables in the food stores of each community was assessed by physically canvassing neighborhood food stores and taking a census <b>of</b> available <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable items based on a list <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables derived from the DASH diet. The predominantly African American community under study had fewer varieties <b>of</b> fresh <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables and fewer stores offering larger varieties <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables. Reduced choice to purchase <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables among minority populations potentially increases health disparities. Improving local food environments is one important strategy to increase access to a healthy diet in minority communities...|$|R

5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application.

There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Intake <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> {{vegetables}} has {{protective effects}} against stroke attack. This study intended {{to examine the}} status <b>of</b> consuming <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables {{and to find out}} which factors may influence the frequency <b>of</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables in individuals with a history of stroke. Methods: The data of 208 subjects from 5 th (2010, 2011) Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHNES) who reported a stroke diagnosis was used for analysis. To identify major factors influencing the consumption <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables, a classification-tree analysis was carried out. Results: Among those who reported a stroke diagnosis, the frequencies <b>of</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables were influenced by their age, place of residence (urban or rural), economic status, educational level, occupation, number of family members, frequency of eating out, and having meals (breakfast or lunch) with family members.

5|$|The first {{extension}} of Smithfield's meat market {{took place between}} 1873 and 1876 {{with the construction of}} the Poultry Market immediately west of the Central Market. A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field (now West Smithfield), comprising gardens, a fountain and a ramped carriageway to the station beneath the market building. Further buildings were subsequently added to the market. The General Market, built between 1879 and 1883, was intended to replace the old Farringdon Market located nearby and established for the sale <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 1826–1830.|$|E

5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E
40|$|Poor {{diet and}} {{physical}} inactivity are important {{factors contributing to}} the increase in overweight and obesity in the U.

5|$|The Superintendent of Waterways and Parks (Shuiheng duwei 水衡都尉) {{was also}} known as the Chief Commandant of Waterways and Parks, and was once a {{subordinate}} of the Minister Steward until 115 BC, when he, and other former subordinates of that ministry, became independent officers. His salary-rank was equivalent to 2000–dan. The Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed a large imperial hunting park located outside Chang'an, including its palaces, rest stops, granaries, and cultivated patches <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable gardens, which, along with game meat, provided food for the emperor's household. He also collected taxes from commoners using the park's grounds and transmitted these funds to the Minister Steward, who managed the emperor's finances. One of the Superintendent's subordinates supervised convicted criminals in their care of the park's hunting dogs.|$|E
5|$|The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans {{recommends}} consuming five to nine servings <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables daily. The {{total amount}} consumed will {{vary according to}} age and gender, and is determined based upon the standard portion sizes typically consumed, as well as general nutritional content. Potatoes {{are not included in}} the count as they are mainly providers of starch. For most vegetables and vegetable juices, one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked. For leafy greens, such as lettuce and spinach, a single serving is typically a full cup. A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients needed for health.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E
