5|$|Connie Smith {{was born}} Constance June Meador on August 14, 1941 to Wilma and Hobart Meador in Elkhart, Indiana. Her parents were {{originally}} from West Virginia, and when Smith was five months old, the family returned there. They would later move to Dungannon, Ohio. Her father was abusive {{when she was}} a child, which would eventually cause her to suffer a mental breakdown {{when she was a}} teenager. When she was seven, her mother divorced her father and married Tom Clark. Clark brought 8 children to the new marriage; Meador brought five, including Smith. The couple would eventually have two more children together, which in total added up to fifteen children. As a child, Smith was surrounded by music. Her stepfather played mandolin, while her brother played fiddle, and her other brother played guitar. On Saturday nights Smith would listen to the Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry</b> radio broadcast. While she was a teenager, she was injured in a lawnmower accident, which nearly cut her leg off. While in the hospital recovering, she was given a guitar and learned how to play different chords. Following the recovery, she began to perform in various local talent contests. In 1959, Smith graduated from Salem-Liberty High School as the class salutatorian.|$|E

25|$|Hay, George D. A Story of the Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry.</b> 1945.|$|E
5000|$|... "George Jones cut Starday Records' {{very first}} album, Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry's</b> New Star, in 1956, and scored several hits for the label {{before moving to}} greener {{pastures}} at Mercury Records. Starday then issued The Crown Prince of Country Music in 1961 to capitalize on Jones' Mercury success by compiling an album of leftover tracks that had not previously appeared on album. As a result, there are no hits to be found, but rather an assortment of rarities such as the Hank Williams-esque ballad [...] "You're in My Heart," [...] which was the B-side of Jones' very first single, [...] "There's No Money in This Deal." [...] Elsewhere, Jones does his best Faron Young impression on [...] "I've Got Five Dollars and It's Saturday Night," [...] and flirts with rockabilly on [...] "One Woman Man" [...] and [...] "Maybe Little Baby." [...] Enthusiasts of Jones' early recordings will enjoy everything here, but the presentation is unfortunately marred by an electronically re-processed stereo effect. The Crown Prince of Country Music, like Jones' first album, Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry's</b> New Star, contains a number of obscure tracks {{that have never been}} reissued on CD, so collectors can only hope that as these songs enter the public domain overseas, a comprehensive anthology of Jones' early sides will finally appear."

5000|$|Don't Go Near the Water is {{the debut}} album of American country music artist Sammy Kershaw. Released in 1991 on Mercury Records, the album {{produced}} four singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts: [...] "Cadillac Style", the title track, [...] "Yard Sale", and [...] "Anywhere but Here", which peaked at numbers 3, 12, 17, and 10, respectively. Also included is [...] "What Am I Worth", a song previously recorded by George Jones on his 1957 debut Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry's</b> New Star. Jones's style {{has been cited}} as one of Kershaw's primary influences. Don't Go Near the Water is certified platinum in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The single's early airplay {{occurred}} in Jones' {{home state of}} Texas, with Houston's country music station KIKK ranking it number one locally. [...] Their charts were sent to stations around the country, which began {{to pick it up}} as well, partially overcoming Starday's regionally limited distribution. However, its progress on the chart was blunted by Red Sovine and Webb Pierce's cover duet, which benefited from Decca Records' major label status and national distribution and rose to number one on the chart over the 1955-1956 Christmas holiday period. Jones's rendition was later included as the first track on his 1957 debut album Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry's</b> New Star.|$|R

Music historian Charles Wolfe notes that while Thompson's active career (1925-1931) was relatively short, it was [...] "one {{of the most}} potent" [...] in the history and development of country music, and that the photographs of Thompson seated with his fiddle before a WSM microphone are among the Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry's</b> most enduring images. [...] Thompson claimed to have known over a thousand fiddle tunes, and once boasted he could [...] "fiddle the bugs off a tater vine." [...] According to Wolfe, an analysis of Thompson's last recordings show a fiddle player of [...] "great ability." ...|$|R

500|$|Summing up on {{the impact}} Modern Sounds had on country music and listeners, writer Daniel Cooper states, [...] "There is no telling how many people, who perhaps never paid much {{attention}} to country music or even had professed to dislike it, listened anew based on the impact of having heard what Ray Charles was capable of doing with that music." [...] Charles eventually earned a country music repertoire and reputation following the success of the Modern Sounds records, later country hit singles for Warner Bros. Records, and various appearances at country music events, including The Johnny Cash Show in 1970 and the Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry's</b> 58th anniversary in 1983, the program to which he listened as a youth.|$|R

5000|$|... "I'm Ragged But I'm Right" [...] is {{a defiant}} {{statement}} of blue collar pride that actually {{dates back to}} a 1929 blues record by the Blue Harmony Boys. It was later cut by stringband veteran Riley Puckett in 1934 but, as Colin Escott speculated in 1994, [...] "George probably picked it up from the Gulf Coast legend Moon Mullican, who played the same spots." [...] The song would remain a favorite of Jones's, who would rerecord it several times (the last being for his 1983 album You've Still Got A Place In My Heart). Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry's</b> New Star also features the ballad [...] "Yearning" [...] with Jeanette Hicks, the first of countless duets Jones would record over his long career which would cement his place as one of country music's greatest harmony singers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{influence}} of the Georgia Fiddle Bands is apparent within Franks's style and recordings. He was exposed {{to the work of}} Fiddlin' John Carson, The Skillet Lickers and other Georgia fiddlers. He grew and gained skills by competing in Georgia fiddle contests, many fostered by World Record Mandolinist Bill Lowery as well as the Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry's</b> Grand Master Fiddler Championship. In the 1990s Georgia honored Franks for his work to preserve the heritage of Georgia's fiddling by naming a state-sponsored fiddle contest in his honor hosted then at Lake Lanier Islands. [...] The Randall Franks Trophy is presented to the winner each year at the 1890s Day Jamboree Old Time Fiddler's Convention in Ringgold, Georgia. Franks also co-hosts America's Grand Master Fiddler Championship annually in Nashville at the Country Music Hall of Fame.|$|R

5000|$|You've Still Got A Place In My Heart {{includes}} several remakes from earlier in Jones's career: [...] "I'm Ragged But I'm Right", had {{appeared on the}} singer's very first LP Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Opry's</b> New Star in 1957, while [...] "Even The Bad Times Are Good" [...] and [...] "Come Sundown" [...] (the latter a Kris Kristofferson song) had been recorded by Jones on the Musicor label. The title track, which peaked at number 3 - Jones's ninth top ten hit in four years - had been composed by Leon Payne, whom the singer had paid tribute to with an album of songs in 1971. Many of the numbers are up-tempo and optimistic, especially the heartfelt [...] "The Second Time Around", which sounds like a tribute to Nancy Jones. He also gives a Johnny Cash-spirited narration on the novelty [...] "Courtin' In The Rain.|$|R
5000|$|After {{releasing}} two unsuccessful albums through Mercury/Polygram, Wright {{asked to}} be released from her contract and signed with MCA Nashville.

In 1999, her fourth album, Single White Female, produced several hit songs and her first gold album certification. In 2000, while touring with singer Brad Paisley, Wright and Paisley cowrote the duet [...] "Hard to Be a Husband, Hard to Be a Wife", which they performed in their joint shows and at the Grand <b>Ole</b> <b>Oprys</b> 75th anniversary, televised by CBS.

As {{a result of her}} independent record label hits, she was signed to Columbia Records where she was produced by Don Law and Frank Jones. At Columbia, she recorded a single called [...] "I Think I Know". The song was a Top 10 hit for Worth. In 1961, she released another single called [...] "Therell Always Be Sadness". The single was not as successful as her other singles, but it did make the Top 25 that year. For almost two years, Worth was absent from the Country charts.|$|R
