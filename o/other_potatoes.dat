500|$|On April 12, another update {{for each}} game was released. These updates were all Portal themed, such as levels based on Aperture Science in The Ball and Killing Floor. Again, players found that by {{completing}} specific tasks {{in the new}} content, they would be presented with an Aperture Science screen, though this time the screens provided a cryptic audio clue. These clues {{were found to be}} two-part clues relating to the previously-identified locations around Seattle. By mapping these points, using locations commonly shared by one clue, players were led to the name of a Steam group that contained a single member by the name of [...] "dinosaur", a reference to an earlier ARG used for Portal 2s announcement. Screenshots within this user's profile gave a QR Code that pointed to a website with a countdown time set to expire on the morning of April 15, 2011. Players who discovered these audio clues would be awarded another potato on their Steam profile. A total of 36 possible potatoes were found: 35 within the games and the referenced Steam group, and a 36th earned by obtaining all 35 of the <b>other</b> <b>potatoes.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{fingerling}} potato is a small, stubby, finger-shaped type {{of potato}} {{which may be}} any heritage potato cultivars. Fingerlings are varieties that naturally grow small and narrow. They are fully mature when harvested and {{are not to be}} confused with new potatoes. Popular fingerling potatoes include the yellow-skinned Russian Banana, the pink-skinned, yellow fleshed French Fingerling, the Purple Peruvian, and the Swedish Peanut Fingerling. Due to their size and greater expense compared to <b>other</b> <b>potatoes,</b> fingerlings are commonly either halved and roasted as a side dish or used in salads.|$|E
50|$|The {{dietary intake}} of Okinawans {{compared}} to other Japanese circa 1950 shows that Okinawans consumed: fewer total calories (1785 vs. 2068), less polyunsaturated fat (4.8% of calories vs. 8%), less rice (154g vs. 328g), significantly less wheat, barley and other grains (38g vs. 153g), less sugars (3g vs. 8g), more legumes (71g vs. 55g), significantly less fish (15g vs. 62g), significantly less meat and poultry (3g vs. 11g), less eggs (1g vs. 7g), less dairy (<1g vs. 8g), much more sweet potatoes (849g vs. 66g), less <b>other</b> <b>potatoes</b> (2g vs. 47g), less fruit (<1g vs. 44g), and no pickled vegetables (0g vs. 42g). In short, the Okinawans circa 1950 ate sweet potatoes for 849 grams of the 1262 grams of food that they consumed, which constituted 69% of their total calories.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the major potato allergen patatin, Sol t 1, with IgE was investigated on a quantitative level {{as a function of}} heat treatment at different temperatures. On the basis of a number of publications, potato {{is considered to be a}} heat-labile allergen, but the molecular explanation for this behavior was not given. In this work, heat treatment of patatin in the absence and presence of <b>other</b> <b>potato</b> proteins mimicking the proteinaceous environment of the potato was studied. Using far-UV circular dichrosim spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry, the molecular transitions during heating of patatin were investigated. It was found that as long as patatin is not aggregated, denaturation of patatin on a secondary or tertiairy folding level is reversible with only a minor effect on the IgE affinity. Aggregation of patatin results in a nonreversible unfolding and a concomitant important decrease in affinity for IgE (25 -fold). Aggregation of patatin in the presence of <b>other</b> <b>potato</b> proteins results in a less condensed aggregate compared to the situation of isolated patatin, resulting in a more pronounced decrease of affinity for IgE (110 -fold). It is concluded that the heat lability of patatin-IgE interaction is explained by aggregation of patatin with <b>other</b> <b>potato</b> proteins rather than by denaturation of patatin itself.

These chemical treatments can delay emergence of the young plants, but this doesn't mean these chemicals shouldn't be used. Many fungicides, including thiabendazole, work best when they are applied to tubers before they are cut into seed pieces.|$|R
40|$|Diabetes is a chronic, complex illness with a {{risk for}} acute and {{long-term}} complications. The {{aim of this}} quality improvement project on prevention of type 2 diabetes was to increase self-management behaviors in patients {{at high risk of}} type 2 diabetes, decrease the financial burden of type 2 diabetes, and decrease the incidence of complications that can occur from type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome of this project was each participant reporting at least one lifestyle modification that would be helpful in preventing type 2 diabetes after attending two group education sessions. A pretest posttest design was used for this project. Three completed the initial questionnaires, and two attended the educational sessions and completed the posttest questionnaires. Of the total number of participants, one reported a decrease in hot/cold cereal, regular soda, sugar or honey in coffee/tea, <b>other</b> <b>potatoes,</b> tomato sauces, chocolate, doughnuts, and cookies, cake, pies, brownies. Two participants reported a decrease in fruit juice, fried potatoes, and pizza. One participant had an increase in physical activity while the other participant had no change in physical activity. The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Trial demonstrated that counseling on a healthy diet and moderate physical activity reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The two participants in this project reported they made some helpful changes in diet after two education sessions. It is vital to the success of a prevention program to convey the significance of preventing a chronic disease such as type 2 diabete...|$|E

2500|$|Potato {{plants are}} {{herbaceous}} perennials that grow about [...] high, depending on variety, with the leaves dying back after flowering, fruiting and tuber formation. They bear white, pink, red, blue, or purple flowers with yellow stamens. In general, the tubers of varieties with white flowers have white skins, while those of varieties with colored flowers {{tend to have}} pinkish skins. Potatoes are mostly cross-pollinated by insects such as bumblebees, which carry pollen from <b>other</b> <b>potato</b> plants, though {{a substantial amount of}} self-fertilizing occurs as well. Tubers form in response to decreasing day length, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.|$|R

50|$|Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja is a cultivar-group of diploid {{potato plants}} {{originating}} from the Andean valleys in South America. The group differs from <b>other</b> <b>potato</b> cultivar-groups {{by the absence}} of dormant tubers. This means that the tuber immediately begins to grow once it is formed, without a resting period. This explains why the varieties of the group are to be planted in areas with a mild climate, where culture throughout the year is possible. By hybridization with Solanum tuberosum by the Scottish Crop Research Institute, varieties were obtained who are adapted to the European climate. These crossings are particularly popular as a culinary potato for their excellent taste.|$|R

40|$|A new potato tuber {{lipoxygenase}} full-length cDNA sequence (lox 1 :St: 2) {{has been}} isolated from potato tubers {{and used to}} express in Escherichia coli and characterize a novel recombinant lipoxygenase (potato 13 / 9 -lipoxygenase). Like most plant lipoxygenases it produced carbonyl compounds from linoleate (the preferred substrate) and was purified in the Fe(II) (ferrous) state. Typical of <b>other</b> <b>potato</b> tuber lipoxygenases, it produced 5 -HPETE [5 (S) -hydroperoxy-(6 E, 8 Z, 11 Z, 14 Z) -eicosatetraenoic acid] from arachidonate. In contrast to any <b>other</b> <b>potato</b> tuber lipoxygenase, it exhibited dual positional specificity and produced roughly equimolar amounts of 13 - and 9 -hydroperoxides (or only a slight molar excess of 9 -hydroperoxides) from linoleate. We have used a homology model of pea 9 / 13 -lipoxygenase to superimpose and compare the linoleate-binding pockets of different potato lipoxygenases of known positional specificity. We then tested this model by using site-directed mutagenesis to identify some primary determinants of linoleate binding to potato 13 / 9 -lipoxygenase {{and concluded that the}} mechanism determining positional specificity described for a cucumber lipoxygenase does not apply to potato 13 / 9 -lipoxygenase. This supports our previous studies on pea seed lipoxygenases for the role of pocket volume rather than inverse orientation as a determinant of dual positional specificity in plant lipoxygenases. We have also used deletion mutagenesis to identify a critical role in catalysis for a surface hydrophobic loop in potato 13 / 9 -lipoxygenase and speculate that this may control substrate access. Although potato 13 / 9 -lipoxygenase represents only a minor isoform in tubers, such evidence for a single lipoxygenase species with dual positional specificity in tubers has implications for the proposed role of potato lipoxygenases in the plant...|$|R
