5|$|Although {{the number}} of Spanish bishops who {{attended}} is unknown, the Archbishop <b>of</b> <b>Toledo,</b> Raymund, did attend.

5|$|An {{authoritative}} {{version of}} Marco Polo's book does not and cannot exist, {{for the early}} manuscripts differ significantly. The published editions of his book either rely on single manuscripts, blend multiple versions together, or add notes to clarify, for example in the English translation by Henry Yule.

Approximately 150 manuscript copies in various languages are known to exist, and before availability of the printing press discrepancies were inevitably introduced during copying and translation. The popular translation published by Penguin Books in 1958 by R.E. Latham works several texts together to make a readable whole.|$|E

5|$|By 1710 the {{population}} of Manche Ch'ol in Belén had fallen to just four; everyone else had {{died as a result}} of disease, hunger and melancholy. By 1770 the Manche Ch'ol were all but extinct; their original territory had been abandoned and had reverted to wilderness, and the few survivors relocated to the highlands numbered not more than 300 in the whole Urran Valley, where there were almost as many Spanish and ladinos. Many Manche Ch'ol in Verapaz were absorbed into the expanding Q'eqchi' Maya population, which gradually occupied the vacated Manche lands. It is possible that a few Manche Ch'ol survived in the forested interior <b>of</b> <b>Toledo</b> District in Belize, to be later absorbed by incoming Q'eqchi' in the late 19th century. In the very early part of the 19th century, a handful of Maya were still recorded as speaking Ch'ol in Cobán.|$|E
