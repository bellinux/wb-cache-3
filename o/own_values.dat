5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their <b>own</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E
5|$|Yoseph Yapi Taum, a {{lecturer}} at Sanata Dharma University in Yogyakarta, views Tini's aloof {{nature as a}} major force driving Tono to Yah; her lifestyle, of which Tono is not a part, alienates him and drives him to find a more traditional woman. Tham Seong Chee, a political scientist from Singapore, views her as a weak-willed character, unwilling to act before meeting Hartono again and even then unable to solve her marital difficulties with Tono. He also sees her as being fettered by her <b>own</b> <b>values,</b> which are incompatible with those held by the general Indonesian populace. The Indonesian writer and literary critic Goenawan Mohamad views her as driven {{in part by the}} stress placed on her by her husband's expectations.|$|E
5|$|Roark {{is arrested}} and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides {{to use his}} papers to defend his friend. This unpopular stance hurts the {{circulation}} of his newspapers, and Wynand's employees go on strike after Wynand dismisses Toohey for disobeying him and criticizing Roark. Faced {{with the prospect of}} closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a speech about the value of ego and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his <b>own</b> <b>values</b> by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the Banner and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.|$|E

As with heterosexual behaviour, different sets of prescriptions and proscriptions may be given to individuals according to their gender, age, social status or social class.|$|E

25|$|One study, of first-year {{students}} {{in medical school}} writing in dialogue journals with their professors, found that the interactive journal writing “provided {{a safe place for}} students to describe their experiences and relationships and to question their <b>own</b> <b>values</b> and beliefs.” The process of writing in this way with their teachers broke down barriers between them, through a mutual sharing of thoughts and feelings, which led to enhanced rapport and communication, and thus facilitated students’ personal and reflective perspectives and initiated and encouraged self-awareness.|$|E
500|$|With {{a newborn}} involved, the {{decision}} is made more complex due {{to the principles of}} respect for autonomy and consent, as a newborn cannot understand or engage in a logical discussion of his <b>own</b> <b>values</b> and best interests. [...] A mentally more mature child can understand the issues involved to some degree, and the physician and parents may elicit input from the child and weigh it appropriately in the decision-making process, although the law may not treat such input as legally informative. Ethicists and legal theorists also state that it is questionable for parents to make a decision for the child that precludes the child from making a different decision for himself later. Such a question can be raised for the decision by the parents either to circumcise or not to circumcise the child.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{sings in}} the first verse: [...] "There are too many options/There is no consolation/I have lost my illusions/What I want is an explanation." [...] According to Rolling Stone, {{although}} not explicitly stated, the lines confirm Madonna's belief that American culture will not [...] "give her an explanation", so she had rejected American values, and along with them her <b>own</b> <b>values.</b> She repeats the line [...] "I got you under my skin" [...] while a male voice acts as the backing for the track. The song ends with Madonna singing the words [...] "feel good" [...] a capella. [...] The lyrics of the song deals with questions, solutions, resurrections, confusions and other broad topics of a neo-philosophical nature. Edna Gundersen of USA Today compared its composition and Madonna's performance with a love letter. The Advocate called it [...] "a plaintive love letter to her husband".|$|E

500|$|Although Barton speaks {{frequently}} {{about his}} desire to help create [...] "a new, living theater, of and about and for the common man", he does not recognize that such a theater has already been created: the movies. In fact, he disdains this authentically popular form. On the other hand, the world of Broadway theatre in Barton Fink {{is a place of}} high culture, where the creator believes most fully that his work embodies his <b>own</b> <b>values.</b> Although he pretends to disdain his own success, Barton believes he has achieved a great victory with Bare Ruined Choirs. He seeks praise; when his agent Garland asks if he's seen the glowing review in the Herald, Barton says [...] "No", even though his producer had just read it to him. Barton feels close to the theatre, confident that it can help him create work that honors [...] "the common man". The men and women who funded the production– [...] "those people", as Barton calls them– [...] demonstrate that Broadway is just as concerned with profit as Hollywood; but its intimacy and smaller scale allow the author to feel that his work has real value.|$|E
500|$|The book {{follows the}} course of Neill's life {{sequentially}} from his youth in [...] "rural, Calvinist Scotland" [...] {{to the start of}} Summerhill between the two World Wars. Hemmings focuses on Neill's relation to education but also minds other biographical detail: the influence of Freudian psychoanalysis and Homer Lane's theories in the 1920s, and of Wilhelm Reich's psychological theories in the 1930s. Hemmings compares Neill's thought with that of Maria Montessori, Bertrand Russell, Fred Clarke, Erich Fromm, Susan Sutherland Isaacs, Benjamin Spock, and contemporaries Paul Goodman, Ivan Illich, R. D. Laing, and Herbert Marcuse. Compared to pedagogues such as Russell, who advocated for the inculcation of certain virtues in a child's education, Neill instead insisted that the child be left to make its <b>own</b> <b>values</b> and decisions apart from adult influence and manipulation. Hemmings also reviews the roles of freedom, authority, and anarchy throughout the maturation of Neill's thought. The final sections explain Summerhill's internal processes, philosophy, and position in both British and global social order. Hemmings contends that Summerhill has remained consistent to its principles while it cycled through roles as one of many 1920s educational experiments, a bastion in the 1930s, and an advocate for [...] "children's freedom" [...] throughout the post-World War II movement for informal' education".|$|E
500|$|Homer Jay Simpson, {{voiced by}} Dan Castellaneta, is {{the protagonist of}} the show {{and the father of}} the Simpson family. He embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, thoughtless and a {{borderline}} alcoholic. He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the situation calls for it, and an integrity reflecting his <b>own</b> <b>values,</b> including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his family. His voice started out as an impression of Walter Matthau but eventually evolved into a more robust voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions. Homer has since {{become one of the most}} influential fictional characters and has been described by the UK newspaper The Sunday Times as the greatest comedic creation of modern time. He has inspired an entire line of merchandise, and his catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", has been included in the Oxford English Dictionary. During the production of the episode Insane Clown Poppy the writers toyed with the idea of giving Homer a long lost legitimate biological daughter, but when the shows showrunner and writer Mike Scully, as well as Matt Groening rejected the idea, the writers changed the story so the clown Krusty would be the one who finds he has a lost daughter.|$|E

500|$|Spike is {{a fictional}} bounty hunter {{who was born}} on Mars on June 26, 2044: he is 27 years old, has fluffy dark-green hair and brown eyes. His right eye is artificial, and {{consequently}} lighter than the other. He stands 6'1" [...] and weighs 155lbs. Spike is a heavy smoker, and is frequently seen smoking despite rain or [...] "no smoking" [...] signs. A skilled martial artist who practices Jeet Kune Do, he is a devoted follower of the philosophies of Bruce Lee. He also owns a converted antique Asteroid racer called the Swordfish II. During gunfights, he most often uses a Jericho 941. In his younger days before joining the Bebop, Spike {{was part of the}} Red Dragon Syndicate, a Chinese criminal organization: during his time there, he was impetuous and volatile, but after leaving he became a calm and collected character with a love for combat. While holding little value in money or justice, he always holds true to his <b>own</b> <b>values</b> and fulfills his obligations. He also generally does this his way rather than following orders, which generally gets him into trouble. Watanabe has said that Spike has a habit of being very indirect with his emotions; for example, he may behave antagonistically towards someone he actually likes. He says that this could apply to Spike's relationship with Faye Valentine.|$|E

The bourgeoisie developed a hegemonic culture, which propagated its <b>own</b> <b>values</b> and norms so that they became the [...] "common sense" [...] values of all.
