Yang Sen had allied with the second largest Sichuanese warlord, Liu Xiang. Together they began fighting against the biggest Sichuanese warlord Liu Wenhui. However, {{at the time of}} the Luding Bridge incident, the region was still under Liu Wenhui's control. Liu Wenhui's troops certainly would not take orders from the lesser rival Yang Sen. Although he received military, political, as well as financial support from Chiang Kai-shek, Yang Sen would not sacrifice his own troops by sending them to help Liu Wenhui stop the communists. Both were well aware of Chiang's {{divide and conquer}} strategy, and both held their main forces to prepare for Chiang's potential take-over. Knowing the local <b>opium</b> <b>dependent</b> warlord commanders were incapable of stopping the communist forces, Chiang tried to send more capable officers from his own officer corps to advise the local troops. These attempts were politely but unanimously rejected by all local Sichuanese warlords, as they feared Chiang's takeover.|$|E

40|$|Background: Given {{the paucity}} of data on {{possible}} testis changes in opioid dependents, we sought to compare the testis volumes between a group of <b>opium</b> <b>dependents</b> {{and a group of}} healthy controls. Objective: Comparison of testis volume between <b>opium</b> <b>dependents</b> and healthy controls. Materials and Methods: This case-control study recruited 100 men with opium dependency (cases) and 100 healthy men (controls) in Iran, in 2008. A checklist containing questions about age, height, weight, daily amount of cigarette use, and duration of cigarette use for all the participants as well as daily amount of opium use (grams) and duration of opium use (years) for the case group was completed. Additionally, the dimensions of each testis were measured by a single person using calipers, and the mean of the left and right testes volume was compared between these two groups. Results: The mean of the testis volumes in the case group was significantly lower than that of the case group (11. 2 ± 2. 2 and 25. 1 ± 2. 7 cm³, p< 0. 001). The results of the ANCOVA test showed that even after the omission of the cigarette smoking effect (p= 0. 454), the testis volume remained lower in the <b>opium</b> <b>dependents</b> (R 2 = 0. 884, p< 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction: Laryngeal {{cancer is}} the second most common cancer {{involving}} the respiratory tract, second only to lung cancer. Previous studies have shown opium dependency to be a possible risk factor for laryngeal cancer. Opium consumption is a major problem {{in some parts of the}} world. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of opium consumption on the pattern of involvement in laryngeal cancer.   Methods and materials: In this analytical cross-sectional study, 44 patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer (41 male and three female) were studied. Data were collected using a questionnaire, physical examination, and paraclinical studies. Patients were defined as <b>opium</b> <b>dependent</b> based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) criteria and duration of opium consumption.   Results: Patients were categorized into two groups: opium-dependent (32. 6 %) and non-opium-dependent (67. 4 %) patients. The average age of the patients was 58. 5 ± 3. 2 years in the opium-dependent group and 60. 7 ± 2. 8 years in the non-opium-dependent group (P=non-significant). An analysis of the pattern of involvement in each group showed glottis involvement in 56 %, subglottis involvement in 8 %, supraglottis involvement in 32 %, and hypopharyngeal involvement in 4 % of the opium-dependent group compared with glottis involvement in 55. 9 %, subglottis involvement in 11. 8 %, supraglottis involvement in 32. 4 %, and hypopharyngeal involvement in none of the non-opium-dependent group (P=non-significant).   Conclusion: There was a poor correlation between opium dependency and pattern of involvement in laryngeal cancer.

40|$|Introduction: Cigarette {{smoking and}} alcohol {{consumption}} have a well-known {{effect on the}} development of upper aerodigestive tract carcinomas, but such a role for opium is questionable. This study was designed to assess the correlation between opium inhalation and cancer of the larynx and upper esophagus. Materials and Methods: Fifty eight patients with laryngeal cancer, ninety eight patients with upper esophageal cancer and twenty seven healthy individuals with no evidence of head and neck or esophageal malignancies were selected from Otolaryngology and Radiation Oncology Department of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.   Duration and amount of cigarette smoking and opium consumption were recorded through comprehensive interviews. Results: The crude odds ratio for laryngeal cancer was 5. 58 (95 % CI 2. 05 - 15. 15, P= 0. 000) in cigarette smokers relative to non-smokers and 9. 09 (95 % CI 3. 21 - 25. 64, P= 0. 000) in opium users relative to non-users. The crude odds ratio for esophageal cancer was 0. 44 (95 % CI 0. 18 - 1. 09, P= 0. 07) in cigarette smokers relative to non-smokers and 1. 44 (95 % CI 0. 57 - 3. 62, P= 0. 43) in opium users relative to non-users.   After adjusting for smoking, the odds ratio for laryngeal cancer in opium users relative to non-users was 6. 06 (95 % CI 1. 10 - 33. 23, P= 0. 05). Laryngeal cancer was detected at a significantly lower age in opium users (54. 54 ± 10. 93 vs 62. 92 ± 10. 10 years, P= 0. 02) than in smokers. This effect was not observed in esophageal cancer. Although the duration (year 17. 50 ± 14. 84 vs 21. 91 ± 14. 03; P= 0. 34) and amount (pack/day 0. 625 vs 0. 978; P= 0. 06) of smoking were higher among those who were <b>opium</b> <b>dependent,</b> these differences were not statistically significant (P= 0. 34 and P= 0. 06, respectively).

40|$|Opium is {{obtained}} from the unripe seed capsules of the poppy plant. Opium is usually used by smoking or by swallowing to create a feeling of euphoria, to provide pleasure or as an analgesic or hypnotic. Cultural attitudes affect the patterns of opioid use among different countries. In the Middle East and south east Asia, opium is used in many cases in social settings and the users do not suffer from considerable social dysfunction. It is used occasionally and mainly in male gatherings but regular use can cause dependence. Opium users have a more stable life style than heroin users and, of those who come for treatment, a higher proportion are married and live with their family. Stopping opium use {{gives rise to a}} mild intensity opiate withdrawal syndrome. The physical signs of withdrawal syndrome usually stop after 14 days; but a protracted syndrome that includes reduced well-being, malaise and periodic strong cravings can continue for months. Completion of withdrawal and remaining abstinent is difficult and opium dependents often relapse if treatment does not continue after completion of withdrawal. When the type of opioid used is less harmful than heroin, as with opium, there is a question as to what type of treatment or maintenance is most effective; detoxification from opium is short-lasting and better tolerated than detoxification from methadone. Three randomised controlled trials involving 870 opium dependents were included in the review. In two of the trials different doses of the semi-synthetic opioid buprenorphine were compared. The higher doses of buprenorphine (4 mg/day and 8 mg/day, respectively) increased the probability of retention in treatment. The studies had a high risk of bias. In the third trial baclofen (an agonist of GABA-B receptors) was compared with placebo for maintenance treatment after a process of detoxification. Only 27 of the 40 participants were <b>opium</b> <b>dependent</b> and there was a trend for increased retention in treatment. Important outcomes such as drug use and drug side effects were not assessed. Overall, the results from three trials are not sufficient to form a view on the effectiveness of any pharmacological intervention for opium dependence. Buprenorphine has partial agonist opioid activity and appears to be well-tolerated with minor side effects. However, buprenorphine abuse has emerged and been recognised as a problem in many Asian countries in the last two decades. Its use by injection is also quite common...|$|E
