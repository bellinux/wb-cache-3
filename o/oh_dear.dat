25|$|Penny Sparrow is {{one such}} {{high-profile}} case. She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way <b>oh</b> <b>dear.</b> From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E

500|$|Broadly, {{the critics}} did not welcome Fleming's {{experiment}} with the Bond formula; academic Christoph Linder {{has pointed out that}} The Spy Who Loved Me received the worst reception of all the Bond books. The Daily Telegraph, for example, wrote [...] "Oh Dear <b>Oh</b> <b>Dear</b> <b>Oh</b> <b>Dear!</b> And to think of the books Mr Fleming once wrote!" [...] while The Glasgow Herald thought Fleming was finished: [...] "His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and he has had to substitute for a fast-moving story the sorry misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail." [...] Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson described the tale as [...] "a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation", going on to hope that [...] "this doesn't spell the total eclipse of Bond in a blaze of cornography". Richardson ended his piece by berating Fleming, asking [...] "why can't this cunning author write up a bit instead of down?" [...] The critic for The Times was not dismissive of Bond, whom they describe as [...] "less a person than a cult" [...] who is [...] "ruthlessly, fashionably efficient in both love and war". Rather, the critic dismisses the experiment, writing that [...] "the novel lacks Mr. Fleming's usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment". John Fletcher thought that it was [...] "as if Mickey Spillane had tried to gatecrash his way into the Romantic Novelists' Association".|$|E
