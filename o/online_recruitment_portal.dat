40|$|Hiring {{managers}} and human resource executive who {{actively involved in}} recruitment would undoubtedly find the application screening process {{as one of the}} most time consuming but necessary step, especially when there are many applications to sort through. It is very common for head hunters to go through hundreds of resume each day to search for suitable candidates to fill various vacancies to earn a living. With the rise of <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> <b>portals</b> in Malaysia in the late 1990 s, the attraction and sourcing process has since been streamlined and achieved a significant speed up in comparison to spend weeks to get a vacancy advertisement posted on newspapers, and saving a lot of precious office space by storing resumes and applications on computers. However, due to the growth in job market and fast paced job application process, recruiters are now flooded with loads of applications on almost every hiring, although the potential yield is higher, it is harder for recruiters to cope with such huge amount of resumes without sacrificing some good candidates by not able to screen through all resumes. This research aims to find way to help busy human resource personnel in screening applications through the use of computerized system, suggesting possible solutions based on existing information system available, <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> job <b>portals</b> hence become the natural target with huge impact on the market as a whole. To encourage application screening automation without obvious financial reward would be the first problem to deal with, through several popular strategy planning frameworks and analysis I attempt to uncover benefits for <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> <b>portals</b> to embrace and welcome this initiative. And then follow up on gathering statistical data to identify important screening criteria and evaluate potential of using each criterion for auto screening and the risk to anticipate with such implementation. Throughout the end of this research, I believe implementing application screening automation tool for <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> <b>portals</b> could indeed build up competitive advantages, although it may not be a very long term advantage, it does raise the defence towards new entrants and substitution products with a feature that heavy users such as head hunters and expanding companies would be most benefited, and helping smaller companies to adopt better screening process, and this will too create customer loyalty. Last but not least, a list of recommendations is being provided to seed ideas for a challenging actual implementation of such feature and I am hopeful to see time and cost saving achievable through this practice...|$|R

Furthermore, this study also will clarify a conceptualisation that provides a new understanding of the relationship between unemployed graduates and the human capital concept. This paper used web documentation for the research technique, and an interpretive approach was used as the research paradigm. Two <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> agency sites were analysed thoroughly, and a qualitative analysis was made on them. The connections show how knowledge sharing {{can be used as a}} medium to help unemployed graduates to get jobs through <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> agencies. An <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> agency can help fresh graduates to find good jobs because most of the agencies have thousands of corporate clients.

40|$|The {{process of}} Recruitment and Selection of new {{employees}} has a growing influence on business results and, nowadays, {{the use of}} knowledge and {{information and communication technologies}} enables this process to be faster and more complete. The need to improve the existing resources in companies has conditioned the changes in the Recruitment and Selection process and, over time, we observe the transformation of this process. Thus, Recruitment and Selection became a strategic process in Human Resources Management improving the organization's competitiveness. The objective of the study is to understand the role of <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> for organizational knowledge management; and to characterize the most used social networks in <b>Online</b> <b>Recruitment,</b> identifying the main reasons to use <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> during the process of recruitment and selection. ln this quantitative study, 112 companies fulfilled a questionnaire that evaluated the <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> process. The main results suggested that national companies and companies with more than 250 employees use more <b>online</b> <b>recruitment.</b> The fact that some companies have job openings available on multiple websites simultaneously, making information available 24 hours a day, reducing the time and process costs and streamline communication between candidates and the organization {{are some of the most}} listed reasons to use the <b>Online</b> <b>Recruitment.</b> Otherwise, the use of traditional methods of recruitment and the fact that the access to social networks are not allowed in some organisations are some of the reasons cited for not using this method of recruitment. Thus, it can be concluded that the Information and Communication Technologies are present in the process of recruitment and selection and that this is a reality existing in organizations as a tool to support of knowledge management. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

In order {{to serve as a}} viable source of help for these people and ultimately maintain the satisfaction of industrial employers - their paying customers, <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> websites should strive to achieve a high level of service quality for the job seekers. The current research (1) proposes an evaluation tool to assist <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> websites in quantifying service quality and (2) examines the relationship between service quality and measures of mental workload and performance time. Results suggest a central role for performance time and mental workload on perceptions of service quality. Key elements of service quality for Internet-based job recruitment are provided based on the results and are shown in contrast with those suggested as traditional measures of service quality. Relevance to industry: Time and mental workload required to complete job recruitment tasks with Internet-based service providers can significantly impact overall service quality evaluations. Thus, they should be monitored and benchmarked when possible, as poor service quality perceptions can ultimately impact employers' willingness to subscribe.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 25). Augere was established in September 2007 by an experienced team of global telecoms executives with the vision of delivering 'broadband for all'. Augere's first commercial network launched in Pakistan in July 2009 and was closely followed by the Bangladesh network in October 2009 under the brand name QUBEE. Working as a HR Executive for QUBEE, I have enriched my knowledge and skills and have got the opportunity to submit a report on “Effectiveness of <b>Online</b> <b>Recruitment</b> System: Evidence from Augere Wireless Broadband Bangladesh Limited” as assigned by my academic supervisor during my internship period. The purpose of a hiring event is {{to reach out to}} prospective employees and bring the specific kind of skills and experiences in the organization especially those which cannot be built from within. For external recruitment QUBEE posts job advertisement in the BDJOBS website and recruits the best possible candidate from the pool of applicants who applied for the position. BDJOBS <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> system can shortlist the application forms according to years of experience, skills, and educational attainment relevant to the job vacancy. Besides this, QUBEE also offers the contractual employees a chance to face the interview if their qualification and job match is similar to the position applied. Also other external referral candidates may apply through employees of our company. In such cases, the line managers send the resumes to the HR department for shortlisting. Then channels of interview are conducted before making the final selection. This report makes a comparison of BDJOBS <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> system with the internal recruitment system of QUBEE. The effectiveness of <b>online</b> job <b>recruitment</b> system is based on Performance, Reliability, Security and Cost-effectiveness. Speaking about the performance of BDJOBS software, it could facilitate efficient filtering of qualified candidates and could provide a well-matched shortlist of qualified applicants compared to the manual process of Internal Recruitment. In terms of Reliability, BDJOBS system could produce the required results with precision and could filter out applicants’ forms without anomalies and any form of discrimination while internal recruitment also provides correct results but with more expenditure of time and effort. BDJOBS had the mechanism to protect and control programs and data, and it provided its users passwords as security against unauthorized users while the internal recruitment system of QUBEE is not capable to control any kind of mechanism. Recruitment through BDJOBS requires certain amount money to be paid for each job posting no matter the desired candidates has been hired or not. Lastly, {{it can be said that}} <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> is more efficient compared to internal <b>recruitment.</b> <b>Online</b> <b>Recruitment</b> is capable of reaching potential employees at a shorter span of time. It is recommended that QUBEE should develop <b>online</b> <b>recruitment</b> system through their own web portal which is more cost effective and also it can build our own talent pool to source for future job opportunities.

A codebook is developed to analyze the content of corporate career websites, including the dimensions identified by Cober, Brown and Levy (2004), in order to evaluate employment websites. This is integrated with other dimensions that the literature acknowledges as predictive of organizational attractiveness. A content analysis of the career website of the top 30 employers in Switzerland is conducted. Results show that the selected companies provide a message that is credible, vivid, and employee-oriented. In addition, companies that express the uniqueness of their employer brand communicate more effectively with their potential candidates. The current analysis takes into consideration {{a limited number of}} companies. The study could be extended to a larger sample that includes poor-performing employers and that allows the identification of specificities by industries.
