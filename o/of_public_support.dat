5|$|This rapid {{progress}} in geology and paleontology during the 1830s and 1840s was {{aided by a}} growing international network of geologists and fossil specialists whose work was organized and reviewed by {{an increasing number of}} geological societies. Many of these geologists and paleontologists were now paid professionals working for universities, museums and government geological surveys. The relatively high level <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>support</b> for the earth sciences was due to their cultural impact, and their proven economic value in helping to exploit mineral resources such as coal.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{object of}} this {{research}} is <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> in European Economic Area and its effectiveness assessment. The main aim is to propose a new model for <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> effectiveness assessment, adjusted to contemporary needs and based on practice <b>of</b> <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> development. Research Design & Methods: The methods of comparative, cluster, regression, modelling analysis, multi-criteria evaluation, analogy search, logical abstraction and impact evaluation have been applied for the research presented in this paper. Findings:  The paper conceptualizes a new model for the assessment <b>of</b> <b>public</b> innovation <b>support.</b> It is based on theoretical argumentation and practical verification. Its structure is based on new solutions and quantitative assessment methods. Implications & Recommendations: The analysis of the proposed model applicability revealed important patterns for the <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> impact assessment. Findings suggest that the increase <b>of</b> <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> index is a necessary but insufficient condition for the growth of the countries innovation index. The impact <b>of</b> <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> occurs only in the long run, as the delay of the effect exists. Contribution & Value Added: The proposed system of quantitative and qualitative indicators that characterize any <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> system (<b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> index) enables the creation and implementation of measures devoted to the <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> impact improvement at EU and national level. The practical application of the suggested model is significant for the effectiveness improvement <b>of</b> <b>public</b> innovation <b>support</b> at EU institutions...|$|R
5|$|But the WFM's {{success at}} Cripple Creek {{also created a}} {{significant}} backlash. The WFM was forever tarred as a dangerous and violent organization {{in the eyes of}} employers. Never again would the WFM have in a local strike the level <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>support</b> it enjoyed at Cripple Creek in 1894. Indeed, when the union struck the Cripple Creek mines again in 1898, its public support ended after violence broke out. During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance earned it the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of the employers and the state combined.|$|E
5|$|With Poland being {{a member}} of the Soviet Bloc, the party's pursuits of power and reform were {{permanently}} hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, acutely conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>support</b> and Soviet reaction). Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the Soviets and the Polish communists.|$|E
5|$|Leopold's {{decision}} to surrender was seized {{on by the}} British and French press who blamed him for the military situation. The Belgian government met in Paris on 26 May and invoked Article 82 of the Constitution, declaring the monarch unable to reign (dans l'impossibilité de régner), and resolved to continue the fight against Germany. The following day, Pierlot held an important meeting with the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, in which the French premier called for the Belgian government to publicly denounce the King and his surrender. Following the meeting, Pierlot gave a radio speech denouncing the King whom he accused of acting unconstitutionally and in sympathy with the Germans. Before being broadcast, Pierlot's speech was heavily edited by the French minister Georges Mandel to ensure a position favorable to the French. The denunciation of the King, who was popular across most strata of Belgian society {{and supported by the}} church, led to a big loss <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>support</b> and alienated Pierlot from his supporters and party.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt was {{receiving}} many letters from supporters {{urging him to}} run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>support</b> he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft felt that if he lost in November, {{it would be a}} repudiation of the party, but if he lost renomination, it would be a rejection of himself. He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, he was determined to be president, and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on 2 December 1917 an {{armistice}} {{was signed}} between Russia and the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk and peace talks began. The newly formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Germans on 3 March 1918, formally {{ending the war}} on the Eastern Front and permitting the redeployment of German forces to the Western Front, altering the balance of power. The treaty also permitted the occupation of large areas of European Russia, and within these territories were large stocks of military equipment previously supplied by the allies. In particular, there were large stocks of such supplies in the northern ports of Murmansk and Archangel. The Allied intervention involved fourteen nations and was conducted over a vast expanse of territory. The initial goals of the Western powers had been to rescue the Czechoslovak Legion which had been fighting the Central Powers on the Eastern Front and had later fought the Bolsheviks, {{as well as to}} secure the supplies of munitions and armaments in Russian ports in order to prevent their capture by German forces, and possibly also to re-establish the Eastern Front. However, with the end of World War I and fearful of Bolshevism, the Allies openly, if only half-heartedly, intervened in the Russian Civil War, giving support to the pro-tsarist anti-Bolshevik White forces as part of the North Russia Campaign. Opposition for the ongoing campaign became widespread however, mostly due to a combination of a lack <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>support</b> and war-weariness; while divided objectives and a lack of an overarching strategy also hampered the effort. These factors, together with the evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion and the deteriorating military situation, compelled the Allies to withdraw by 1920. With the end of allied support, the Red Army soon defeated the remaining White government forces, leading to their eventual collapse.|$|E
