5|$|Although their {{suspected}} {{white supremacist}} affiliations led federal authorities to investigate possible ties {{to a larger}} group, authorities later downplayed the trio as drug addicts who had little chance of actually carrying out the plot.

5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> or startling behaviour, such {{as suddenly}} displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of bright and contrasting colours, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not an honest signal.|$|E
5|$|The strike action {{began on}} a local level after postal workers at Royal Mail offices in London and Edinburgh accused their bosses of cutting jobs and services, which they claimed broke the 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement, the {{agreement}} that was struck to end the 2007 strikes, and accused Royal Mail <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> modernisation of the service. After a series of localised walkouts over the summer months, and after failing to reach an agreement, the CWU opened a national ballot for industrial action in September 2009.|$|E
5|$|A {{grand jury}} indicted Paul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart on November 5, 2008, on federal charges <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> {{to kill and}} inflict bodily harm upon a major presidential candidate, conspiracy, interstate {{unlawful}} transportation of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation of a firearm {{with the intent to}} commit a felony, transporting a short-barreled shotgun across state lines without a license and unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Cowart was also charged with damaging religious property and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. On November 6, Schlesselman and Cowart pleaded not guilty before a federal magistrate in Memphis, Tennessee. The two were placed into federal custody without bail. The charges carry a maximum punishment of 50 years in prison and $540,000 in fines.|$|E

5|$|The borders {{were still}} not {{finalized}} in June 1880 when a proposal very favorable to Greece that included Mount Olympus and Ioannina was {{offered by the}} British and French. When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected, Prime Minister Trikoupis made the mistake <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> a mobilization of the Hellenic Army. A coincident change of government in France, the resignation of Charles de Freycinet and his replacement with Jules Ferry, led to disputes among the Great Powers and, despite British support for a more pro-Greek settlement, the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around Arta. When the government of Trikoupis fell, the new prime minister, Alexandros Koumoundouros, reluctantly accepted the new boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} to a number <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; {{and some of its}} range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|Kagame's {{first term}} expired and new {{elections}} {{were held in}} 2010. Having served one term as elected president, Kagame was entitled to serve for one further term. The election campaign began publicly in January 2010 when Victoire Ingabire, a Hutu who had been living abroad for some years, returned to Rwanda and announced her candidacy for the presidency. This failed as she was arrested and accused <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> state security. Ingabire caused some controversy in the country following her arrival, with comments relating to the genocide. The government accused her of breaking the country's strict laws regarding genocide denial, and she was arrested in April 2010. She was released on bail, but was prohibited from running in the election. In October 2012 she was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment by the High Court of Kigali, which is heavily criticized by Amnesty International.|$|E

5|$|On 13 April, MTV3 {{organised}} another debate, {{which featured}} the same four party chairpersons {{as the debate}} by the Finnish Broadcasting Company two weeks earlier; Katainen, Kiviniemi, Urpilainen and Soini. The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU-sponsored Portuguese bailout; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it, insisting that the bailout is {{necessary in order to}} assure the stability of the European economy and thus in the interest of Finland. Urpilainen and Soini were against the bailout, with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his stance that the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members. Soini also criticised the governing parties for using scare tactics in the form <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> Finns with rising unemployment if the bailout fails to pass. On other issues, Katainen, as he had stated earlier, willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age, while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so. Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland's admission to NATO. However, even he said that the admission does not seem possible during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may have gone back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study used}} {{a sample of}} 106 {{countries}} to investigate {{the link between the}} number <b>of</b> <b>threatened</b> plant species and tourism which was proxied by the number of international tourist arrivals. In the analysis, we also include GDP per capita, population growth, and land under crop, which act as the control variables. We find that using OLS, the number of international tourist arrivals, population growth rate and land cultivated with crop increases the number <b>of</b> <b>threatened</b> plant species, while GDP per capita reduces the number <b>of</b> <b>threatened</b> plant species. Our further analysis using quantile regression indicates that tourism affected positively the number <b>of</b> <b>threatened</b> plant species for all quantiles (0. 05 0. 25 0. 50 0. 75 0. 90 0. 95); crop production (positively) at middle quantiles (0. 50 0. 75); GDP per capita (negatively) at lower quantiles (0. 05 0. 25); and population growth (positively) at middle quantiles (0. 50 0. 75). Our analysis clearly indicates that using estimates from OLS may have serious “bad” policy implications on the number <b>of</b> <b>threatened</b> plant species, compared to the quantile method that can capture properly the dimension <b>of</b> the <b>threatened</b> plant species. As for tourism, our study supports the effort for biodiversity conservation and sustainable tourism worldwide...|$|R
