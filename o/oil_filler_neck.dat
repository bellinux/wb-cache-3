40|$|Known {{handling}} {{units are}} designed as headers which travel on a gantry crane for the filling process. The filling nozzle and the filling tube {{are attached to}} the header, the filling tube is pulled out of the header for filling and inserted in the fuel tank <b>filler</b> <b>neck.</b> If the vehicle moves while the filling tube is approached and inserted, there is a risk that the filling tube no longer enters into the <b>filler</b> <b>neck.</b> In order to introduce the filling tube easily into the <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> of the vehicle, the handling unit is fitted with a docking element to which a position detector is assigned; the position detector is connected to a control unit on the handling unit. Before inserting the filling tube into the <b>filler</b> <b>neck,</b> the docking element is docked onto the fuel tank cap. The docking element can be guided precisely to the tank cap and attached to it by means of the position detector. The handling unit is also suitable if there are relative movements between the vehicle and the unit while t he filling tube is approached...|$|R

50|$|The engine used {{clockwise}} rotation as a standard, but some counter-clockwise engines were produced. While {{they were a}} very sturdy, reliable engine, they did have a few flaws, {{one of which was}} that the water tap poured water over the <b>oil</b> <b>filler.</b> This was easily corrected by the use of a rubber pipe.|$|R
25|$|Bladder tanks, bag tanks or fuel cells, are {{reinforced}} rubberised bags {{installed in}} a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate fuel.

50|$|In a {{wet sump}} system, the main {{dipstick}} reaches to {{near the bottom}} of the crankcase. The <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap covers a hole in the crankcase where oil can be added; it is typically located on the top of the rocker cover (or if two, the one closer to the front of the vehicle).|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel filter}} {{moved from the}} wing {{to the top of}} the {{thermostat}} housing. The <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> moved from the crankcase cover to the dipstick housing. The front indicators were originally combined with the headlights, but later replaced by side lights (moved from the headlight reflector) and separate indicators were fitted in the bumper.|$|R
50|$|It is the {{appearance}} of Nohara Hiroshi after getting converted into a robot by a mysterious organization with dubious beauty salon. Body is that the face is made of ivory, and his trademark beard has also been faithfully reproduced. In his chest, two switches which are suggestive of the nipples are attached. Fuel is marked with <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> to the portion {{of oil in the}} butt, it can be injected from there.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency {{defines a}} fuel line as [...] "all hoses or tubing {{designed}} to contain liquid fuel or fuel vapor. This includes all hoses or tubing for the <b>filler</b> <b>neck,</b> for connections between dual fuel tanks, and for connecting a carbon canister to the fuel tank. This {{does not include}} hoses or tubing for routing crankcase vapors to the engine's intake or any other hoses or tubing that {{are open to the}} atmosphere." ...|$|R
2500|$|The U.S. National Fire Protection Association {{does most}} of the {{research}} and code writing to address the potential for explosions of gasoline vapor. The customer fueling area, up to [...] above the surface, normally does not have explosive concentrations of vapors, but may from time to time. Above this height, where most fuel <b>filler</b> <b>necks</b> are located, there is no expectation of an explosive concentration of gasoline vapor in normal operating conditions. Electrical equipment in the fueling area may be specially certified for use around gasoline vapors.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> tube for {{the engine}} is located behind the flip-down license plate door, as is the oil {{dipstick}} and the power steering fluid reservoir (when fitted). Most vans had a twist-on/off gas cap right on the outside just under and behind the passenger side door. A locking cap was optional. The spare tyre lies in a tray under the very front of the van (as {{the engine is}} in the back), just below the radiator.|$|R
2500|$|Leyland's {{corporate}} badge, {{a design}} {{based on the}} spokes of a wheel, appeared on the hubcaps of the 1500FWD, and next to the Triumph name on the metal identification labels fitted to the bootlids of various models. It was also used for the <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap on the Dolomite Sprint engine. However it was never used as a bonnet badge, with models of that era such as the TR6 and the second generation 2000 carrying a badge simply stating the name [...] "Triumph".|$|R
50|$|The dynamo {{is driven}} from the clutch casing {{so it is}} {{generating}} while the engine is running. The nearside of the engine carries the generator and magneto, the carburettor and its water-heated induction pipe with a proper hot-spot and the vacuum tank on the dash.The offside of the engine has the starter, steering-box, exhaust manifold, oil-dipper gauge and <b>oil</b> <b>filler.</b> The water connection between the lower casting and the cylinder head is through large external aluminium ports {{so there is a}} single compression joint between castings.|$|R
2500|$|The 1973 {{model was}} highly popular, {{due to the}} {{previous}} year's improvements, {{as well as the}} new four bolt 15" [...] with newly designed flat hubcaps, which replaced the original [...] "bowl type" [...] covers. The fuel <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> was moved from inside the trunk to the right front quarter panel, just above the fender. Inside, a matte black padded dashboard was introduced, resulting in greater comfort and less eye fatigue. The wiper/washer control was also moved from a button on the dashboard to a lever on the right of the steering column. Later that year, additional improvements appeared, including a four-spoke black steering wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Bladder tanks, or fuel cells, are {{reinforced}} rubberized bags {{installed in}} a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate {{the weight of the}} fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprops use bladder tanks. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. One major plus side is the ability to utilise as much of the aircraft as possible to store fuel.|$|R
50|$|Tell-tale {{signs of}} such {{eventual}} related damage are a white foam that {{appears on the}} inside of the <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap and the gradually increasing loss of antifreeze coolant (due to seepage into the intake passages which will lead to engine lock up failure in such cases). External seepage is also found near the valley edge of the lower intake manifold. These engines are also known for problematic EGR Valves in which carbon build-up occurs very rapidly, therefore reducing gas mileage drastically, however without affecting the reliability of the engine.|$|R
5000|$|The Times {{tried the}} 14/28 again and {{reported}} to its readers in mid January 1926 {{that while there}} may now be better designs of light car the 14/28 represented great value for money and still came with insurance for its first twelve months. A petrol gauge on the dash and an [...] "automatic screen wiper", two horns and a proper rear windscreen. There was still no filter in the <b>oil</b> <b>filler.</b> The same complaints were made as in previous reports yet the car's general behaviour on the road was considered [...] "praiseworthy".|$|R
40|$|In {{the known}} filling device, the {{handling}} unit is a distributor which is arranged {{at the bottom}} end of a vertical conveyor. It is borne by a carriage which travels along a bridge. Since the main components for automatic filling are easily accessible, there is the danger {{that they can be}} willfully or accidentally damaged. In order to protect the main components from accidental or willful damage, the handling unit is designed as a tank robot which is housed inside the tank island. The tank robot can reliably grab the filler nozzle by means of its grippers and easily guide it to the <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> of any motor vehicle. The filling device is not only suitable for conveying fluid fuels but also for pressurized gases...|$|R
50|$|The Typ 87 is a 2-door offroad sedan. The visual {{appearance}} {{is similar to}} the KdF-Wagen because the KdF-Wagen body was also used for the Typ 87. Due to the 5¼-16 offroad tyres, the wings had to be increased in size with an additional metal strip next to the bonnet and boot. The step strips were also increased in width. While the boot of the KdF-Wagen holds a spare wheel in front of the fuel tank, the Typ 87 has an additional 20 l fuel canister instead at the same place. The spare wheel is located on the 40 l fuel tank which has a modified <b>filler</b> <b>neck.</b> Chassis and body are connected with screws. By default, the Kommandeurswagen has a sunroof.|$|R
50|$|The DV {{range was}} {{available}} in range of sizes with capacities ranging from 8 to 36 pints, {{and the number of}} feeds from 1 to 26. Each of the lubricators consist of a reservoir, a ratchet assembly, a sliding shaft assembly, and the pump units. A screwed <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap is fitted to the lockable hinged lid of the reservoir and a sight glass for indicating the oil level is fitted to the front face of the reservoir. The pumps of the DV type lubricator are operated by a sliding shaft assembly, unlike the Silverton or Wakefield lubricators which are operated by a rotating camshaft.|$|R
25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gear stick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|R
50|$|Some of the 096 {{parts were}} held {{over for the}} 01M transmission, such as oil filter, <b>oil</b> pan, <b>filler</b> tube, gaskets, {{speedometer}} gears, skid plate, etc. These transmissions have different torque converters and other internal parts that are not interchangeable.|$|R
