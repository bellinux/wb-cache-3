5|$|Statistically, Cumberland are {{the worst}} team {{in the history of}} first-grade rugby league in Australia. They only have won 12.5% of their games, lowest to Annandale (18.3%), who are also a defunct team. They won the wooden spoon for being last <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the 1908 season. They had only one win which was 14–6 over Western Suburbs, and had their worst loss in their final game against Norths, 45–0. They lost six {{consecutive}} games from 9 May 1908 until 27 June 1908, a win, then a final loss. They scored an average 4.75 points each game whereas they had an average of 23.88 points scored against them.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} example shows {{a sequence}} of nested phrases in which each head precedes its complement. In the complementizer phrase (CP) in (a), the complementizer (C) precedes its tense phrase (TP) complement. In the tense phrase in (b), the tense-marking element (T) precedes its verb phrase (VP) complement. (The subject of the tense phrase, the girl, is a specifier, which {{does not need to}} be considered when analyzing the ordering of head and complement.) In the verb phrase in (c), the verb (V) precedes its two complements, namely the determiner phrase (DP) the book and the prepositional phrase (PP) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>In</b> (d), where a picture is analyzed as a determiner phrase, the determiner (D) a precedes its noun phrase (NP) complement, while in (e), the preposition (P) on precedes its DP complement your desk.|$|E

25|$|Designs {{initially}} {{considered for}} the various MOTS routes included the German-designed Type 214, Japan's Sōryū-class, the French-designed Scorpène class, the Spanish S-80 class, and an evolved Collins-class. The Spanish S-80 class was dropped from consideration due to serious design issues that had been noted in the public domain. An evolved Collins class design was also considered in 2013 but was officially dropped from consideration in 2015, due to it being assessed that the work required equated to composing a brand new design. In addition, Saab pushed an enlarged variant of its Swedish A26 submarine, but was excluded from further consideration in February 2015 due to Sweden having not designed and built a submarine independently for twenty years. Pure MOTS submarines were initially ruled out by the project in March 2011, but were put back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> December 2011.|$|E
25|$|AS Monaco made {{a winning}} start against Paris Saint-Germain's expensively-assembled {{team with a}} late goal. Guillaume Hoarau scored his first Paris Saint-Germain goal as the capital outfit {{condemned}} last season's runners-up Bordeaux to their first defeat of the season at the Parc des Princes. Sochaux got their first point {{of the season with}} a hard-earned draw at home to PSG. Paris Saint-Germain made it three games without defeat as their improvement under Paul Le Guen continued with another Guillaume Hoarau goal earning them a narrow win at Caen. Paris Saint-Germain took an early lead from the spot through new signing Mateja Kežman and held out for the 90 minutes to take all three points at home to Nantes. Saint-Étienne picked up their first win in four matches as they beat Paris Saint-Germain. Nassim Akrour's third goal of the season gave promoted Grenoble an historic win over Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. Paris Saint-Germain's poor recent run continued as they let slip an early lead to take only a point from Nancy. Paris Saint-Germain staged a come-from-behind win at home to Lorient with a late goal from substitute Loris Arnaud. Goals abounded as Paris Saint-Germain handed Marseille its first league defeat of the season, outscoring their arch-rivals four goals to two and denying them top spot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> a thrilling 'clasico' at the Stade Vélodrome. A bizarre own-goal from Zoumana Camara condemned Paris Saint-Germain to defeat at home to Toulouse. Paris Saint-Germain coach Paul Le Guen blasted his players for being too soft at half-time of their clash away to Nice, but despite an improved second-half display, the capital club fell to a second consecutive loss. Ludovic Giuly's first goal for Paris Saint-Germain was enough to earn all three against a resistant, if largely uninspired, Lille who saw their nine-game unbeaten run brought to an end at the Parc des Princes.|$|E

The film contains several elements based on Christian themes, including {{the concept of}} Luke as a Saint who wins over the crowds and is ultimately sacrificed. Newman's character of Luke is portrayed as a [...] "Jesus-like redeemer figure." [...] After [...] winning the egg-eating bet, Luke lies exhausted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the position of Jesus as depicted on his crucifixion.

Tammy and an agitated Ron go off to have coffee, and Donna (Retta) insists to Leslie that the arrangement is a mistake because the two act crazy when they are together. At a local diner, Ron and Tammy immediately start a very loud argument {{in front of the other}} patrons.

500|$|Jirat-Wasiutyński {{notes that}} art {{historian}} Denys Sutton {{was the first}} critic to interpret Gauguin's self-portrait as [...] "demonic". This interpretation {{is illustrated by the}} pendant, the companion piece [...] Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan (1889), which visually complements the Self-Portrait. De Haan's devilish eyes and red hair shaped like horns in his portrait {{on the left side of}} the dining room where it was created in situ, corresponds to the snake held in Gauguin's hand in his self-portrait on the right door of the dining room. [...] Two books appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> de Haan's portrait: Paradise Lost (1667–74) by seventeenth-century English poet John Milton, and Sartor Resartus by Thomas Carlyle. [...] These respective literary allusions, to Milton's Satan and to Carlyle's Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, a character described as both angelic and diabolical, play directly into de Haan's and Gauguin's corresponding self-portraits. Jirat-Wasiutyński argues that Gauguin portrays himself as a magus, as [...] "both seer and demonic angel".|$|E

500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> front of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
500|$|Franco's {{death in}} 1975 {{led to the}} {{beginnings}} of diplomatic movement between Britain and Spain on the Gibraltar issue, though not immediately. Spain applied to join the European Economic Community (EEC) and NATO, for which it needed British support. In 1980, talks between British and Spanish ministers led to the Lisbon Agreement, a statement on co-operation {{between the two countries}} which committed them to starting negotiations on Gibraltar's future and lifting the Spanish restrictions on communications with Gibraltar. Although Britain promised to [...] "honour the freely and democratically expressed wishes of the people of Gibraltar", Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher indicated in the House of Commons that sovereignty would be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>in</b> a change from the previous policy. However, the border was not reopened due to [...] "technical issues" [...] – code for unresolved issues between the two governments – and the agreement was strongly opposed by many Gibraltarians, who did not wish their sovereignty to be under discussion and objected to the lack of Gibraltarian representatives at the talks. The outbreak of the Falklands War in 1982 caused a further delay. Argentina carried out an unsuccessful sabotage operation, kept secret at the time, that was intended to sink a Royal Navy frigate in Gibraltar's harbour; the saboteurs were captured by the Spanish police in Algeciras before they could carry out their attack. A further agreement was reached in Brussels in 1984 which clarified the Lisbon Agreement and required that Britain allow Spaniards to live and work in Gibraltar, which they would {{have the right to do}} anyway as EEC citizens. The border was finally fully reopened on 4–5 February 1985.|$|E

5000|$|Later {{coffee tables}} were {{designed}} as low tables and this idea {{may have come}} from the Ottoman Empire, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> use in tea gardens.
