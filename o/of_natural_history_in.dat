5|$|D. carnegii (also spelled D. carnegiei), {{named after}} Andrew Carnegie, {{is the best}} known, mainly due to a near-complete {{skeleton}} (specimen CM 84) collected by Jacob Wortman, of the Carnegie Museum <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> <b>in</b> Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and described and named by John Bell Hatcher in 1901.

Ocepeia fossils have been recovered from the Grand Daoui, Meraa El Arech, and Sidi Chennane quarries, with the latter bearing the most complete specimens. Some of the original material was collected on-site as early as 1997, while other material was obtained from fossil dealers.|$|E
5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years. Barry's most famous rescue {{was that of a}} young boy. He found the child asleep in a cavern of ice. After warming up the boy's body sufficiently by licking him, he moved the boy about and onto his back and carried the child back to the hospice. The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> <b>in</b> Bern disputes the legend, attributing it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford, Illinois. Dubbed Jane, the find was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed {{that it is more}} likely a juvenile Tyrannosaurus. It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of her age. Jane is currently on exhibit at the Burpee Museum <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> <b>in</b> Rockford, Illinois.|$|E
