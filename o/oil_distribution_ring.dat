40|$|MANAGEMENT OF IODIZED OIL ADMINISTRATION IN SEVEN DISTRICTS IN WEST JAVAAND SOUTH SUMATERA DURING 1997 - 2002. Background: The {{intensification}} of administration of Iodized oil as a short term intervention program {{to combat the}} 100 problem have been launch more than 5 years. Since January 2001, the iodized oil program is under responsibility of the district government. Some problems araised. Objectives: To get an efficiency model of iodized <b>oil</b> <b>distribution.</b> Specific objective, to study the maximum coverage and the accuracy of distribution population target, inhibition and promoting factors of distribution. Methods: The study was crossectional and explorative. The study was done in six districts of West Java and one district in South Sumatera. Respondent were the 100 program officer. Primary data collected with interview method and secondary data collected with copying the annual data reported of primary health care, and/or notation of vilages midwive. Descriptive analysis on organisation and management flow of capsules was implemented. Results: It was found out that there were deviated target of iodized <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> area as well as population target which is happen in OKI, Sukabumi, and Karawang. In OKI, Iodized oil was distributed in precisely light and moderate prevalence kecamatan; and also elementary school. Planning of Iodized <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> not yet property running well due to some reasons. The coverage of Iodized <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> variated in between kecamatan (from 45, 8 % to 93, 5 %). Conclusions: The distribution model is fairly good. The quality of data for planning still low. There are some inhibiting factors drawn synergistic effect for delying the success of iodized oil administration. The coverage of distribution is low, fund for sweeping and up-dating population target data are too restrict. Recommendations: The iodized <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> guide book need to be updated. Administration of iodized oil in the light prevalence kecamatan should be sloped.

40|$|To study <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> in {{fermentation}} {{liquid and}} solids {{for the purpose}} of recovering oil from corn stillage by centrifugation, a low-shear single-screw extruder was used to treat corn for dry-grind ethanol fermentation. Five different treatments for corn were used, and their effects on ethanol fermentation, <b>oil</b> <b>distribution,</b> and <b>oil</b> extractability were studied. Extruded corn with different particles sizes had similar ethanol yields (33 % based on corn) because the starch was equally gelatinized by extrusion. Pretreatment with larger particle size before extrusion tended to have higher free oil than pretreatment with smaller particle sizes, but the effect was not dramatic, which indicates that manipulating particle size has limited effect on <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> in the liquid. Autoclaved flaked corn had lower ethanol yield because autoclaving at 28 % moisture did not fully gelatinize the starch. Addition of protease and cellulase significantly increased the ethanol yield by at least 4 %. A significant amount of bound oil became more extractable after enzyme treatment. Such oil can be effectively extracted into liquid phase by using a surfactant. In general, oil tended to be strongly associated with the solids in the thin stillage. By enzymatic treatment, 70 % <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> was achieved in the thin stillage, compared to the conventional fermentation, where only 50 % oil goes into the liquid. It was also demonstrated that mass loss after fermentation can be used to accurately quantify ethanol yield...|$|R

Based on an oil–water two-phase network simulation model, a three-dimensional pore-scale micro network model with solid–liquid interfacial effects was established. The influences of solid–liquid interface effects including van der Waals force and wettability on the residual <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> and relative permeability were investigated through microscopic simulation. The effects of pore radius, pore–throat size ratio, shaping factor, and coordination number on the residual <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> were analyzed at the same time. The results showed that the oil recovery would be overestimated by about 4 % without van der Waals force in a water-wet reservoir. The impact of van der Waals force on water-wet reservoirs was significantly obvious in contrast with oil-wet reservoirs. In addition, the residual <b>oil</b> <b>distribution</b> was significantly influenced by pore radius in water-wet reservoir, comparatively influenced by pore–throat size ratio in oil-wet reservoir. The present study illustrates the successful application of three-dimensional micro network models considering solid–liquid interfacial effects, and provides new insights for oil recovery enhancement...|$|R
