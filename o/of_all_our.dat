5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of the Petition by the House of Lords, Charles sent a message to the Commons [...] "forbidding them to meddle with affairs of state", something that produced a furious debate. John Finch, the Speaker of the House of Commons, announced that he had been commanded to interrupt any Member of Parliament who should insult or cast aspersion on a Minister of State, such as the Duke of Buckingham. This produced a [...] "spectacle of passions" [...] in the House; the tradition of free speech within the Commons was a long one, and many MPs found themselves [...] "unable to speak for tears running down their faces at the thought of the destruction of the liberties of Parliament". Coke, although crying, declared {{that he did not know}} whether he would be allowed to speak in Parliament again, but named Buckingham anyway, saying that [...] "the Duke of Buckingham is the cause <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> miseries, and till the King be informed thereof we shall never go out with honour, or sit with honour here; that man is the grievance of grievances; let us set down the cause <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> disasters and they will reflect upon him".|$|E
500|$|On 24 September 2007, the All-Burma Monks' Alliance {{released}} a statement condemning the military government: [...] "In order to banish the common enemy evil regime from Burmese soil forever, united masses of people need to join hands with the united clergy forces ... We pronounce the evil military despotism, which is impoverishing and pauperizing our people of all walks, including the clergy, as the common enemy <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> citizens."

500|$|The casual {{way that}} Truman and Groves {{were shown to}} decide to use the bomb, with Truman stating that [...] "I think more of our American boys than I do <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> enemies", while accurate, troubled Walter Lippmann, who felt that {{it could lead to}} foreigners being fearful of atomic weapons being in American hands. It was {{replaced}} with a scene where Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack or not. In it, Truman asserts that dropping the bomb will shorten the war, and a [...] "year less of war will mean life for... from 300,000 to half a million of America's finest youth".|$|E
500|$|In 1963, she {{appeared}} in Sunday in New York. Newsday called her [...] "the loveliest and most gifted <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> new young actresses". However, she also had detractors – in the same year, the Harvard Lampoon named her the [...] "Year's Worst Actress" [...] for The Chapman Report. Fonda's career breakthrough came with Cat Ballou (1965), in which she played a schoolmarm turned outlaw. This comedy Western received five Oscar nominations, with Lee Marvin winning best actor, {{and was one of}} the year's top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to bankable stardom. After this came the comedies Any Wednesday (1966), opposite Jason Robards and Dean Jones, and Barefoot in the Park (1967), co-starring Robert Redford.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the signing of}} the legislation, he visited each major island in the kingdom for a personal look at how the reciprocity treaty had affected his people. In a speech before an audience of Native Hawaiians at a Congregational church on Kauai, Kalākaua related his concerns, [...] "I will speak to you of one of our great questions, which is the supply of people, not only to meet the requirements <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> industries but to assist in the increase of a Hawaiian population." [...] He wanted to bring in Austronesian immigrants from Asia-Pacific nations to save the declining population of the Hawaiian race from completely dying out. Prior labor immigration had been mostly unmarried men, and he hoped to attract unmarried women as potential wives for them, as well as bringing in family groups.|$|E

500|$|Strength of mind, {{by which}} Wollstonecraft meant [...] "the {{degree to which}} [...] can {{independently}} reach its own conclusions" [...] (emphasis in original), is central to her idea of the female genius. Merely imitating others is not enough, even if one imitates the [...] "correct" [...] actions and thoughts. Reason, for Wollstonecraft, is what controls the emotions; without reason, she contends, people would fail to understand their own feelings. Moreover, reason allows for the distinction between a useful sensibility and a harmful sensualism. She writes: [...] "sensibility is indeed the foundation <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> happiness; but these raptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by what strikes his gross senses." [...] Useful sensibility allows Mary to embark upon charity projects. Yet, this highly attuned sensibility separates the classes along emotional lines: only the middle-class Mary is able {{to understand what the}} poor around her require.|$|E
500|$|After {{the passage}} of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, the Supreme Court dealt with a series of cases {{regarding}} the scope of that amendment's Due Process Clause. This Clause says that [...] "Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law". The Court initially rejected an argument that the Due Process Clause applied to the state governments in Hurtado v. California (1884), a case concerning the right to a grand jury hearing. Justice Matthews, writing {{for the majority of the}} Court, reasoned that [...] "the Amendment prescribing due process of law is too vague and indefinite to operate as a practical restraint." [...] While this decision rejected an expanded reach of the Due Process Clause, the Court stated that the Clause did protect against state encroachment of [...] "fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> civil and political institutions".|$|E
500|$|Beecham and Sargent were allies {{from the}} early days of the London Philharmonic to Beecham's final months when they were {{planning}} joint concerts. They even happened to share the same birthday. When Sargent was incapacitated by tuberculosis in 1933, Beecham conducted a performance of Messiah at the Albert Hall to raise money to support his younger colleague. Sargent loved Beecham's company, and took in good part his quips, such as his reference to the rising conductor Herbert von Karajan, as [...] "a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent" [...] and, on learning that Sargent's car was caught in rifle fire in Palestine, [...] "I had no idea the Arabs were so musical." [...] Beecham declared that Sargent [...] "is the greatest choirmaster we have ever produced ... he makes the buggers sing like blazes." [...] And on another occasion he said that Sargent was [...] "the most expert <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> conductors – myself excepted of course." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers responded {{positively}} to [...] "Tapestry". Zack Handlen, while writing for The A.V. Club, compared [...] "Tapestry" [...] {{to the television}} series Quantum Leap with the older Picard jumping into the younger man's body. He also said it had the [...] "feel" [...] of A Christmas Carol, {{and that it was}} a [...] "modest episode, with a modest goal: to remind us that the we are the sum <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> parts, even the ones we aren't very proud of." [...] He gave the episode a rating of [...] "A". In DeCandido's review of [...] "Tapestry" [...] for Tor.com, he compared the episode to It's a Wonderful Life, and called it one of the [...] "finest hours" [...] of the series. He praised [...] "Tapestry" [...] for endorsing the Q/Picard chemistry at the heart of Q episodes, and said that Stewart and de Lancie [...] "play off each other magnificently". He gave it a rating of 9 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Hutchinson {{simplified}} {{the task}} of her opponents, whose prosecution had been somewhat shaky. [...] Her revelation was considered not only seditious, but also in contempt of court. [...] Cotton was pressed by Dudley {{on whether or not}} he supported Hutchinson's revelation; he said that he could find theological justification for it. [...] Cotton may have still been angry over the zeal with which some opponents had come after the dissidents within his congregation. [...] Winthrop was not interested in this quibbling, though; he was using Hutchinson's bold assertions to lead the court in the direction of rewriting history, according to the historical interpretations of Winship. [...] Many of the Puritans had been convinced that there was a single destructive prophetic figure behind all of the difficulties that the colony had been having, and Hutchinson had just become the culprit. [...] Winthrop addressed the court, [...] "if therefore it be the mind of the court, looking at [...] as the principal cause <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> trouble, that they would now consider {{what is to be done}} with her." ...|$|E
500|$|Sensing {{an attack}} coming, Washington told his troops on September 5th, [...] "Should they [...] push their design against Philadelphia, on this route, their all is at stake—they {{will put the}} contest on {{the event of a}} single battle: If they are overthrown, they are utterly undone—the war is at an end." [...] Two days later, upon hearing that British ships had left the Chesapeake, Washington was sure Howe's move was imminent. He rallied his troops, {{referencing}} Horatio Gates's successes against the British in the north, saying [...] "Who can forbear to emulate their [...] noble spirit? Who is there without ambition, to share with them, the applauses of their countrymen, and of all posterity, as the defenders of Liberty, and the procurers of peace and happiness to millions in the present and future generations? Two years we have maintained the war and struggled with difficulties innumerable. But the prospect has since brightened, and our affairs put on a better face—Now is the time to reap the fruits <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> toils and dangers! ... The eyes of all America, and of Europe are turned upon us." ...|$|E
