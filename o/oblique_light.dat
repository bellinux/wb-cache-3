60|$|And {{all this}} she did {{from the moment}} of {{percussion}} onward, in a mood of exaltation entirely strange to her, but, as she was astonished to find, by no means disagreeable. She found afterwards that she only remembered very indistinctly her selection of the window and her preparations for the fatal blow, but that the effect of the actual breakage remained extraordinarily vivid upon her memory. She saw with extreme distinctness both as it was before and after the breakage, first as a rather irregular grey surface, shining in the <b>oblique</b> <b>light</b> of a street lamp, and giving pale phantom reflections of things in the street, and then as it was after her blow. It was all visual impression in her memory; she could not recollect afterwards if there had been any noise at all. Where there had been nothing but a milky dinginess a thin-armed, irregular star had flashed into being, and a large triangular piece at its centre, after what seemed an interminable indecision, had slid, first covertly downward, and then fallen forward at her feet and shivered into a hundred fragments....|$|E

6000|$|In fact, Quebec is {{a little}} painful in this and other confusions of the South and North, and one never quite reconciles himself to them. The Frenchmen, who {{expected}} to find there the climate of their native land, and ripen her wines in as kindly a sun, have perpetuated the image of home in so many things, that {{it goes to the}} heart with a painful emotion to find the sad, <b>oblique</b> <b>light</b> of the North upon them. As you ponder some characteristic aspect of Quebec,--a bit of street with heavy stone houses opening upon a stretch of the city wall, with a Lombardy poplar rising slim against it,--you say, to your satisfied soul, [...] "Yes, it is the real thing!" [...] and then all at once a sense of that Northern sky strikes in upon you, and makes the reality a mere picture. The sky is blue, the sun is often fiercely hot; you could not perhaps prove that the pathetic radiance is not an efflux of your own consciousness that summer is but hanging over the land, briefly poising on wings which flit at the first dash of rain, and will soon vanish in long retreat before the snow. But somehow, from without or from within, that light of the North is there.|$|E
60|$|Quebec lay {{shining in}} the tender <b>oblique</b> <b>light</b> of the {{northern}} sun when they passed next morning through the Upper Town market-place and took their way towards Hope Gate, where {{they were to be}} met by the colonel a little later. It is easy for the alert tourist to lose his course in Quebec, and they, who were neither hurried nor heedful, went easily astray. But the street into which they had wandered, if it did not lead straight to Hope Gate, had many merits, and was very characteristic of the city. Most of the houses on either hand were low structures of one story, built heavily of stone or stuccoed brick, with two dormer-windows, full of house-plants, in each roof; the doors were each painted of a livelier color {{than the rest of the}} house, and each glistened with a polished brass knob, a large brass knocker, or an intricate bell-pull of the same resplendent metal, and a plate bearing the owner's name and his professional title, which if not avocat was sure to be notaire, so well is Quebec supplied with those ministers of the law. At the side of each house was a porte-cochère, and in this a smaller door. The thresholds and doorsteps were covered with the neatest and brightest oil-cloth; the wooden sidewalk was very clean, like the steep, roughly paved street itself; and at the foot of the hill down which it sloped was a breadth of the city wall, pierced for musketry, and, past the corner of one of the houses, the half-length of cannon showing. It had the charm of those ancient streets, dear to Old-World travel, in which the past and the present, decay and repair, peace and war, have made friends in an effect that not only wins the eye, but, however illogically, touches the heart; and over the top of the wall it had a stretch of such landscape as I know not what Old-World street can command: the St. Lawrence, blue and wide; a bit of the white village of Beauport on its bank; then a vast breadth of pale-green, upward-sloping meadows; then the purple heights; and the hazy heaven over them. Half-way down this happy street sat the artist whom they had seen before in the court of the Hôtel Dieu; he was sketching something, and evoking the curious life of the neighborhood. Two schoolboys in the uniform of the Seminary paused to look at him as they loitered down the pavement; a group of children encircled him; a little girl with her hair in blue ribbons talked at a window about him to some one within; a young lady opened her casement and gazed furtively at him; a door was set quietly ajar, and an old grandam peeped out, shading her eyes with her hand; a woman in deep mourning gave his sketch a glance as she passed; a calash with a fat Quebecker in it ran into a cart driven by a broad-hatted peasant-woman, so eager were both to know what he was drawing; a man lingered even at the head of the street, as if it were any use to stop there.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{specimen}} preserves faint plumage impressions, {{it is understandable}} why they escaped v.

Only in <b>oblique</b> <b>light</b> do the Haarlem specimen's feather imprints show up at all, and these originate from the left forearm, and therefore likely the imprints of the animal's secondary remiges.

50|$|This is a circular, bowl-shaped crater with a rim raised {{above the}} surface of the {{surrounding}} lava plain.

These features are best observed under <b>oblique</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions when the terminator has just moved past the crater during the waxing phase.|$|R
40|$|Many {{biological}} {{objects are}} barely distinguished with the brightfield microscope because they appear transparent, translucent and colourless. One {{simple way to}} make such specimens visible without compromising contrast and resolution is by controlling the amount and the directionality of the illumination <b>light.</b> <b>Oblique</b> illumination is an old technique described by many scientists and microscopists that however has been largely neglected in favour of other alternative methods. <b>Oblique</b> <b>lighting</b> is created by illuminating the sample by {{only a portion of}} the light coming from the condenser. If properly used it can improve the resolution and contrast of transparent specimens such as diatoms. In this paper a quantitative evaluation of OL in brigthfield microscopy is presented. Several feature descriptors were selected for characterising contrast and sharpness showing that in general OL provides better performance for distinguishing minute details compared to other <b>lighting</b> modalities. <b>Oblique</b> <b>lighting</b> is capable to produce directionally shadowed differential contrast images allowing to observe phase details in a similar way to differential contrast images (DIC) but at lower cost. The main advantage of OL is that the resolution of the light microscope can be increased by effectively doubling the angular aperture. OL appears as a cost-effective technique both for the amateur and professional scientist that {{can be used as a}} replacement of DIC or phase contrast when resources are scarce.

50|$|Sverdrup is a lunar crater that {{is located}} about one crater {{diameter}} {{from the southern}} pole of the Moon.

50|$|Eckert is a tiny, {{isolated}} lunar {{impact crater}} {{in the northern}} part of the Mare Crisium (a circular region of relatively dark, flat material on the surface of the Moon).

50|$|The {{shell of}} this species {{slightly}} larger than that of Pupilla muscorum, with slightly more prominent growth lines, around 6 not very convex whorls. The shell apex is flat (in contrast to Pupilla muscorum and Pupilla pratensis). The apertural lip is weak; the cervical callus is weak; there are usually no teeth in the aperture, occasionally a weak parietal tooth. Note {{the presence of a}} characteristic gutter-like depression in the external surface of the last whorl, at about 1/4 of the distance from its base. (In <b>oblique</b> <b>light</b> this is also visible in the aperture as a narrow, delicate ridge).|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{of adults}} is about 70-80 mm. The forewings are dark brownish gray, darkest at the base, {{and with an}} <b>oblique</b> <b>lighter</b> band extending from the midwing to the leading edge near the wing base. The hindwings are yellow-orange with dark hairs at the base (though these are not especially prominent) and two concentric black bands. The yellow zone separating the black bands is wide, with a relatively smooth edge; {{the outer edge of}} the hindwings is light yellow with some black bars extending from the outer band. As typical for hickory-feeding Catocala, both foreleg and hindleg tibiae of this species are spiny, and the tarsi carry four rows of irregular rows of spines each.|$|R
40|$|Footwear {{impression}} {{evidence in}} dust {{is often difficult}} to locate in ambient light and is a fragile medium that both collection and enhancement techniques can destroy or distort. The collection of footwear impression evidence always begins with non-destructive photographic techniques; however, current methods are limited to <b>oblique</b> <b>lighting</b> of the impression followed by an attempt to photograph in situ 12, 15, 17. For the vast majority of footwear impressions, an interactive collection method, and thus a potentially destructive procedure, is subsequently carried out to gather the evidence 18. Therefore, alternative non-destructive means for the preservation and enhancement of footwear impressions in dust merits further attention. Previous research performed with reflected ultraviolet (UV) photography and reflected ultraviolet imaging systems (RUVIS) has shown that there are additional non-destructive methodologies that {{can be applied to the}} search for and documentation of footwear impressions in dust 34, 36, 37. Unfortunately, these prior studies did not include robust comparisons to traditional <b>oblique</b> white <b>light,</b> instead choosing to focus on different UV wavelengths. This study, however, seeks to evaluate the use of a RUVIS device paired with a 254 nanometer (nm) UV light source to locate 2 -D footwear impressions in dust on multiple substrates against standard <b>oblique</b> white <b>light</b> techniques and assess the visibility of the impression and amount of background interference present. The optimal angle of incident UV light for each substrate was also investigated. Finally, this study applied an image enhancement technique in order to evaluate its usefulness when looking at the visibility of a footwear impression and the amount of background interference present for enhanced white light and RUVIS pictures of footwear impressions in dust. 	A collection of eight different substrate types was gathered for investigation, including vinyl composition tile (VCT), ceramic tile, marble tile, magazine paper, steel sheet metal, vinyl flooring, wood flooring, and carpet. Heel impressions were applied to the various substrates utilizing vacuum collected dust and normal walking pressure. Each substrate was then explored and photographed in ambient fluorescent <b>light,</b> <b>oblique</b> white <b>light</b> at 0, 15, 30, and 0 with the light source below the surface plane of the substrate, and 254 nm UV light at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 0 with the light source below the surface plane of the substrate. All pictures were evaluated for clarity and visible detail of the footwear impression and the amount of background interference present, selecting for the best images within a lighting condition group. Additional intra- and intergroup comparisons were carried out to explore differences created by the various lighting conditions. Enhanced images were then created with the best scored pictures and evaluated for additional modifications in impression visibility and background interference. 	Photographs of footwear impressions in dust illuminated with ambient fluorescent light proved to be the most difficult conditions under which a footwear impression could be visualized. However, both <b>oblique</b> white <b>light</b> and 254 nm UV light lighting conditions showed improvements in either visualization or background dropout, or both, over ambient light conditions. An assessment of the white light and 254 nm UV light RUVIS images also demonstrated that the best angles for the light source for all substrates were oblique 0 and oblique 0 below the surface plane of the substrate lighting. It was found that white light photographs generally provided higher visibility ratings, while RUVIS 254 nm UV light photographs provided better grades for reducing background interference. Enhanced images of white light conditions provided generally poorer quality and quantity of details, while enhanced RUVIS images seemed to improve upon these areas. 	 The use of a RUVIS to capture photographs of footwear impression evidence in dust was found to be a successful secondary non-destructive technique that can be paired with traditional <b>oblique</b> white <b>light</b> procedures. Additionally, the use of below the surface plane of the substrate lighting techniques were found to improve either visibility or background dropout, or both, over standard 0 <b>oblique</b> <b>lighting,</b> depending on the light source, and should be employed, when applicable. Finally, further investigation into digital photo-editing enhancement techniques for footwear impression evidence in dust is needed...|$|R
