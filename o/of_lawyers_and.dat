5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function <b>of</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|During the 1580s, Coke became intimately {{linked with}} the Howard family, the Dukes of Norfolk and Earls of Arundel. His uncle Thomas Gawdy had close links to Earl Arundel himself. In Norfolk Arundel held a liberty– he was {{essentially}} a local prince who appointed all officials, maintained his own prison, executed justice and bribed any royal clerks. His power base was his household, particularly the network <b>of</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> stewards who held his estates together. Coke's uncle Thomas Gawdy had served as Steward to the Third Duke of Norfolk, and during the 1580s Coke was employed by the Howards to counter lawyers employed by the Crown, who argued that the Howards' lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th Duke. As well as defeating these direct attacks Coke traveled to Cardiff to answer a challenge by Francis Dacre, son of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre and uncle-in-law to the 4th Duke's three sons, Philip Howard and his two half-brothers, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Lord William Howard– he proved that Dacre's evidence was false and had the case dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The SPC is {{the highest}} court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which {{controls}} the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, {{in part because the}} Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage <b>of</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.|$|E

The claims asked for {{the installation of the}} water and sanitation infrastructure necessary to control the epidemic, compensation for the victims, and an apology. Fifteen months later, in February 2013, the UN stated that the case was “not receivable,” because it involved “review of policy matters”, citing the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. In October 2013, BAI, IJDH, and another U.S. law firm, filed a lawsuit challenging UN immunity in U.S. federal court {{on behalf of}} Haitian and Haitian-American victims of the cholera epidemic. In January 2015, Judge J. Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit, affirming UN immunity. In May 2015, an appeal to Oetken's decision was filed.|$|E

25|$|Concretely, Tunisian {{women are}} very {{involved}} in society, as they represent 58.1 per cent of students in higher education. They work in all trades, in the army, in civil and military aviation and in the police. They represent 72 per cent of pharmacy workers, 42 per cent in medicine, 27 per cent of magistrates, 31 per cent <b>of</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> 40 per cent of university professors. In total, in 2004 they constituted 26.6 per cent of the work force, although in 1989 they had only represented 20.9 per cent and a mere 5.5 per cent in 1966. Furthermore, from 1999 to 2004 job creation grew 3.21 per cent for women, {{with an average of}} 19,000 created each year. Moreover, the illiteracy rate of women ten years and older declined from 96.6 per cent in 1956 to 58.1 per cent in 1984 to 42.3 per cent in 1994 to 31 per cent in 2004; the masculine rate in 2004 was 21.2 per cent. This is explained primarily {{by the fact that the}} number of girls per one hundred boys in primary school was 52 in 1965 and 83 in 1989. Furthermore, in the absence of the equity law, they represented 14.89 per cent of the members of government, 22.75 per cent (43 of 189) of the deputies of the House elected on October 24, 2004, 27.06 per cent of municipal councillors and 18 per cent of the members of the economic and social council. In addition, between ten thousand and fifteen thousand of them are business leaders. Nevertheless, unemployment affects women disproportionately, 16.7 per cent in 2004 compared to 12.9 per cent for men.|$|E

500|$|On 13 August 1582 Coke married Bridget, the {{daughter}} of John Paston, a Counsellor from Norwich. Paston came {{from a long line}} <b>of</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> judges – his great grandfather, William Paston, was a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Having grown up nearby Coke knew the family, and asked for Bridget's hand immediately after she turned eighteen. At {{the time he was a}} thirty-one-year-old barrister with a strong practice, and her father had no qualms about accepting his offer. Six months after they married John Paston died, leaving his daughter and son-in-law his entire estate and several of his clients. Bridget maintained a diary, which reveals that she mainly ran the household. Despite this she was an independent woman, travelling without her husband and acting as a helpmate to Coke. Bridget was noted by Woolrych as an [...] "incomparable" [...] woman who had [...] "inestimable value clearly manifested by the eulogies which are lavished on her character". The couple settled at the manor of Huntingfield, described by Catherine Drinker Bowen as [...] "enchanting, with a legend for every turret...

500|$|The {{burning in}} 1789 of Catherine Murphy, for coining, {{received}} practically no {{attention from the}} newspapers (perhaps owing to practical limitations on how much news they could publish across only four pages), but {{it may have been}} enacted by Sir Benjamin Hammett, a former sheriff of London.

[...] He denounced the punishment as [...] "the savage remains of Norman policy" [...] which [...] "disgraced our statutes", as [...] "the practice did the common law". [...] He also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution.
