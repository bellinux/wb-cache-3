"What {{is really}} great about this clip, the in-joke that informs, underlines {{everything}} you see, {{is that these}} are three very famous people, working in exactly the same field, competing directly for television ratings and advertising dollars, who should supposedly have very large egos, making fun <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> and revealing— wait... is that irony, on American TV?— that they are probably very good friends, having a very good time." ...|$|E
500|$|Chancellor {{stated in}} May 2007 that the band would {{probably}} continue their tour until early 2008 and then [...] "take some time off". He {{added that the}} band had already written some new material and would surely release another album at some point. He speculated {{about the possibility of}} a [...] "band movie", something the band has considered for a long time. Ideas ranged from [...] "a narrative story in a surreal fashion with as much money and special effects as possible" [...] to [...] "pockets <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> or something that's live or the band playing". Although Carey stated that the necessary know-how was at hand due to the band's connections to artists working in the movie business, Jones dismissed the idea, saying [...] "It's just talk right now." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Usher commented that lyrically, 8701 represents his [...] "soul", and elaborated by explaining that he was inspired by love and heartache; [...] "I listen {{to a lot of}} Donny Hathaway's, Stevie Wonder's, Marvin Gaye's and Michael Jackson's earlier records, those Motown greats. There's a little bit <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> in the album. I really appreciate what music was back then {{as well as in the}} early '90s when you had artists like Troop and Jodeci, and Michael Jackson was in his prime." [...] Usher explained that the album's lyrics also reflect on what has been going on with his relationship; 8701 is predominantly an R album. [...] "Can U Help Me", is about a deep relationship to which Usher experienced. [...] "U Don't Have to Call" [...] is a hip-hop song inspired by Jackson, while [...] "U Got It Bad" [...] is an R slow-jam. About [...] "U Got It Bad", Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that it makes use of the acoustic guitar and a [...] "slow-burning bassline" [...] throughout. The album's lead single [...] "U Remind Me" [...] is also an R track, and its lyrics is based on meeting a woman who reminds Usher of an ex-girlfriend, and therefore cannot date her.|$|E

60|$|I {{nodded and}} we talked {{together}} long and earnestly, {{but in the end}} were no wiser for all our talking. For neither of us knew how it came about that men by striking water with a rod could turn it into what seemed to be blood, as the Hebrew prophet and Ki both had done, or how that blood could travel up the Nile against the stream and everywhere endure for a space of seven days; yes, and spread too to all the canals in Egypt, so that men must dig holes for water and dig them fresh each day because the blood crept in and poisoned them. But both of us thought that this was the work of the gods, and most <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> god whom the Hebrews worship.|$|E
6000|$|Then out {{and away}} to Livingstone once more. The maiden from New Hampshire disappeared; papa and mamma with her disappeared. Disappeared, too, {{the old lady}} from Chicago and all the rest, while I thought of all that I had not seen--the forest of petrified trees with {{amethyst}} crystals in their black hearts; the great Yellowstone Lake where you catch your trout alive in one spring and drop him into another to boil him; and most <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> mysterious Hoodoo region where all the devils not employed in the geysers live and kill the wandering bear and elk, so that the scared hunter finds in Death Gulch piled carcasses of the dead whom no man has smitten. Hoodoo-land with the overhead noises, the bird and beast and devil-rocks, the mazes and the bottomless pits,--all these things I missed. On the return road Yankee Jim and Diana of the Crossways gave me kindly greeting as the train paused an instant before their door, and at Livingstone whom should I see but Tom the driver? ...|$|E
60|$|General Halleck {{arrived at}} Pittsburg {{landing on the}} 11th of April and {{immediately}} assumed command in the field. On the 21st General Pope arrived with an army 30,000 strong, fresh from the capture of Island Number Ten in the Mississippi River. He went into camp at Hamburg landing five miles above Pittsburg. Halleck had now three armies: the Army of the Ohio, Buell commanding; the Army of the Mississippi, Pope commanding; and the Army of the Tennessee. His orders divided the combined force into the right wing, reserve, centre and left wing. Major-General George H. Thomas, {{who had been in}} Buell's army, was transferred with his division to the Army of the Tennessee and given command of the right wing, composed <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> army except McClernand's and Lew.

I was named second in command of the whole, and was also supposed to be in command of the right wing and reserve.|$|E

60|$|The use {{of words}} then being to stand as outward mark of our {{internal}} ideas, and those ideas being taken from particular things, if every particular {{idea that we}} take up should have a distinct name, names must be endless. To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general; which is done by considering them {{as they are in}} the mind such appearances,--separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as time, place, or any other concomitant ideas. This is called ABSTRACTION, whereby ideas taken from particular beings become general representatives of all of the same kind; and their names general names, applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract ideas. Such precise, naked appearances in the mind, without considering how, whence, or with what others they came there, the understanding lays up (with names commonly annexed to them) as the standards to rank real existences into sorts, as they agree with these patterns, and to denominate them accordingly. Thus the same colour being observed to-day in chalk or snow, which the mind yesterday received from milk, it considers that appearance alone, makes it a representative <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind; and having given it the name WHITENESS, it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagined or met with; and thus universals, whether ideas or terms, are made.|$|E
6000|$|Elsley and Lucia {{have not}} yet arrived at that terrible crisis: though {{they are on the}} path toward it,--the path of little carelessnesses, rudenesses, ungoverned words and tempers, and, worst <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> half-confidence, which is certain to avenge itself by {{irritation}} and quarrelling; for if two married people will not tell each other in love what they ought, they will be sure to tell each other in anger what they ought not. It is plain enough already that Elsley has his weak point, which must not be touched; something about [...] "a name," [...] which Lucia is to be expected to ignore,--as if anything which really exists could be ignored while two people live together night and day, for better for worse. Till the thorn is out, the wound will not heal; and till the matter (whatever it may be) is set right, by confession and absolution, there will be no peace for them, for they are living in a lie; and, unless it be a very little one indeed, better, perhaps, that they should go on to that terrible crisis of open defiance. It may end in disgust, hatred, madness; but it may, too, end in each falling again upon the other's bosom, and sobbing out through holy tears,--"Yes, you do know the worst of me, and yet you love me still. This is happiness, to find oneself most loved when one most hates oneself! God, help us to confess our sins to Thee, as we have done to each other, and to begin life again like little children, struggling hand in hand out of this lowest pit, up the steep path which leads to life, and strength, and peace." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are several}} who are persuaded {{that the same}} thing cannot happen in England, because here (they say) the occupations of merchants, tradesmen, and {{manufacturers}} are not held as degrading situations. I once thought that the low estimation in which commerce was held in France might be reckoned among {{the causes of the}} late Revolution; and I am still of opinion that the exclusive spirit of the French nobility did irritate the wealthy of other classes. But I found long since, that persons in trade and business were by no means despised in France in the manner I had been taught to believe. As to men of letters, they were so far from being despised or neglected, that there was no country, perhaps, in the universe, in which they were so highly esteemed, courted, caressed, and even feared: tradesmen naturally were not so much sought in society, (as not furnishing so largely to the fund of conversation as they do to the revenues of the state,) but the latter description got forward every day. M. Bailly, who made himself the popular mayor on the rebellion of the Bastile, and is a principal actor in the revolt, before the change possessed a pension or office under the crown of six hundred pound English a year,--for that country, no contemptible provision; and this he obtained solely as a man of letters, and on no other title. As to the moneyed men, whilst the monarchy continued, there is no doubt, that, merely as such, they did not enjoy the privileges of nobility; but nobility was of so easy an acquisition, that it was the fault or neglect <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> description who did not obtain its privileges, for their lives at least, in virtue of office. It attached under the royal government to an innumerable multitude of places, real and nominal, that were vendible; and such nobility were as capable of everything as their degree of influence or interest could make them,--that is, as nobility of no considerable rank or consequence. M. Necker, so far from being a French gentleman, was {{not so much as a}} Frenchman born, and yet we all know the rank in which he stood on the day of the meeting of the States.|$|E
