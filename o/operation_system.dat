Also in 1947, Calgary Power built its Barrier Hydro Plant and used it to test the use of a newly developed remote-control <b>operation</b> <b>system.</b> The automation efforts worked well enough that Calgary Power soon converted all of its plants to the Barrier Plant system.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} incident, WMATA General Manager John Catoe {{stated that the}} cause was not known but that [...] "the system is safe." [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began an investigation. WMATA and NTSB {{investigators}} considered several possible causes, which might include operator error, brake failure, fault in the computerized signal and <b>operation</b> <b>system,</b> {{or a combination of}} the three. During rush hour operation, train movement is typically controlled by a centralized computer system, and a separate decentralized system can automatically apply the brakes to prevent a collision. These systems had failed at least once in the past, and the NTSB subsequently identified incompatible specifications, from the maximum deceleration capability of the trains to the deceleration rates used in the wayside system design. [...] The train has a manual emergency brake, which can be applied by the driver {{in the event of an}} imminent collision, if the driver can see and identify the hazard with sufficient time to stop. Officials indicated that the manual brake was indeed engaged. It is possible that the brake system failed to perform as designed, or that the operator applied the brake too late. The lead car of the moving train was two months overdue for scheduled brake maintenance. In a press conference the evening of June 22, Catoe stated that the last car on the stopped train was a CAF 5000-Series car (car 5066), which entered service in 2001, and that the lead car on the moving train was a Rohr Industries 1000-Series car. WMATA later confirmed that all of the cars on the moving train were 1000-Series.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the claim that}} the application of human factors (HF) knowledge can improve both human well-being and <b>operations</b> <b>system</b> performance. Methodology: A systematic review was conducted using a general and two specialist databases to identify empirical studies addressing both human effects and <b>operations</b> <b>system</b> effects in examining manufacturing <b>operations</b> <b>system</b> design aspects. Findings: We found 45 empirical studies addressing both the human effects and <b>system</b> effects of <b>operations</b> <b>system</b> (re) design. Of those studies providing clear directional effects, 95 % showed a convergence between human effects and system effects (+,+ or -,-), 5 % showed a divergence of human and system effects (+,- or -,+). System effects included quality, productivity, implementation performance of new technologies, and also more ‘intangible’ effects in terms of improved communication and co-operation. Human effects included employee health, attitudes, physical workload, and ‘quality of working life’. Research limitations/implications: Future research should attend to both human and system outcomes in trying to determine optimal configurations for <b>operations</b> <b>systems</b> as this appears to be a complex relationship with potential long-term impact on operational performance. Practical implications: The application of HF in <b>operations</b> <b>system</b> design can support improvement in both employee well-being and system performance in a number of manufacturing domains. Originality/value: This paper outlines and documents a research and practice gap between the fields of HF and OM research that has not been previously discussed in the management literature. This gap may be inhibiting the design of <b>operations</b> <b>systems</b> with superior long term performance...|$|R

The Model 1916 and Model 1917 were exported to Canada and the United Kingdom, and a few were supplied to the US military, particularly the Navy.

2500|$|Dramatic {{changes were}} {{occurring}} in the service industries, as well. [...] Beginning in 1955 McDonald's provided {{one of the first}} innovations in service operations. [...] McDonald's is founded on the idea of the production-line approach to service. [...] This requires a standard and limited menu, an assembly-line type of production process in the back-room, high customer service in the front-room with cleanliness, courtesy and fast service. While modeled after manufacturing in the production of the food in the back-room, the service in the front-room was defined and oriented to the customer. It was the McDonald's operations system of both production and service that made the difference. McDonald's also pioneered the idea of franchising this <b>operation</b> <b>system</b> to rapidly spread the business around the country and later the world.|$|E
