5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E
25|$|The action {{potentials}} {{that travel}} down connected neurons {{are based on}} electric current generated by the movement of sodium and potassium ions into and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> Specialized cells in certain animals like the electric eel can generate electric currents powerful enough to disable much larger animals.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol reduces bone formation, favoring {{long-term}} {{development of}} osteoporosis (progressive bone disease). It transports potassium <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> {{in exchange for}} {{an equal number of}} sodium ions (see above). This can trigger the hyperkalemia of metabolic shock from surgery. Cortisol also reduces calcium absorption in the intestine.|$|E

50|$|While some {{prisoners are}} allowed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>cells</b> at times, others remain locked in their <b>cells</b> most <b>of</b> the time. Many prisoners who {{are kept in}} their cells must find ways <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cells.</b> Even those who are allowed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>cells</b> at times still have plans that involve escape from their cells.|$|R
25|$|Endocytosis and {{exocytosis}} {{are both}} forms of bulk transport that move materials into and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively, via vesicles. In {{the case of}} Endocytosis, the cellular membrane folds around the desired materials outside the cell. The ingested particle becomes trapped within a pouch, known as a vesicle, inside the cytoplasm. Often enzymes from lysosomes are then used to digest the molecules absorbed by this process.|$|E
25|$|Like other insects, the red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} breathes through {{a system of}} gas-filled tubes called tracheae connected to the external environment through spiracles. The terminal tracheal branches (tracheoles) make direct contact with internal organs and tissue. The transport of oxygen to cells (and carbon dioxide <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells)</b> occurs through diffusion of gases between the tracheoles and the surrounding tissue and is assisted by a discontinuous gas exchange. As with other insects, the direct communication between the tracheal system and tissues {{eliminates the need for}} a circulating fluid network to transport O2. Thus, red imported fire ants and other arthropods can have a modest circulatory system though they have highly expensive metabolic demands.|$|E
25|$|KCC2 {{levels are}} low during {{mammalian}} embryonic development, when neural networks {{are still being}} established and neurons are highly plastic (changeable). During this stage, intracellular chloride ion concentrations are high due to low KCC2 expression {{and high levels of}} a transporter known as NKCC1 (Na+/K+ chloride cotransporter 1), which moves chloride ions into cells. Thus, during embryonic development, the chloride gradient is such that stimulation of GABAA receptors and glycine receptors at inhibitory synapses causes chloride ions to flow <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> making the internal neuronal environment less negative (i.e. more depolarized) than it would be at rest. At this stage, GABAA receptors and glycine receptors act as excitatory rather than inhibitory effectors on postsynaptic neurons, resulting in depolarization and hyperexcitability of neural networks.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a maximum}} {{security}} prison or area (called high {{security in the}} federal system), all prisoners have individual cells with sliding doors controlled from a secure remote control station. Prisoners are allowed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>cells</b> one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> twenty four hours (one hour and 30minutes for prisoners in California). When <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>cells,</b> prisoners remain in the cell block or an exterior cage. Movement <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cell</b> block or [...] "pod" [...] is tightly restricted using restraints and escorts by correctional officers.|$|R
50|$|Resistance to {{fungicides}} {{can also}} be developed by efficient efflux <b>of</b> the fungicide <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cell.</b> Septoria tritici has developed multiple drug resistance using this mechanism. The pathogen had 5 ABC-type transporters with overlapping substrate specificities that together work to pump toxic chemicals <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cell.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{this phase}} the {{membrane}} is most permeable to K+, which can travel into or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> through leak channels, including the inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Therefore, the resting membrane potential is mainly determined by K+ equilibrium potential {{and can be}} calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation.|$|R
25|$|Cystic fibrosis: More than 1,800 {{mutations}} in the CFTR gene {{have been found}} {{but the majority of}} these have not been associated with cystic fibrosis. Most of these mutations either substitute one amino acid (a building block of proteins) for another amino acid in the CFTR protein or delete a small amount of DNA in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation, called ΔF508, is a deletion (Δ) of one amino acid (phenylalanine) at position 508 in the CFTR protein. This altered protein never reaches the cell membrane because it is degraded shortly after it is made. All disease-causing {{mutations in}} the CFTR gene prevent the channel from functioning properly, leading to a blockage of the movement of salt and water into and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> As a result of this blockage, cells that line the passageways of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs produce abnormally thick, sticky mucus. This mucus obstructs the airways and glands, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. In addition, only thin mucus can be removed by cilia; thick mucus cannot, so it traps bacteria that give rise to chronic infections.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers {{have long}} known that astrocytes express water {{channels}} called aquaporins. Until recently, however, no physiological function has been identified that explains their presence in the astrocytes of the mammalian CNS. Aquaporins are membrane-bound channels that play critical roles in regulating the flux of water into and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> [...] Relative to simple diffusion, the presence of aquaporins in biological membranes facilitates a 3–10 fold increase in water permeability.|$|E

50|$|Osmosis is {{the process}} in which water flows from an area with a low solute concentration, to an {{adjacent}} area with a higher solute concentration until equilibrium between the two areas is reached. All cells are surrounded by a lipid bi-layer cell membrane which permits {{the flow of water}} in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cell</b> while also limiting the flow of solutes. In hypertonic solutions, water flows <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cell</b> which decreases the cell's volume. When in a hypotonic solution, water flows into the membrane and increases the cell's volume. When in an isotonic solution, water flows in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cell</b> at an equal rate.|$|R
