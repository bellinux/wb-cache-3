5|$|An {{important}} {{area of research}} concerned the Wigner effect. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the graphite moderator can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, this causes the graphite to heat and swell. Investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.|$|E

5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> in which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, {{and the answer is}} a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} her selection, Sarumpaet was {{approached}} by UNICEF and asked to do a survey of child trafficking in Southeast Asia and promote awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> After discovering the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> she wrote Pelacur dan Sang Presiden (The Prostitute and the President), spending six months interviewing prostitutes in Surabaya, Surakarta, Garut, and Borneo in preparation.

5|$|A {{commonly}} studied variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> involves {{networks of}} interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where {{three or more}} of the curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although {{it was probably the}} most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E
5|$|Gum-digging was {{the major}} source of income for {{settlers}} in Northland, and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land. By the 1890s, 20,000 people were engaged in gum-digging, of which 7000 worked full-time. Gum-digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland families would cross the Waitematā Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> {{that has been}} frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is that we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E
5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres {{at the front of}} the car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun in the opposite direction to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> {{was that}} Bordeaux {{may not have}} {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because {{it was out of}} range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E
