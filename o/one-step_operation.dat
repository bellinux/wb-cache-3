40|$|Sorting {{algorithms}} are {{an intrinsic}} part of functional programming folklore as they exemplify algorithm design using folds and unfolds. This {{has given rise}} to an informal notion of duality among sorting algorithms: insertion sorts are dual to selection sorts. Using bialgebras and distributive laws, we formalise this notion within a categorical setting. We use types as a guiding force in exposing the recursive structure of bubble, insertion, selection, quick, tree, and heap sorts. Moreover, we show how to distill the computational essence of these algorithms down to <b>one-step</b> <b>operations</b> that are expressed as natural transformations. From this vantage point, the duality is clear, and one side of the algorithmic coin will neatly lead us to the other `for free'. As an optimisation, the approach is also extended to paramorphisms and apomorphisms, which allow for more efficient implementations of these algorithms than the corresponding folds and unfolds...|$|R

Even with {{the depth of}} features in a convolutional network, a layer in isolation is not enough: compounding and aggregating these representations improves inference of what and where. Architectural efforts are exploring many dimensions for network backbones, designing deeper or wider architectures, but how to best aggregate layers and blocks across a network deserves further attention. Although skip connections have been incorporated to combine layers, these connections have been "shallow" themselves, and only fuse by simple, <b>one-step</b> <b>operations.</b> We augment standard architectures with deeper aggregation to better fuse information across layers. Our deep layer aggregation structures iteratively and hierarchically merge the feature hierarchy to make networks with better accuracy and fewer parameters. Experiments across architectures and tasks show that deep layer aggregation improves recognition and resolution compared to existing branching and merging schemes...|$|R
40|$|Eutectic bonding is a {{diffusion}} brazing process developed for fabricating boron-aluminum components from composite monolayer.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that Bell {{inequality}} supporting the local realism can be violated in quantum mechanics. Numerous tests of such a violation have been demonstrated with bipartite entanglements. Using spectral jointmeasurements of the qubits, we here propose a scheme to test the tripartite Mermin inequality (a three-qubit Bell-type inequality) with three qubits dispersively-coupled to a driven cavity.

50|$|Many {{metal forming}} {{operation}} require too much deformation of the blank {{to be performed}} in a single step. Multistep or progressive stamping operations are used to incrementally form the blank into the desired shape {{through a series of}} stamping operations. Incremental forming simulation software platforms addresses these operations with a series of <b>one-step</b> stamping <b>operations</b> that simulate the forming process one step at a time.Another common goal in design of metal forming operations is to design the shape of the initial blank so that the final formed part requires few or no cutting operations to match the design geometry. The blank shape can also be optimized with finite element simulations. One approach is based on an iterative procedure that begins with an approximate starting geometry, simulates the forming process and then checks deviation of the resulting formed geometry from the ideal product geometry. The node points are adjusted in accordance with the displacement filed to correct the blank edge geometry. This process is continued until the end blank shape matches the as-designed part geometry.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{the second part of}} a two-part article about shape {{optimization}} of metal forming processes. This part is focused on numerical applications of the optimization method which has been described in the first paper. The main feature of this work is the analytical calculations of the derivatives of the objective function for a non-linear, non-steady-state problem with large deformations. The calculations are based on the differentiation of the discrete objective function and on the differentiation of the discrete equations of the forging problem. Our aim here is to show the feasibility and the efficiency of such a method with numerical examples. We recall the formulation and the resolution of the direct problem of hot axisymmetrical forging. Then, a first type of shape optimization problem is considered: the optimization of the shape of the initial part for a <b>one-step</b> forging <b>operation.</b> Two academic problems allow for checking the accuracy of the analytical derivatives, and for studying the convergence rate of the optimization procedure. Both constrained and unconstrained problems are considered.

We tried to apply the most suitable reconstruction techniques for this particular case. Methods: We report a case of a 99 -year-old woman, with a vision loss of 70 % in the left eye and 40 % in the right eye, who underwent basal cell carcinoma resection of the lower right eyelid 3 months before. The margins of resection and the deepest layers were affected. After the histopathology report, we decided to plan a more aggressive treatment with a total resection of the lower right eyelid. We had a case with 3 added difficulties: the old age of the patient, the vision loss in the contralateral eye, {{and the size of the}} resection. Results: On the basis of our experience and the bibliography reviewed, we decided to use the chondromucosal nasal flap for the posterior lamella reconstruction and the transposition flap of von Langenbeck for the anterior lamella.

40|$|Emerging {{lower cost}} {{titanium}} metal powder produced via an electrolytic method has been fully consolidated using spark plasma sintering (SPS) generating microstructures {{comparable to those}} observed in Ti– 6 Al– 4 V PM product. This {{is the first time}} powder from an alternative titanium extraction method has been processed via SPS and it is benchmarked with commercial alloys (CP–Ti, Ti– 6 Al– 4 V, and Ti– 5 Al– 5 V– 5 Mo– 3 Cr). The effect of powder feedstock size, morphology, and alloy chemistry on the consolidated density and microstructure is presented. Through a design of experiments (DoE) type approach the effect of SPS processing conditions on these alloy powders, including maximum sintering temperature, pressure, heating rate, and dwell time were investigated. The SPS process is found to be largely insensitive to feedstock size and morphology, although very large or highly porous powder particles are more difficult to fully consolidate. The maximum sintering temperature and pressure have the largest contribution to achieving full consolidation, with higher pressures and temperatures increasing the final density. Increasing heating rate increases the final grain size, despite less time being spent at the higher temperature and it is thought this is due to bypassing the traditional first phase of sintering. This paper shows that SPS is a viable step for a low-cost manufacturing route, for example to produce preform billets to be finished with a <b>one-step</b> forging <b>operation,</b> especially when combined with the possibility of lower cost powder. In the long-term, SPS will allow a significant reduction in the processing cost, contributing to an increased usage of titanium powder feedstock for a range of applications. This is reinforced by the successful large scale production of a 5 kg SPS Ti- 6 - 4 billet, demonstrating the potential industrial scalability of the process, particularly for the aerospace industr...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} progress {{towards a}} step-change in {{the economics of}} titanium. Titanium's properties make it desirable to designers, but it is frequently overlooked due to high costs; making research into reducing costs of considerable interest. Examining the literature shows cost reduction possibilities in two main areas; extraction and downstream processing. Lower-cost extraction has previously received much attention, but in isolation will not produce the required reductions. Powder metallurgy techniques allow near net shape (NNS) production with limited material wastage and processing steps; also allowing utilisation of powders/particulates produced by many developing extraction methods. Combining products from alternative extraction with novel solid-state downstream processing has potential to produce truly cost-effective titanium alloy components. Chapter 4 establishes field assisted sintering technology (FAST) as a rapid and effective method to fully consolidate commercial and developing titanium alloy powders, {{with a wide variety}} of chemistries, morphologies, and sizes, including material from the Metalysis FFC process. FAST scalability was successfully tested by producing a 5. 5 kg, 250 mm diameter, specimen. Chapter 5 shows that titanium alloy preforms produced via FAST behave equivalently to conventionally processed melt, multi-step forged, products. The shapes and microstructures produced were not those typically required for components. Consequently, chapter 6 investigates the proposed cost-effective processing route of producing wrought microstructures in two steps from powder, which has been termed FAST-forge. A fully dense, microstructurally homogeneous, shaped preform billet formed via FAST was finished with a precision <b>one-step</b> forging <b>operation</b> that refined the microstructure, verifying the FAST-forge concept at laboratory-scale. It is anticipated with further development, and by utilising finite element modelling, that it will be possible to produce semi-complex NNS components with competitive mechanical properties in just two steps. Therefore, FAST-forge has potential to be disruptive technology that could enable the desired step-change in the economics of titanium. ...|$|R

Also, it describes a strategy of supportive systems to aid the conventional protection philosophy in combating situations where protection systems have maloperated and/or information is missing and provide selective and secure coordinations. SVMs have considerable potential as zone classifiers of distance relay coordination. This typically requires a multiclass SVM classifier to effectively analyze/build the underlying concept between reach of different zones and the apparent impedance trajectory during fault.

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the activity recovered by patients after one-stage open ACL reconstruction and osteochondral autologous grafting of articular cartilage lesions and after isolated open ACL reconstruction. The study group included 21 patients with chronic ACL deficiency and grade III or IV cartilage lesion according to the ICRS scale who were treated with combined ACL reconstruction and osteochondral grafting in one step. The control group included 32 patients with chronic ACL insufficiency and no chondral deficit higher than grade I on the ICRS scale who underwent isolated reconstruction of the ligament. For the assessment, the Lysholm and Gillquist (L&G) score and the functional Marshall score were used. Both groups displayed a statistically significant improvement in the L&G score and the Marshall score between the preoperative and 12 -month assessments. The mean gain in L&G score over this period was 30. 66 ± 7. 79 in the study group and 31. 65 ± 6. 96 in the control group.

40|$|AbstractThe Strong Categorical Combinatory Logic (CCL, CCLβηSP), {{developed}} by Curien (1986) is, when typed and augmented with a rule defining a terminal object, {{a presentation of}} Cartesian Closed Categories. Furthermore, it is equationally equivalent to the Lambda-calculus with explicit couples and Surjective Pairing. Here we study the confluence propertied of (CCL, CCLβηSP) and of several of its subsystems, {{and the relationship between}} untyped Lambda-calculi and (CCL, CCLβηSP) as rewriting systems. We prove that there exists a subset D of CCL, and a subsystem SLβ of CCLβηSP confluent on D, a very simple isomorphism between Λ, the classical Lambda-calculus, and a subset SDλ of D, which is extended between β-derivations of Λ and a class of derivations of SLβ. Substitution, which is a <b>one-step</b> <b>operation</b> belonging to the metalanguage of Λ, is now described by rewritings with SLβ and calculations between several substitutions launched at the same time may be performed by SLβ. This point is a real increase in the calculation capacities of Lambda-calculus (same results for D). The same result holds for the Lambda-calculus with couples and projection rules (without Surjective Pairing). The locally confluent subsystem CCLβSP (that is SLβ + (SP)) is not confluent. This result is obtained by firstly designing a new counter-example (different from J. W. Klop's one) for confluence of the Lambda-calculus with couples and Surjective Pairing and then translating it into CCL. However, CCLβSP is shown to be confluent on the set derived from SDλ. These results cannot be obtained with classical methods of confluence and we designed a new method called Interpretation Method based on this trick: a given relation R is confluent on a set X if and only if a relation E(R) induced by R on a set of regularized terms E(X) is confluent...|$|E
