40|$|In vitro {{amplification}} of {{nucleic acids}} using the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) has become, since its discovery in the 1980 s, a powerful diagnostic tool {{for the analysis of}} microbial infections {{as well as for the}} analysis of microorganisms in food samples. However, despite its potential, PCR has neither gained wide acceptance in routine diagnostics nor been widely incorporated in standardized methods. Lack of validation and standard protocols, as well as variable quality of reagents and equipment, influence the efficient dissemination of PCR methodology from expert research laboratories to end-user laboratories. Moreover, the food industry understandably requires and expects <b>officially</b> <b>approved</b> <b>standards.</b> Recognizing this, in 1999, the European Commission approved the research project, FOOD-PCR ([URL] which aims to validate and standardize the use of diagnostic PCR for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in foods. The present review focuses on the harmonization procedure and standardization criteria for detection of foodborne pathogens by PCR. The progress of standardization so far and future perspectives of diagnostic PCR are discussed...|$|R
40|$|While the Web {{is facing}} {{interesting}} new {{changes in the}} way users access, interact and even participate to its growth, the most traditional applications dedicated to its fruition: web browsers, are not responding with the same euphoric boost for innovation, mostly relying on third party or open-source community-driven extensions for addressing the new Social and Semantic Web trends and technologies. This technological – and decisional – gap, which is probably {{due to the lack of}} a strong standardization commitment on the one side (Web 2. 0 /Social Web) and in the delay of massive adherence to new <b>officially</b> <b>approved</b> <b>standards</b> (W 3 C approved Semantic Web languages), has to be filled by successful stories which could lay the path for the evolution of browsers. In this work we present a novel web browser extension which combines several features coming from the worlds of terminology and information extraction, semantic annotation and knowledge management, to support users in the process of both keeping track of interesting information they find on the web, and organizing its associated content following knowledge representation standards offered by the Semantic Web. 1...|$|R
25|$|After much hesitation, on July 3, 1944, the British {{government}} {{consented to}} the establishment of a Jewish Brigade with hand-picked Jewish and also non-Jewish senior officers. On 20 September 1944 an official communique by the War Office announced the formation of the Jewish Brigade Group of the British Army and the Jewish Brigade Group headquarters was established in Egypt at the end of September 1944 (the formation was styled a brigade group because of the inclusion under command of an artillery regiment). The Zionist flag was <b>officially</b> <b>approved</b> as its <b>standard.</b> It included more than 5,000 Jewish volunteers from Mandatory Palestine organized into three infantry battalions of the Palestine Regiment and several supporting units.|$|R
40|$|IEEE 802. 3 az) <b>standard</b> was <b>officially</b> <b>approved.</b> This new <b>standard</b> {{introduces}} a low power mode {{for the most}} common Ethernet physical layer standards {{and is expected to}} provide large energy savings. In this letter, for the first time, Network Interface Cards (NICs) that implement Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) are used to measure energy savings with real traffic. The data presented will be useful to better estimate the energy savings that can be achieved when EEE is deployed. Existing analysis of EEE based on simulations predict a large overhead due to mode transitions between active and low power modes. The experimental results confirm that transition overheads can be significant, leading to almost full energy consumption even at low utilization levels. Therefore traffic patterns will {{play a key role in}} the energy savings achieved by EEE as it becomes deployed in the field. Index Terms—IEEE 802. 3, Ethernet, energy efficiency...|$|R
