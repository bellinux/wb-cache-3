40|$|The {{understanding}} and prediction of high-lift aerodynamics {{of a civil}} aircraft in landing configuration still lacks validated and comprehensively assessed databases involving numerical simulations, wind tunnel tests as weil as flight tests. The joint research project HINVA (High lift INflight VAiidation) aims on closing this gap for a short to medium range transport aircraft together with its specific high-lift devices. The research aircraft, used to apply all three methodologies, is the Airbus A 320 ATRA (Advanced Technology Research Aircraft). The present work comprised an airborne particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement conducted {{as part of the}} second flight test campaign of the project HINVA. The specific task of the PIV system was the quantification of the <b>outer</b> <b>strake</b> vortex which was initiated by the outer vortex generator of the nacelle in the high-lift regime. PIV data at different Reynolds numbers and angles of attack was acquired and evaluated. This contribution summarizes the PIV flight test study by presenting its setup, realization and results...|$|E
