25|$|The {{process of}} {{emission}} and absorption of photons seemed {{to demand that}} the conservation of energy will hold at best on average. If a wave containing exactly one photon passes over some atoms, {{and one of them}} absorbs it, that atom needs to tell the others that they can't absorb the photon anymore. But if the atoms are far apart, any signal cannot reach the other atoms in time, and they might end up absorbing the same photon anyway and dissipating the energy to the environment. When the signal reached them, the other atoms would have to somehow recall that energy. This paradox led Bohr, Kramers and Slater to abandon exact conservation of energy. Heisenberg's formalism, when extended to include the electromagnetic field, was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sidestep this problem, a hint that the interpretation of the theory will involve wavefunction collapse.|$|E
25|$|To {{bolster the}} Tasmanian team Colin McDonald of Victoria was shipped over with Jim Burke, Norm O'Neill and Peter Philpott of New South Wales. Terence Cowley won the toss {{and put the}} MCC in to bat rather than face Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman, Peter Loader and Ted Dexter on a green wicket in English-style conditions. Willie Watson (43) and Arthur Milton (83) put on 99 for the first wicket, Peter May (80) and the out-of-form Colin Cowdrey (72) 123 for the fifth wicket and the M.C.C batted into the second day before declaring on 384/9, Cowley taking 5/92. McDonald used a heavy bat and made 104 before he threw his wicket away in what was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a draw. No other batsman made 30 and the wickets were shared around {{five of the seven}} bowlers used, Tyson (3/60) being the best, though Trueman took a good one-handed catch off Mortimore to dismiss O'Neill for 20. The {{tourists}} batted out the last afternoon, Watson making 42 and Graveney 52 in their 162/4.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Brian Lowry of Variety said: [...] "Despite a pedigree that includes Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz {{and many of}} that program's stars, Sit Down seldom rises above sniggering double entendre." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode B, saying: [...] "I'm staying optimistic that the characters {{are going to get}} fleshed out in upcoming episodes, because this is <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a character-based ensemble comedy." [...] Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode, noting the [...] "familiar aspects" [...] of [...] Arrested Development, such as the [...] "deft wordplay, biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor". He concluded, saying: [...] "As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter, this should continue to be a very entertaining show." [...] Kona Gallagher [...] of TV Squad watched the episode twice, and said that it [...] "definitely grows on you." [...] She concluded, saying: [...] "In all, I think the first time you watch Sit Down, Shut Up, it's really easy to blow it off as another animated show that's trying too hard. However, it's actually worth sticking around and watching a couple of episodes." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{members of}} Duran Duran have {{discussed}} eventual plans for Reportage. According to Rhodes, the group hopes {{to release it}} someday: [...] "We want it to come out one day, it's a really interesting record... more of an edgy, indie rock album, <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> our earlier roots. There {{are a lot of}} songs I'm very proud of that I'd like people to hear.".|$|R
5000|$|Commings let it {{be known}} that he wanted the job badly, and he even came to Iowa to {{campaign}} for it. At one of these rallies, Commings told reporters, [...] "I feel I can win at Iowa. <b>Obviously,</b> it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take football players, but I don't feel anybody has a better rapport with the high school players than me. We have always had a very sophisticated football program at Massillon. My coaching staff (nine men) is larger than at most colleges." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{band members}} are Christians {{and in an}} {{interview}} with the BBC, Josh Farro stated [...] "Our faith is very important to us. It's <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come out in our music because if someone believes something, then their world view is going to come out in anything they do. But we're not out here to preach to kids, we're out here because we love music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hudson, {{known as}} the [...] "Railway King" [...] was concentrating on {{connecting}} his portfolio of railways so as to join Edinburgh with the English network. His Newcastle and Berwick Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament in 1845, but {{for the time being}} it was to use the Newcastle and North Shields Railway's station at Carliol Square. Building a crossing of the Tyne was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a lengthy process, so that he gave the construction of the general station a low priority. The Tyne crossing became the High Level Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|... was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be a hard}} sell. Notwithstanding {{the strong}} policy {{arguments}} in favor of establishing this privilege and the serious harm that would be caused by its absence, no such protection had ever been held to exist. Not only was the concept that the judicial system was entitled to 'every man's evidence' itself deeply rooted in the Constitution, but merely determining the scope of the privilege (when would it apply?) and identifying who would receive it (only regularly employed journalists? freelancers? anyone?) were difficult matters at best." [...] Floyd Abrams ...|$|E
5000|$|Potvin {{subsequently}} {{told the}} press, [...] "If {{you read the}} story that I wrote, you'll notice that I'm talking about it on a symbolic level [...] [...] [...] I go to great pains {{to make clear that}} I'm not talking about the deaths of anybody. After all, as you can imagine, I'm a human being. I'm a father, I'm a hockey dad, I'm a businessman, I'm a community leader. I'm <b>obviously</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be revelling in the deaths of anybody." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009/10 season, Tahir {{moved from}} the Titans to the Dolphins. This was {{due to a lack of}} {{first-class}} cricket with the club, who preferred to play 23-year-old leg-spinner Shaun von Berg. When Tahir was called into South Africa's squad for the final Test against England, national coach Mickey Arthur said [...] "I'm not entirely sure what the issues are between him and the Titans, but the Titans <b>obviously</b> aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pick him because they'd rather pick the young leggie they have". He holds the record for representing highest number of teams (27) in the world. He moved to the Highveld Lions in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|... "At this point, I {{think we}} can win at all of 'em." [...] Hamlin {{speaking}} after the race. Hamlin appeared in victory lane to celebrate his sixth win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Hamlin also earned $219,975 in race winnings, and he later expressed his confidence heading into the Chase: [...] "It's been an up-and-down year, but there's been a lot of ups, and <b>obviously</b> we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> enter this Chase No. 1. It means a lot to this whole race team. A lot of people bashed this race team about 'can't finish this, and can't finish that.' But we've got the most wins, and hopefully that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> carry us for the 10 weeks in the Chase." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who's jesting? I'm not. It's {{a mighty}} serious thing for me. I {{want to get}} away. The only thing that's keeping me in this forsaken place is this delay. These people are <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fire me sooner or later. Why on earth can't they do it at once?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None," [...] she replied, [...] "except that I {{never saw}} any one with such overmanicured nails as his. I never knew {{him to go to}} a {{manicurist}} in my life, but he is <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> one nearly every day now or he couldn't keep the polish on. If that helps in any way--" ...|$|E
60|$|The voyage was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pay, but {{the strange}} thing was, their cargo {{for the most}} part had come down after the agent died. To some extent this bore out Marston's {{conclusion}} that the old mulatto was the Bat and had power over Don Felix's uncivilized customers. Marston began to muse about the fellow. He had power; one felt it, although he was old and repulsive. Something indicated that he had inherited from his white ancestors qualities not often found in half-breeds. Marston began to see that this was partly why the fellow repelled him; one got a hint of intelligence put to a base use.|$|E
50|$|Tony Havelock-Allen {{was running}} a {{production}} company, Constellation Films. Daniel Birt was an editor who wanted to direct and brought Interrupted Journey to the company. Havelock-Allen was married to Valerie Hobson {{at the time and}} he also felt the movie might make a good vehicle for Richard Todd who had just become a star with The Hasty Heart. The producer later recalled:I didn't think much of the project, {{but if you have a}} company you have to do something, because the money keeps on going out. It had no success at all, however. Daniel Birt was <b>obviously</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a great director; editors can always make films but only the very talented ones can make good films.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with AbsolutePunk regarding {{the sound of the}} album, rhythm guitarist Mike Kennerty stated [...] "Pop radio is literally just pop music now. There’s no guitars to be found, so we kind of saw that coming. It’s a different place and we made a different record. It’s not like a singles record, it’s actually a record. That was our concentration from when we were recording. We knew we were making a fucking record. Fuck the normal system of singles and all that stuff. <b>Obviously,</b> it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get worked by the label, but we wanted to make something we were proud of as a record, first and foremost, and we did that." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "A lot {{of people}} want to have her face {{revealed}} and <b>obviously</b> people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be pissed off either way. Like, 'I thought she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> look beautiful!' or, 'I thought she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the most hideous thing ever!' So we've had a lot of debate over Tali's face, but that's the one we kind of dread a lot. We're always, 'Well, let's talk about something else for a while!'

60|$|His {{feelings}} that night differed considerably {{from the frame}} of mind {{in which he had}} gone to bed the night before. It was partly a very excellent dinner and partly the fact that Psmith's flat, though at present in some disorder, was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be extremely comfortable, that worked the change. But principally it was due to his having found an ally. The gnawing loneliness had gone. He did not look forward to a career of Commerce with any greater pleasure than before; but there was no doubt that with Psmith, {{it would be easier to}} get through the time after office hours. If all went well in the bank he might find that he had not drawn such a bad ticket after all.|$|E
5000|$|According to a France 24 {{report in}} October 2012, [...] "rich {{businessmen}} from Damascus and Aleppo support the FSA {{as well as}} political organisations like the Muslim Brotherhood." [...] The ideology of various FSA groups depended on their sponsors and funders. [...] "If a militia receives money from the Muslim Brotherhood, then it <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an Islamist militia", an observer stated.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{analysts say}} that the new {{parliament}} could create difficulties for Mehmet Ali Talat, the peace negotiator for the Turkish Cypriots. With Talat's party gaining slightly fewer seats, [...] "... it is <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> limit Talat's ability {{to act in a}} lot of ways, you know parliament {{is going to have a}} much greater say in all of this and really can tie his hands." ...|$|E
50|$|The North British Railway was {{involved}} with the company financially and in the Board of the D&QR, but by now it had become obvious within the NBR that the way forward was a Forth Bridge. The expenditure on that scheme would be huge, and any money diverted to connecting the Queensferry route would be wasted. The NBR nominees on the D&QR Board were instructed to do all they could to slow the rate of progress of the planning and construction of the railway. In June 1874 the NBR prevarication {{came to a head}} when the D&QR directors re-issued the company's prospectus, and decided to go it alone without the promised NBR financial support, which was <b>obviously</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be made available.|$|R
5000|$|Co-writer Wyatt Durrette told The Boot {{that the}} idea came when he and Zac went to a bar in Orlando, Florida to watch a UFC fight. Durrette said that while they were {{watching}} the fight a guy and a girl walked in and all night she stared at him. Durrette {{said that she was}} [...] "a beautiful girl, but she had her boyfriend with her, so I <b>obviously</b> wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say or do anything. We kind of spoke all night from across the room, but didn't say anything to each other." [...] Durrette said that Zac had the idea of bringing the wise man into it and turning it into the older man at the bar who's a much wiser man, giving you advice.|$|R
5000|$|Brent Sexton (Stan Larsen) {{spoke about}} portraying his {{character}} {{from the first}} to second seasons: [...] "I don't know if there's anything different {{in terms of the}} performance, but the conflict is different, and <b>obviously</b> Stan is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be different. Last year Stan was a bit frozen in inaction. This year, he's trying to take action and get resolution on his past, his present, and his future, but to gain resolution on one of those creates conflict on another." ...|$|R

5000|$|A company without {{funds and}} with a {{judgment}} against it for default on paying its contractor was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{find it difficult to}} resume construction work; and so it proved. A small series of apparently willing contractors were found, only for them to leave the negotiation at the last minute, until a deal was struck with Green and Burleigh, a London company, were prepare to complete the work [...] "for the remainder of the shares and debentures".|$|E
50|$|With the {{unsuccessful}} Frank Taylor now departed {{new manager}} Tony Waddington quickly began to stamp his {{mark on the}} club allowing a number of players to leave the club whilst bringing in his own replacements. It was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a transitional season for the club but there was probably too much upheaval as performances out on the pitch were not good and despite a 9-0 win over Plymouth Argyle, Stoke finished in 18th place avoiding relegation by three points.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rock Sound, lead vocalist Jason Aalon Butler commented on record's sound, stating [...] "it's a Letlive record, so <b>obviously</b> there's always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an element of aggression and rock 'n' roll present, {{but there is a}} lot of new stuff going on musically. There are elements of new wave, as well as some really dark hip-hop and soul influences, and even some indie references. We've always mixed things up and experimented, and this record is no different." ...|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, in March 2012 more {{insight into}} the {{internal}} issues surrounding the Chicago move—including an attempt made by the writers {{to find a new}} owner—are explored by articles in The Atlantic Wire and New York magazine's Daily Intelligencer. [...] According to an article in the Chicago Tribune, founding editor Scott Dikkers returned to the publication in light of the Chicago move stating that he hopes to find a [...] "younger and hungrier" [...] pool of talent in Chicago than what was available in New York City. [...] "The Onion is <b>obviously</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> draw talent from wherever it is", Dikkers said. [...] "In Madison, people used to just come in off the street ... and we'd give them a shot. The Onion has always thrived on the youngest, greenest people." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bauer {{features}} an eclectic and large variety of pitches. According {{to an article}} in Sports Illustrated, he has experimented with up to 19 different pitches. He explained in an interview why he features so many pitches:I'm very passionate about my craft and I've always been into science and discovery and all that stuff, so I'm always {{trying to find a}} way to get better from season to season. And throwing more pitches is a way that I've found to.... The more pitches that I have, that have different speeds and move differently, the more confusion it creates for the hitter. And if I throw all of them out of the same tunnel and make them look the same though 20 feet of flight ... <b>obviously,</b> I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a lot tougher to hit.|$|R
5000|$|After an inquiry, the {{stewards}} {{allowed the}} result to stand. [...] "Even though the betting public could see {{there were some}} problems there, we felt that (Better Talk Now) was <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win the race, and it didn't really affect the placing of the horses," [...] explained Chuck Nuber, one of Lone Star's three stewards. [...] "(Kitten's Joy) comes on and finishes second, about the best {{that it was going}} to finish. It was a little rough, but it was the correct order of finish." ...|$|E

They were <b>obviously</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be for me." [...] A total of four Harrison compositions would appear on the Don't Take Love For Granted including the title cut and [...] "Love is the Sweetest Mistake" [...] which were respectively the A-side and B-side of the overlooked lead single.|$|E
5000|$|In 1952, Martin Stone {{wanted to}} try his hand at {{producing}} a comedy, and so he and Coopersmith {{came up with the}} idea of a series called [...] "Johnny Jupiter" [...] about a television studio janitor, played by Vaughn Taylor, who succeeds in contacting the planet Jupiter. His attempt to explain the strange ways of Earth to the Jupiterians, portrayed by hand puppets, provided the satirical content of the series. In reviewing the show, Jack Gould of the New York Times wrote, “If Mr. Coopersmith can sustain the brilliant pace of the opening show, he <b>obviously</b> is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> move quickly to the head of the class among TV’s satirists.” [...] The 13-week series was produced on the independent station, DuMont Television Network, and was extended for another 26 weeks as a sitcom on ABC.|$|R
500|$|Irving {{was dismayed}} by the storyline which saw Meyer shot in a road rage incident, {{describing}} filming the scenes as an [...] "unpleasant experiences", the worst aspect being that Meyer loses his spleen {{as a result of}} his injuries. Of the later storyline which sees Meyer investigated by Tom Campbell-Gore on behalf of the hospital Board, Denis Lawson explained: [...] " [...] actually rather fancies Meyer's job but if he finds against him in the investigation he cannot get the job because it's a conflict of interest. So he has to play a rather clever game, which he does." [...] On taking over as head of the cardiothoracic surgery department, he commented: [...] "George is fantastic in the show, but <b>obviously</b> I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do something very, very different, so I don't feel that I'm stepping into his shoes." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} Auguste was calling the Sioux warriors women, and was riding wildly {{around on his}} horse saying {{they had come to}} fight, not to talk. Lt. Grattan led his force deeper into the village, and located High Forehead, who upon being ordered to {{surrender}} High Forehead dared Lt. Grattan to come fight him man to man, and that he would die rather than surrender. This annoyed Grattan greatly, who now turned to negotiating with Conquering Bear. The Indian leader requested that Lt. Grattan have soldiers go and retrieve James Bordeau to translate, as Auguste would not translate correctly, and, he was intoxicated. One of the Indian leaders, Man-Afraid-Of-His-Horse, went and retrieved Bordeau. However, before Bordeau arrived the tension between Lt. Grattan and Conquering Bear had increased. Bordeau quickly realized before he reached the meeting spot that violence was <b>obviously</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be avoided, and he turned back.|$|R
