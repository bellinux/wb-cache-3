Under the direction <b>of</b> <b>newly</b> appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility.

In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E
