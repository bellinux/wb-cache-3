40|$|Central {{data bases}} are useful {{only if they}} are kept up to date and easily {{accessible}} in an interactive (query) mode rather than in monthly reports that may be out of date and must be searched by hand. The concepts of automatic data capture, data base management and query languages require good communications and readily available work stations to be useful. The minimal necessary work station is a personal computer which can be an important office tool if connected into <b>other</b> <b>office</b> <b>machines</b> and properly integrated into an office system. It {{has a great deal of}} flexibility and can often be tailored to suit the tastes, work habits and requirements of the user. Unlike dumb terminals, there is less tendency to saturate a central computer, since its free standing capabilities are available after down loading a selection of data. The PC also permits the sharing of many other facilities, like larger computing power, sophisticated graphics programs, laser printers and communications. It can provide rapid access to common data bases able to provide more up to date information than printed reports. Portable computers can access the same familiar office facilities from anywhere in the world where a telephone connection can be made...|$|E
