5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> wake times. Second, inflammation may <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E

5|$|The game divides {{each school}} {{day of the}} storyline into four {{segments}}. These segments illustrate the events that <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> Takaaki's commute to school, during school, after school, and after he returns {{home at the end}} of each day. Depending on the time of the day and the player's actions, he or she may be presented one of three types of events: mandatory events, which occur automatically during certain points in the game's plot line; temporary events, which <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> certain periods of time only if specific conditions are met; or after school events, which occur at the end of each school day.|$|E
5|$|Although Parker {{had promised}} to hold auditions for {{students}} attending the Performing Arts, the school was initially advised by the Board of Education to prevent the students from working on the film, fearing it would affect their studies. It was later announced that filming would <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> the summer when the students were not attending school. Parker distributed casting call advertisements at the Performing Arts school and the High School of Music & Art.|$|E
5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
30|$|The {{incipient}} droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the wintering {{period of}} the winter wheat growth helped to increase the winter wheat yield, while the mild droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the maturity stage of winter wheat resulted in a reduction of yield. The mild droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the filling and maturity period {{had a significant effect}} on the yield of winter wheat. The moderate droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the flowering, filling, and maturity periods of the winter wheat growth {{had a significant impact on}} yield. In addition, the water shortage due to droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the seeding period in autumn also affected the production of winter wheat, and that is particularly true for the severe and extreme droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the seeding period. With some exception of the occurrence of droughts of certain intensities during some specific growth stages of winter wheat, droughts of higher intensities had greater impacts on winter wheat yield during the critical growth stages.|$|R

5|$|Attacks may {{be brought}} on by {{physical}} exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This may explain why attacks are more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> a period of rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.|$|E

5|$|Five {{days after}} the shootdown, USAF OPC {{officials}} began including Black Hawk flight times in the daily ATO and included the correct IFF code in the ATO provided to Eagle Flight. OPC officially ended on 31 December 1996. Over the six years of the operation, coalition participants flew a total of 62,000 fixed-wing and rotary-wing sorties. The Black Hawk shootdown was the only serious accident to <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> the operation.|$|E

5|$|In smaller litters, {{difficulties}} may <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> labour due to oversized pups. Large litters {{result in}} higher incidences of stillbirth, {{but because the}} pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, {{lack of access to}} the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns. Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating.|$|E
5|$|In the ride's {{narrative}} of events preceding those that <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> the ride, King Adelsten entered {{the mountain to}} fight a dragon called Ormaar. During the battle, the king lost his crown. Stansein, one of the king's servants, guides riders through the mountain to find and retrieve the crown. Throughout the ride, riders can score points by hitting objects on the screen with their light guns. At the end, the highest scores are placed in the 'Wonder Mountain's Guardian Hall of Fame'.|$|E

5|$|Pilot whales {{have one}} of the longest birth {{intervals}} of the cetaceans, calving once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> the summer for long-finned pilot whales. For short-finned pilot whales of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which calving peaks can vary by population. For long-finned pilot whales, gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned pilot whales have a 15-month gestation period.|$|E
5|$|Tank {{bursting}} due to overpressure may {{be prevented}} by a pressure-relief burst disc fitted to the cylinder valve, which bursts if the cylinder is overpressurised and vents air {{at a rapid}} controlled rate to prevent catastrophic tank failure. Accidental rupture of the burst disc can also <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> filling, due to corrosive weakening or stress from repeated pressurization cycles, but is remedied by replacement of the disc. Bursting discs are not required in all jurisdictions.|$|E

5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax (PSP) tends {{to occur in}} a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E
