25|$|Since 1959, {{a second}} enigmatic group of ancient sea {{reptiles}} is known, the Hupehsuchia. Like the Ichthyopterygia, the Hupehsuchia have a pointed snout and show polydactyly, {{the possession of}} more than five fingers or toes. Their limbs more resemble those of land animals, making them appear as a transitional form between these and ichthyosaurs. Initially, this possibility was largely neglected because the Hupehsuchia have a fundamentally different form of propulsion, with an extremely stiffened trunk. The similarities were explained as a case of convergent evolution. Furthermore, the descent of the Hupehsuchia is no less <b>obscure,</b> <b>meaning</b> a possible close relationship would hardly clarify the general evolutionary position of the ichthyosaurs.|$|E

He knew that step. There was no doubt about it. She had come back! And he very nearly said aloud [...] "Of course!"--such was his sudden and masterful {{perception}} of the indestructible character of her being. Nothing could destroy her--and nothing but his own destruction could keep her away. She was the incarnation of all the short moments which every man spares out of his life for dreams, for precious dreams that concrete the most cherished, the most profitable of his illusions. He peered at her with inward trepidation. She was mysterious, significant, full of <b>obscure</b> <b>meaning</b> --like a symbol. He peered, bending forward, as though he had been discovering about her things he had never seen before. Unconsciously he made a step towards her--then another. He saw her arm make an ample, decided movement and he stopped. She had lifted her veil. It was like the lifting of a vizor.|$|E

The Demoiselle, keeping her carriage, is for Liberty indeed, as she has full well shewn; but then for Liberty with Respectability: whereupon these serpent-haired Extreme She-Patriots now do fasten on her, tatter her, shamefully fustigate her, in their shameful way; almost fling her into the Garden-ponds, had not help intervened. Help, alas, to small purpose. The poor Demoiselle's head and nervous-system, none of the soundest, is so tattered and fluttered that it will never recover; but flutter worse and worse, till it crack; and within year and day we hear of her in madhouse, and straitwaistcoat, which proves permanent!--Such brownlocked Figure did flutter, and inarticulately jabber and gesticulate, little able to speak the <b>obscure</b> <b>meaning</b> it had, through some segment of that Eighteenth Century of Time.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate children's ability to use semantic syntax in connection with two types of meanings of polysemantic words. Cne hundred fourth graders ranked the familiarity cf multiple definitions of 60 words given in a semantic survey. Those 34 words found to have common <b>meanings</b> or <b>obscure</b> <b>meanings</b> were used to construct a Words in Context Test. A second version of the test was developed using a low-association value trigram instead of the target real word. The two versions were administered to 64 subjects. from three fourth-grade classes randomly assigned to experimental groups. There were consistently more errors cn <b>obscure</b> <b>meanings</b> than on common meanings. The mean difference was greater with real words (- 4. 81) than with trigrams (-. 75). Fewer errors were made with real words on ccmmon meanings, but more errors were made with real words cn <b>obscure</b> <b>meanings.</b> Children's problems with <b>obscure</b> <b>meanings</b> represented by the frequent use of multiple-meaning words in sentences seem to be due to interference by better-known meanings of familiar words diverting them from the semantic syntax.

She also considers whether repetition underpins or <b>obscures</b> <b>meaning</b> and the context, and if the location in which an image is stored or experienced changes what it communicates...|$|R

In one such instance, Cioculescu dismissed the claim that Arghezi's Inscripţie pe un portret ("Inscription on a Portrait") was riddled with <b>obscure</b> <b>meanings,</b> by offering his interpretation and presenting the issue as soliciting one's perspicacity. Ştefănescu, who described Arghezi as [...] "Don Quixote" [...] to Cioculescu's [...] "Sancho Panza", noted that the critical process resulted in the two of them switching roles, and that the critic himself largely invented the arguments against Arghezi to support his own thesis.|$|R

50|$|Verbal Object The {{designation}} of the verbal object takes five different forms. /us/ is a reflexive suffix, as in wonotiusam he killed himself. The second suffix, /jo/ indicated both plural object and repetitive actions. This occurs in cani majse ono wojomakas Im {{going to hit}} them (one after another) {{on the head with}} a stick, and humbotmenwet as hesbopajodom I kept on shoving anything into the sack. The third suffix is used commonly and appears to have an <b>obscure</b> <b>meaning.</b> /to/ can be used with /ju/ rub on to form juto rub in and with /mej/ give to form mejto buy. It may work to create the transitive form of a verb, although this is not always the case. /toto/, a reduplication of /to/ indicates reciprocal action.|$|E

Producing gaps in the plots can even be considered one of the forms of expression of jokes. In closing, a few words and images on humour in visual contemporary folk art that have attracted {{a lot of interest in}} Finland for over the past ten years.

5000|$|The name Diapensia lapponica {{was given}} by Linnaeus to {{designate}} a flower found in Lapland, where he traveled early in his career. Linnaeus's book about the flora of Lapland has been called [...] "the first proto-modern flora". However, sources disagree on how Linnaeus might have derived the genus name, Diapensia. Gray states that the term {{was derived from the}} ancient Greek name of the Sanicle, a very different looking flower, and opined that the term was [...] "of <b>obscure</b> <b>meaning</b> and strangely applied [...] [...] [...] to this boreal plant." [...] Webster's also reflects uncertainty stating the term is [...] "New Latin, perhaps irregular from Greek dia pente by fives + New Latin -ia; from the five-leaved calyx", a description that would apply to thousands of flowering plants. The Encyclopaedia Londinensis of John Wilkes suggested that term is from Greek,"deeply grieving or mourning; probably from its situation".|$|E
5000|$|Nebeker kept a dream journal, {{a source}} for some of his work. There is a clear {{influence}} from expressionism, but Nebeker is less cynical and more humorous {{in the treatment of}} his subjects. In his self portraits, he sometimes portrayed himself as a woman. Asked why he often painted words and phrases in Japanese and Norwegian on his work, Nebeker responded, [...] "I don't like the way English looks, it is so blatant. It is too easy to take literally, too easy to see what it means. I don't intentionally <b>obscure</b> <b>meaning,</b> but I distrust clarity." [...] The last of his painted work often exceeded six foot dimensions.

50|$|Various {{kinds of}} {{language}} peculiar to ingroups can be named across a semantic field. Slang {{can be either}} culture-wide or known only within a certain group or subculture. Argot is slang or jargon purposely used to <b>obscure</b> <b>meaning</b> to outsiders. Conversely, a lingua franca {{is used for the}} opposite effect, helping communicators to overcome unintelligibility, as are pidgins and creole languages. For example, the Chinook Jargon was a pidgin. Although technical jargon's primary purpose is to aid technical communication, not to exclude outsiders by serving as an argot, it can have both effects at once and can provide a technical ingroup with shibboleths. For example, medieval guilds could use this as one means of informal protectionism. On the other hand, jargon that once was obscure outside a small ingroup can become generally known over time. For example, the terms bit, byte, and hexadecimal (which are terms from computing jargon) are now recognized by many people outside computer science.|$|E
