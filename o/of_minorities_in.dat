5|$|The {{original}} {{stated purpose}} of GRCs was {{to guarantee a}} minimum representation <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> Parliament and ensure that {{there would always be}} a multiracial Parliament instead of one made up of a single race. Speaking in Parliament during the debate on whether GRCs should be introduced, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Chok Tong said he had first discussed the necessity of ensuring the multiracial nature of Parliament with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in July 1982. Then, Lee had expressed concern about the voting patterns of younger Singaporeans, who appeared to be apathetic to the need of having a racially balanced slate of candidates. He was also worried about more Singaporeans voting along racial lines, which would lead to a lack of minority representation in Parliament.|$|E

25|$|Education is {{considered}} a contributing factor to why {{women are more likely}} than men to live in poverty. 63% of female households who have children under the age of 18 do not complete high school. However, for minority women, socioeconomic factors contribute to them receiving less of an education than whites. There is a high concentration <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding in inner-city schools.|$|E

25|$|After the Turkish War of Independence {{ended in}} Greek defeat in Anatolia, {{and the fall}} of Lloyd George and his Middle Eastern policies, the western powers agreed to the Treaty of Lausanne with the new Turkish Republic, in 1923. This treaty made Tenedos and Imbros part of Turkey, and it {{guaranteed}} a special autonomous administrative status there to accommodate the local Greek population. The treaty excluded the Orthodox Christians on the islands from the population exchange that took place between Greece and Turkey. Article 14 of the treaty provided specific guarantees safeguarding the rights <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> both the nations.|$|E
25|$|The state {{proclaimed the}} {{official}} ideology {{that there are}} no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see Czechoslovakism), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II (after the country had been divided during the war), the conflict between the Czechs and the Slovaks surfaced again. The governments of Czechoslovakia and other eastern European nations deported ethnic Germans to the West, reducing the presence <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> the nation. Most of the Jews had been killed during the war by the Nazis and their allies.|$|E
25|$|Since 1982, both parliaments {{have had}} {{to comply with the}} Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which constitutionalized a number of {{fundamental}} human rights and educational rights <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> all provinces (education is a provincial jurisdiction in Canada). Prior to this, Quebec was effectively the sole province required constitutionally to finance the educational needs of its linguistic minority. Ontario and Quebec are both required to finance schools for their principal religious minorities (Roman Catholic in Ontario, Protestant in Quebec), but only in Quebec is the minority almost completely composed of speakers of the minority language. (Quebec also provided English schools for anglophone Roman Catholics.) In 1997, an amendment to the constitution allowed for Quebec to replace its system of denominational school boards with a system of linguistic school boards.|$|E

25|$|Thirty years later, the 1960s {{ushered in}} a {{turbulent}} period for St. Paul's. In 1968, students wrote an acerbic manifesto describing the school administration as an oppressive regime. As {{a result of this}} manifesto, seated meals were reduced from three times a day to four times a week, courses were shortened to be terms (rather than years) long, Chapel was reduced to four times a week, and the school's grading system was changed to eliminate + and- grades and given its current High Honors, Honors, High Pass, Pass, and Unsatisfactory labels instead of A–F. By the end of the sixties, St. Paul's had begun to admit sizable numbers <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> every class, had secularized its previously strict religious schedule considerably, expanded its course offerings, and was poised to begin coeducation.

25|$|In Warsaw, {{soldiers}} of Blue Army assaulted Jews in the streets, but were punished by military authorities. Many other events in Poland were later {{found to have}} been exaggerated, especially by contemporary newspapers such as The New York Times, although serious abuses against the Jews, including pogroms, continued elsewhere, especially in Ukraine. The above-mentioned atrocities committed by the young Polish army and its allies in 1919 during their Kiev operation against the Bolsheviks {{had a profound impact}} on the foreign perception of the re-emerging Polish state. The result of the concerns over the fate of Poland's Jews was a series of explicit clauses in the Versailles Treaty signed by the Western powers, and President Paderewski, protecting the rights <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> new Poland including Germans. In 1921, Poland's March Constitution gave the Jews the same legal rights as other citizens and guaranteed them religious tolerance and freedom of religious holidays.|$|E
