5|$|Historically the breeds {{that were}} merged into the King Charles Spaniel {{were used for}} hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs.

5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E

5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the English Cocker Spaniel had a median age of eleven years and two months.

Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous.

40|$|Essential {{systemic}} hypertension {{is one of}} {{the most}} common systemic diseases. It has physical, social and economical adverse effects. Purpose: This study was done to investigate the ocular manifestation due to systemic hypertension in Sudanese patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study done in Fatah Elrahman Elbashir Khartoum Medical Referred Clinics for two months, Nov. and Dec. 2000. 86 patients with essential systemic hypertension were studied, (i. e. 171 eyes). Results: In this study we found that the age of the patients was from 21 - 79 years and the majority of the patients were in the age group of 41 - 60 years (67. 4 %). Half of the patients had duration of hypertension from 1 - 5 years. Most of the patients presented with mild elevation of B. P level (40. 7 %) followed by those with normal B. P (24. 4 %), with moderate elevation of B. P (22. 1 %) and with severe B. P level (12. 8 %). Nearly one third of patients (36. 0 %) had controlled B. P, (22. 1 %) had uncontrolled B. P and (41. 9 %) of patients had semi-controlled BP. Visual acuity of less than 9 / 12 due to the effect of hypertension was detected in 23 eyes (12. 9 %). Facial palsy was detected in 3 patients (3. 5 %). Subconjectival haemorrhage was detected in 3 eyes (1. 7 %). Fundoscopic changes in the form of: Arteriolar changes: Narrowing in (72. 5 %) <b>of</b> the <b>eyes,</b> straightness in (66. 1 %) <b>of</b> the <b>eyes,</b> tortuosity in (11. 7 %) <b>of</b> the <b>eyes,</b> copper-wiring in (63. 7 %) <b>of</b> the <b>eyes,</b> silver-wiring in (28. 1 %) <b>of</b> the <b>eyes,</b> irregularity in (18. 1 %) <b>of</b> the <b>eyes</b> and other signs in (8. 8 %) <b>of</b> the <b>eyes.</b> Veins signs: were engorged dilated in (36. 8 %) <b>of</b> <b>eyes,</b> tortuosity in (9. 36 %) <b>of</b> <b>eyes,</b> and retinal vein occlusion in (2. 9 %) <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> Arterio-venous crossing defects: were grade I in 27. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes,</b> grade II in 37. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes,</b> grade III in 15. 8 % and grade IV in 6. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> Retinopathy: Retinal haemorrhage was detected in 10. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes,</b> cotton wool spots in 14. 6 % and others in 2. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> Optic disc signs: Atrophy was detected in 10. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> papilloedema was detected in 5. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes,</b> and other signs 1. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> Intraocular pressure: was normal in 94. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> and above the upper normal limit (21 mmHg) in 5. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> Conclusion: In conclusion from this study we found that the signs detected in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> patients with essential systemic hypertension related significantly to the control of blood pressure and level of blood pressure where the duration and the age had no significant effect if the B.

40|$|In an {{experimental}} setting, we applied a dual strategy {{to better understand}} the effect <b>of</b> pictures <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> on human behavior. First, we investigated whether the effect <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> was limited to interaction tasks in which the subjectsâ€™ decisions influenced the outcomes of other subjects. We expanded the range of tasks to include individual choice tasks in which the subjectsâ€™ decisions only influenced their own outcomes. Second, we investigated whether pictures <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> were one <b>of</b> many social cues or were unique in their effect. We compared the effect <b>of</b> pictures <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> with the effect of a different condition in which we presented the subjects with pictures of other students (peers).

While pictures <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> uniformly enhanced pro-social behavior in interaction tasks, {{this was not the case}} for reminders of peers. Furthermore, the reminders of peers led to more rational behavior in individual choice tasks, whereas the effect <b>of</b> pictures <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> was limited to situations involving interaction.

5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E

As a third surviving son, even of an influential regional family, Stephen still needed the support of a powerful patron such as the King to progress in life. With Henry's support, Stephen rapidly began to accumulate lands and possessions. Following the battle of Tinchebray in 1106, Henry confiscated the County of Mortain from William of Mortain, and the Honour <b>of</b> <b>Eye,</b> a large lordship previously owned by Robert Malet. In 1113, Stephen was granted both the title and the honour, although without the lands previously held by William in England.

5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E

CMO occurred postoperatively in only 32 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> without pre-existing diabetic retinopathy and in 81 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy (p < 0. 05). CMO persisted at 1 year after surgery in only 7 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> without pre-existing diabetic retinopathy and in 56 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> in which diabetic retinopathy persisted (p < 0. 01). Angiographic CMO (that is, detectable only on fluorescein angiography) was {{more common than}} clinical CMO (detectable on ophthalmoscopic examination as well) in eyes with no pre-existing diabetic retinopathy, whereas clinical CMO was seen more often than angiographic CMO when diabetic retinopathy was present preoperatively (p < 0. 01). The course and final visual outcome of angiographic CMO were more favourable than in clinical CMO. Final visual acuity of at least 6 / 12 was achieved in 86 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> with angiographic CMO and in only 33 % <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> with clinical CMO. On {{the basis of the}} above findings we believe that cataract extraction should not be recommended for eyes with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy until the vision has deteriorated to at least 6 / 30 - 6 / 60...|$|R
