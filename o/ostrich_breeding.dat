40|$|I {{would like}} to take this {{opportunity}} to report an unusual case of poisoning from ingestion of Senecio sceleratus (Family: Compositae) in a 24 -month-old ostrich cock farmed in Pomona, 26 km from Harare city centre, Zimbabwe. Poisonous plants including Senecio spp. can grow and spread rapidly in rangelands and pose potentially lethal problems for grazing livestock (1). The plant is widespread in Southern Africa and studies have been conducted in 4 species (2). Toxicology following ingestion of this plant has been reported previously in cattle (3, 4), but to date there are no reports of its toxicology in Ratites. Three alkaloids were identified in this plant: retrorsine (§-longilobine), N-oxide isatidine and sceleratine (3, 5). Ragwort, a perennial herb, grows to a height of about 91. 50 cm. It is a glabrous, unbranched plant with alternate auriculate leaves, possessing inflorescences in a corymb of many small yellow-rayed heads that form achenes holding white bristles (6) (Figure). It is common in Harare, growing on the margins of vleis.

Procedure Following prolapse of the phallus of the male <b>ostrich</b> during the <b>breeding</b> season, the pair were immediately separated. The hen was reintroduced to the cock at intervals of 5 to 8 days over a 6 week period for supervised mating. Records were kept of dates of mating and laying, number of eggs laid, egg weights, and fertility determined by candling after 2 weeks incubation. Results Over the 6 week period, 10 eggs were laid, of which 8 were fertile and 2 infertile. Fertile eggs weighed 1020 to 1285 g (mean 1143). The two infertile eggs weighed 1160 and 925 g. Six fertile eggs were laid 2 to 7 days after mating. The remaining two fertile eggs were laid the same days that mating occurred, suggesting that fertilisation resulted from the last matings 5 and 8 days previously, or from earlier matings. Conclusion Sperm storage occurs in ostrich hens and fertile eggs can be laid for at least 5 to 8 days after copulation.

40|$|In a {{study on}} ostrich {{nutrition}} that spanned three breeding seasons, we assessed the effect of different energy and protein levels in the previous breeding season on production in the following breeding season. During the first breeding season, groups of <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches</b> were fed diets with energy levels of 8. 5, 9. 5 and 10. 5 MJ metabolisable energy (ME) /kg dry matter (DM) and protein levels of 13. 5, 15. 0 and 16. 5 %. Amino acid profile was balanced and {{was related to the}} protein content in all cases. In the second breeding season, groups were fed diets with levels of 7. 5, 8. 5 and 9. 5 MJ ME/kg DM and 10. 5, 12. 0 and 13. 5 % protein, and during the third breeding season all the breeding birds were fed a single diet of 9. 5 MJ ME/kg DM and 12 % protein. Different levels of dietary protein in previous years had no effect on egg production, egg weight, fertility, hatchability and initial chick weight in subsequent years of production. Different levels of dietary energy in previous years had no significant effect on the body weight of breeding females, initial egg weight or the percentage of infertile eggs produced over the three seasons, but females fed diets containing only 7. 5 MJ ME/kg DM during the second year produced significantly fewer eggs in the third breeding season, resulting in fewer chicks being hatched. It was concluded that there are potential carry-over effects of dietary energy levels from one year to the next and that an energy level of less than 8. 5 MJ ME/kg DM in the diet may have an adverse effect on egg production in <b>breeding</b> female <b>ostriches</b> in following <b>breeding</b> seasons...|$|R

Ostriches of a commercially standard slaughter age of 14 months, raised under the same environment were used. The pH 24 was the highest in the pure Blue genotype and therefore meat from this genotype was the darkest and the percentage drip loss and cooking loss the lowest. When comparing the pure Blue genotype to the pure Black genotype, 70 % of the muscles had a higher pH 24, 50 % of the muscles were redder and significantly less saturated in colour, 67 % of the muscles had a lower percentage drip loss and 50 % of the muscles had a lower percentage cooking loss.

The animals were hosted in 18 small dairy herds and an <b>ostrich</b> <b>breeding</b> located in 10 municipalities {{of the state of}} Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Thirty isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus by biochemical and molecular techniques and were comparatively characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods. The molecular characterization by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), spa typing, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed five clonal types (PFGE A, spa type t 359, sequence type 747 [ST 747]; PFGE B, spa type t 1180, ST 750; PFGE C, spa type t 605, ST 126; PFGE D, spa type t 127, ST 751; and PFGE F, spa type t 002, ST 5). None of the isolates harbored the Panton-Valentine leukocidin or exfoliative toxin D gene. The detection of major clone A (in 63 % of the isolates) in different herds, among all animal species studied, and in infection and colonization samples evidenced its geographical spread among Rio de Janeiro State and no host preference among the animal species.

The hide is tanned in South Africa and sold all over the world. Besides, the ostrich meat is considered a niche production in the marketplace thus allowing for another profit for the <b>ostrich</b> <b>breeding.</b> Theoretical analysis of skinning process has been carried out, and an automatic measurement system in order to record the drawing-force on the animal’s body during skinning tests, has been designed. The aim was to indentify the best animal position and provide values of drawing-force in order to design a specific machine for ostrich skinning. Experimental results partially confirm theoretical analysis; {{they point out that}} the angle of inclination of drawing-force with back-line is a parameter which mostly influences the value of drawing-force and that this influence tends to increase as the angle is near to 90 ° or exceeds this limit. In any case, the applied drawing-force must not exceed 350, 0 daN. Therefore ostrich skinning should be done with vertical-drawing machines and the animal should be suspended by its wings at the rail, in relation to their anatomy structure and the tensile strenght of the hide. In the case of low working capacity (8 - 10 heads per hour) the animal could be skinned suspended by the legs, considering some limitations pointed out during experimental trials; technical, operating, ergonomic, health-hygienic limitations are accentuated if the workers involved are not enough able to ostrich slaughter...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 1985. The {{domestication}} of ostriches {{and commercial}} <b>ostrich</b> <b>breeding</b> {{has a long}} and interesting history. Orstriches were successfully domesticated in Algeria during 1857 and also successfully bred in Italy during 1859. In South Africa the domestication of wild ostriches started in the Cape Colony with 80 tame birds during 1865. This number increased to 32 247 birds within ten years (De Mosenthal, 1877). Ostrich farming reached a peak during 1913 with 757 000 birds (De Jager, 1985, personal communication). Currently (1985) there are approximately 120 000 domesticated ostriches in South Africa. The commercial production of ostrich meat started in 1958 and the first abattoir was built in 1964. At the present moment 85 000 birds are slaughtered anually. Although the income from the carcass of a 14 month old ostrich comprise only 15 % of the total income of a 14 month old bird (With the hide comprising 65 % and, the first harvest feathers 20 %), the subjects of carcass characteristics and meat quality has long been neglected. Very {{little is known about}} the anatomy of the skeleton and muscles of the ostrich, the post mortem reactions of these muscles and the effects of different slaughtering, chilling and deboning practices. The necessity of the above mentioned have proved very usefull in the beef, sheep, pork and poultry industries. With this present study we described the essential skeletal and muscular anatomy and included well known practices to the meat industry, such as electrical stimulation of the carcasses, post mortem pH monotoring of certain muscles, different deboning practices and vacuum packed ageing of selected cuts of ostrich meat. The obtained results are in agreement with general meat science, with expected inter-species variation, e. g. where the final pH-values of pork is relatively low at approximately 5, 5; that of beef is higher at 5, 7 and ostrich meat even higher at 6, 0.

Ninety pairs of <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches</b> were divided randomly into nine groups of 10 pairs per group in a factorial design with three energy and three protein levels. The groups were fed diets with levels of 7. 5, 8. 5 and 9. 5 MJ metabolisable energy/kg, each combined with each one of three protein levels 105, 120 and 135 g/kg respectively. Fresh eggs were collected from each group at the end of the breeding season and the albumen and yolk separated and analysed for protein and lipid content and for amino acid and mineral composition. No significant interaction between energy and protein levels occurred. Despite some differences in egg composition and amino acid concentrations, different dietary energy and protein levels for the most part had little or no effect on the composition of ostrich eggs.

The {{effect of}} {{different}} dietary vitamin and mineral levels on certain production parameters, including egg shell characteristics of <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches.</b> South African Journal of Animal Science, 44 (5) : 51 - 57,doi: 10. 4314 /sajas. v 44 i 5. 11. The original publication {{is available at}} [URL] studies on breeding birds indicated no effect of dietary energy-content on feed intake. This observation is contradictory to results for other animals and/or poultry where feed intake decreases {{with an increase in}} dietary energy level. Literature revealed that a lack of certain nutrients may cause animals to consume more feed than necessary to satisfy their nutrient requirements for these limiting nutrients. In this study eight diet groups were evaluated. A standard commercial diet plus one of the following supplements: (i) Standard diet without a vitamin and mineral premix pack (control diet), (ii) with a normal premix pack, (iii) with normal vitamin and 2 x trace elements (M x 2), (iv) with normal trace elements and 2 x vitamins, (v) with a normal premix pack and limestone added as calcium source; (vi) with a normal premix pack and monocalcium phosphate added as phosphorus source, (vii) with a normal premix pack and soybean oilcake added as crude protein source, (viii) with a normal premix pack and linseed added as a fatty acid source. Significant differences were recorded in the quantity of feed ingested by birds between the diet with surplus minerals (M x 2) (Group 3) (2. 3 ± 0. 3 kg/bird/day), the diet with no vitamins and minerals added (Group 1) (2. 7 ± 0. 3 kg/bird/day) and the diet with added fatty acids in the form of linseed (Group 5) (2. 9 ± 0. 5 kg/bird/day). This indicates the possibility that ostriches may adjust feed intake to satisfy their mineral requirements. No statistically significant relationship was found between the thickness and strength of the shell. Significant differences in shell strength (mean value of 154. 7, 109. 9, 140. 4, 142. 7, 153. 0, 143. 4, 138. 4 and 151. 1 N/cm 2, respectively) were found between all treatments, but no specific pattern could be identified.

40|$|An <b>ostrich</b> <b>breeding</b> flock, joined as {{individual}} breeding pairs (n = 136 pairs), {{was used to}} investigate the possibility of diagnostic ultrasonography as a method to predict the reproductive performance of ostrich females during a breeding season. Follicular activity was easily detected and quantified by using diagnostic ultrasonography. One to 8 follicles were recorded in 25 % of females scanned {{at the beginning of}} the 9 -month breeding season. At the end of the breeding season, 1 - 3 follicles were observed in 28. 7 % females. Females in which follicular activity was observed came into production earlier than those in which no follicles were observed, with the mean (Â±SE) number of days to the production of the 1 st egg being 22. 3 Â± 12. 5 and 87. 4 Â± 7. 2 days, respectively. Females in which follicular activity was observed {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season, produced on average 181 % more eggs during the 1 st month of the breeding season (P &lt; 0. 01) than females in which no follicular activity was observed (6. 67 Â± 0. 70 vs 2. 37 Â± 0. 41 eggs). Egg production over the first 2 months of breeding and over the entire breeding season were similarly affected (P &lt; 0. 01), with the mean number of eggs produced over the first 2 months of the breeding season being 14. 7 Â± 1. 5 for females with observed follicular activity and 7. 4 Â± 0. 9 eggs for females with no observed follicular activity. Females in which follicular activity was observed at the end of the breeding season produced on average 108 % more eggs (P&lt; 0. 01) during the last month of the breeding season than females in which no follicular activity was observed (2. 77 Â± 0. 43 vs. 1. 33 Â± 0. 27 eggs).

Transcutaneous scanning of the featherless ventrolateral part of the left abdomen caudal to the thigh was conducted using an ultrasound machine equipped with a 3. 5 MHz convex array scanner. The stage, shape, size and echogenicity of the ovarian follicles were determined. Four types of follicles were observed: a) large follicles (6. 4 - 9. 8 cm in diameter); b) small follicles (2. 2 - 5. 8 cm in diameter); c) atretic follicles (3. 5 - 5. 4 cm in diameter); and d) developing ova (2. 1 - 2. 7 cm in diameter). Large follicles appeared as anechoic round to oval structures with anechoic to hypoechoic walls.

Dietary protein and lysine levels were held constant respectively at 120 (g/kg feed) and 5. 8 (g/kg feed). The trial ran over one breeding season and production records recorded included egg production, chick production, number of infertile eggs, number of dead-in-shell eggs and weight change of breeders. No significant differences were observed for total eggs produced per female per season (44. 3 ± 7. 6), number of chicks hatched (15. 6 ± 4. 1), number of infertile eggs (11. 8 ± 3. 9) and for number of dead-in-shell eggs (11. 9 ± 3. 1). Analysis of variance revealed {{no significant difference in the}} weight change of female birds on different treatments, although regression analysis revealed an increase of 2. 4 kg per female bird per 0. 5 MJ increase in dietary energy value of the feed. Significant differences in the weight change of male breeders were observed which ranged between 6. 3 ± 2. 7 kg and 18. 4 ± 2. 8 kg over the breeding season. Overall, the weight of male breeders increased by 1. 9 kg per 0. 5 MJ increase in dietary energy content (R 2 = 0. 09).

Ultrasound scanning and blood sampling for plasma hormone analysis were performed in 9 hens on a monthly basis during the breeding season and in two periods of the non-breeding season. Our data demonstrated that: (1) large follicles were detected and LH concentrations were elevated already 1 month before first ovipositions of the egg production season took place; (2) E- 2 beta concentrations increased as soon as the egg production season started; (3) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations were elevated during the entire egg production season; and that (4) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations decreased simultaneous with or following the last ovipositions of the egg production season. By comparing these parameters during the egg production season with their pre-and post-seasonal values, significant differences were found in the numbers of large follicles and E- 2 beta concentrations between the pre-seasonal, seasonal and post-seasonal period; while LH concentrations were significantly different between the seasonal and post-seasonal period. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that changes in numbers of large follicles and in concentrations of LH and E- 2 beta closely parallel individual egg production figures and provide some new cues that egg production in ostriches is confined to a marked reproductive season. Moreover, our data provide indications that mechanism, initiating, maintaining and terminating the egg production season in farmed <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches</b> are quite similar to those already known for other seasonal breeding bird species.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{nutrient}} {{requirements for}} <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches</b> are currently not well-defined. Quantification of the nutrient requirements {{will improve the}} financial wellbeing of the industry. A study {{of the growth of}} the reproductive organs and liver, together with various production studies, were therefore undertaken in order to gain knowledge about the nutrition of <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches,</b> thereby quantifying the nutrient requirements of <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches.</b> Various studies were conducted to determine the influence of dietary protein, amino acids and energy on production levels of <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches.</b> In a first study, five diets, varying in crude protein (CP) but with a constant energy content of 9. 2 MJ ME/kg feed, were provided at a feed intake level of 2. 5 kg/bird/day. The dietary CP levels were 7. 5 %, 9. 1 %, 10. 8 %, 12. 3 % and 14. 0 %. No differences (P> 0. 05) between treatments (total eggs per female per season) were found for number of unfertilized eggs (eggs per female per season; 8. 9 ± 0. 8), dead-in-shell chicks (8. 0 ± 0. 5), number of chicks hatched (19. 1 ± 1. 1) and change in mass of females (- 16. 2 ± 1. 6 kg). A tendency was observed for a difference in total egg production (mean and standard error; 39. 1 ± 3. 6; P= 0. 08). The 12. 3 % CP diet caused the lowest (P 0. 05) occurred between the genotype of the bird and the dietary protein concentration for both egg and chick production. In a second study, six diets varying in ME (MJ ME/kg feed), were provided at an average feed intake level of 3. 4 kg/bird/day. The levels were 7. 5, 8. 0, 8. 5, 9. 0, 9. 5 and 10. 0 MJ ME/kg feed respectively. No differences (P> 0. 05) were observed for total eggs produced per female per season (44. 8 ± 7. 8), number of chicks hatched (15. 4 ± 4. 1), number of infertile eggs (11. 5 ± 3. 8), number of dead-in-shell eggs (12. 1 ± 3. 2) and change in mass of females (10. 7 ± 3. 6 kg). Males increased linearly (y= 2. 4 x + 2. 45; R 2 = 0. 09; P 0. 05) content of eggs between the experimental diets, {{as well as for the}} calcium content of eggshells. The proline content differed (P 0. 05) at any dietary energy level when levels of 8. 0, 8. 7, 9. 4, 10. 1, 10. 8 and 11. 5 MJ ME/kg feed were provided. The mean and standard error was 3. 7 ± 0. 2 kg. The production of <b>breeding</b> female <b>ostriches</b> was not influenced by dietary ME and protein at these feed intake levels. Ostrich birds do not have the ability to regulate their feed intake at any dietary energy level as used in this study. The amount of nutrients deposited in the eggs had no influence on the reproductive efficiency of the <b>breeding</b> female <b>ostrich.</b> The experiments also revealed that female <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches</b> were independent of dietary energy and protein as used in this study for the mean frequency of egg laying at various dietary protein and energy levels (P> 0. 05). In a fourth study, the growth and development of the reproductive organs of female birds at the onset of the breeding season were investigated. The amount of nutrients needs to be determined in order to support the growth of the reproductive organs during the breeding season, due to the fact that these organs are linked to egg production. It was thus necessary to investigate whether the reproductive organs grew and developed during a season. The first slaughter interval was conducted at the start of the breeding season. The ovary, oviduct and liver were collected, weighed after each slaughter and analyzed. Ovary and oviduct were analyzed for crude protein and fat. No differences (P> 0. 05) were observed between the different slaughter intervals for the mass, crude protein and fat content of both organs. No trend (P> 0. 05) in the weight of the oviduct could be observed over the 49 -day period, this weight being highly correlated with body weight; whereas the ovary weight tended to be correlated with the time after the onset of the breeding period, although the variation in weights, both within and between weighings, was very high. The variation in the weight of the ovary probably reflects differences in the laying pattern of individuals. The number of follicles were not affected (P> 0. 05) by the number of days after mating. Livers were assessed for crude protein and fat, but no difference (P> 0. 05) was detected between the intervals, but the weight difference amongst the slaughter intervals was significant (P 0. 05) was tussen die behandelings waargeneem vir aantal geil eiers (totale eiers geproduseer per voël per seisoen; 8. 9 ± 0. 8), aantal dood-in-dop (8. 0 ± 0. 5), aantal kuikens (19. 1 ± 1. 1) en verandering in massa van wyfies (- 16. 2 ± 1. 6 kg) nie. ‘n Neiging (P= 0. 08) is wel waargeneem vir totale aantal eiers geproduseer. Die gemiddelde en standaard fout was 39. 1 ± 3. 6. Die 12. 3 % dieët het tot die laagste verandering (P 0. 05) was tussen die genotipe en dieët proteïen konsentrasie vir beide eier- en kuikenproduksie opgemerk nie. In ‘n tweede studie is ses diëte, variërend in ME (MJ ME/kg voer), by ‘n gemiddelde tempo van 3. 4 kg/voël/dag gevoer. Die verskillende ME-vlakke was 7. 5, 8. 0, 8. 5, 9. 0, 9. 5 en 10. 0 MJ ME/kg voer. Geen betekenisvolle verskille (P> 0. 05) is vir totale eiers geproduseer per voël per seisoen (44. 8 ± 7. 8), aantal kuikens uitgebroei (15. 4 ± 4. 1), aantal geil eiers (11. 5 ± 3. 8), aantal dood-in-dop eiers (12. 1 ± 3. 2) en massa verandering van wyfies (10. 7 ± 3. 6 kg) opgemerk nie. Die mannetjies het toegeneem in liggaamsmassa (P 0. 05) bestaan vir die ru-proteïen en vetinhoud van die eiers by die verskillende eksperimentele diëte, asook die kalsiuminhoud van die eierdoppe. Prolien vlakke het tussen die diëte verskil (P 0. 05) deur die verskillende dieët energie vlakke van 8. 0, 8. 7, 9. 4, 10. 1, 10. 8 en 11. 5 MJ ME/kg voer beïnvloed nie. Die gemiddelde en standaardfout was 3. 7 ± 0. 2 kg. Die produksie van broeivolstruise nie deur verskillende dieëtvlakke van proteïen en energie by vlakke soos gevoer in hierdie studie geraak nie. Broeivolstruise in hierdie studie het nie die vermoë gehad om hul voerinname te beheer by enige dieët energievlak soos gebruik nie. Die aantal nutriënte wat in die eiers neergelê is, het geen bydrae tot die reproduksievermoë van die wyfie gehad nie. Die studie het verder bewys dat die gemiddelde frekwensie van eier-lê by wyfies onafhanklik was by dieët-energie en -proteïenvlakke (P> 0. 05) soos in hierdie studie gebruik. In ‘n vierde studie is die groei en ontwikkeling van die reproduksie-organe van die wyfies bestudeer tydens die aanvang van die broeiseisoen. Die hoeveelheid of konsentrasie van voedingstowwe moes bepaal word om die groei van die reproduksie-organe te ondersteun tydens die broeiseisoen, omdat hierdie organe aan eierproduksie gekoppel is. ‘n Studie is derhalwe uitgevoer om te bepaal tot watter mate die reproduksie organe groei en ontwikkel tydens die broeiseisoen. Die eerste slagting is uitgevoer op die dag van afkamp. Die ovaria, ovidukt en lewer is versamel, geweeg en ontleed. Die ovaria en ovidukt is ontleed vir ru-proteïen en vet. Geen verskille (P> 0. 05) is tussen die verskillende slagtings vir die gewig, ru-proteïen en vetinhoud vir beide organe opgemerk nie. Geen betekenisvolle tendens in die gewig van die ovidukt is waargeneem oor die 49 -dae periode nie, maar die gewig was hoogs gekorreleerd met liggaamsmassa. Ovaria-gewig het geneig om gekorreleerd te wees met die aantal dae na afkamp. Variasie binne en buite die gewigte was baie hoog. Die aantal follikels teenwoordig is nie beïnvloed (P> 0. 05) deur die aantal dae na paring. Die lewers is ontleed vir ruproteïen en vet, maar geen verskille (P> 0. 05) is tussen die intervalle opgemerk nie, maar die gewigte van dag 0 en 49 na paring het verskil (P< 0. 05). Dit kan aangevoer word dat die voëls moontlik lewer reserwes gebruik het om die voedingstowwe van die dieët te supplementeer vir die ontwikkeling van die reproduksie-organe. Data uit hierdie studie kan gebruik word in ‘n optimiseringsmodel (Brand & Gous, 2006) om die voedingsbehoeftes van broeivolstruise te bepaal. Hierdie studie beveel aan dat die broeiwyfie moontlik addisionele proteïen tydens die eerste sewe weke van die broeiseisoen benodig. Resultate van Hoofstuk 4 en vorige studies is gebruik om die energie- proteïen- en aminosuurbehoefte vir eierproduksie en onderhoud van broeivolstruise te bereken. Twee metodes is gebruik om die energiebehoefte vir eierproduksie te bereken. Metaboliseerbare Energie behoefte vir eierproduksie (MEe) en effektiwiteit van ME benutting vir energie deponering in eier (ko) is onderskeidelik as 12. 2 MJ (vir ‘n eier wat gemiddeld 1. 4 kg weeg) en 0. 8 bereken. Effektiewe Energie behoefte vir eierproduksie (EEe) en onderhoud (EEm) was onderskeidelik as 15. 9 MJ/dag en 17. 1 MJ/dag bereken. Die gemiddelde daaglikse proteïenbehoefte (TPt) is as 175 g proteïen/dag bereken. ‘n Aanduiding van die aminosuur behoefte vir onderhoud en eierproduksie word ook gegee, wat laer is as vorige studies...|$|R

The tours depart from 08h00 until 16h00 when the last tour of the day starts.Oudtshoorn is the ostrich capitol {{of the world with}} more ostriches to be found here than anywhere else. Safari Ostrich Farm was established as a tourist attraction in 1956. Safari was established by Derek Fisch and Harry Lipschitz both 4th generation ostrich farmers.The climate in the Klein Karoo region is ideal for these large birds to breed and live. Ostriches being desert birds prefer hot and dry climates like in Oudtshoorn.Safari Ostrich Farm provides interesting and fun tractor tours of the working farm conducted by their professional guides. The guided tour will allow you to learn more about ostriches and their fascinating nature. The duration of each tour is approximately one hour long and is a combination of an easy walking tour with a fun ride on the Safari tractor trailer.The tour also includes a visit to one of the hatcheries where {{you will be able to}} see chicks hatching. The guides will also show you the exquisite and sought-after [...] "Feather-boom" [...] ostrich feathers and you will get a chance to learn more about ostrich skins and the process of making ostrich leather goods.The tractor drive will take you through an ostrich camp with 18 adult Zimbabwe Blue <b>breeding</b> <b>ostriches</b> around you. The tour also includes a visit to one of {{the breeding}} camps where a great photo opportunity presents itself where visitors are allowed to stand on ostrich eggs to test their strength.You will also be shown the Kenyan Red and Zimbabwe Blue Ostriches as well as the local South African breed. The Safari farm provides for meals in their restaurant and offer light meals in their café. They also have a gift shop with a wide range of ostrich related products such as leather bags, feather-dusters and ornamental ostrich eggs.|$|R
40|$|A falta de conhecimento sobre a reprodução do avestruz dificulta o desenvolvimento da sua criação {{comercial}} devido a uma baixa eficiência reprodutiva. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a ação da aplicação de um análogo de GnRH (lecirelina - Gestran Plus®) na indução da ovulação em fêmeas adultas de avestruz. Primeiramente, um grupo de 10 fêmeas foi avaliado para determinação de seu status reprodutivo, por meio da mensuração das concentrações séricas de estradiol e progesterona (coletas de sangue 3 x/semana); da observação do comportamento reprodutivo; da determinação do desenvolvimento ovariano por exame ultrassonográfico (a cada 21 dias); e pela postura de ovos. Após o término desta primeira fase, as fêmeas foram separadas em grupo controle (n = 3) e grupo tratado (n = 6). A cada semana, 2 fêmeas do grupo tratado eram selecionadas para a aplicação intramuscular de 1 ml (25 &# 956;l) de lecirelina, e os seus efeitos avaliados pela análise das concentrações séricas de estradiol, progesterona e corticosterona (0 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h e 96 h pós-aplicação); pela verificação do desenvolvimento ovariano e ocorrência de ovulação através de exames ultrassonográficos (24 h, 48 h e 96 h); pela observação de comportamento reprodutivo (0 h, 48 h e 96 h) e pela postura de ovos. O tratamento foi repetido no mesmo animal a cada 21 dias e em cada tratamento realizado, 2 fêmeas do grupo controle eram submetidas às mesmas análises. Os resultados indicam que a aplicação de lecirelina foi capaz de induzir a ovulação em 77 % dos tratamentos realizados, com postura de ovos normais em 50 % das induções. Assim, o tratamento proposto foi considerado eficiente na indução da ovulação em fêmeas de avestruz desde que seja aplicado em fêmeas que apresentem ovário bem desenvolvido. The lack {{of knowledge}} about the ostrich reproduction delays the development of the <b>ostrich</b> commercial <b>breeding</b> due to a low reproductive performance. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the application of an analog of GnRH (Lecirelin - Gestran Plus®) for induction of ovulation in adult female ostriches. Initially, a group of 10 adult female ostriches were evaluated in order to determine their reproductive status, by measuring serum levels of estradiol and progesterone (blood sampling - 3 times a week), by the observation of reproductive behavior, by the evaluation of the ovarian development through ultrasound examination (repeated every 21 days) and by the egg laying data. After the end of the first phase, female ostriches were separated into a control group (n = 3) and a treated group (n = 6). Every week, two females from the treated group were selected to receive the treatment: an intramuscular application of 1 ml (25 &# 956;l) of Lecirelin. The effect of the application was evaluated by the analysis of serum concentrations of estradiol, progesterone and corticosterone (0 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h and 96 h post-application), by the verification of the ovarian development and the occurrence of ovulation through ultrasound examinations (24 h, 48 h and 96 h), by the observation of reproductive behavior (0 h, 48 h and 96 h) and by the egg laying data. The intramuscular application was repeated in the same animal every 21 days and two females from the control group were subjected to the same analysis during each treatment. The results indicate that the application of Lecirelin was able to induce ovulation in 77 % of the treatments with normal egg laying in 50 % of inductions. Thus, the treatment was found effective in inducing ovulation in female ostrich provided that it is applied in females who exhibit well developed ovary...|$|R
