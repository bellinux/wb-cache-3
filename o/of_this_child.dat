25|$|Because the {{necropolis}} of Sekhemkhet {{was never}} finished, {{it is hard}} to say which planned cultic building had already existed. The pyramid courtyard was surrounded by a niched enclosure wall facing north-west. It was 1.850ft long, 607ft wide and 33ft high. The only archaeologically preserved cultic building is the Southern Tomb, its base measurement is estimated to be 105ft x 52ft. The subterranean structure included a tight corridor, beginning at the western site of the tomb and ending in a double chamber. In this chamber in 1963 Jean-Philippe Lauer excavated the burial of a 2-years-old toddler. The identity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> remains a mystery, the only for sure known fact about it is that it cannot be king Sekhemkhet himself, since the king was always depicted as a young man.|$|E
500|$|Although Pasteur {{had little}} idea how his method worked, he tested it on a boy, Joseph Meister (1876–1940), who {{was brought to}} Pasteur by his mother on 6 July 1885. He was covered in bites, having been set upon by a mad dog. [...] Meister's mother begged Pasteur to help her son. Pasteur was a scientist, not a physician, and he {{was well aware of}} the {{consequences}} for him if things were to go wrong. He nevertheless decided to help the boy and injected him with increasingly virulent rabid rabbit spinal tissue over the following 10days. Later Pasteur wrote, [...] "as the death <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> appeared inevitable, I decided, not without deep and severe unease... to try out on Joseph Meister the procedure, which had consistently worked on dogs". [...] Meister recovered and returned home with his mother on 27 July. Pasteur successfully treated a second boy in October that same year; Jean-Baptiste Jupille (1869–1923) was a 15-year-old shepherd boy who had been severely bitten as he tried to protect other children from a rabid dog. Pasteur's method of treatment [...] remained in use for over 50years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first major}} {{international}} instrument {{dealing with the}} trafficking of children {{is part of the}} 2000 United Nations Palermo protocols, titled the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. Article 3(a) of this document defines child trafficking as the [...] "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring and/or receipt" [...] of a child for the purpose of exploitation. The definition for child trafficking given here applies only to cases of trafficking that are transnational and/or involve organized criminal groups; in spite <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>child</b> trafficking is now typically recognized well outside these parameters. The International Labour Organization expands upon this definition by asserting that movement and exploitation are key aspects of child trafficking. The definition of [...] "child" [...] used here is that listed in the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child which states, [...] "a child means every human being below the age of 18 years, unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier." [...] The distinction outlined in this definition is important, because some countries have chosen to set the [...] "age of majority" [...] lower than 18, thus influencing exactly what legally constitutes child trafficking.|$|E
2500|$|... “As an {{instance}} of the progress being made in the civilization of the Indian the Department publishes a letter received not long ago from a Sioux, named Blue Horse, asking the authorities to oblige him with the gift of a glass eye. He naively states the being desirous of adopting the customs of the pale-faces, and noticing the white man splitting wood for his squaw, {{he thought he would}} follow suit. But not being adept at the art of splitting wood, a piece flew up and ‘hit him in the eye' putting it out. Hence his request. He incidentally mentions {{that he would like to}} have a brown eye to match the other optic. We hope the Great Father or his representative will grant the request <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> of nature. He may then properly be termed a ‘bully Blue Horse with a glass eye.” Blue Horse was witty, and when artist Elbridge Ayer Burbank asked about his request to the Great Father in Washington for a glass eye, Blue Horse responded, [...] "he did not want a glass eye, but a good eye he could use." [...] "While he was in the agent's office the carpenter was making a coffin out of a bacon box.

She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>child</b> who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody is going to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E
2500|$|Oral {{tradition}} in the Spokane area may give an entirely different account <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>child.</b> This tradition holds that, {{in the fall of}} 1853, John Mullan met and married Mary Ann Finley (or [...] "Finlay"), granddaughter of Jaco Finlay. Her age is unclear; she was born in either 1834 or 1836, making her either 19 or 17 years of age {{at the time of her}} marriage. She was one-half Native American. On June 9, 1855, Mary Ann died giving birth to a son, whom she named Peter Mullan. Historian Glen Adams argues that Peter Mullan was not John Mullan's child. Rather, a full-blood Native American probably impregnated Mary Ann, and that Peter is the boy whom John Mullan raised for a time. (Whether there was a John Mullan III in addition to Peter Mullan is not resolved by Adams.) Mullan biographers Louis C. Coleman and Leo Rieman examined much of the same evidence, and came to the same conclusions as Adams. Historian Keith Petersen, however, argues that it is plausible that Mullan fathered Peter Mullan. He argues that there is confusion over whether the mother was Mary Ann Finley or another woman, Rose Laurant. Laurant was Salish, and she may have lived with the Bitterroot Salish in 1853 when John Mullan was in the same area. Limited evidence in the oral tradition confuses Finley with Laurant, Petersen believes, and he concludes (a) that Peter Mullan is not the same person as John Mullan III, and (b) it is not unreasonable to believe that Peter Mullan was John Mullan's biological son.|$|E
