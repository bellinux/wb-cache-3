5000|$|... <b>ozocerite</b> (pseudomineral): very rare; {{associated}} with quartz and galena; small (0.09 millimeter), brown spheres consisting of bitumen (mixture of liquid and solid carbohydrates of the methane-family).|$|E
50|$|Zietrisikite is a waxy {{hydrocarbon}} mineral; {{although only}} {{in the sense that}} crude oil could be classed as mineral. It is very similar to <b>Ozocerite</b> and is found at Zietrisika, Moldavia.|$|E
5000|$|Ozokerite or <b>ozocerite</b> (Gr. Όζο oze, stench, and κερί kero, wax), archaically {{referred}} to as earthwax or earth wax, is a naturally occurring odoriferous mineral wax or paraffin found in many localities.|$|E
50|$|Matrix {{minerals}} in the lode are quartz and/or baryte. Common minerals are calcite and dolomite. Secondary minerals {{consist of}} lead minerals like anglesite, cerussite, pyromorphite and wulfenite, and of iron sulfides like marcasite and pyrite. A rarity is the bitumen containing pseudomineral <b>ozocerite.</b>|$|E
50|$|The quarry {{is noted}} for its minerals. The Tabataud quarry most {{probably}} yielded the finest galenas {{in the whole of}} France. It is furthermore {{one of the very few}} sites for wulfenite in France. As a rarity occurs the pseudomineral <b>ozocerite.</b> The cerussite is of extremely good quality and diversity.|$|E
5000|$|... galena (PbS): very common; {{crystals}} {{can reach}} several centimeters; occurs most often weathered (with a coating of iron oxide), often dull (due to oxidation), yet can display a brilliant luster and show excellent quality in some protected tension gashes; cubes and octahedra; grows on quartz, sometimes on calcite, dolomite or baryte; overgrown by cerussite, pyrite, marcasite, quartz and <b>ozocerite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kinney {{did some}} {{scientific}} work {{in addition to}} his medical work. This included studying the Nehalem Beeswax along the Oregon Coast, which Kinney believed was <b>ozocerite.</b> He also donated a collection of fish from Astoria to the Smithsonian Institution in 1888. Augustus Kinney died on March 24, 1908, at the age of 62 at the Fabiola Hospital in Oakland, California, of cancer and was buried at the IOOF Cemetery (now Salem Pioneer Cemetery) in Salem. His nephew Augustus, from his brother Alfred, also was a doctor who studied tuberculosis.|$|E
50|$|During the Laramide Orogeny {{along the}} Wasatch Mountains, the north-south {{trending}} coast during the Late Cretaceous was receding eastward, {{at the same}} time the area where the basin is located was subsiding, creating a lacustrine environment. A clastic wedge consisting of the North Horn, Colton, and Wasatch was deposited northwards. These sediments interfingered with organic-rich lacustrine clays and carbonate muds of the Green River and Flagstaff facies. Later, deposits originated from the Uinta Mountains from the north, forming a southward-thinning clastic wedge. A carbonate sediment consisting of an organic-rich oil shale was deposited from the middle Eocene into the Oligocene. The basin is also known for solid-hydrocarbon-filled fractures consisting of <b>ozocerite,</b> gilsonite, and wurtzilite.|$|E
5000|$|Hunt defines bitumen {{as native}} {{substance}} of variable color, viscosity, and volatility composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen. He further defines petroleum {{as a form}} of bitumen that is gaseous or liquid in the reservoir and can be produced through a pipe. Other bitumens range from very viscous (e.g., Athabasca and Venezuelan heavy oils, La Brea tar pits) to solid (e.g. gilsonite, <b>ozocerite,</b> grahamite, impsonite). Pyrobitumen is formed by thermal decomposition and molecular cross-linking of bitumen. Pyrobitumen is distinguished from other solid bitumens extruded from early-mature kerogen-rich source rocks (e.g., gilsonite) and semi-solid bitumens in high viscosity oil sands formed by water washing and biodegradation of conventional oil (e.g., Athabasca bituminous sands), all of which are soluble in carbon disulfide.|$|E
40|$|Al~traet [...] Series of {{hydrocarbons}} ranging up to C 75 {{have been}} detected by high temperature gas chromatography (HTGC) {{in a number of}} geochemical samples, including oils and waxes precipitated in drill stem pipes. A saturated hydrocarbon fraction isolated from a fossil bitumen, <b>ozocerite,</b> and enriched in branched/cyclic compounds, was analysed by direct insertion probe mass pectrometry (DIP/MS) and showed the presence of cyclic structures in the high molecular weight region (>C 40). The asphaltene fractions isolated from the various samples were analysed by flash pyrolysis-high temperature gas chromatography (P-HTGC). Similar distributions of high molecular weight hydrocarbons were produced from the asphaltenes of both the oils and waxes. In vitro simulation experiments of the asphaltene fractions produced a similar distribution of high molecular weight hydrocarbons as observed from Py-HTGC, suggesting that thermal breakdown of asphaltenes may be responsible for the production, or release, of some naturally occurring high molecular weight hydrocarbons. Key words [...] oils, waxes, asphaltenes, high molecular weight hydrocarbons (C 40 +), high temperature gas chromatography (HTGC), flash pyrolysis-HTG...|$|E
40|$|The General Regional Exhibition of Lviv was {{organized}} in 1894, on the 100 year {{anniversary of the}} Kosciuszko Uprising of 1794. The Exhibition was meant to demonstrate Galicia’s economical and cultural progress since its gaining political autonomy and to become {{an opportunity for the}} national integration of Poles. The Exhibition displays included various thematic groups which were devoted to both spiritual and material aspects of life in Galicia and were meant to show the abundance of its crops and produce, mining and metallurgy, agriculture, forestry and hunting. The shows pictured everyday life of the inhabitants of Galicia, its folk art, so-called domestic industry and craftwork. Other sections of the Exhibition demonstrated the development of the Galician financial institutions, public administration, healthcare, communication, engineering, construction, literature, general and vocational education and the bloom of the fine arts and architecture. The article analyzes only some parts of the great legacy of the Exhibition, its scope focuses on mining and metallurgy. The text points out the dynamic development of the oil industry and the increase in the branches such as: salt production, iron smelting, and brown and hard coal extraction. The only branch of the Galicia’s economy which had not offered good perspectives and was thus soon discontinued had been the production of earthwax (<b>ozocerite).</b> The organization of the exhibitions of such sort was regarded at that time {{as one of the best}} ways to stimulate economy and benefit the regions. The actual development itself, especially of the oil mining, aided many positive social and cultural changes and undoubtedly increased the societal potential and might have resulted in further initiatives...|$|E
