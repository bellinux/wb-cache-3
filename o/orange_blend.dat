40|$|In 2014, {{global demand}} for {{essential}} oils was 165 kt {{and it is}} expected to grow 8. 5 % per annum up to 2022. Every year Australia produces approximately 1. 5 k tonnes of essential oils such as tea tree, orange, lavender, eucalyptus oil, etc. Usually essential oils come from non-fatty areas of plants such as the bark, roots, heartwood, leaves and the aromatic portions (flowers, fruits) of the plant. For example, orange oil is derived from orange peel using various extraction methods. Having similar properties to diesel, essential oils have become promising alternate fuels for diesel engines. The present study explores the opportunity of using sweet orange oil in a compression ignition engine. <b>Blends</b> of sweet <b>orange</b> oil-diesel (10 % sweet orange oil, 90 % diesel) along with neat diesel fuel were used to operate a six-cylinder diesel engine (5. 9 litres, common rail, Euro-III, compression ratio 17. 3 : 1). Some key fuel properties such as: viscosity, density, heating value, and surface tension are presented. Engine performance (brake specific fuel consumption) and emission parameters (CO, NO X, and Particulate Matter) were measured to evaluate running with the blends. The engine was operated at 1500  rpm (maximum torque condition) with different loads. The results from the property analysis showed that sweet <b>orange</b> oil-diesel <b>blend</b> exhibits lower density, viscosity and surface tension and slightly higher calorific value compared to neat diesel fuel. Also, from the engine test, the sweet <b>orange</b> oil-diesel <b>blend</b> exhibited slightly higher brake specific fuel consumption, particulate mass and particulate number; however, the blend reduced the brake specific CO emission slightly and brake specific NO X emission significantly compared to that of neat diesel...|$|R

The caffeine concentration in the infusions and in the leaf, and its partition constant between swollen leaf and solution, was little affected by the presence of electrolytes or pH changes. The concentration of theaflavins in the infusions was not changed by the addition of salts but was considerably greater in acid media and also, temporarily, in borate buffers. The acid effect was corroborated by experiments with a Ceylon Broken <b>Orange</b> Pekoe <b>blend.</b> The most significant finding was that the concentration of theaflavins in the Kapchorua leaf rose markedly with falling pH while its partition constant decreased.

5000|$|Single {{strength}} {{orange juice}} (SSOJ) {{can either be}} [...] "not from concentrate" [...] (NFC) orange juice or juice that is reconstituted from a concentrate {{with the addition of}} water to reach a specific single strength brix level. The processing of SSOJ also begins with the selection of orange. The most common types of orange used to produce orange juice are the Pineapple orange, Valencia orange, and Washington Navel oranges from Florida and California. The manufacturing journey begins when oranges are delivered to processing plants by trucks holding about 35,000 to 40,000 pounds of fruit. The fruit is unloaded at the plant for inspection and grading to remove unsuitable fruit before the oranges enter the storage bins. An automatic sampler contraption removes oranges for determination of acid and soluble solids. The bins are organized based on ratio of soluble solids to acids in order to <b>blend</b> <b>oranges</b> appropriate to produce juice with uniform flavor. After the fruit leaves the bins, they are scrubbed with detergent on a rotary brush washer and subsequently rinsed with potable water. Throughout the processing stages, there are multiple points with facilities that inspect oranges and discard damaged fruit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{contemporary}} problem {{faced by}} the fruit and dairy sectors in developing countries {{is the lack of}} a basic infrastructure for handling the deluge in production. Several technologies and inno-vations have been devised to conserve and utilize the products individually in food formulations and to some extent in combination. Further, additional investigations are required to explore the feasibil-ity of vitamin C enrichment of milk, which could be effectively achieved by incorporation of <b>orange</b> juice. <b>Blends</b> with different levels of orange juice and skim milk were spray dried, viz., 10 : 90, 15 : 85, 20 : 80 and 25 : 75 at feed temperatures of 45 – 50 ºC and compressed air pressure of 0. 108 – 0. 136 MPa. It was observed that the various processing parameters, such as outlet air temperature, total solids and blend proportions {{had a profound effect on}} the characteristics of the resultant powder. As the propor-tion of juice increased, the acidity and viscosity of the blends increased due to the high citric acid con-tent of the juice. However, an increase in the acidity had no negative effect on the thermal stability of the blends before or after spray drying, due to the low feed temperature (45 oC) used in the study. It was found that increments in the inclusion of orange solids had a negative effect on the resultant yield of the powder. The increase in solids of the blends up to 30 % resulted in a steep increase in the yield, which was adjudged as the optimal total solids for drying the blends. Further increase in total solids of the blends resulted in reduced yields. The outlet air temperatures of the spray drier were optimized at a temperature range of 80 – 85 oC for all blends. Sensory evaluation studies affirmed that the blend with a 15 : 85 ratio of orange juice: skim milk, respectively, possessed the desired sensory characteristics...|$|R
60|$|Wednesday, October 13th.--A good view, from an upland {{swell of}} our pasture, {{across the valley}} of the river Charles. There is the meadow, as level as a floor, and carpeted with green, perhaps two miles from the rising ground {{on this side of the}} river to that on the {{opposite}} side. The stream winds through the midst of the flat space, without any banks at all; for it fills its bed almost to the brim, and bathes the meadow grass on either side. A tuft of shrubbery, at broken intervals, is scattered along its border; and thus it meanders sluggishly along, without other life than what it gains from gleaming in the sun. Now, into the broad, smooth meadow, as into a lake, capes and headlands put themselves forth, and shores of firm woodland border it, covered with variegated foliage, making the contrast so much the stronger of their height and rough outline with the even spread of the plain. And beyond, and far away, rises a long, gradual swell of country, covered with an apparently dense growth of foliage for miles, till the horizon terminates it; and here and there is a house, or perhaps two, among the contiguity of trees. Everywhere the trees wear their autumnal dress, so that the whole landscape is red, russet, <b>orange,</b> and yellow, <b>blending</b> in the distance into a rich tint of brown-orange, or nearly that,--except the green expanse so definitely hemmed in by the higher ground.|$|R
40|$|Since {{consuming}} vinegar on {{a regular}} basis can contribute to the maintenance of good health, many fruit vinegar products are sold in Taiwan. Using 66 fruit vinegars purchased in local markets as samples, this study investigated the labeling, pricing and physicochemical properties of commercial concentrated fruit vinegar in order to understand their production methods and quality. Two out of the 66 samples had no label, while only 29 samples listed nutrient content. According to the labels, 26 of the fruit vinegar samples were made from juice mixed with grain vinegar (JG), while 28 samples were produced from juice via alcoholic and vinegar fermentation (F). The remaining samples were produced by fermentation and mixed with grain vinegar, alcoholic vinegar and juice. Most of the domestic products, such as mei (also called as Japanese apricot), cider, <b>orange,</b> lemon and <b>blended</b> vinegar, were produced by mixing juice with grain vinegar, whereas most imported cider and wine vinegar were produced by fermentation. Wine vinegar had the highest unit price of all fruit vinegar samples. Appearance of these vinegar samples differed significantly. The variations in pH and acidity were less than other physicochemical properties. Total sugar content of vinegar without sugar was less than 3 %, while those with sugar added ranged from 8 % to 64 %. Most imported cider and wine vinegar samples had no sugar added, with the acidity being about 5 similar to 7 %. Most domestic products with sugar added have the average acidity of less than 3 %. Variations in soluble solids content and density of the fruit vinegar were similar to the variation in total sugar content. Besides acetic acid, the major organic acids found in fruit vinegar are malic, lactic and citric acids. Mulberry vinegar was found to be higher in lactic and succinic acids than other fruit vinegar. Red wine vinegar was rich in tartaric, malic and lactic acids. The Chinese National Standards (CNS 14834, N 5239), which regulates edible vinegar focuses on "seasoning vinegar" but not "vinegar beverages". Since people are paying much more attention to health, the number of concentrated vinegar products in Taiwan is expected to increase in the future. Thus, appropriate rules are required to regulate vinegar products...|$|R
40|$|Os antibióticos têm sido utilizados como aditivos na alimentação animal para aumentar o desempenho e manter a saúde dos animais, como suínos e frangos, destinadas à produção de alimentos de origem animal. No entanto, desde 2006, a Comunidade Europeia proibiu o uso de antibióticos para esse proposito devido ao desenvolvimento de resistência bacteriana aos antibióticos. Como resultado, várias alternativas foram estudadas e propostas para substituir os antibióticos utilizados na alimentação animal. Os óleos essenciais têm recebido considerável atenção devido às suas propriedades antimicrobianas. Portanto, o objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar {{in vitro}} a atividade antibacteriana dos óleos essenciais contra a {{microbiota}} patogênica e probiótica de ocorrência no trato gastrointestinal de suínos e aves, destinadas à produção de alimentos de origem animal. A atividade antibacteriana seletiva, a qual, significou uma alta atividade antibacteriana contra bactérias patogênicas e reduzida ou nenhuma atividade sobre bactérias probióticas, foi avaliada como característica fundamental dos óleos essenciais com alto desempenho. Esta característica foi avaliada nos óleos essenciais usados individualmente e em combinações binarias. Inicialmente, no Capítulo 2, uma triagem de vinte e oito óleos essenciais (OEs) através do método de difusão em disco mostrou que Eucalyptusglobulus, E. exserta, Pimenta pseudocaryophylllus, Orange Oil Phase Essence, e CitrusTerpens (Os dois últimos OEs foram subprodutos do processamento da laranja para obtenção de suco) tiveram uma atividade antibacteriana seletiva sobre a bactéria patogênica Salmonella Enteritidis e a bactéria probiótica Lactobacillus plantarum. Numa fase posterior, esses cinco óleos foram avaliados individualmente e em misturas binárias, contra cinco bactérias patogênicas e três bactérias probióticas. Os melhores resultados foram observados quando os OEs foram avaliados isoladamente e não em misturas. Assim, Orange Oil Phase Essence e Citrus Terpens destacaram-se por ter a melhor atividade antibacteriana seletiva contra essas bactérias. No Capítulo 3, uma análise mais detalhada da atividade antibacteriana dos óleos essenciais foi realizada utilizando Orange Oil Phase Essence e a mistura composta pelos óleos de E. globulus e P. pseudocaryophyllus. Estes dois óleos foram selecionados com base nos resultados do Capitulo 2 e da disponibilidade de OEs em nosso estoque. Ambos, óleo e a mistura foram avaliados sobre a bactéria patogênica mais resistente, E. faecalis, e a bactéria probiótica menos resistente L. rhamnosus, como observado no Capitulo 2. A avaliação da Concentração Inibitória Mínima e Concentração Bactericida Mínima do Orange Oil Phase Essence e da mistura mostrou que não tiveram um efeito antibacteriano seletivo sobre E. faecalis e L. rhamnosus. Finalmente, no Capitulo 4, foi avaliada a atividade antibacteriana individual e combinada dos óleos de E. globulus e P. pseudocaryophyllus sobre E. faecalis e L. rhmanosus. Os resultados mostraram que a combinação destes dois OEs, avaliadas pelo método checkerboard, não potencializou a atividade antibacteriana seletiva dos dois OEs. Portanto, observou-se que o óleo de E. globulus isoladamente apresentou a melhor atividade antibacteriana seletiva contra E. faecalis e L. rhamnosus. Em conclusão, este trabalho permitiu identificar óleos essenciais com perfil antibacteriano seletivo para eles serem possíveis alternativas botânicas aos antibióticos utilizados na alimentação animal. Antibiotics {{have been used}} in animal feed to maintain health and increase performance, {{as in the case of}} pigs and poultry intended for food production of animal origin. However, since 2006 the European Community has banned the use of antibiotics for this purpose due to the emergence and increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. As a result, several alternatives have been studied and proposed to substitute antibiotics used in animal feed. Essential oils have received considerable attention due to their antimicrobial properties. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate in vitro the antibacterial activity of essential oils against pathogenic and probiotic bacteria that occur in the gastrointestinal tract of swine and poultry, intended for food production of animal origin. The selective antibacterial activity, which means high antibacterial activity on pathogenic bacteria and reduced or no activity on probiotic bacteria, was evaluated as a fundamental feature of the highest-performance essential oils. This feature was evaluated in essential oils used individually and in binary combinations. Initially, in Chapter 2, the screening of twenty-eight essential oils (EOs) by disk diffusion method showed that Eucalyptus globulus, E. exserta, Pimenta pseudocaryophylllus, Orange Oil Phase Essence, and Citrus Terpens (the last two EOs were by-products of orange juice production) had a selective antibacterial activity against the pathogenic Salmonella Enteritidis and probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum. At a later stage those five oils were evaluated, individually and in binary blends, against five pathogenic bacteria and three probiotic bacteria. Better results were observed when the EOs were checked alone and not in <b>blends.</b> <b>Orange</b> Oil Phase Essence and Citrus Terpens stood out for having the two best selective antibacterial activities against those bacteria. In Chapter 3, a more detailed analysis of essential oil antibacterial activities was perfomed using Orange Oil Phase Essence and the blend composed of E. globulus and P. pseudocaryophyllus. These two oils were selected based on the results of Chapter 2 and from the availability of our EO stock. Both oil and blend were checked on the most resistant pathogenic bacterium, E. faecalis, and on the less resistant probiotic bacterium of the Lactobacillus genus, L. rhamnosus, as observed in Chapter 2. The evaluation of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration for Orange Oil Phase Essence and the blend showed that there was not a selective antibacterial effect against E. faecalis and L. rhamnosus. Finally, in Chapter 4, the individual and combined antibacterial activities of E. globulus and P. pseudocaryophyllus essential oils on E. faecalis and L. rhmanosus were evaluated. The results showed that the combination of two EOs evaluated by checkerboard method did not potentiate the selective antibacterial activity of the two EOs. Therefore, it was observed that the E. globulus essential oil alone had the best selective antibacterial activity against E. faecalis and L. rhamnosus. In conclusion, this work enabled the identification of essential oils with selective antibacterial profile that can become possible botanical alternatives to antibiotics used in animal feed...|$|R
