IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> experiences.|$|E

5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was {{before he became a}} writer for the show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea.

This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E
