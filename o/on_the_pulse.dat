25|$|The group {{velocity}} {{of a wave}} (e.g., a light beam) may also exceed c in some circumstances. In such cases, which typically {{at the same time}} involve rapid attenuation of the intensity, the maximum of the envelope of a pulse may travel with a velocity above c. However, even this situation does not imply the propagation of signals with a velocity above c, even though one may be tempted to associate pulse maxima with signals. The latter association {{has been shown to be}} misleading, because the information on the arrival of a pulse can be obtained before the pulse maximum arrives. For example, if some mechanism allows the full transmission of the leading part of a pulse while strongly attenuating the pulse maximum and everything behind (distortion), the pulse maximum is effectively shifted forward in time, while the information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> does not come faster than c without this effect. However, {{group velocity}} can exceed c in some parts of a Gaussian beam in vacuum (without attenuation). The diffraction causes that the peak of pulse propagates faster, while overall power does not.|$|E

500|$|As she {{had begun}} to do in Caged Bird, and {{continued}} throughout her series, Angelou upheld the long tradition of African-American autobiography. At the same time she made a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. [...] Most reviewers agreed that the book was made up of a series of vignettes. [...] By the time Song was written in 2002, sixteen years after her previous autobiography, Angelou had experienced great fame and recognition as an author and poet. [...] She recited her poem <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pulse</b> of Morning at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F.

[...] Angelou wrote two collections of essays in the interim, Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now (1993) and Even the Stars Look Lonesome (1997), which writer Hilton Als called her [...] "wisdom books" [...] and [...] "homilies strung together with autobiographical texts". [...] She also continued her poetry with several volumes, including a collection of her poems, The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou (1994). [...] In 1993, Angelou recited her poem <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pulse</b> of Morning at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F.

2500|$|For metallized film capacitors, {{the maximum}} {{possible}} pulse voltage is limited {{because of the}} limited current-carrying capacity between contact of the electrodes and the electrodes themselves. The rated pulse voltage Vp is the peak value of the pulse voltage which may be applied continuously to a capacitor at the rated temperature and at a given frequency. The pulse voltage capacity is given as pulse voltage rise time dV/dT in V/µs and also implies the maximum pulse current capacity. The values <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> rise time refer to the rated voltage. [...] For lower operating voltages, the permissible pulse rise times may decrease. The permissible pulse load capacity of a film capacitor is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10°K is acceptable.|$|E

2500|$|During the First World War, {{into which}} Canada was drawn {{due to its}} {{association}} with the United Kingdom, the governor general's role turned from one of cultural patron and state ceremony to one of military inspector and morale booster. Starting in 1914, Governor General Prince Arthur donned his Field Marshal's uniform and put his efforts into raising contingents, inspecting army camps, and seeing troops off before their voyage to Europe. These actions, however, led to conflict with the Prince's prime minister at the time, Robert Borden; though the latter placed blame on the Military Secretary Edward Stanton, he also opined that the Duke [...] "laboured under the handicap of his position {{as a member of}} the Royal Family and never realized his limitations as Governor General." [...] Prince Arthur's successor, the Duke of Devonshire, faced the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and held discussions with his Canadian prime minister, as well as His Majesty's Loyal Opposition members, on the matter. Once the government implemented conscription, Devonshire, after consulting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> of the nation with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Vincent Massey, Henri Bourassa, Archbishop of Montreal Paul Bruchési, Duncan Campbell Scott, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Stephen Leacock, made efforts to conciliate Quebec, though he had little real success.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to {{the album}} in the U.S. was more {{enthusiastic}} {{than it had}} been for Byrdmaniax but still wasn't wholly positive. [...] Andy Mellen, reviewing the album in the Winnipeg Free Press in February 1972, noted [...] " [...] not being anywhere the equal of Younger Than Yesterday or even Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, it is an encouraging LP, offering some assurance that Roger McGuinn and friends still have their fingers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> of what's happening musically in 1972." [...] Ben Gerson commented on both the band and the album in the March 1972 issue of Rolling Stone magazine: [...] "There is a programmatic certainty to their music at this point which at first glance happily signifies that a first-generation band has successfully remade itself, but, after repeated exposure disappoints one with its inflexibility." [...] Gerson concluded his review of Farther Along by commenting [...] "This is not an outstanding album, either by Byrds or contemporary standards, though, for at least a Byrds fan, it contains several seductive tunes and some exemplary musicianship. But beneath the old Byrds sound, and this new, quartered approach, there is a more fundamental commitment, and that is to survival." [...] The question of The Byrds' continued existence was also echoed in a contemporary review by Bud Scoppa in the March 1972 edition of Rock magazine, in which he opined [...] "The Byrds recognized their failure on Byrdmaniax, but placed the blame on the lavish production job rather than their own disunity. [...] So what we have with Farther Along, evidently rushed out to rectify the problems caused by the last LP, is more disunity, but this time in a basic unadorned state." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book of Darwin's {{dissertations}} {{does not}} mention Withering, but the first case described in its appendix is a [...] "Miss Hill of Aston near Newport" [...] who is given a more detailed description as case IV in Withering's book. Erasmus Darwin noted the date in his Commonplace book as 25 July 1776, {{and it appears that}} he learnt of the use of digitalis when both he and Withering saw this patient in consultation. Withering's description suggests he is annoyed at Darwin's incomplete account, and Page 8 of his book says that [...] "Dr. Duncan also tells me that the late very ingenious and accomplished Mr. Charles Darwin, informed him of its being used by his father and myself, in cases of Hydrothorax, and that he has ever since mentioned it in his lectures, and sometimes employed it in his practice." [...] Though there is no indication as to the author of the case descriptions, implying that they were part of Charles Darwin's dissertation, in later publications Erasmus Darwin said he had appended case notes, and it seems clear that these were his own. In a paper, dated 14 January 1785 and read on 16 March of that year, Erasmus Darwin published a more detailed [...] "account of the successful use of foxglove", but this gained little attention. Withering's [...] "account" [...] has a preface dated 1 July 1885, and its publication later that year convinced physicians of the use of digitalis as treatment. While Darwin had priority of publication, Withering is rightly given credit for finding and developing this treatment, and was understandably annoyed at Erasmus Darwin. The book of dissertations also had a note of [...] "other ingenious works of the late Mr Darwin in the Hands of the Editor, which may at some distant time be given to the public".
