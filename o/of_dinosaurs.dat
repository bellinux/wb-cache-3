5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b> Although {{it has been suggested that}} most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids, Juravenator, and Megapnosaurus were likely nocturnal. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral, active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian Agilisaurus was inferred to be diurnal.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{gained a}} home in {{television}} in the 1960s animated sitcom The Flintstones, in another example <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> shown as coexisting with humans (for comedic effect in this case). Dinosaurs also entered comic books in this period in such series as Tor and Turok, where prehistoric humans fought anachronistic dinosaurs. For those wanting more scientific accounts <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> there were the first nontechnical dinosaur books. Ned Colbert's The Dinosaur Book (1945) was the first such book, and its status as the only such book for many years made Colbert an important figure for the coming generations of paleontologists and dinosaur enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> {{began in the}} 1820s of England. In 1842, Richard Owen coined the term dinosaur, which under his vision were elephantine reptiles. An ambitious scientist who used dinosaurs and other fossils to promote his beliefs, Owen was the driving force for the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, the first large-scale dinosaur reconstructions that were accessible to the public (1854). These sculptures, which can still be seen today, immortalized a very early stage in the perception <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b>|$|E

5|$|Herrerasaurus {{displays}} {{traits that}} are found in different groups <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most of the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> {{there are a few}} differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets the pelvis) that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Horner, {{an expert}} on the Hadrosauridae family, had less {{affinity}} for other kinds <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b> In 1987 and 1989, horned dinosaur specialist Peter Dodson was invited to investigate the new ceratopsian finds. In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening the case for the validity of a separate Styracosaurus ovatus, to be distinguished from Styracosaurus albertensis.|$|E
5|$|Like Compsognathus, {{and unlike}} Sinosauropteryx, {{a patch of}} fossilized skin from the tail and hindlimb of the {{possible}} relative Juravenator starki shows mainly scales, though there is some indication that simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b>|$|E

5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth in}} {{interest}} in dinosaurs since the Dinosaur Renaissance {{has been accompanied}} by depictions made by artists working with ideas at the leading edge of dinosaur science, presenting lively dinosaurs and feathered dinosaurs as these concepts were first being considered. Cultural depictions <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> have been an important means of translating scientific discoveries to the public.|$|E
5|$|The middle–late Campanian {{formations}} show {{a greater}} diversity <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> {{than any other}} single group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: Tyrannosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, and Torosaurus, which suggests food was plentiful immediately prior to the extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of how this find reflects metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot, though, regardless of the object's identity. Both modern crocodilians and birds, the closest living relatives <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well; the structure is not necessarily tied to metabolic rate.|$|E

5|$|The reevaluation <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> spurred public interest, {{with the}} new {{generation}} of paleoartists quick to respond.

5|$|The {{study of}} early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor {{therefore}} {{has important implications}} for the concept <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> as a monophyletic group (a group descended from a common ancestor). The monophyly <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who compiled a list of cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of Herrerasaurus by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common ancestor, and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of Herrerasaurus also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} groups <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> very {{complete}} remains {{have been discovered}} for most known tyrannosaurids.

5|$|Unlike {{some other}} groups <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> neither genus was more common at {{higher or lower}} {{elevations}} than the other. However, Gorgosaurus appears more common in northern formations like the Dinosaur Park, with species of Daspletosaurus more abundant to the south. The same pattern is seen in other groups <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b> Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also {{more common in the}} Two Medicine Formation of Montana and in southwestern North America during the Campanian, while centrosaurines and lambeosaurines dominate in northern latitudes. Holtz has suggested that this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines. At the end of the later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like Tyrannosaurus rex, hadrosaurines like Edmontosaurus and chasmosaurines like Triceratops were widespread throughout western North America, while albertosaurines and centrosaurines became extinct, and lambeosaurines were rare.|$|E
5|$|When laying eggs, females grow {{a special}} type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limbs. This {{medullary}} bone, which {{is rich in}} calcium, is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur Allosaurus and the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Because the line <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Because Iguanodon {{is one of}} {{the first}} dinosaur genera to have been named, {{numerous}} species have been assigned to it. While never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early genera <b>of</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> (such as Megalosaurus) became, Iguanodon has had a complicated history, and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions. Although Gregory Paul recommended restricting I. bernissartensis to the famous sample from Bernissart, ornithopod workers like Norman and McDonald have disagreed with Paul's recommendations, except exercising caution when accepting records of Iguanodon from France and Spain as valid.|$|E
