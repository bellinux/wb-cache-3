2500|$|Dan Povenmire {{attributes}} the show's genesis to {{growing up in}} Mobile, Alabama, where his mother told him never to waste a day of summer. To occupy himself, Povenmire undertook projects such as hole-digging and home movie-making. Povenmire recalled, [...] "My mom let me drape black material {{all the way across}} one end of <b>our</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> to use as a space field. I would hang little models of spaceships for these little movies I made with a Super 8 camera." [...] He was an artistic prodigy and displayed his very detailed drawings at art shows. Meanwhile, Marsh grew up in a large, blended family. As with Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in several activities in order to have fun.|$|E

60|$|The lack of room in {{our house}} is brought painfully to my mind as I recall that she lay {{for a week or}} two in a corner of <b>our</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> with all the noise and bustle of the family going on around her. Her own attic chamber was unwarmed (like those of all her girl friends), and so she was forced to lie near the kitchen stove.|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} two or three years, “The Internet will kill television, ” has been a commonplace. But what does this {{scenario}} really imply?

Let’s instead examine {{for a moment the}} possibility that television kills the Internet. When I suggest that,...|$|R

40|$|Today’s (home) media {{environment}} {{is becoming increasingly}} saturated. Smartphones, tablets and laptops enter <b>our</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> and possibly alter our television viewing experience. In this paper, we want to grasp {{to what extent the}} use and role of television changes in the presence of multiple mobile media technologies. Through a multi-method approach we explore TV viewing behavior in a media-rich <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Survey results indicate that the ownership of multiple media technologies in the home environment promotes their use whilst watching television. In addition, in-depth interviews reveal that in these media-rich <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> media consumption becomes both more individualized and more social. According to the interviewees, social interaction within the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> has not decreased, but rather complemented with online conversations. These conversations can be in accordance (or congruent) with television content, {{but most of the time}} they are unrelated (or incongruent) ...|$|R

Upset over memories of beatings and imprisonment from the Taliban, Afghan expats bristled at the privileges Taliban leaders are allowed in Doha {{along with the}} fact that Taliban leaders do not have to work.

As a blackfella, I’m not sure I {{agree that it is}} for “everyone” but that’s {{precisely}} why I love it. It’s been over 40 years since Basically Black, the first Indigenous sketch show aired on our screens, and it’s been too long a wait to see our mob doing humour our way in <b>our</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> once again.

40|$|Panoramic Sham is {{sunset and}} sunrise, {{a walk through}} a field of wildflowers or {{a day in the}} forest. It is that moment when a light breeze tousles your hair and {{chirping}} birds reaffirm vitality. Panoramic Sham is also a heap of outdated home goods that once transformed <b>our</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> into artificial habitats. I reimagine decommissioned domestic goods as a way to confront trends of mass-production, habits of consumption and to explore systems of artifice, authenticity, and the consumer haze perpetuated by contemporary American society. Comprised of synthetic materials and manufactured to impersonate nature, these 20 th century cast-offs provide an abundant cycle of cultural and generational refuse...|$|R
2500|$|Responding to {{two columns}} that Bozell wrote in early 2005, San Francisco Chronicle {{columnist}} Neva Chonin claimed that Bozell wanted to forbid offensive television programs {{not only from}} his views, but [...] "from all <b>our</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms,</b> choice and taste be damned." [...] Television Watch, an organization promoting parental responsibility for children's television viewing over increased government regulation of television, used a short clip of Bozell saying that the V-Chip is ineffective at blocking inappropriate television programs in a promotional video released in July 2005 intended to claim that special-interest groups like Bozell's own Parents Television Council are using such propaganda to justify increased government control of the public airwaves.|$|R

Its {{potential}} impact on humanity, however, is actually far more profound. VR provides not just a new digital content delivery platform. It creates, in literal fact, an entire new class of human experience. A virtual experience is only virtual according to our intellects, but to every other fiber of our perceptual system, the experience is not at all virtual. It is real. I will discuss the implications, both beautiful and unsettling, of a world in which human experiences can be wholly designed and manufactured, yet perceived by our nervous systems as absolutely real...|$|R

40|$|It can not {{be denied}} that our age is the epoch of the photograph: we are {{surrounded}} by photographic images in <b>our</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms,</b> in the streets, in our places of work and in our places of leisure. And yet, the photographic image was generally ignored by most major twentieth century philosophers working in phenomenology. Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, Lacan and Levinas all choose examples of paintings rather than photographs to illustrate, and/or ground, their arguments on issues of visual perception, aesthetic, ethics and politics. It is surprising and disturbing that despite the fact that these philosophers were all exposed to an ever increasing number of disturbing and difficult photographic images, often raising philosophical issues relevant to their own work, they chose to ignore discussions of such photographs in their philosophical work...|$|R
