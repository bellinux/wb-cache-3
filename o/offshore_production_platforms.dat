30|$|Oil {{platforms}} {{are complex}} structures where different {{processes such as}} drilling, extraction, processing and storing take place. In large platforms, the structure provides accommodation for over two hundred people and helicopter traffic is constant (Booth & Butler, 1992). The platforms located in the geographical area of this case studied varied in size, production and level of complexity. While some performed all the above processes, others only extracted the natural resource and directed it to other platforms, which initially processed the raw material {{before it could be}} transported onshore for refining. Besides oil production, Gas Oil Separation Plants (GOSP) include utility systems that provide energy, water and air {{to be used in the}} platform (Devold, 2013). Some platforms provide gas to other platforms in the same area. In this sense, there was a complex network of interdependence and intense information flow among the platforms. In <b>offshore</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms,</b> the local control room is the central space for monitoring and controlling production processes and safety procedures (Walker et al., 2014). Platform operators are professionals monitoring production processes, storage and assisting oil production teams. In many companies, the concept of integration brought changes to the role of the platform operator by demanding them to be part of distributed teams (Walker et al., 2014).|$|E
40|$|Whereas most water {{produced}} from onshore {{oil and gas}} operations is disposed via reinjection, some waters, such as those from <b>offshore</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms,</b> coastal production, and some onshore wells, must be treated to remove organic constituents before the water is discharged. Current methods for reducing residual free phases and dissolved organic carbon are not always fully effective in meeting regulatory limits. In addition, cost, space requirements, {{and ease of use}} are important factors in any treatment system. Surfactant-modified zeolite (SMZ) has been used successfully to treat contaminated ground water for organic and inorganic constituents. This research will use laboratory batch and column studies to design a field system that will be used to treat produced waters to reduce dissolved and free-phase organic constituents. The system will be designed to operate simply and to have low operating costs. Methods for regeneration of the spent zeolite will also be tested, as will the treatment system at a field production site in the final project task. Research over the past six months has focused on the selection and characterization of the surfactant modified zeolite and the produced waters. The zeolite to be used in this work has been obtained from St. Cloud Mine near Winston, New Mexico. The primary surfactant to be used to modify the zeolite is hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) ...|$|E
40|$|Public {{attention}} has frequently been {{directed to the}} large accidental oil spills connected with tanker groundings or breakups and platform blowouts. The operational oil discharges connected with <b>offshore</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> could, however, have equally severe effects in the offshore environment because the pollution occurs day after day {{as long as the}} activities that produce it continue to operate. This study is concerned with such discharges in the North Sea. The study focused on the central actors involved in the standard-setting process for operational or chronic discharges. Each key actor was interviewed in depth to determine their perceptions of the problem, the role of other actors, the alternatives considered and the interactions among actors. This decision-making complex thus includes a variety of decision-making units with varying abilities to influence the outcomes of the standards. Regulator, developer and environmental expert actors formed the basic focus for this effort. The objectives of the regulators and developers are described along with the alternative regulations, treatments and uses of the environment that are considered. Then a comparison and evaluation of the decision process by which Norwegian and U. K. regulators arrived at discharge standards is made. Major findings include the near similarity of the standards set even though the approaches to such standards are perceived to be quite different in each country. Another finding is that entrepreneurial endeavor for oil discharge treatment equipment is a key parameter in deciding on standards since both countries must rely on such effort for what is available. Lack of information on the effects of oil in the sea is another finding along with a minimal role for environmental quality factors in setting standards. Such findings make it difficult to trace trade-offs in the selection process for standard setting. Finally, some suggestions for improvements in this process are noted...|$|E

As more oil and gas are discovered in deeper water than ever before, the offshore industry has become increasingly interested in the design of advanced <b>offshore</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms.</b> A new design concept called FLOATING JACKET (FJ) is studied in this thesis. The most unique feature of the new FJ concept is to place much of the needed buoyancy/ballast deep in the ocean water. The deck and production equipment are supported by a jacket structure which is in turn mounted on top of the large buoyancy/ballast tank deeply submerged below the ocean surface. This concept offers many attractive features. Model testing of the FJ was performed in Offshore Technology Research Center (OTRC). The responses of the FJ under regular waves and 100 -year storm-n in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), with or without surface current, have been investigated. responses are obtained and the linear relationships between the responses and between the mooring tension and the responses are identified. The quadratic relationship between the low frequency responses and the input wave elevations are presented by using the bi-coherence spectral analysis. Experimental results in 100 -year storm are compared to the analytical calculations both in time and frequent domains. Surface current is included in some of the comparisons. The results are in good agreement, especially for the 100 -year storm-n without current. From the experimental studies on the FJ platform, it can be concluded that this new Floating Jacket concept is indeed a feasible and superior platform configuration for deep water production systems...|$|E
40|$|Exploiting {{stranded}} gas reservoirs, associate {{gas from}} <b>offshore</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms,</b> condensate gas reservoirs {{may not be}} feasible using traditional approaches (i. e. pipelines) due to gas volumes, composition, location and/or climate. Marine Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) technology is a possible alternative; however, the required gas quality for CNG remains a challenge in commercial deployment. The optimal design conditions to safely and efficiently load, store, and unload CNG vessels are highly dependent {{on the quality of}} the gas. The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of moderate/rich gases in CNG technology by performing dynamic simulations of the loading and unloading operations. It was demonstrated that existing Equations of State (EOS) are limited in accurately predicting the behaviour of the gas under load/unload conditions, particularly for gases with large heavy hydrocarbons content. Experiments with laboratory-synthesized gas samples were conducted using a PVT cell. The accuracy of the EOSs in predicting dew points, liquid dropout percentages, and gas densities was evaluated using the experimental data from the laboratory and literature. After tuning Peng-Robinson (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equations to improve their predictions, their performance was evaluated using the HYSYS process simulator. A marked improvement in the EOS predictions was achieved by modifying a few EOS parameters. Dew point predictions were improved by adjusting binary interaction parameters (kij), the density predictions were improved by modifying the Peneloux parameters, and modifying both kij and Peneloux parameters enhanced the liquid dropout predictions. Dynamic simulations of the loading and unloading operations of a CNG tank were then performed to evaluate the effect of the heavy hydrocarbon content of the gases. Overall, removing all the heavier hydrocarbons appeared to produce very low temperatures during the unloading operation, while not removing these components caused an accumulation of liquids inside the tank at keel pressure. In addition, the simulation of the loading and unloading of a CNG tank was attempted in the laboratory using the PVT system; however, the attempt was unsuccessful as the system would require major modifications...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{price and}} demand for natural gas {{has made it possible}} to explore remote gas fields. Traditional <b>offshore</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> for natural gas have been exporting the partially processed natural gas to shore, where it is further processed to permit consumption by end-users. Such an approach is possible where the gas field is located within a reasonable distance from shore or from an existing gas pipeline network. However, much of the world’s gas reserves are found in remote offshore fields where transport via a pipeline is not feasible or is uneconomic to install and therefore, to date, has not been possible to explore. The development of floating production platforms and, on the receiving end, regasification platforms, have increased the possibilities to explore these fields and transport the liquefied gas in a more efficient form, i. e. liquefied natural gas (LNG), to the end user who in turn can readily import the gas. Floating production platforms and regasification platforms, collectively referred to as FLNG, imply a blend of technology from land-based LNG industry, offshore oil and gas industry and marine transport technology. Regulations and rules based on experience from these applications could become too conservative or not conservative enough when applied to a FLNG unit. Alignment with rules for conventional LNG carriers would be an advantage since this would increase the transparency and possibility for standardization in the building of floating LNG production vessels. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify the risks relevant to FLNG. The risks are compared to conventional LNG carriers and whether or not regulatory alignment possibilities exist. To identify the risks, a risk analysis was performed based on the principles of formal safety assessment methodology. To propose regulatory alignment possibilities, the risks found were also evaluated against the existing rules and regulations of Det Norske Veritas. The conclusion of the study is that the largest risk-contributing factor on an FLNG is the presence of processing, liquefaction or regasification equipment and for an LNG carrier it is collision, grounding and contact accidents. Experience from oil FPSOs could be used in the design of LNG FPSOs, and attention needs to be drawn to the additional requirements due to processing and storage of cryogenic liquid on board. FSRUs may follow either an approach for offshore rules or, if intended to follow a regular docking scheme, follow an approach for ship rules with additional issues addressed in classification notes...|$|E
