5000|$|Transport on a country-wide scale {{began in}} 1710 with the {{introduction}} by the General Post <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> coaches on the main routes between towns. Private operators added to the routes, and an established [...] "turnpike" [...] road system started in the 1730s. In 1715 the Irish Parliament took steps to encourage inland navigation, {{but it was not}} until 1779 that the first 19 km (12 mi) section of the Grand Canal was opened. The addition of the Royal Canal and river navigation (particularly on the River Shannon) meant that freight could be transported more easily. Charles Bianconi established his horse-car services in the south in 1815, the first of many such passenger-carrying operations. Despite these improvements huge areas of Ireland still relied on a basic road system; turnpikes were still slow and canals were expensive.|$|R

50|$|Before the {{creation}} <b>of</b> the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> Postmaster, <b>mail</b> duties were handled by {{workers in the}} <b>office</b> <b>of</b> the Doorkeeper, who were paid additional compensation. The Postmaster {{was made into a}} distinct and permanent House of Representatives employee in 1832, and in 1834, William J. McCormick, a Doorkeeper's office employee, was named as the first House Postmaster. Four years later, the Postmaster was also given responsibility for the Capitol post <b>office.</b> The <b>office</b> <b>of</b> Postmaster was abolished in 1992; House mail handling procedures were reassigned to other officers and private entities.|$|R

5000|$|In 1801, {{the title}} of [...] "surveyor" [...] was changed to Special Agent. In 1830, the Special Agents were {{organized}} into the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Instructions and <b>Mail</b> Depredations. The Postal Inspection Service was the first federal law enforcement agency to use the title Special Agent for its officers. Congress changed this title to Inspector in 1880.|$|R
50|$|Another serious {{collapse}} {{was at the}} <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> the King's Buildings after {{a chimney}} broke in the roof and forced its way through four floors. The place was completely wrecked, but fortunately there was no loss of life. The upper floor, occupied by Messrs.

50|$|Thomas Albert Lurz (b. January 9, 1874), a Baltimore {{native and}} letter carrier with the U.S. Post <b>Office,</b> rescued tons <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> {{from the burning}} Central Post Office {{on the east side}} of Battle Monument Square, on North Calvert Street, between East Lexington and Fayette Streets. Lurz {{gathered}} a group of men who loaded bags <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> onto horse-drawn wagons, took them to North and Pennsylvania Avenues, and stood guard until the Maryland National Guard arrived (for which he later received a commendation). Meanwhile, back at the General Post Office, employees kept spraying water on the building's sides and roof and were able to minimize damage and save the 1889 Italian Renaissance edifice with its nine towers and central tall clock tower (later razed and replaced by the current 1932 building, later converted to city use as Courthouse East).|$|R

50|$|For {{more than}} two centuries after the last fortifications were built in 1753, there was total neglect of the forts and battlements {{resulting}} in vegetation overgrowth, till the Government of Panama decided to restore them. After Panama became an independent country, Spain abandoned the San Lorenzo Fort in 1821. Following merger of Panama with Columbia, the fort was used as a prison. Then it was the Post <b>Office</b> for delivery <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> from Britain to Latin America. At Chagres town and below the fort and on {{the west bank of the}} Chagres River it was a haven for the adventurers of the 1849 California Gold Rush. With advent of railroad in 1850, importance of Chagres River inter-ocean route diminished.|$|R
50|$|After 10 {{years of}} {{activity}} <b>of</b> the post <b>office</b> building, a need appears {{for a new}} one dedicated entirely to the Imperial Directorate of Posts, with its constantly expanding amount <b>of</b> <b>offices</b> works (<b>mail,</b> telegraph and phone), and a multitude of civil servants. Another plot was acquired, with land and buildings between Jagiellońska and Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki streets, belonging to the Customs <b>Office.</b> After demolition <b>of</b> an old classicist building standing there, the construction of the new edifice started in 1896, according to the design of a team of architects led by Kleinfeldt and L. Neumann from Konigsberg.|$|R
50|$|This {{line was}} never {{particularly}} busy. The first timetable showed three passenger trains and {{a freight train}} each way daily. This was soon reduced to three mixed trains. Traffic continued to go down. The line suffered competition from the Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway. This route was quicker to the main Inverness to Aberdeen line. Traders in Banff could {{not be expected to}} transport their goods across the bridge over the river, then up the hill to the station, when there was a more convenient station in Banff. The company's directors were particularly incensed with the Post <b>Office.</b> Instead <b>of</b> the <b>mails</b> been carried at a fixed rate they sent the postman up the line with the mailbags, while only purchasing a ticket like an ordinary passenger.|$|R
5000|$|These {{expansions}} warranted a large central post <b>office</b> for receipt <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> and distribution. In 1868, the Madras Chamber of Commerce {{urged the}} Governments of India and Madras {{to build a}} large General Post Office in a central place. However, owing {{to the construction of}} GOPs in Calcutta and Bombay, both Government of India and Government of Madras were able to sanction only [...] 200,000 for this purpose. In 1873, the present site, where the Abercrombie Battery had once stood, was selected and the construction started in 1874, but {{there was a lack of}} funds to proceed with the work till 1880. The site was initially intended to be divided between the Bank of Madras and the Post Office. However, the Chamber urged that both the post and telegraph departments be housed in one building, which necessitated an even bigger building, and the governments decided not to divide the land and allotted the whole to the new post office.|$|R
25|$|In March, 1873, Vail was {{assigned}} to duty in the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> the General Superintendent <b>of</b> Railway <b>Mail</b> Service, Washington, D.C.

In June, 1874, he was appointed Assistant Superintendent <b>of</b> Railway <b>Mail</b> Service. In 1875, he became Assistant General Superintendent.|$|R
