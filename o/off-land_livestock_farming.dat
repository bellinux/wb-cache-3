40|$|We {{argue that}} an {{understanding}} of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> as normative practice clarifies how sustainability is to be understood in <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> The sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is first approached by investigating its identity. We argue that the economic aspect qualifies and the formative aspect founds the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice. Observing the normativity related to these aspects {{will be the first}} task for the livestock farmer. In addition, we can distinguish conditioning norms applicable to the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice which should be observed for competent performance of the practice. Failing to do justice to this normativity might affect the practice's sustainability only in the long term - this is especially the case with conditioning norms. Motives to observe normativity have, therefore, the character of an ultimate conviction regarding the flourishing of the practice. Finally, the sustainability of the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice crucially depends on the broader food system of which it is part...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{the scale and}} {{intensity}} of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> have increased significantly. At the same time, Western societies have become more urbanised and fewer people have close relatives involved in farming. As a result, most citizens have little knowledge or direct experience of what farming entails. In addition, more people are expressing concerns over issues such as farm animal welfare. This has led to increasing public demand for more sustainable ways of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> To date, {{little research has been}} carried out on the social pillar of sustainable <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} provide insights into the sociocultural sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems. This study reviews the key findings of earlier published interdisciplinary research about the social perceptions of dairy farming in the Netherlands and Norway (Boogaard et al., 2006, 2008, 2010 a and 2010 b) and synthesises the implications for sociocultural sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> This study argues that the (sociocultural) sustainable development of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is not an objective concept, but that it is socially and culturally constructed by people in specific contexts. It explains the social pillar of the economics/ecological/social model sustainability in terms of the fields of tensions that exist between modernity, traditions and naturality – ‘the MTN knot’ – each of which has positive and negative faces. All three angles of vision can be seen in people's attitudes to dairy farming, but the weight given to each differs between individuals and cultures. Hence, sociocultural sustainability is context dependent and needs to be evaluated according to its local meaning. Moreover, sociocultural sustainability is about people's perceptions of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> Lay people might perceive <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> differently and ascribe different meanings to it than experts do, but their ‘reality’ is just as real. Finally, this study calls for an ongoing collaboration between social and animal scientists in order to develop <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems that are more socioculturally sustainable...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} monitoring Trenthorst, situated near Lübeck in a temperate {{maritime climate}} on loamy soils, {{was established in}} 2003 and compares two cash crop and three <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems. We studied the soil mineral nitrogen contents of one cash crop and two <b>livestock</b> <b>farms,</b> specialised in dairy cows and goats/oilseeds resp., with {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> show a more even course of Nmin in the rotation and a higher rotation mean. The rotation average of Nmin in the cash crop farm was not lower than the ones in the <b>livestock</b> <b>farms.</b> But {{in the course of the}} rotations differences became evident: compared to the <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> the cash crop farm showed higher Nmin-values after the first rotation year (mulched vs. cut grass clover) but lower values in the fourth and fifth year of the rotation. As a precise nitrogen supply via manure as in the <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> is impossible in a self-sustaining cash crop farm, the excess of nitrogen at the beginning and the lack of it towards the end of the rotation could not be balanced. A way to improve this might be the use of green manure crops for biogas production and the application of the residues as manure. But as no full rotation period has yet passed, a longer study period is necessary to confirm the results...|$|R

Excessive livestock waste {{as a result of}} intensive farming system need to be addressed. Although animal waste can be utilized as a manure to improve the physical and chemical properties of soil, it can also cause environmental hazard if not managed properly. It can caused malodour or odour nuisance to environment, surface water contamination, secondary pollution and also religious sensitivity. In order to minimize the problem, there must be some sort of regulation, existing regulation/by-law mainly focusing on disease control. As the environment issue caused by <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> becoming more prominent, the government needs to formulate regulation or guidelines to tackle the problem. With this, come <b>Livestock</b> <b>farming</b> rules 2000 and specific guidelines to <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> in Sabah and also guidelines to establish Pig Farming Area (PFA). Amongst the important feature of <b>Livestock</b> <b>Farming</b> Rules 2000 are control of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming,</b> layout plan for pig farm before being licensed and the level of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) based on the standard requirement of the Department of Environment and Conservation.

This study aims to explore associations between the presence of <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> and respiratory health {{in an area of}} high-density <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> in the Netherlands. We focused especially on associations between farm exposures and respiratory symptoms within subgroups of potentially susceptible patients with a pre-existing lung disease. In total, 14   875 adults (response rate 53. 4 %) completed a questionnaire concerning respiratory health, smoking habits and personal characteristics. Different indicators of <b>livestock</b> <b>farm</b> exposures relative to the home address were computed using a geographic information system. Prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma was lower among residents living within 100  m of a farm (OR 0. 47, 95 % CI 0. 24 - 0. 91 and OR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 45 - 0. 93, respectively). However, > 11 farms in 1000  m compared to fewer than four farms in 1000  m (fourth quartile versus first quartile) was associated with wheezing among COPD patients (OR 1. 71, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 2. 89).

40|$|The meat {{industrial}} sector in Namibia has changed rapidly since becoming {{linked to the}} global economy after the country's independence from South Africa. Before independence, the meat industry was managed by colonists who ran commercial farms in the central and southern parts of the country, and who ignored <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> by "Black people" living in the north under apartheid regime. After independence, however, the nation has promoted <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> by people living in northern Namibia to involve them in the national meat market. On the other hand, the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> of Ovambo has also changed {{in the past two}} decades, and some households have set "cattle posts," areas of grazing land surrounded by a fence. The purpose of this research is to clarify the relation between the changes in <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> among Ovambo agro-pastoralists and the expanding of meat industry of Namibia, with special reference to the setting of cattle posts. Most cattle post owners have high-paying jobs, and their cattle management system is different from the old one.
