50|$|The British and Irish sort {{codes are}} only used for {{domestic}} money transfers. If {{money is being}} transferred across international borders, an international network is used. At the beginning of 2014 all European countries using the euro switched to the IBAN {{as a means of}} identifying bank accounts and previously used coding systems such as the BLZ, BIC and even account numbers are not in use anymore. However, transfers to, amongst others, the United States and Australia make use of the <b>BIC</b> <b>Codes.</b> Characters 9 to 14 of British and Irish IBANs hold the bank account sort code.|$|R
50|$|A bank {{transfer}} (also {{known as a}} wire transfer or credit transfer) is a method of transferring money from one person or institution (entity) to another. A wire transfer {{can be made from}} one bank account to another bank account or through a transfer of cash at a cash office. A bank wire transfer is often the most expedient method for transferring funds between bank accounts. The transfer messages are sent via a secure system (such as SWIFT or Fedwire) utilizing IBAN and <b>BIC</b> <b>codes.</b> Online {{bank transfer}} systems in Europe are popular alternative payment methods, where the bank transfer is authorized by the consumer who logs onto his bank website and authorizes the funds transfer for payment to a merchant.|$|R

25|$|Before IBAN, differing {{national}} standards for bank account identification (i.e. bank, branch, routing codes, and account number) were confusing for some users. This often led to necessary routing information being missing from payments. Routing information as specified by ISO 9362 (also known as Business Identifier <b>Codes</b> (<b>BIC</b> <b>code),</b> SWIFT ID or SWIFT code, and SWIFT-BIC) {{does not require a}} specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. It also does not contain check digits, so errors of transcription were not detectable and it was not possible for a sending bank to validate the routing information prior to submitting the payment. Routing errors caused delayed payments and incurred extra costs to the sending and receiving banks and often to intermediate routing banks.|$|R

50|$|TARGET2 {{is also an}} interbank RTGS {{payment system}} for the {{clearing}} of cross-border transfers in the eurozone. Participants in the system are either direct or indirect. Direct participants hold an RTGS account and have access to real-time information and control tools.

40|$|Data {{detection}} of convolutional coded differential quaternary phase shift keyed (DQPSK) signals using a predictive Viterbi algorithm (VA) based receiver, is presented for single input, multiple output - orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) systems. The receiver has both error correcting capability {{and also the}} ability to perform channel estimation (prediction). The predictive VA operates on a supertrellis with just S_ST=S_E× 2 ^P- 1 states instead of S_ST=S_E× 2 ^P states, where the complexity reduction is achieved by using the concept of isometry (here S_E denotes the number of states in the encoder trellis and P denotes the prediction order). Though the linear prediction based data detection in turbo coded OFDM and the bit interleaved <b>coded</b> (<b>BIC)</b> OFDM systems perform better than the proposed approach in terms of bit error rate (BER) for a given {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR), the decoding delay of the proposed approach is significantly lower than that of the BIC and the turbo coded OFDM systems.

40|$|In this paper, a relay-based {{energy-efficient}} cooperative {{communication strategy}} is proposed, under {{the hypothesis that}} the relay transmits with power drawn from energy-harvesting (EH) sources. Assuming a deterministic EH model under which the harvested amount of energy is known prior to transmission, a spectrally efficient adaptive Bit-Interleaved <b>Coded</b> (<b>BIC)</b> OFDM modulation scheme has been investigated. To guarantee the successful reception of a packet, Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocol has been adopted. Assuming a long term static channel, the expected goodput (EGP) metric is used as cost function to be optimized. The most significant step-ahead of the proposed approach with respect to state-of-the-art is to increase the cooperation gain by using a bargaining game algorithm. Since most renewable sources are highly intermittent, they can induce significant fluctuation on the available power. The bargaining game algorithm takes into account the energy status of the relay and helps the source node to decide whether to cooperate or not with the relay. Achieved simulation results show that the bargaining game algorithm actually helps the nodes to select the right strategy, with a substantial goodput improvement, in particular when the energy availability of relay becomes intermittent due to the harvesting...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the blind index <b>coding</b> (<b>BIC)</b> problem, {{in which a}} single sender communicates distinct messages to multiple users over a shared channel. Each user has partial knowledge of each message as side information. However, unlike classic index <b>coding,</b> in <b>BIC,</b> the sender is uncertain of what side information is available to each user. In particular, the sender only knows the amount of bits in each user's side information but not its content. This problem can arise naturally in caching and wireless networks. In order to blindly exploit side information in the BIC problem, we develop a hybrid coding scheme that XORs uncoded bits of a subset of messages with random combinations of bits from other messages. This scheme allows us to strike the right balance between maximizing the transmission rate to each user and minimizing the interference leakage to others. We also develop a general outer bound, which relies on a strong data processing inequality to effectively capture the senders uncertainty about the users' side information. Additionally, we consider the case where communication takes place over a shared wireless medium, modeled by an erasure broadcast channel, and show that surprisingly, combining repetition coding with hybrid coding improves the achievable rate region and outperforms alternative strategies of coping with channel erasure and while blindly exploiting side information.

40|$|In a {{world where}} {{mobility}} is ever increasing, people needs {{to communicate with each}} other having timely access to information regardless of the location of the individuals or the information to be exchanged. In this scenario, the demand for advanced wireless communication systems has prompted both the search for a better understanding of fundamental limits in communication theory and their implications for the design of high-efficient wireless systems. Hence, high data transmission rates, wide area coverage, high quality of service (QoS) and efficient use of transmission resources come out as the main design challenges to be met by wireless communication engineers. Recently, technological advances based on multiple antenna systems (MIMO), multicarrier transmissions (OFDM) and advanced error-correcting code schemes such as bit interleaved <b>coded</b> (<b>BIC)</b> modulation, demonstrated the possibility to increase system performance and to obtain the desirable QoS for the fourth generation of wireless system and beyond. Another promising concept which gained considerable interest in the wireless communication arena is Cognitive Radio. This allows the shared use of the same spectrum bands between licensed (primary) and unlicensed (secondary) users on a non-interference basis. Due to the mobility of the users, however, radio propagation conditions may change during the transmission, so that different packets experience different channel conditions. Unfortunately, this inexorably plagues the radio resource management, which would need a reliable (and stable) knowledge of Channel State Information (CSI). As a matter of fact, the transmitter has only an Imperfect and/or Outdated CSI, which hinders resource allocation and make the system performance more and more degraded. The goal of this thesis is to tackle this issue, by designing a novel algorithm for the prediction of radio channel variations in a cognitive packed-based BIC-OFDM transmission system. The key idea is based on the Effective SNR Mapping (ESM) concept, which maps the instantaneous per-subcarrier SNRs into a single value, the effectiveSNR, which is used at transmitter side to choose the optimal radio resource allocation. The proposed performance prediction algorithm has been then applied as the core of a novel link resource allocation (LRA) strategy for a BIC-OFDM and Cognitive BIC-OFDM systems. Extensive numerical results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms when subject to radio channel variations. Finally, the LRA algorithm has also been applied to a MIMO-SVD BIC-OFDM scheme, in order to obtain a preliminary valuation of its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The {{presentation}} will {{summarize the}} first two outcomes of the JRA and highlight the open issues currently under investigation. The first part concerns a preliminary work about a link resource adaptation (LRA) problem for point-to-point bit-interleaved <b>coded</b> (<b>BIC)</b> OFDM systems with outdated channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. The LRA strategy is able to select modulation, coding rate and power distribution of a OFDM system with the aim to maximize the expected goodput (EGP) metric. The main contributions consists in the derivation of a novel link performance prediction (LPP) method under outdated CSI. Based on these findings, an effective LRA strategy is then developed. Simulation results corroborate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, showing remarkable performance gains w. r. t. the conventional approach which does not care of the outdated CSI. The main results of this study are reported in a paper to be presented at the forthcoming European Wireless 2014 conference. The second activity deals with a centralized resource allocation problem for multicarrier cooperative cognitive radio networks in the presence of imperfect CSI. The problem considers a cooperative network in a cognitive scenario, in which a secondary user (SU) may gain access to the same bandwidth of a primary user (PU) network, if the interference at the PU receivers is kept below a certain interference threshold. The cooperative network considered in this study includes the source node (SN), the destination node (DN) and M relay nodes (RNs). Direct link is not present between the SN and DN and decode-and-forward protocol is used at RNs. In this scenario, the SN transmits several OFDM symbols to the different RNs. Then each RN decodes the messages of a certain subset of subcarriers, then re-encodes these messages and forwards to the DN them, by using on different subcarriers w. r. t. the SN-RN link. The centralized resource allocation problem selects the subcarrier pairing for the SN-RN and the RN-DN links, and a power allocation for each RN with the aim of keeping the interference at each PU receiver below a certain threshold. Finally, the current research activities on the open issues will be briefly summarized. The goal is to derive a distributed resource allocation problem, by resorting to mathematical theory of convex optimization and game theory, for the scenario described above. The activity will also introduce, as performance metric, the goodput and the packet error rate, which both allow to characterize in more a suitable way the actual performance of a packet-oriented communication system. Moreover, the performance of the SN-RN-DN link will be investigated, in the presence of imperfect CSI...|$|R
