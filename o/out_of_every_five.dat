5|$|The {{imposition}} of new taxation categories {{that were a}} departure from both secular Ottoman law and the traditionally accepted Islamic law drew local Muslim anger at the authorities. However, the principal point of contention between the authorities and the notables of Jerusalem and Nablus was the conscription order by Ibrahim Pasha on 25 April 1834. That day, Ibrahim Pasha convened {{with all of the}} clan leaders from both cities to demand the drafting of one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> Muslim men of fighting age. The order would begin with the conscription of 200 men from Jerusalem, a combined 3,500 men from Sanjak al-Quds and Sanjak Nablus, and 500 men from Hebron. By May 1834, the only prominent ally of the Egyptians in Palestine was the Abd al-Hadi clan.|$|E
5|$|In June 1976, {{a series}} of protests took place across {{communist}} Poland soon after the government announced plans to increase sharply the fixed prices charged nationwide for many basic commodities. Violent incidents occurred in Płock, Radom and Ursus as the protests were forcibly put down, and the planned price hikes were cancelled. These demonstrations and the events surrounding them brought the Polish workforce and intellectual political opposition together, and by 1980, a campaign of civil resistance for political change was intensifying strongly. Industrial strike action in Lublin in July 1980—the so-called Lublin July—preceded the formation of Solidarity (Solidarność) in {{the port city of}} Gdańsk during the following months. This was the first non-communist trade union in an Eastern bloc country. The government took several steps to obstruct Solidarity's emergence, enforcing press censorship and cutting off telephone connections between the coast and the hinterland, but despite these efforts four <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> Polish workers were members of the union by late 1980.|$|E

40|$|Childhood obesity {{influences}} {{body weight}} in the adult and is intrinsically associated with multiple co-morbidities. In the past 20 years, the prevalence of overweight and obese school children in Switzerland has increased by three to six-fold. One <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> four to <b>five</b> children is overweight or obese. Thus, primary prevention is absolutely essential. Excess weight results from a positive energy balance. According to the current literature, changes in {{the quantity and quality}} of nutrition, a reduction in physical activity, an increase in sedentary lifestyles, including media consumption, as well as a reduction of sleep time are the most important external factors that promote the development of childhood obesity after infancy. Hereby, the intrauterine milieu and genetic factors also play a role. The obesity epidemic particularly affects children born to overweight parents, children with low socio-economic status, and migrants. Randomized, controlled studies aimed at medium to long-term (< or = 1 year) reductions in BMI or fat tissue have mainly been school-based and sometimes involved the family as well. Unfortunately, these studies only produced unanimously negative or modest results. We believe that successful and sustainable prevention must contain 3 elements: (1) A relatively intensive and sustained modification of the individual's behavior that appropriately accounts for the multifactorial causes of childhood obesity. (2) A concurrent adaptation of external conditions that enable behavioral modifications. (3) Incorporation of socio-economic and political aspects...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate prevalence, determinants, and clinical outcome implications of reduced functional capacity (FC) in patients with organic mitral regurgitation (MR). BackgroundEvaluation of FC by exercise testing is rarely performed in MR because {{little is known about the}} clinical determinants and outcome implications of FC. MethodsCardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was prospectively performed in 134 asymptomatic patients with organic MR to assess FC (peak oxygen consumption [Vo 2]) simultaneously to Doppler-echocardiographic quantitation of MR (effective regurgitant orifice [ERO]) and left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function. ResultsPeak Vo 2 was 26 ± 6 ml/kg/min (96 ± 16 % of age-predicted), but varied widely (57 % to 145 % of predicted) and was markedly reduced (≤ 84 % of predicted) in 19 % of patients. Although ERO of MR was univariately associated with reduced FC (26 vs. 9 % with ERO ≥ 40 vs. < 40 mm 2), independent determinants of reduced FC were LV diastolic function (higher E/E′ ratio, p = 0. 006), atrial fibrillation (p = 0. 01), and lower forward stroke volume (p = 0. 03). Clinical events (death, heart failure, new atrial fibrillation) and clinical events or surgery were more frequent with than without reduced FC (3 years, 36 ± 14 % vs. 13 ± 4 %, p = 0. 02; and 66 ± 11 % vs. 29 ± 5 %, p = 0. 001, respectively), even adjusting (risk ratios 1. 80 and 1. 54 respectively, both p ≤ 0. 03) for age and ERO. ConclusionsIn asymptomatic organic MR, FC quantitatively assessed by CPET is unexpectedly markedly reduced in one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> four to <b>five</b> patients. Reduced FC is independently determined by consequences rather than severity of MR and predicts increased subsequent clinical events. Therefore, CPET frequently reveals functional limitations not detected clinically and is an important tool in managing patients with organic MR...|$|R

25|$|The high {{concentration}} of population around Mbanza Kongo and its outskirts {{played a critical role}} in the centralization of Kongo. The capital was a densely settled area in an otherwise sparsely populated region where rural population densities probably did not exceed 5 persons per square kilometer. Early Portuguese travelers described Mbanza Kongo as a large city, the size of the Portuguese town of Évora as it was in 1491. By the end of the sixteenth century, Kongo's population was probably close to half a million people in a core region of some 130,000 square kilometers. By the early seventeenth century the city and its hinterland had a population of around 100,000, or one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> inhabitants in the Kingdom (according to baptismal statistics compiled by Jesuit priests). This concentration allowed resources, soldiers and surplus foodstuffs to be readily available at the request of the king. This made the king overwhelmingly powerful and caused the kingdom to become highly centralized.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1918, {{with the}} ending of the German Spring Offensive, the Australian troops started to conduct {{offensive}} patrols into no man's land. As the front lines after the Spring Offensive lacked fortifications and were non-continuous, it was discovered that the patrols could infiltrate the German outpost line and approach the outposts from behind. In this manner, the outposts could be taken quickly, and with minimal force. This tactic was first reported as being used on 5 April 1918 by the Australian 58th Battalion, 15th Brigade, 5th Division. However, within a few weeks all five of the Australian divisions (and the New Zealand Division) were using the tactic, with some units using the tactic more than others (for example, the 3rd Division conducted the tactic on three <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> days in April).

25|$|The 1963 Corvette Sting Ray {{not only}} had a new design, but also newfound {{handling}} prowess. The Sting Ray was also a somewhat lighter Corvette, so acceleration improved despite unchanged horsepower. For the 1963 model year, 21,513 units would be built, which was up 50 percent from the record-setting 1962 version. Production was divided almost evenly between the convertible and the new coupe – 10,919 and 10,594, respectively – {{and more than half}} the convertibles were ordered with the optional lift-off hardtop. Nevertheless, the coupe wouldn't sell as well again throughout the Sting Ray years. In fact, not until 1969 (by which time the coupe came with removable T-tops) did the closed Corvette sell better than the open one. Equipment installations for 1963 began reflecting the market's demand for more civility in sporting cars. The power brake option went into 15 percent of production, power steering into 12 percent. On the other hand, only 278 buyers specified the $421.80 air conditioning; leather upholstery – a mere $80.70 – was ordered on only 1,114 cars. The cast aluminum knock-off wheels, manufactured for Chevy by Kelsey-Hayes, cost $322.80 a set, but few buyers checked off that option. However, almost 18,000 Sting Rays left St. Louis with the four-speed manual gearbox – better than four <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five.</b>|$|E
