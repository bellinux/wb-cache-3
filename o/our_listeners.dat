40|$|A major {{limitation}} of today's computer games is the shallowness of interactions with non-player characters.

The dependent variable was the listener response; fixed factors were language (EP, Italian), stop duration (100, 125 and 150  ms), contextual vowel duration (100, 125 and 150  ms) and voicing maintenance percentage during stop closure (0 %, 12.5 %, 25 %, 37.5 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 %) and their interactions. All numerical fixed factors were centred (z-transformation). Listener was chosen as random factor.|$|R

40|$|When Java {{developers}} need {{to improve}} {{the performance of their}} applications, they usually use one of the many existing profilers for Java. These profilers generally capture a profile that represents the execution time spent in each method. The developer can thus focus her optimization efforts on the methods that consume the most time. In this paper we argue that this type of profile is insufficient for tuning interactive applications. Interactive applications respond to user events, such as mouse clicks and key presses. The perceived performance of interactive applications {{is directly related to the}} response time of the program. In this paper we present listener latency profiling, a profiling approach with two distinctive characteristics. First, we call it latency profiling because it helps developers to find long latency operations. Second, we call it listener profiling because it abstracts away from method-level profiles to compute the latency of the various listeners. This allows a developer to reason about performance with respect to listeners, also called observers, the high level abstraction at the core of any interactive Java application.

50|$|Creativity drives {{grammatical}} change. This presupposes {{a certain}} attitude {{on the part}} of listeners. Instead of punishing deviations from accepted usage, listeners must prioritize imaginative mind-reading. Imaginative creativity—emitting a leopard alarm when no leopard was present, for example—is not the kind of behavior which, say, vervet monkeys would appreciate or reward. Creativity and reliability are incompatible demands; for 'Machiavellian' primates as for animals generally, the overriding pressure is to demonstrate reliability. If humans escape these constraints, it is because in <b>our</b> case, <b>listeners</b> are primarily interested in mental states.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} conversational recounting about {{experiences as a}} potential mechanism by which people socially construct themselves and their worlds over the life span and the resulting implications for understanding adult development. Two principles governing conversational recounting of past events are proposed: coconstruction (the joint influences of speakers and contexts on conversational reconstructions of past events) and consistency (the influence of a conversational reconstruction on subsequent memory). Operating together, the principles provide an account for how autobiographical memory is socially constructed. In addition, the principles may illuminate how conversations about the past can influence the development of identity in adulthood. Conversation is {{to be thought of}} as creating a social world just as causality generates a physical one. (Harr 6, 1983, p. 65). We live our lives immersed in talk, providing others with stories of what happens to us and ideas about what we think our experi-ences mean. We all remember times when a conversation made a big difference in how we understood an experience, where <b>our</b> <b>listener</b> provided new insights or perspectives, or, in telling, we realized something about ourselves. We may be less aware of more subtle influences of social context on our everyday talk about experiences or of the ways that conversations we have about our experiences shape our memory for our own past (see Vorauer & Miller, 1997). In this article, I explore conversations about expe-riences as a way in which we socially construct our past and our identities. On a metatheoretical level, my goal is to accommodate both social constructivist and more traditional approaches within psy-chology while developing an account of autobiographical remem-bering and adult development. The resulting framework is rooted in research on memory and language (H. H. Clark, 1996; Engel...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} bottom-up versus top-down sensory inputs to auditory learning {{are not well}} established.

A third, control group did not receive any training. Only the FD-train group improved on a FD probe following training, whereas all groups improved on ID following training. However, only the ID-train group also showed changes in performance accuracy as a function of interval with training on the ID task. These findings suggest that top-down, dimension-specific attention can direct auditory learning, even when this learning is not reflected in conventional performance measures of threshold change...|$|R
