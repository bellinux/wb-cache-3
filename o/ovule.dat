25|$|Each carpel has a broad two-crested stigma {{on a short}} style, {{and usually}} {{contains}} a single <b>ovule.</b> The integument – the covering {{on the outside of}} the <b>ovule</b> – is in the form of a long coiled tube, an unusual feature in flowering plants. The fruit which forms after fertilization is a fleshy drupe, to which the stigma remains attached.|$|E
25|$|Common {{causes of}} empty seed are lack of pollination, {{abortion}} of the <b>ovule,</b> and insect damage.|$|E
25|$|The chalaza, {{the base}} of the <b>ovule</b> {{opposite}} the micropyle, where integument and nucellus are joined together.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>ovules</b> per carpel varies widely in Ochnaceae. Medusagyne and Quiinoideae have two <b>ovules</b> per carpel. In Testulea {{and in a}} clade of four genera in Sauvagesieae (Godoya, Rhytidanthera, Krukoviella, and Cespedesia), the number of <b>ovules</b> is 100 to 200 per carpel. For the {{remainder}} of Sauvagesieae, except Euthemis, and for Philacra and Luxemburgia, the number of <b>ovules</b> per carpel ranges from four to 50. Euthemis has two <b>ovules</b> per carpel.|$|R
40|$|Mutualisms are {{interspecific}} {{interactions in}} which both players benefit. Explaining their maintenance is problematic, because cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. Monoecious figs (Ficus) are pollinated by host-specific wasps (Agaonidae), whose larvae gall <b>ovules</b> in their "fruits'' (syconia). Female pollinating wasps oviposit directly into Ficus <b>ovules</b> from inside the receptive syconium. Across Ficus species, there is a widely documented segregation of pollinator galls in inner <b>ovules</b> and seeds in outer <b>ovules.</b> This pattern suggests that wasps avoid, or are prevented from ovipositing into, outer <b>ovules,</b> and this results in mutualism stability. However, the mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer <b>ovules</b> remain unknown. We report that in Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer <b>ovules</b> are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. Parasitism risk decreases towards {{the centre of the}} syconium, where inner <b>ovules</b> provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. We suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer <b>ovules,</b> and by forcing wasps to focus on a subset of <b>ovules,</b> reduces their galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may therefore contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defences against pollinator oviposition, or physiological constraints on pollinators that prevent oviposition in all available <b>ovules...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) <b>ovules</b> {{grown in}} a defined {{nutrient}} medium undergo normal morphogenesis, including fiber production. In identical medium lacking boron, <b>ovules</b> callus and accumulate brown substances. Boron deficiency-like symptoms were induced by 6 -azauracil and 6 -azauridine in <b>ovules</b> growing in boron-sufficient media. Other nucleoside base analogs either reduced or {{had no effect}} on over-all growth, but did not cause typical boron-deficient callus growth of cotton <b>ovules.</b> Orotic acid and uracil countered the effects of 6 -azauracil. Actinomycin D, fluorodeoxyuridine, and ethidium bromide reduced not only fiber production on <b>ovules</b> growing in boron-sufficient media but also callusing of <b>ovules</b> in boron-deficient media...|$|R
25|$|The funicle (funiculus, funiculi) or seed stalk which {{attaches}} the <b>ovule</b> to {{the placenta}} and hence ovary or fruit wall, at the pericarp.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, W. A. Bell {{studied the}} Sydney Coalﬁeld in Nova Scotia, and {{suggested}} that the large fossilized seeds called Trigonocarpus noeggerati could be the ovules of Macroneuropteris scheuchzeri. Erwin Zodrow in 2002 also noted that this <b>ovule</b> fossil was commonly in physical association with M. scheuchzeri foliage. Specimens of Trigonocarpus can be quite large. The largest recorded was 10cm and has been noted as the largest <b>ovule</b> produced by a non-angiosperm seed-plant. Some have noted that the large size of these seeds may have allowed them to float, like small coconuts, to be distributed in these coastal mangrove-like areas as well as inland wetland forests. Their three-part symmetry gives them their name. A tube-like opening at the top brought pollen into the <b>ovule.</b> Pachytesta is a term that is also used {{for this type of}} seed/ovule.|$|E
25|$|The micropyle, a small pore or {{opening in}} {{the apex of the}} {{integument}} of the <b>ovule</b> where the pollen tube usually enters during the process of fertilization.|$|E
2500|$|The single living {{member of}} the Ginkgophyta, Ginkgo biloba {{produces}} pollen strobili, but the <b>ovules</b> are typically borne in pairs {{at the end of}} a stem, not in a strobilus. When there are more than a pair of <b>ovules</b> in [...] "G. biloba", however, or when fossil taxa bearing large numbers of <b>ovules</b> are examined, it is clear that the paired <b>ovules</b> in the extant species are a highly reduced strobilus.|$|R
5000|$|The small <b>ovules</b> (fossil genus Callospermarion) {{with the}} {{characteristic}} secretory structures have an integument {{that was only}} fused to the nucellus in the basal part of the <b>ovules</b> and so superficially resemble medullosalean <b>ovules.</b> Unlike the Medullosales, the <b>ovules</b> appear to be bilaterally symmetrical, although details of the vasculature suggest they were in fact evolved from plants with radially symmetrical <b>ovules.</b> The apical part of the nucellus has a lagenostome-like projection, which breaks down to form the pollen chamber. The full ontogeny of these <b>ovules</b> has been worked out in some detail {{and seems to be}} essentially similar to that seen in modern-day gymnosperms, including the use of a pollen drop to help capture and draw the pollen into the pollen chamber and a pollen tube to deliver the generative nucleus. [...] The <b>ovules</b> were borne on the underside of pinnules that did not differ significantly in form from those of the purely vegetative fronds.|$|R
50|$|In Ochneae, Lophira has 4 to 50 <b>ovules</b> per carpel. In the subtribes Elvasiinae and Ochninae, {{the number}} of <b>ovules</b> per carpel is one.|$|R
25|$|In gymnosperms, the <b>ovule</b> is not {{contained}} in a carpel, but exposed {{on the surface of}} a dedicated support organ, such as the scale of a cone, so that the penetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary. Details of the process vary according to the division of gymnosperms in question. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the <b>ovule,</b> whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm that are unable to swim but are conveyed to the egg along a pollen tube.|$|E
25|$|The D {{function}} genes {{were discovered}} in 1995. These genes are MADS-box proteins {{and they have a}} function that is distinct from those previously described, although they have a certain homology with C function genes. These genes are called FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN7 (FBP7) and FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN1L (FBP1l). It was found that, in Petunia, they are involved {{in the development of the}} <b>ovule.</b> Equivalent genes were later found in Arabidopsis, where they are also involved in controlling the development of carpels and the <b>ovule</b> and even with structures related to seed dispersal.|$|E
25|$|A scar {{also may}} {{remain on the}} seed coat, called the hilum, where the seed was {{attached}} to the ovary wall by the funicle. Just below it is a small pore, representing the micropyle of the <b>ovule.</b>|$|E
50|$|The ovary (from Latin ovum meaning egg), is the {{enlarged}} basal portion {{which contains}} placentas, ridges of tissue bearing {{one or more}} <b>ovules</b> (integumented megasporangia). The placentas and/or <b>ovule(s)</b> may be born on the gynoecial appendages or less frequently on the floral apex. The chamber in which the <b>ovules</b> develop is called a locule (or sometimes cell).|$|R
40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} implicate ammonium {{as an important}} factor in the growth and development of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) <b>ovules</b> cultured in vitro. For example, <b>ovules</b> cultured at 28 C require indoleacetic acid (IAA) and either ammonium or gibberellic acid (GA 3) in the medium for fiber development, whereas <b>ovules</b> cultured at 34 C require only IAA. Because of this effect of ammonium supply, it seemed possible that hormones or increased temperature were also promoting the availability of reduced nitrogen by induction of increased nitrate reductase activity in the <b>ovules.</b> This possibility was tested...|$|R
40|$|The <b>ovules,</b> {{seeds and}} pollen grains of 24 Rafflesia {{specimens}} from nine species were examined. The <b>ovules</b> and seeds of all specimens showed similar shapes and structures. Rafflesia <b>ovules</b> are J-shaped and incompletely anatropous, while the seeds are chestnut-shaped. The pollen grains are small (10 - 25 µm in diameter), prolate-spheroidal and subprolate, monoporate, {{with a smooth}} surface and no ornamentation...|$|R
25|$|During germination, {{the tube}} cell elongates into a pollen tube. In the flower, the pollen tube then grows towards the <b>ovule</b> where it {{discharges}} the sperm {{produced in the}} pollen grain for fertilization. The germinated pollen grain with its two sperm cells is the mature male microgametophyte of these plants.|$|E
25|$|The Anthophyte Theory {{was based}} on the {{observation}} that a gymnospermic family Gnetaceae has a flower-like <b>ovule.</b> It has partially developed vessels as found in the angiosperms, and the megasporangium is covered by three envelopes, like the ovary structure of angiosperm flowers. However, many other lines of evidence show that gnetophytes are not related to angiosperms.|$|E
25|$|In non-flowering seed plants, pollen germinates in {{the pollen}} chamber, located beneath the micropyle, {{underneath}} the integuments of the <b>ovule.</b> A pollen tube is produced, which grows into the nucellus to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells. Sperm cells of Pinophyta and Gnetophyta are without flagella, and are {{carried by the}} pollen tube, while those of Cycadophyta and Ginkgophyta have many flagella.|$|E
5000|$|Most lyginopteridalean <b>ovules</b> were radiospermic. [...] The only notable {{exceptions}} were a distinctive group of Mississippian-age lyginopteridaleams that had platyspermic <b>ovules</b> and {{are referred to}} the fossil family the Eospermaceae.|$|R
50|$|In propagation, {{the pollen}} tubes of Iris tenax reach the Iris tenuis <b>ovules</b> in 30 hours, whereas the pollen tubes of Iris tenuis require 50 hours {{to reach the}} Iris tenax <b>ovules.</b>|$|R
50|$|As the Lyginopteridales are the earliest-known gymnosperms, and the {{development}} of <b>ovules</b> was one of the key innovations that enabled seed plants eventually to dominate land vegetation, the evolution of lyginopteridalean <b>ovules</b> has attracted considerable interest from palaeobotanists. The most important work on these early <b>ovules</b> was by the British palaeobotanist Albert Long, based mainly on early Mississippian, anatomically preserved fossils from Scotland (UK).|$|R
25|$|Gnetophyta {{consists}} of three genera, Ephedra, Gnetum and Welwitschia. All three are typically dioecious, although some Ephedra species exhibit monoecy. In contrast to the conifers, which have simple pollen strobili and compound seed strobili, gnetophytes have both compound pollen and seed strobili. The seed strobili of Ephedra and Gnetum are reduced, with Ephedra producing only two ovules per strobilus and Gnetum a single <b>ovule.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{common terms}} for seeds and fruit do not {{correspond}} to the botanical classifications. In culinary terminology, a fruit is usually any sweet-tasting plant part, especially a botanical fruit; a nut is any hard, oily, and shelled plant product; and a vegetable is any savory or less sweet plant product. However, in botany, a fruit is the ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds, a nut {{is a type of}} fruit and not a seed, and a seed is a ripened <b>ovule.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conifers are heterosporous, {{generating}} {{two different}} types of spores: male microspores and female megaspores. These spores develop on separate male and female sporophylls on separate male and female cones. In the male cones, microspores are produced from microsporocytes by meiosis. The microspores develop into pollen grains, which are male gametophytes. Large amounts of pollen are released and carried by the wind. Some pollen grains will land on a female cone for pollination. The generative cell in the pollen grain divides into two haploid sperm cells by mitosis leading {{to the development of the}} pollen tube. At fertilization, one of the sperm cells unites its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of an egg cell. The female cone develops two <b>ovule,</b> each of which contains haploid haploid megaspores. A megasporocyte is divided by meiosis in each <b>ovule.</b> Each winged pollen grain is a four celled male gametophyte Three of the four cells break down leaving only a single surviving cell which will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte. The female gametophytes grow to produce two or more archegonia, each of which contains an egg. Upon fertilization, the diploid egg will give rise to the embryo, and a seed is produced. The female cone then opens, releasing the seeds which grow to a young seedling.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ovules</b> in {{different}} medullosalean species could vary from maybe 1 cm to over 10 cm long - {{the latter being}} the largest known <b>ovules</b> produced by any non-angiosperm seed-plant. [...] It was traditionally believed that the <b>ovules</b> were borne directly on the fronds, replacing one of the pinnules on the ultimate pinnae. However, {{there is a strong}} possibility that this reconstruction was based on the chance finds of <b>ovules</b> having been preserved just lying on a piece of pinna rather than in organic attachment to it. A number of cases are now coming to light that suggest that the seeds were borne in clusters on relatively slender, branching axes, and that these trusses of <b>ovules</b> would have been produced {{from the top of the}} trunk among the crown of fronds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ovules</b> of Stamnostoma have {{a complex}} apex with plug and cone {{mechanism}} {{for creating a}} chamber for prepollen, as in other Lyginopteridales. Several <b>ovules</b> are borne on an elongate open cupule of bracts.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the self-incompatibility mechanism in Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus. Controlled self- and cross-pollinations were conducted on individual flowers from three mature trees that had self-incompatibility levels of 76, 99 · 6 and 100 %. Flowers were harvested at 4, 6 and 8 weeks after pollination. Embryology was investigated by bright field microscopy on material harvested at 4 and 6 weeks after pollination. Fertilization had taken place at 4 weeks after pollination with zygotes and free nuclear endosperm visible. There was a greater proportion of healthy, fertilized <b>ovules</b> in the cross- compared with the self-pollination treatment, and approx. half the <b>ovules</b> examined from both pollen treatments were not fertilized or were degenerating. By 6 weeks after pollination a few zygotes were starting to divide. The number of healthy, fertilized <b>ovules</b> was still greater in the cross-pollination treatment, but the number of healthy fertilized <b>ovules</b> was lower in both treatments compared with 4 weeks after pollination, and many <b>ovules</b> were degenerating. Fertilized <b>ovules</b> were significantly larger than non-fertilized or degenerating <b>ovules</b> and this difference was detectable by eye at 6 and 8 weeks after pollination. The mechanism of self-incompatibility appears to have both late pre- and post-zygotic components...|$|R
25|$|In {{plants with}} SI, when a pollen grain {{produced}} in a plant reaches a stigma {{of the same}} plant or another plant with a similar genotype, the process of pollen germination, pollen-tube growth, <b>ovule</b> fertilization and embryo development is halted at one of its stages and consequently no seeds are produced. SI {{is one of the}} most important means of preventing inbreeding and promoting the generation of new genotypes in plants, and it is considered as one of the causes for the spread and success of angiosperms on the earth.|$|E
25|$|The female {{determinant}} is a small, extracellular molecule, {{expressed in}} the stigma; {{the identity of the}} male determinant remains elusive, but it is probably some cell membrane receptor. The interaction between male and female determinants transmits a cellular signal into the pollen tube, resulting in strong influx of calcium cations; this interferes with the intracellular concentration gradient of calcium ions which exists inside the pollen tube, essential for its elongation. The influx of calcium ions arrests tube elongation within 1–2 minutes. At this stage, pollen inhibition is still reversible, and elongation can be resumed by applying certain manipulations, resulting in <b>ovule</b> fertilization.|$|E
25|$|In endospermic seeds, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo is the fertilised <b>ovule,</b> an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a scutellum. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.|$|E
40|$|Tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular fruit {{vegetable}} around the world. Seed abortion where in only a small proportion of <b>ovules</b> in an ovary develops into matured seeds, is a wide spread phenomenon in multi-ovulated species. In agriculturally important crops such as chickpea, groundnut, Brassica, pigeon pea and field bean seed abortion substantially reduces their productivity. Tomato genotypes exhibited seed abortion where in only some proportion of <b>ovules</b> developed into matured seeds. Seed abortion in tomato cultivars would increase the cost of hybrid seed production. In this study, we have analyzed 19 genotypes for number of <b>ovules,</b> seed set and seed abortion. Tomato genotypes differed significantly for number of <b>ovules</b> per ovary, seed set per fruit and per cent seed abortion. The <b>ovules,</b> matured seeds and seed abortion ranged from 52 to 412 per ovary; 50. 90 to 240. 76 per fruit and 6. 06 to 24. 44 per cent respectively. Strong positive correlation was observed in genotypes with higher number of <b>ovules</b> showed higher percentage of seed abortion...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} culture technique permitting to grow cotton embryos from fertilization to germination with minimum of manipulation and maximum yield of viable plants. During the study, conditions were optimized for transfer of zygotic <b>ovules</b> after post anthesis and selection of media {{for the growth of}} <b>ovules.</b> Forty-eight hours post anthesis was selected as the most appropriate time since > 50 % of <b>ovules</b> were found alive, floating and developing. Also, ST medium was found suitable as it supported the growth very well and <b>ovules</b> continued to grow till the end of 10 weeks. This in-ovule technique has several advantages over culture of isolated embryos. The aseptic removal of 48 h old <b>ovules</b> from the ovaries was rapid and efficient and minimum damage was observed in this technique. No change of medium was needed during the entire culture period. This technique was used {{for the first time as}} a means of cotton transformation using Sonication assisted Agrobacterium mediated transformation (SAAT) method while a marker gene was used to transform cotton <b>ovules...</b>|$|R
50|$|The fitness {{requirements}} for androdioecy to arise and sustain itself are theoretically so improbable {{that it was}} long considered that such systems do not exist. Particularly, males and hermaphrodites {{have to have the}} same fitness, in other words the same number of offspring, in order to be maintained. However, males only have offspring by fertilizing eggs or <b>ovules</b> of hermaphrodites, while hermaphrodites have offspring both through fertilizing eggs or <b>ovules</b> of other hermaphrodites and their own <b>ovules.</b> This means that all else being equal, males have to fertilize twice as many eggs or <b>ovules</b> as hermaphrodites {{to make up for the}} lack of female reproduction.|$|R
