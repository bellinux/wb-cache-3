5|$|Although {{some historians}} have {{identified}} Garrard {{as a member}} of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, Kentucky, from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the Club's official membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion <b>of</b> <b>Useful</b> Knowledge for membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion <b>of</b> <b>Useful</b> Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might {{be understood as}} a physical principle that could be described in terms of the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate <b>of</b> <b>useful</b> energy transformation.|$|E
5|$|The dust {{present in}} the {{interstellar}} medium is opaque to visual light.

Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier {{in the history of the}} Universe. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number <b>of</b> <b>useful</b> portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy.|$|E

An immediately example of the utilization <b>of</b> the <b>useful</b> movement model it constitutes the drawing of the movement diagrams, which it illustrates the dynamics aspect <b>of</b> the <b>useful</b> movement. Like application, {{by means of the}} SIMULINK model they are traced, {{on the basis of the}} traction and braking characteristics and of the imposed conditions of the route, the movement diagram of the high-speed train.

5|$|After {{a return}} to the United States in mid-1970, Yancey entered {{inactive}} status at Norfolk on 1 October of that year. The ship was decommissioned at Norfolk on 20 January 1971, and entered the James River berthing area of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Yancey was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1977. The vessel remained in the James River fleet until 16 August 1984 when she was withdrawn to be stripped <b>of</b> <b>useful</b> equipment by the U.S. Navy. She re-entered the fleet one year later, on 28 August 1985, but was withdrawn for the final time on 15 December 1989 to be prepared for sinking as an artificial reef.|$|E
5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development <b>of</b> <b>useful</b> abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.|$|E
5|$|German foreign {{intelligence}} gathering, large-scale Allied trench raids and observed troop concentrations west of Arras {{made it clear}} to the Germans that a spring offensive near Arras was being planned. In February 1917, a German-born Canadian soldier deserted to the German side and helped confirm many of the suspicions held by the Germans, providing them with a great deal <b>of</b> <b>useful</b> information. By March 1917, the German forces were aware that a major attack was imminent and would include operations aimed at capturing Vimy Ridge. General of Infantry Ernst August Marx von Bachmeister, commanding the German 79th Reserve Division, reported in late-March that he believed the Canadian Corps was moving into an echelon formation and were preparing for a major attack. The Germans quickly developed plans to launch a pre-emptive operation, following the adage that the best defence is a good offence, intent on capturing the northern section of the Zouave Valley along the northernmost portion of the Canadian front. Heavy Canadian Corps artillery fire ultimately prevented the Germans from executing their pre-emptive attack.|$|E

5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network <b>of</b> <b>useful</b> contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{was one of}} 37 men {{who founded}} the Kentucky Society for the Promotion <b>of</b> <b>Useful</b> Knowledge in 1787. Although he did not {{participate}} in any of the ten statehood conventions that sought to separate Kentucky from Virginia, he supported the idea in principle. When Woodford County was formed from the part of Fayette County that included Scott's fledgling settlement, Scott declined appointment as the new county's lieutenant. He did, however, consent to be a candidate to represent the county in the Virginia House of Delegates. During his single term, he served on the committee on privileges and election and on several special committees, including one that recommended that President George Washington supply a military guard at Big Bone Lick to facilitate the establishment of a saltworks there.|$|E
5|$|Shelby {{returned}} to Kentucky in April 1783, settling at Boonesborough. He married Susannah Hart on April 19, 1783; {{the couple had}} eleven children. Their eldest daughter, Sarah, married Dr. Ephraim McDowell, and the youngest daughter, Letitia, married future Kentucky secretary of state Charles Stewart Todd. On November 1, 1783, {{the family moved to}} Lincoln County, near Knob Lick, and occupied land awarded to Shelby for his military service. Shelby was named one of the first trustees of Transylvania Seminary (later Transylvania University) in 1783, and on December 1, 1787, founded the Kentucky Society for the Promotion <b>of</b> <b>Useful</b> Knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, in 1791, {{with his}} ideas for {{manufacturing}} being a major influence, Hamilton, along with Coxe and several entrepreneurs from New York and Philadelphia helped form the Society for the Establishment <b>of</b> <b>Useful</b> Manufactures, a private industrial corporation. In May 1792, the directors decided to scope out The Passaic Falls. On July 4, 1792, The society directors met Philip Schuyler at Abraham Godwin's {{hotel on the}} Passaic River, where they would lead a tour prospecting the area for the national manufactory. It was originally suggested that they dig mile long trenches and build the factories away from the falls, but Hamilton argued {{that it would be}} too costly and laborious.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} medicinal plants including opium are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of ethnobotany to search for pharmacologically active substances in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds <b>of</b> <b>useful</b> compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|E
