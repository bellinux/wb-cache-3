25|$|Recent {{decades have}} revived his secular cantatas and what <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> 'secular oratorios' or 'concert operas'. Of the former, Ode for St. Cecilia's Day (1739) (set to texts by John Dryden) and Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to {{classical}} mythology for subjects, producing such works as Acis and Galatea (1719), Hercules (1745) and Semele (1744). These works {{have a close}} kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes performed onstage by small chamber ensembles. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, {{in addition to his}} renown as instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of Matt Dennis's Everything Happens To Me (June Christy, vocal) {{was not done}} under Kenton's aegis but with Christy's later to be husband Bob Cooper as the leader just after the second AFM recording ban. This {{is added to the}} CD and shows the continuity of Graettinger's writing and recorded works for Capitol; the chart had originally been done for the full Kenton instrumentation but was never recorded. The small 11 piece group (to include violin and cello) provides some real insight to the inner workings of Graettinger's writing. The aesture nature of his arrangement and use of pantonality (<b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> it atonality in spots) makes one wonder how June Christy is able to pick off the 9th of the F minor chord {{at the top of the}} tune; there is basically no clue given by Graettinger as to what pitch is coming for the singer (the glue that holds this together is the Bb pedal point at the bottom). Interestingly, after first stating the entire tune there is a tutti ensemble section that gives way to the 'last 'A' of the form'. Also, his harmonic transitions between sections are key in their departure from the tune compared to the established harmony while June Christy sings.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} also been noted by scholar Philip Simpson as {{highlighting}} [...] "the divide between the underprivileged and privileged classes," [...] {{as well as for}} its inversion of commonly-held beliefs about violence in urban areas and pastoral ethics: [...] "The Strangers, as many horror films do... undermines the conventional notion of rural society as a simpler, crime-free place. <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> the narrative sensibility informing The Strangers 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. Of course, it may be that provincial violence is a result of contamination, or in other words that the kind of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by Louis Wirth." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an essay}} in 1999, he {{identified}} {{what he saw as}} the harmful role played by sentimentality in a case involving Stephen Lawrence. Lawrence, a young black British man, was murdered and the subsequent case was mired in accusations of racism among the investigating police. Dalrymple wrote that [...] "the response to the Stephen Lawrence case is another example of how the rule of law is to be supplanted by the rule of sentiment—and it is yet one more instance of what <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> the Dianafication of British public life, in which transitory popular enthusiasm trumps venerable tradition". In a 2004 essay, he analysed how sentimentality towards children was closely linked with violence and neglect, particularly in the poorest sections of British society: [...] "The upbringing of children in much of Britain is a witches' brew of sentimentality, brutality, and neglect, in which overindulgence in the latest fashions, toys, or clothes, and a television in the bedroom are regarded as the highest—indeed only—manifestations of tender concern for a child's welfare".|$|E

[...] If Japan took control of China, {{it was believed that}} inevitably, Japan would then attack Britain's Asian colonies plus the Dominions of Australia and New Zealand. As such, the Chamberlain government, unwilling {{to go to war with}} Japan, was not prepared to accept a Japanese victory over China either. From the viewpoint of London, it was much preferable that Japan remain embroiled in China than attack the British Empire. The British Ambassador in China, Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr reported to London that unless Britain gave China loans to continue the war, the economic collapse of Nationalist China that the Japanese were banking on might very well occur.|$|E
2500|$|Barrie {{also had}} friendships with other children, both before {{he met the}} Davies boys and after they had grown up, and there has since been {{speculation}} that Barrie was a paedophile. One source for the speculation is a scene in the novel The Little White Bird, in which the protagonist helps a small boy undress for bed, and at the boy's request they sleep in the same bed. However, {{there is no evidence}} that Barrie had sexual contact with children, nor that he was suspected of it at the time. Nico, the youngest of the brothers, denied as an adult that Barrie ever behaved inappropriately. [...] "I don't believe that Uncle Jim ever experienced what <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> 'a stirring in the undergrowth' for anyone—man, woman, or child", he stated. [...] "He was an innocent—which is why he could write Peter Pan." [...] His relationships with the surviving Davies boys continued well beyond their childhood and adolescence.|$|E
2500|$|Six of Bishop's {{first eight}} novels are set on other worlds (the {{other two are}} {{the part of his}} UrNu {{sequence}} of stories.) Critic and author John Clute writes that [...] "…his early stories and novels display considerable intellectual complexity, and do not shirk the downbeat implications of their anthropological treatment of aliens and alienating milieux…" [...] In his major essay on these early novels, author Ian Watson writes [...] "Michael Bishop is both an exoticist and a moralist. [...] He is sometimes guilty, in the first respect, of a certain over-writing – underlying exotic venue by exotic diction – though the two become more organically integrated as his work progresses; and in the second respect of what <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> an over-scrupulousness on the part of his characters and his perceived attitude to them… These, however, are merely the consequence of aspiration and conscience; and as more of Bishop's work has appeared – and his reputation has grown – he has shown…a more coherent melding of exotic vision, ethics and style." ...|$|E

2500|$|During his 1904 {{retreat from}} Tibet, Younghusband had a mystical {{experience}} which suffused him with [...] "love for the whole world" [...] and convinced him that [...] "men at heart are divine." [...] This conviction was tinged with regret for the invasion of Tibet, and eventually, in 1936, profound religious convictions invited a founder's address to the World Congress of Faiths (in imitation of the World Parliament of Religions). Younghusband published {{a number of books}} with what <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> New Age themes, with titles like The Gleam: Being an account of the life of Nija Svabhava, pseud. (1920); Mother World (in Travail for the Christ that is to be) (1924); and Life in the Stars: An Exposition of the View that on some Planets of some Stars exist Beings higher than Ourselves, and on one a World-Leader, the Supreme Embodiment of the Eternal Spirit which animates the Whole (1927). The latter drew the admiration of Lord Baden-Powell, the Boy Scouts founder. Key concepts consisted of the central belief that would {{come to be known as}} the Gaia hypothesis, pantheism, and a Christlike [...] "world leader" [...] living on the planet [...] "Altair" [...] (or [...] "Stellair"), exploring the theology of spiritualism, and guidance by means of telepathy.|$|E
