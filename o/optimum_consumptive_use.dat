Air temperatures were higher and vapor pressures were lower at the arid sites. Use of air temperatures and dewpoint estimates from arid sites caused an overestimation of ET, by 17 % (210 mm) over the irrigation season.

Application of the <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> concept to water rights administration and water resources planning, however, required a wirtten reference.

40|$|Economic {{efficiency}} {{criteria are}} used to optimally allocate irrigation water in a closed river basin (Sevier River). The Basin is geographically divided into four subbasins. Liner programming model were developed {{for each of the}} four areas and used to generate value of marginal product schedules by parametric variation of water during the late irrigation season (after July 1). Differences in value of marginal product for average annual water deliveries were indications of a malallocation of late season water. A reallocation involving 28 percent of the restraining input (water) would increase net farm incomes (returns to capital, labor, and management) an estimated 10 percent. All water diverted to cropland, however, is not used consumptively by crops, but finds its way back to the river bia return flows and is available for rediversion downstream. Total <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> is a function of the number of times return flow from an initial acre foot of diversion can be rediverted. This assumes, a priori, an allocation should be based on a net stream depletion concept where <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> values for water are used. To accomplish this requires an economic-cum-hydrologic model which takes into account the physical response by crops to different amounts of water application and <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> plus the timing and amounts of water available during the hydrologic cycle. Conservation practices that increase farm efficiency [...] increase the amount of <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> from a given diversion or water right [...] will reduce return flows and affect the 2 ̆ 2 tenure 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 security 2 ̆ 2 of downstream water rights.

40|$|Irrigation {{agriculture}} {{is the largest}} use of water (~ 80 %) in the United States ('Irrigation and Water Use', 2016) A combination of irrigation and precipitation infiltrates through the Earth's subsurface and represents the primary inputs to an agricultural field's groundwater system. This water propagates down from the surface, with some of it recharging the underlying groundwater storage as return flow. The difference {{between the amount of}} irrigation water applied and the return flow to the aquifer, represents the <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> of the system. The alterations in the quality and distribution of water from groundwater pumping and irrigation places greater emphasis on the need to understand the connection between agricultural consumption and subsurface groundwater flux. Temperature fluctuations in the Earth's shallow subsurface are mainly governed by spatial and temporal variations in temperature at the ground surface (Hatch et al., 2006). These temperature signals at depth are primarily controlled by advection, dispersion, and thermal conduction. It has been shown for streambeds that when temperature propagates through the subsurface, it is a nonlinear function of fluid velocity, the frequency of the surface temperature variations, and the sediment and fluid thermal properties (Stallman, 1965). This information has been useful for understanding fluxes for saturated conditions such as in stream systems, but has not yet been applied to understand <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> in unsaturated conditions such as in agricultural systems. Temperature propagation in unsaturated conditions is different than saturated conditions due to changes in soil and thermal properties. Previous models have had difficulty estimating groundwater fluxes for some unsaturated conditions. This study experiments with the possibility of using a combination of MATLAB and HYDRUS 1 D to infer unsaturated groundwater fluxes, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and saturated water content. One application of this type of flux estimation could be the inference of root water uptake and the <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> of an agricultural system. The method is designed to calculate root water uptake under steady-state conditions; and therefore might have limitations for quantifying <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> in field applications. It is beneficial to research the <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> in agricultural systems in order to gain understanding of the effects of irrigation on the total flux in groundwater storage.

Furthermore, A 2 scenario predicted greater reduction in wheat yield, compared with B 2 scenario in the year of 2038. Likewise...|$|R
40|$|Simulation of {{the effect}} of {{irrigation}} water management on cotton yield and its <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> was done using data of six years field trials planted at Beni Sweif and Demiatte locations. Cotton was planted at Beni Sweif for four growing season (1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001) and at Demiatte for two growing seasons (1999 and 2002). Cotton was irrigated with either fresh or drainage water at the two locations. Yield-Stress model was calibrated and validated using the yield and <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> of those field trials. Then, the model was used to predict cotton yield and <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> under deficit irrigation (80, 70, 60 and 50 % of full irrigation). The results of the simulation showed that, at Beni Swief, there is a high potentiality for irrigation water saving corresponding to 30 % of the applied full irrigation with only yield losses not exceeding the 2 % under both fresh and drainage irrigation water. Whereas, at Demiatte, 20 % saving in irrigation water reduced cotton yield by about 5 % average over the two growing seasons under both fresh and drainage irrigation water. However, the point that should be clearly identified is to what extent the applied water can be reduced without exerting harmful effects on the cotton yield...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 1991 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 19 - 20, 1991, Athens, Georgia. Allocations for <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> of Chattahoochee River waters {{have led}} to a myriad of legal issues. Federal and state {{statutes}} and case law are conflicting. Complicating the matter are political considerations among the three states involved. The need for identification of the issues has been stimulated by the Corps of Engineers' proposal to divert a portion of the Buford project waters from non-consumptive use in hydropower generation to <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> as municipal water supply. The implementation of this proposal will arguably {{have a significant impact on}} downstream users. Three questions evolve from the proposal. First, is there an ascertainable limit to <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> of Chattahoochee waters and is that limit being approached? Second, what political entities have the power, or the right, to allocate <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> of the Chattahoochee River waters? Finally, what are the mechanisms for such allocation and which mechanism will provide equitable allocation amongst the various users? This paper concentrates on answering the last two questions.

40|$|Landowners {{and game}} reserve {{managers}} are often {{faced with the}} decision whether to undertake consumptive (such as hunting) and/or non-consumptive (such as tourism) use of wildlife resources on their properties. Here a theoretical model {{was used to examine}} cases where the game reserve management allocated the amount of land devoted to hunting (trophy hunting) and tourism, based on three scenarios: (1) hunting is separated from tourism but wildlife is shared; (2) hunting and tourism co-exist; and (3) hunting and tourism are separated by a fence. The <b>consumptive</b> and non-consumptive <b>uses</b> are not mutually exclusive; careful planning is needed to ensure that multiple management objectives can be met. Further, the analysis indicates that the two uses may be undertaken in the same area. Whether they are spatially, or temporally separated depends on the magnitude of the <b>consumptive</b> <b>use.</b> When <b>consumptive</b> <b>use</b> is not dominant, the two are compatible in the same shared area, provided the wildlife population is sufficiently large...|$|R
