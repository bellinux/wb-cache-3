40|$|Covert timing {{channels}} {{have been}} considered a significant threat in multi-level systems (MLS) because of their capability in aiding information leakage across level boundaries leading to security policy violations. However, their threat in general purpose systems has not been considered in much detail. In fact, under the commonly assumed threat model, covert timing channels are only induced into a system after the host software or OS has been compromised. As a result, much of the effort is focused on protecting this subversion rather than explicitly addressing the problem of covert timing channels. ^ In this dissertation, we show that this model takes a rather conservative view of the capabilities of covert timing channels and understates the threat they pose in general purpose systems. We describe how, in addition to hiding information leakage, covert timing channels can act as mechanisms that allow sensitive information captured at one system layer to traverse across various hardware/software boundaries within a system, eventually onto the network. This property allows the covert timing channel mechanism to not {{be a part of}} the host OS or software, making their subversion unnecessary. More importantly, it is possible to induce covert network timing channels which do not require an attacker to control the host 2 ̆ 7 s network <b>output</b> <b>subsystem</b> (via software or by compromising hardware). This allows covert timing channels to leak sensitive information over a network under conditions that would usually be assumed to be hostile for this purpose. The central thesis of this work is that covert timing channels are a threat to the security of general purpose networked system. Towards that end, we focus on showing that an attacker, through creative placement of a covert channel source outside the host 2 ̆ 7 s usual trusted computing base (TCB), can create covert timing channels which can aid in the exfiltration of sensitive data over a network. Specifically, we build and analyze two covert network timing channels which can leak secrets over a network without compromising the host OS or its software. Finally, we describe techniques to hide the presence of these superimposed network timing channels from network monitors. ...|$|E

The consumers it targeted as end users ranged from the middle to the lower classes, who were very sensitive to price fluctuations. To win the sale competition, the company was applying a strategy of cost leadership enabling it to set prices lower than those offered by its competitors. To secure profits despite the lower prices, it had to keep the principal costs of production down as low as possible. The research used a descriptive method to describe the problems the Surabaya Glory Motor company {{had to deal with}} in the application of a manufacturing information system. The data were gathered thought interviews, study documents, and observations. The results of the analysis indicated that the system preferred so far had led to failure to keep the confirmation of delivery time agreed with buyers. Delays in obtaining confirmation of consignment dates was attributed to the lack of employees able to ensure rapid procurement of goods. Difficulty in identifying correct names of products for the compilation of a purchase order, inconsistent quality of products, frequent overstock and stockout, dualism in job descriptions lowered job satisfication among employees. Discussions {{in the course of this}} research had produced an improved design of a model of manufacturing information system suitable to support the application of the cost leadership strategy. The newly designed model was meant to help the company solve the problems it was facing. By this arrangement, data fed to the database were then queried and normalized by several stages generating a subsystem of output useful to users. The data passed into the database comprised accounting information system, industrial engineering subsystem, and manufacture Intelligence subsystem. The resultant data output consisted of subsystems of production, inventory, quality, and costs. The accounting information system consisted of letters of requests for goods, requests for purchases, purchase orders, list of purchase order numbers, and letters of return. The industrial engineering subsystem consisted of standard operational procedures, letter of job instructions, details of warehouse capacity, standards of hours per man per unit, diagram of process paces, bills of materials, coding scheme, standard criteria of evaluation, quality check sheets, and layout of production floors, Manufacturing intelligence subsystem passed into the database was made up of collections of intelligence concerning supplies, trade unions, and market surveys.

40|$|The ocean {{monitoring}} community requires {{high quality}} data that is Data Management and Communications (DMAC) - compliant for both near real time (ex., weather forecasting and warnings) and climate data records (ex., comprehensive delayed mode). SAIC {{has developed a}} flexible and cost effective automated data quality assurance (ADQA) system {{that can be used}} to assess the quality of marine observations and provide quality controlled data to a wide variety of end users. For example, if a researcher needs data sets from different sources for a modeling project, ADQA provides a means of characterizing the relative quality of these input sets. These characterizations are necessary to enable the researcher to determine the cumulative accuracy of his modeling output. The system is scalable and can be used by a single data provider or a large data center. For the U. S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), this approach is well-suited for a diverse science community employing many different methods to characterize the quality of their data products. The ADQA system has been implemented by integrating a set of data quality algorithms based upon National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) Technical Document 03 - 02 "Handbook of Automated Data Quality Control Checks and Procedures of the National Data Buoy Center" into a processing system that was created using the CALIPSO science data processing framework developed by SAIC. The CALIPSO framework is actually a library of reusable components that provide the core non-science functionality of any science data processing system. This design separates the science processing components from the basic, reusable system infrastructure and allows for the addition or removal of algorithms with relative ease. The generic infrastructure of the framework includes substantial core functionality (ex., read inputs, organize/format data, run algorithms, write output, handle errors and generate metadata) that is common to many science data management applications and is easily configurable to work with a wide variety of marine instruments and science data sets. The basic architecture includes the following subsystems: Input, Control, Data Store and Output. The Input subsystem uses an American Standard Code for Information Exchange (ASCII) configuration file to identify input parameters and define the input file format. As a data record is read from the input file, it is processed into discrete parameters and stored in the Data Store subsystem. Thus, the data are readily available within Framework. The current data formats are: Network Common Data Form (NetCDF), Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), Sensor Metadata Language (SensorML) and ASCII. However, the flexibility of the framework allows for the inclusion of additional data formats without having to redesign the entire ADQA system. The Control subsystem provides the linkage between Framework and the algorithm library and orchestrates the processing activities between the various Framework subsystems and the Algorithm Library. This subsystem balances the flexibility and performance of the ADQA system as it readily accommodates algorithm and data product additions with minimal code changes. The Store Data subsystem is implemented using common data structure for application specific data structures assembled from standard building blocks. Thus, allowing other Framework elements to be generic and configurable. This architectural approach facilitates changing "on the fly" the underlying data structures to allow the addition of parameters or new algorithms. Localized changes to algorithms are made with minimal changes to the input, control, data store and output modules. Furthermore, this subsystem allows parameters to be retrieved by name, consequently, other Framework subsystems and the algorithms in the algorithm library are able to query data structures and retrieve the necessary information. The <b>output</b> <b>subsystem</b> also uses an ASCII configuration file to define the format and content of data products. We are able to add additional data formatwithout having to design the entire ADQA system. The current data formats are: NetCDF, HDF, Sensor and ASCII. The Algorithm Library of the ADQA system was implemented using a modular architecture that encapsulates algorithms into decoupled, re-useable modules while providing the mechanism for assembling them into a working system. We are building a library of re-useable validation algorithms by implementing the algorithms as generic re-useable modules based upon NDBC Technical Document 03 - 02 that can be configured to work with parameters from any source. For example, we have configured a rate and limit check algorithm to process several marine parameters by simply defining the appropriate thresholds. For this paper, we will present a scalable ADQA processing system that is well-suited to address many different methods of characterizing the quality of data products. The system is a modular design that simplifies the integration of additional data quality assurance (DQA) processing components. © 2008 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} our English Speech-to-Text (STT) {{systems for}} the 2012 IWSLT TED ASR track evaluation. The systems consist of 10 subsystems that are combinations of different front-ends, e. g. MVDR based and MFCC based ones, and two different phone sets. The <b>outputs</b> of the <b>subsystems</b> are combined via confusion network combination. Decoding is done in two stages, where the systems of the second stage are adapted in an unsupervised manner on {{the combination of the}} first stage outputs using VTLN, MLLR, and cM-LLR...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA dynamic {{high gain}} like {{observer}} is proposed {{for a class}} of MIMO nonlinear systems that are observable for any inputs. Two main results are worth to be mentioned. The first one {{is related to the}} considered class of systems that is composed by cascade subsystems and each subsystem is associated to a subset of the <b>outputs.</b> Each <b>subsystem</b> assumes a triangular dependence on the state of that subsystem itself but may depend on the state of all other subsystems. Hence, the contribution is to extend the results existing in the literature in that more interconnections between the subsystems are allowed. The second important result lies {{in the nature of the}} observer gain which involves a scalar time-varying parameter governed by some scalar Riccati equation. Simulation results are given in order to highlight the performances of the proposed observer, namely its exponential convergence and a good behavior with respect to noise measurements...|$|R
40|$|The human {{language}} processor is {{conceived as a}} system that consists of several interrelated subsystems. Each subsystem performs a specific task in the complex process of language comprehension and production. A subsystem receives a particular input, performs certain specific operations on this input and yields a particular <b>output.</b> The <b>subsystems</b> can be characterized {{in terms of the}} transformations that relate the input representations to the output representations. An important issue in describing the language processing system is to identify the subsystems and to specify the relations between the subsystems. These relations can be conceived in two different ways. In one conception the subsystems are autonomous. They are related to each other only by the input-output channels. The operations in one subsystem are not affected by another system. The subsystems are modular, that is they are independent. In the other conception, the different subsystems influence each other. A subsystem affects the processes in another subsystem. In this conception there is an interaction between the subsystems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} designing farming systems for low input conditions. By focusing {{on the problem of}} feed (=resource) allocation in livestock systems it provides clues for the design of alternative agricultural systems and systems in general. Linear programming (LP) is used to examine system behaviour under conditions of varying feed resource qualities, for individual animal production levels that range from 0. 75 to 3. 00 times maintenance. Milk yield, animal numbers and amounts of feed offered or refused are measures of system performance in two hypothetical Cases representative for actual farming systems. Case 1 considers available feed as one aggregated resource, with an average nutritive value ranging from that of straw to that of high quality forage. It establishes the individual animal output level that is required to achieve maximum total system output from a given feed resource. In Case 2, animals of different production levels are allowed to select between two feed resources that, through proper definition of the their proportions on offer, on average represent the same feed quality scale as in Case 1. The possibility of selection, however, allows the nutritive value of the actual intake to differ from the average nutritive value of feed offered. Better feed and higher (potential) individual animal output tend to increase total system output in terms of milk, by reducing the number of animals. Nevertheless, the term 'damning objective' is introduced to express that high targets for <b>subsystem</b> <b>output</b> reduces total system <b>output</b> if <b>subsystem</b> requirements exceed resource availability. Moreover, heterogeneity of (feed) resources can increase system output by using more production units with lower individual output. The results are tested against farmers' practice and situations reported in literature. Implications for the design of sustainable systems and further research are discussed...|$|R
