Most UI guidelines and usability studies are rarely updated and are still based on smaller screens or <b>one-handed</b> <b>operations,</b> which can be tiresome on large devices that may require different, or even two-handed postures. Past usability studies have successfully proposed crowd-sourced data collection systems, using mobile applications published on app stores. This work aims to investigate how similar systems can benefit from gamification elements in order to accelerate data collection and to produce accurate results over relatively short periods. An Android game is presented, which challenges users in short 30 -second games, collecting performance of users operating the touchscreen using different device grips and postures.

50|$|The first {{mobile phone}} with Internet {{connectivity}} was the Nokia 9000 Communicator, launched in Finland in 1996. The viability of Internet services access on mobile phones was limited until prices {{came down from}} that model, and network providers started to develop systems and services conveniently accessible on phones. NTT DoCoMo in Japan launched the first mobile Internet service, i-mode, in 1999 and this is considered {{the birth of the}} mobile phone Internet services. In 2001, the mobile phone email system by Research in Motion (now BlackBerry Limited) for their BlackBerry product was launched in America. To make efficient use of the small screen and tiny keypad and <b>one-handed</b> <b>operation</b> typical of mobile phones, a specific document and networking model was created for mobile devices, the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). Most mobile device Internet services operate using WAP. The growth of mobile phone services was initially a primarily Asian phenomenon with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all soon finding the majority of their Internet users accessing resources by phone rather than by PC. Developing countries followed, with India, South Africa, Kenya, the Philippines, and Pakistan all reporting that the majority of their domestic users accessed the Internet from a mobile phone rather than a PC. The European and North American use of the Internet was influenced by a large installed base of personal computers, and the growth of mobile phone Internet access was more gradual, but had reached national penetration levels of 20-30% in most Western countries. The cross-over occurred in 2008, when more Internet access devices were mobile phones than personal computers. In many parts of the developing world, the ratio is as much as 10 mobile phone users to one PC user.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} ThumbSpace, a {{software-based}} interaction technique that provides general <b>one-handed</b> thumb <b>operation</b> of touchscreenbased mobile devices.

We present the ThumbSpace design and a comparative evaluation against direct interaction for target selection. Our results show that in addition to being well received, ThumbSpace improves accuracy for selecting targets that are out of thumb reach, and makes users as effective at selecting small targets as large targets. The results further suggest user practice and strategic design iterations hold potential to close the gap in access time between the two input methods, where ThumbSpace does not do as well as direct interactions...|$|R

Section 2 introduces the wearable computing idea and discusses requirements for a wearable computer systems. Section 3 looks at various aspects of the software architectural approach and how it applies to the construction of product families. In Section 4, we will discuss the relationship between component-based programming and software architecture. This paper concludes with an outlook on future research directions. 2. Wearable Computing The ever advancing miniaturization of computer technology and the increasing availability of wireless communication technology has made possible the creation of mobile computers that allow us to access information anywhere, anytime. Yet, today's mobile computers still follow the traditional user-paradigm that originated with the invention of the Personal Computer. This paradigm is characterized by applications that are based on the desktop or paper metaphor, and the idea of a computer that reacts to user input. Wearable Computing breaks with these ideas and envisions instead computers that become an active part of the environment. Using sensors for location, direction, etc. a wearable computer actively senses its environments and reacts to changes in its state. A heads-up display superimposes information on real objects in the user's immediate surrounding and thus provides automatic access to information in real-time. Speechrecognition capabilities enable the user to control the computer using voice and enable <b>one-handed</b> or hands-free <b>operation</b> that makes input devices like keyboard or mouse obsolete.

The aim of this survey was to investigate patients&# 39; perceptions of the importance of different general attributes of autoinjectors, and patient preferences when comparing the ExtaviPro™ 30 G and Betacomfort® autoinjectors. Method: The survey was conducted in France, Germany, Italy, and the USA in patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had been using an autoinjector for at least 1 year. Participants examined the ExtaviPro™ 30 G and Betacomfort® devices, viewed fact sheets, and watched a video of these autoinjectors in use, then scored nine prespecified attributes of autoinjectors in terms of importance on a scale of 1 – 7 (1 = not at all important; 7 = extremely important). They then indicated which device they preferred, both overall and by individual attribute. Results: Among the 201 participants who completed the survey, being reliable to use was considered the most important general attribute of autoinjectors, followed by attributes associated with convenience (ease of <b>operation,</b> <b>one-handed</b> injection, ease of reach of injection sites, ergonomic shape). For each of the nine attributes, a significantly higher proportion of participants (74 %– 94 % by attribute; P < 0. 05 for each) preferred ExtaviPro™ 30 G to the Betacomfort® autoinjector, and 173 (86 %) participants indicated that they preferred ExtaviPro™ 30 G overall (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The results of this survey suggest that patients with MS rate reliability and convenience as the most important general attributes of autoinjectors, {{and are more likely to}} prefer ExtaviPro™ 30 G to the Betacomfort® autoinjector for routine self-administration of interferon beta- 1 b.

The constraints provided by the existing electronics and software of the brace, combined with suitable ergonomic data, were used to inform the design of a hand-held user interface device, pictured below. The UI features <b>one-handed</b> <b>operation,</b> utilizing an LCD character display and speaker for output devices and a navigation switch for an input device.

40|$|Objective: This study {{focuses on}} the effects of pre-cues informing the {{location}} of upcoming visual stimulus on finger movement response in the context of control-on-display interfaces. Background: Previous research on pre-cues focus on attention allocation and motion studies were limited to indirect control conditions. The design of this study aimed to collect data on the exact landing point for finger-tap responses to a given visual stimulus. Method: Controlled visual stimuli and tasks were presented on a UI evaluation system built using mobile web standards; response accuracy and response time were measured and collected as appropriate. Among the 16 recruited participants, 11 completed the experiment. Results: Providing pre-cue on the location of stimulus affected response time and response accuracy. The response bias, which is a distance from the center of stimulus to the finger-tap location, was larger when the pre-cue was given during a <b>one-handed</b> <b>operation.</b> Conclusion: Given a pre-cue, response time decreases, but with accuracy penalized.

40|$|Mobile {{phones are}} not only a {{ubiquitous}} social accessory, but rapid technology advances have transformed them into feature-rich, Internet-enabled mobile PCs - a role once reserved for touchscreen-based personal digital assistants (PDAs). Although the most widespread phone styles in circulation feature the classic combination of numeric keypad and non-touchscreen display, larger touchscreen devices are gaining ground, {{as indicated by the}} fervor surrounding new devices such as Apple's iPhone and LG's Prada phone. Yet as devices evolve, users will remain constrained by the limits of their own visual, physical, and mental resources. My research has focused on the specific limitation that mobile users often have only one hand available to operate a device, which can be especially problematic for touchscreen-based devices, since they are frequently designed for two-handed stylus operation. Considering the growing volumes of data that small devices can now store and connect to, as well as the expanding cultural role of mobile phones, improving usability in mobile computing has potentially enormous implications for user productivity, satisfaction and even safety. My own exploratory surveys have suggested that one-handed use of mobile devices is very common but that today's hardware and software designs do not support users in performing many tasks with only one hand. Motivated by these findings, the research goal of this dissertation is to contribute substantial knowledge in the form of empirically backed design guidelines and interaction techniques for improving <b>one-handed</b> usability and <b>operation</b> of mobile devices, with particular emphasis on those with touch-sensitive displays. The guidelines for one-handed mobile device design are the product of a series of studies conducted in pursuit of foundational knowledge in user behavior, preference, thumb capabilities and touchscreen-thumb interaction characteristics for single-handed device use. I also demonstrate the application of these guidelines through the development and evaluation of four applications. Two involve designs for navigating among programs, one provides an interface for searching large data sets, and the last offers a generalized mechanism for controlling arbitrary touchscreen interfaces with a thumb. Each of these applications explores a different one-handed interaction technique and offers perspective on its viability for one-handed device use...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionCervical mediastinoscopy {{can provide}} a {{minimally}} invasive access to the paratracheobronchial mediastinum within its reachable range, but its operability is substantially limited because of its small operative field, poor visualisation, and <b>one-handed</b> <b>operation.</b> Presentation of casesPatient 1, a 56 -year-old woman, presented with a 22 × 17 mm, non-symptomatic, 18 F-fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG) -avid, solid schwannoma originating from the vagus nerve trunk in the right upper paratracheal space. Patient 2, a 55 -year-old man, presented with a 55 × 41 mm cystic mass in the left upper paratracheal space that extensively compressed and dislocated the trachea toward the right, which caused dyspnoea and cervicothoracic pain. The masses in both cases were completely resected using a Linder-Dahan spreadable-blade video mediastinoscope. DiscussionThe addition of the video system and spreadable blades to the conventional scope combined with a scope-holding device has enabled effective bi-manual preparation and more precise and safer mediastinoscopic procedures than those performed using the conventional one-handed mediastinoscope. Owing to the improved operability, more complex or extended procedures could be performed in wider and more stable operative spaces with better visualisation, although the system has the same minimal invasiveness {{as that of the}} conventional mediastinoscope.

40|$|Purpose Syringes {{are used}} for {{diagnostic}} fluid aspiration and fine-needle aspiration biopsy in interventional procedures. We determined the benefits, disadvantages, and patient safety implications of syringe and needle size on vacuum generation, hand force requirements, biopsy/fluid yield, and needle control during aspiration procedures. Materials and Methods Different sizes (1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 ml) of the conventional syringe and aspirating mechanical safety syringe, the reciprocating procedure device, were studied. Twenty operators performed aspiration procedures with the following outcomes measured: (1) vacuum (torr), (2) time to vacuum (s), (3) hand force to generate vacuum (torr-cm 2), (4) operator difficulty during aspiration, (5) biopsy yield (mg), and (6) operator control of the needle tip position (mm). Results Vacuum increased tissue biopsy yield at all needle diameters (P < 0. 002). Twenty-milliliter syringes achieved a vacuum of - 517 torr but required far more strength to aspirate, and resulted in significant loss of needle control (P < 0. 002). The 10 -ml syringe generated only 15 % less vacuum (- 435 torr) than the 20 -ml device and required much less hand strength. The mechanical syringe generated identical vacuum at all syringe sizes with less hand force (P < 0. 002) and provided significantly enhanced needle control (P < 0. 002). Conclusions To optimize patient safety {{and control of the}} needle, and to maximize fluid and tissue yield during aspiration procedures, a two-handed technique and the smallest syringe size adequate for the procedure should be used. If precise needle control or <b>one-handed</b> <b>operation</b> is required, a mechanical safety syringe should be considered. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|<b>One-handed</b> <b>operation</b> of {{touchscreen}} smartphones presents challenges such as hard-to-reach {{targets and}} the thumb occluding the interface. There {{are two main}} approaches to address these challenges: Modification of the graphical user interface (GUI) and extension of the device's input modalities using its sensors. Previous work has presented techniques addressing a specific problem in isolation, but has failed to provide one solution which tackles all main challenges of thumb interaction together. This thesis examines whether this can be done. To establish the background, the thesis finds that users prefer convenience over efficiency and confirms that they predominantly use one hand. To detect mode of operation, the thesis presents an approach to classify a user's finger {{with a high degree}} of accuracy using a single touch. Following the first research avenue, the thesis presents a thumb-optimised GUI that increases usability and efficiency of one-handed website operation. Following the second avenue of research, the thesis presents a novel one-handed input technique for smartphones, using a set of three off-screen gestures. Both approaches address the most common problems of one-handed smartphone operation via the thumb largely successfully, but fail to completely solve the problem of interface occlusion. The thesis adds to the literature in the field of visual perception, input classification, GUI optimisation, and input techniques. Readers learn that visual search strategies of the desktop world may also apply to the mobile world and that eye gaze position may have a greater impact on target acquisition time than Fitts's law. The one-touch finger classification technique provides an additional layer of context and new opportunities for improving the human-machine dialogue. The thumb-optimised GUI presents practitioners with a potential blueprint for translating classical WIMP UI elements into thumb-friendly touch interfaces while the novel input technique provides a new layer of complexity for off-screen interaction...|$|E
40|$|To The Editor: I was {{impressed}} with the recent article, “In-flight Thoracic Ultrasound Detection of Pneumothorax in Combat,” by Dr. Justin Madill (1). It gives us all great pride to know of the life-saving and life-sustaining work that our nation’s military Emergency Physicians do every day in austere conditions in deployed environments! The author is, indeed, correct to note that medical evacuation (and casualty evacuationdmedical evacuation in airborne or ground vehicles without intrinsic, dedicated patient care modalities) is very different from operating among the environs of the Emergency Department (ED). Hypobaria, hypoxia, hypothermia, vibration, noise, confined spaces, limited patient access, and other physical and physiologic stressors of flight contribute to these challenges (2). I was particularly cued on the comment noting that “auscultation of breath sounds while in-flight would be futile due to the high ambient noise of the helicopter. ” In fact, this is not a problem solely for the militaryd physicians are often required to evaluate, make clinical decisions, and initiate treatment under noisy conditions. Auscultation is a fundamental and powerful clinical tooldit is rapid, simple, inexpensive, portable, and repeatable. But meaningful auscultation is challenging at best, often impossible, in high-noise environments. This might include being in the back of an aircraft or vehicle, in a very noisy ED, or even at the point of injury in a noisy environment (e. g., a stadium). The U. S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), located at Fort Rucker, AL, has been addressing this challenge. Recognizing the need for a device capable of adequate preservation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under conditions of noise, USAARL partnered with Active Signal Technologies, Inc. (Linthicum Heights, MD), through a Small Business Innovative Research collaboration, to develop a “noise-immune stethoscope” (NIS) (3, 4). The NIS is a hybrid dual-mode design stethoscope with both an acoustic (passive) and a Doppler (active) mode. It is designed for <b>one-handed</b> <b>operation</b> and is powered by two AA-cell batteries. The acoustic mode consists of a directly coupled piezoelectric ceramic stack, whereas the Doppler operates with a 2 – 3 -MHz ultrasound carrier wave...|$|E
