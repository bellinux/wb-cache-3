5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>disturbance,</b> a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E

5|$|If signs <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{are present}} {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the {{diagnosis}} of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E
40|$|Although {{reduction}} <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> {{may result}} in productivity increase, some of the presumed gain may be diverted to other disturbances. There {{is a need to}} develop methods that provide {{a better understanding of the}} causes and actions <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> in manufacturing systems. Discrete-event simulation is used to analyze the effects <b>of</b> reduced <b>disturbances.</b> Two case studies from manufacturing companies in Sweden were carried out. The investigation shows that the best ways to decrease disturbances are to eliminate those resulting from long waiting times. It is suggested that the new allocation <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> be thoroughly investigated before efforts are taken to eliminate disturbances and increase total output...|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack <b>of</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E
5|$|Reports on {{the number}} of populations and {{individuals}} vary widely. A survey in 1982 reported 450 plants in five populations, with the largest population comprising 300 plants.

5|$|Sphecius grandis wasps {{frequently}} {{interact with}} humans {{because of their}} tendency to make their nests in backyards, gardens and sidewalks. Pest control is mostly unneeded as they nest in areas with little to no vegetation, usually ignore people, and females are not aggressive, tending to save their venom for their cicada prey, but will sting if they are grabbed or stepped on. Despite their large size, being the largest wasp to inhabit California, their sting has been reported as being between merely numbing and sharp to moderate. Males, while smaller, are naturally more aggressive and less tolerant <b>of</b> <b>disturbance.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} for diagnosing the original source and underlying causes <b>of</b> power system <b>disturbances,</b> where {{voltage and current}} recordings from different locations of a power system are collected. In the proposed method, disturbances are first pre-classified {{based on the number}} of transition segments. The spatial zone of the source <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> is coarsely determined from voltage recordings only. Disturbances are then further analyzed and characterized by extracting information from both voltages and currents. Finally more accurate information about the location of the source <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> is obtained by different techniques depending on the type <b>of</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Several underlying causes are analyzed and classified by using the proposed features extracted from both voltage and current waveforms. Finally, the location of the source <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> is refined once the underlying causes are found. Case studies were performed on a large grid-connected wind farm with disturbances from several underlying causes, including: fault, unit tripping, transformer, capacitor, and cable energizing generated by PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|R

Further, we show that, when nontraded goods are present, the degree of commodity sustainability is crucial.

5|$|The hoard was {{concentrated}} {{in a single}} location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest. The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as ladles and bowls were stacked inside each other, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box. Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, but the overall amount <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> was low. It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within the container, {{and the existence of}} the container itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated in situ by professional archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Kr√∏yer started Chez Moi, {{a series}} of watercolours of Marie and their {{daughter}} Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen in a style inspired by the Art Nouveau approach adopted by Carl Larsson whom Kr√∏yer probably met during his time in Paris.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the dynamic effects of demand and supply {{disturbances}} on the Finnish economy. In addition, the study aims at finding out whether liberalization of capital movements affected the transmission <b>of</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The analysis is based on a vector autoregressive model for unemployment and the GNP from 1970. 1 to 1990. 4. The vector autoregressive representation is then transformed to a corresponding moving average representation and the dynamic effects <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> are analyzed by impulse response functions. The model restricts the number <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> to two, called demand and supply disturbances. Estimation shows that demand disturbances have temporary effects on GNP and unemployment, the effects <b>of</b> supply <b>disturbances</b> on GNP are permanent but their effects on unemployment are temporary. As capital mobility increases the effects <b>of</b> demand <b>disturbances</b> die out faster. There is no significant difference in the short term effects <b>of</b> supply <b>disturbances</b> on GNP but the long term effects are magnified. This is in accordance with economic theory. demand and supply; capital movements; Finnish economy...|$|R
