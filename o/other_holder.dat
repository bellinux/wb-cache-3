2500|$|The title megas stratopedarchēs ("grand {{master of}} the camp") was instituted c. 1255 by the Emperor Theodore II Laskaris (r. 1254–1258) for his chief {{minister}} and confidante, George Mouzalon. Theodore II states in a decree that he [...] "established the dignity anew", but no <b>other</b> <b>holder</b> of the office is known before that time. The mid-14th century Book of Offices of pseudo-Kodinos places the megas stratopedarchēs as the ninth-most senior official of the state below the Emperor, ranking between the prōtostratōr and the megas primmikērios. Kodinos reports that he was [...] "supervisor of the provisioning of the army, that is food, drink and all necessities". In reality, however, during the Palaiologan period (1261–1453) the [...] stratopedarchēs was most likely an honorific court title, and did not necessarily entail an active military command. Like many other titles in the Palaiologan period, the post could be held by two people simultaneously. According to Pseudo-Kodinos, the ceremonial costume of the megas stratopedarchēs was identical to the offices immediately superior to it: a rich silk kabbadion tunic, a golden-red skiadion hat decorated with embroideries in the klapōton style, without veil, or a domed skaranikon hat, again in red and gold and decorated with golden wire, with {{a portrait of the}} emperor standing in front, and another of him enthroned in the rear.

The fact that the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was usually an absentee appointment and that the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Lord Manners, was not familiar with the Irish political scene gave Saurin the opportunity to direct the Irish Government, an opportunity of which he took full advantage. Sir Robert Peel, while Chief Secretary for Ireland, was said to be wholly in sympathy with Saurin, although Peel was later to radically alter his view on Catholic Emancipation.|$|E
50|$|A {{resignation}} is {{the formal}} act {{of giving up}} or quitting one's office or position. A resignation can occur when a person holding a position gained by election or appointment steps down, but leaving a position upon the {{expiration of a term}} is not considered resignation. When an employee chooses to leave a position, it is considered a resignation, as opposed to involuntary termination, which occurs when the employee involuntarily loses a job. Whether an employee resigned or was terminated is sometimes a topic of dispute, because in many situations, a terminated employee is eligible for severance pay and/or unemployment benefits, whereas one who voluntarily resigns may not be eligible. Abdication is the equivalent of resignation of a reigning monarch or pope, or <b>other</b> <b>holder</b> of a non-political, hereditary or similar position.|$|E

5000|$|The {{judgment}} creditor may also seek {{to execute the}} money judgment against intangible property, such as bank accounts, accounts receivable, and other debts owed to the judgment debtor by third parties. The creditor must request that the {{clerk of the court}} who issued the fi fa follow this up by issuing a [...] "summons in garnishment" [...] directed against the holder of money that is due to the judgment debtor. This third party is known as the garnishee. Service of process must be effected on both the garnishee and the judgment debtor, and the notice to the judgment debtor must promptly follow notice on the garnishee. The notice will instruct the garnishee not to release funds due to the debtor, and it will set a date for the garnishee to appear in court and contest the garnishment, if it so chooses. If the garnishee appears in court and admits liability (that is, admits that it is holding the debtor's money and has no reason to prevent the court from seizing it), of if the garnishee does not appear in court at all, the court will issue a judgment on the writ. The sheriff will then go to the bank (or <b>other</b> <b>holder</b> of the judgment debtor's money) and collect the money for the {{judgment creditor}}.|$|E
