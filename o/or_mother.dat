5|$|Longtime Quarter Horse breeder and racehorse owner Walter Merrick of Sayre, Oklahoma, bred Easy Jet {{from two}} future AQHA Hall of Fame members, Jet Deck and Thoroughbred mare Lena's Bar in 1967. His dam, <b>or</b> <b>mother,</b> Lena's Bar, had {{produced}} {{a small number}} of other offspring, but Easy Jet was her last; she died shortly after he was weaned, or removed from his mother's milk. Both of his parents were descended from Three Bars, who was the sire of Lena's Bar and the grandsire of Jet Deck's dam. Easy Jet is one of only two horses in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame to have both parents in the Hall of Fame; his two grandsires, Moon Deck and Three Bars, are also in the Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (<b>or</b> <b>mother</b> substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|Balkh is {{considered}} to be the first city to which the Indo-Iranian tribes moved from north of the Amu Darya, between 2000 and 1500 BC. The Arabs called it Umm Al-Belaad <b>or</b> <b>Mother</b> of Cities on account of its antiquity. The city was traditionally a center of Zoroastrianism. The name Zariaspa, which is either an alternate name for Balkh or a term for part of the city, may derive from the important Zoroastrian fire temple Azar-i-Asp. Balkh was regarded as the place where Zoroaster first preached his religion, as well as the place where he died.|$|E

25|$|The three Healy sisters {{attended}} {{parochial schools}} in Montreal, Canada, ultimately entering Catholic orders. Martha, the oldest, left her convent {{after several years}} and moved to Boston, where two brothers were. She married an Irish immigrant. Josephine lived with her family in Boston before joining the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph. Eliza joined the Congregation of Notre Dame in Montreal, where she was known as Sister Mary Magdalen. After teaching in Quebec and Ontario, in 1903 Eliza was appointed abbess <b>or</b> <b>Mother</b> Superior of the convent and school of Villa Barlow in St. Albans, Vermont.

25|$|Private {{writings}} by both Evans and Cheevers {{indicate that}} their dedication did not preclude or {{interfere with their}} duties as a wife <b>or</b> <b>mother.</b> It was not unusual {{for women in the}} mid-seventeenth Century to show a deep devotion to religion, and mothers were often responsible for teaching and raising children according to the basic tenets of their religion. Because of this, some scholars believe it is possible that Evans and Cheevers viewed their journey as an extension as their accepted roles as devoted Christian wives. Quaker marriages were exceptional for the seventeenth century for viewing spouses as “spiritual equals,” and for allowing each marriage partner to explore and advocate for their own faith.|$|E
25|$|From 1 January 1985 the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands {{nationality}} (Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap 19 December 1984, Stb. 628) permits {{children of}} either a Dutch father <b>or</b> <b>mother</b> to receive Dutch nationality by descent.
