25|$|The {{critical}} {{detail of}} stimulated emission {{is that the}} induced photon has the same frequency and phase as the incident photon. In other words, the two photons are coherent. It is this property that allows <b>optical</b> <b>amplification,</b> {{and the production of}} a laser system. During the operation of a laser, all three light-matter interactions described above are taking place. Initially, atoms are energized from the ground state to the excited state by a process called pumping, described below. Some of these atoms decay via spontaneous emission, releasing incoherent light as photons of frequency, ν. These photons are fed back into the laser medium, usually by an optical resonator. Some of these photons are absorbed by the atoms in the ground state, and the photons are lost to the laser process. However, some photons cause stimulated emission in excited-state atoms, releasing another coherent photon. In effect, this results in <b>optical</b> <b>amplification.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, intermediate <b>optical</b> <b>amplification</b> {{sites in}} DWDM systems may {{allow for the}} dropping and adding of certain wavelength channels.

25|$|WDM, DWDM and CWDM {{are based}} on the same concept of using {{multiple}} wavelengths of light on a single fiber, but differ in the spacing of the wavelengths, number of channels, and the ability to amplify the multiplexed signals in the optical space. EDFA provide an efficient wideband amplification for the C-band, Raman amplification adds a mechanism for amplification in the L-band. For CWDM, wideband <b>optical</b> <b>amplification</b> is not available, limiting the optical spans to several tens of kilometres.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} {{identical}} in form to atomic absorption {{in which the}} energy of an absorbed photon causes an identical but opposite atomic transition: from the lower level to a higher energy level. In normal media at thermal equilibrium, absorption exceeds stimulated emission because there are more electrons in the lower energy states than in the higher energy states. However, when a population inversion is present, the rate of stimulated emission exceeds that of absorption, and a net <b>optical</b> <b>amplification</b> can be achieved. Such a gain medium, along with an optical resonator, {{is at the heart}} of a laser or maser.|$|E
25|$|As before, the {{presence}} of a fast, radiationless decay transition results in the population of the pump band being quickly depleted (N4 ≈ 0). In a four-level system, any atom in the lower laser level E2 is also quickly de-excited, leading to a negligible population in that state (N2 ≈ 0). This is important, since any appreciable population accumulating in level 3, the upper laser level, will form a population inversion with respect to level 2. That is, as long as N3 > 0, then N3 > N2, and a population inversion is achieved. Thus <b>optical</b> <b>amplification,</b> and laser operation, can take place at a frequency of ν32 (E3-E2 = hν32).|$|E

2500|$|Stimulated {{emission}} {{can provide}} a physical mechanism for <b>optical</b> <b>amplification.</b> [...] If an external source of energy stimulates more than 50% of the atoms in the ground state to transition into the excited state, then {{what is called a}} population inversion is created. [...] When light of the appropriate frequency passes through the inverted medium, the photons are either absorbed by the atoms that remain in the ground state or the photons stimulate the excited atoms to emit additional photons of the same frequency, phase, and direction. Since more atoms are in the excited state than in the ground state then an amplification of the input intensity results.|$|E

2500|$|An {{electron}} {{in level}} 2 may decay by spontaneous emission {{to the ground}} state, releasing a photon of frequency ν12 (given by E2 – E1 = hν12), which is shown as the transition L, called the laser transition in the diagram. If the lifetime of this transition, τ21 is much longer than the lifetime of the radiationless 3 → 2 transition τ32 (if τ21 ≫ τ32, known as a favourable lifetime ratio), {{the population of the}} E3 will be essentially zero (N3 ≈ 0) and a population of excited state atoms will accumulate in level 2 (N2 > 0). If over half the N atoms can be accumulated in this state, this will exceed the population of the ground state N1.
