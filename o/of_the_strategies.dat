After the World War I, in 1919–22, he won Muslim {{leadership}} support of Ali Brothers by backing the Khilafat Movement in favour the Islamic Caliph and his historic Ottoman Caliphate, and opposing the secular Islam supporting Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. By 1924, Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, the Khilafat Movement was over, and Muslim support for Gandhi had largely evaporated.|$|E

He also feared that other American interests, including the economy, were suffering through U.S. involvement in the war, and that the U.S. was losing prestige internationally.|$|E

While not specifically mentioning netball, it did acknowledge the importance of the sport in terms of international prestige. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> to help meet those objectives was to strengthen national sporting bodies like the netball association.

25|$|In the past, simple {{game theory}} models, {{such as the}} classic {{cooperative}} hunting and Prisoner's dilemma models, {{were used to determine}} decisions made by animals in cooperative relationships. However, complicated interactions between animals have required the use of more complex economic models such as the Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium is a type of non-cooperative game theory that assumes an individual's decision is influenced by its knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> of other individuals. This theory was novel because it took into consideration the higher cognitive capabilities of animals. The evolutionarily stable strategy is a refined version of the Nash equilibrium in that it assumes strategies are heritable and are subject to natural selection. Economic models are useful for analyzing cooperative relationships because they provide predictions on how individuals act when cooperation is an option. Economic models are not perfect, but they provide a general idea of how cooperative relationships work.|$|E
25|$|After {{replacing}} Dennis Green on {{an interim}} basis {{to end the}} 2001 season, Mike Tice was officially named head coach on January 10, 2002. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> the Vikings first-year head coach came up with was a formula to get Moss the ball more often. Coach Tice called it the Randy Ratio. It was an effort on the coaches part to throw 40% of the passes to Moss {{as a way to}} keep him involved in the offense more than {{he had been in the}} 2001 season when he had stretches in games where he was being shut out, and partly to use more game clock by sustaining long drives to give the Vikings defense a chance to rest. An assistant coach would stand on the sidelines during games and track how many times Moss had been thrown to, and then inform Tice of the percentages so that he is always aware of it. In the 2001 season, the Vikings record was 4–1 when Moss had 40% of the passes thrown his direction, and 1–10 in other games.|$|E
25|$|Government {{marriage}} {{officers who}} have an objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex marriages may note this objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs, {{and if they do}} so they cannot be compelled to solemnise same-sex marriages. (This provision does not apply to religious marriage officers because they are in any case not obliged to solemnise a marriage that would violate the doctrines of their religion.) Several constitutional scholars have argued that this provision is unconstitutional, representing as it does state-sanctioned discrimination in violation of the right to equality. In September 2016, almost a decade after same-sex marriage was legalized in South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs released a list of marriage offices across the country that are willing to solemnise same-sex marriages. According to the list, of the 409 marriage offices only 117 (or 28.6%) are willing to do so. In Gauteng, 17 out of 57 offices said they would conduct same-sex marriages, 10 out of 59 in the Eastern Cape, 5 out of 28 in the Free State, 10 out of 58 in Mpumalanga, 16 out of 61 in Limpopo, 10 out of 34 in the Western Cape, 9 out of 22 in the Northern Cape, 29 out of 68 in KwaZulu-Natal and 10 out of 22 in North West. Following its release, Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba said the list was just one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> that the Department had undertaken to resolve the issue, which include increasing sensitisation of Home Affairs officials and ensuring that LGBT people are treated respectfully and according to policies and laws by staff.|$|E

500|$|Traditional modern {{literary}} critics of Sappho's poetry {{have tended to}} see her poetry as a vivid and skilled but spontaneous and naive expression of emotion: typical of this view are the remarks of H. J. Rose that [...] "Sappho wrote as she spoke, owing practically nothing to any literary influence," [...] and that her verse displays [...] "the charm of absolute naturalness." [...] Against this essentially romantic view, one school of more recent critics argues that, on the contrary, Sappho's poetry displays and depends for its effect on a sophisticated deployment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> of traditional Greek rhetorical genres.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Salah Al Bandar, then {{an adviser}} to the Cabinet Affairs Ministry {{distributed}} a 240–page scandalous report, revealing an alleged Khawalid-led political conspiracy aiming to disenfranchise and marginalize the Shia majority, and to minimize the influence of [...] "reformers in the ruling family". One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> of the alleged conspiracy was to naturalize Sunnis in order to re-shift the demographic balance. Other strategies included stroking sectarianism in the media, use of GONGOs and rigging the parliamentary election. The report named Ahmed bin Ateyatalla as head of the conspiracy by leading an [...] "underground network" [...] that aims [...] "to override the legal legitimacy, falsify popular will and vilify civil organizations".

Vicky Frost of The Guardian was overly critical of the episode, criticising it for the reunion between Ruth and Harry, which she stated [...] "wasn't quite the romantic occasion [...] liked," [...] and Malcolm's method to convince a [...] "trained killer not to shoot Nico." [...] Overall, Frost thought the episode was [...] "medium" [...] and rated it five out of ten on the [...] "ridiculous-o-meter".|$|E

40|$|Although a strategy, in theory, {{should help}} the {{organization}} {{to move in the}} same direction by showing a direction for the organization, in practice <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> increases <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> possible paths, as managers translate <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> into their own context. This increases <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>strategies</b> in <b>the</b> organization, and it becomes difficult to get an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interaction and relationships between <b>the</b> translated <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> managers distinguish between <b>the</b> different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy,</b> such as <b>the</b> abstract words or intention, and the concrete as targets and projects. Managers use <b>the</b> various parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> in different contexts, but still speak about "strategy" even if they have changed dimension like the words and KPIs.
