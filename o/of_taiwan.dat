5|$|Forecasters at the JTWC {{initially}} projected {{the storm}} to track north <b>of</b> <b>Taiwan</b> on September12 and merge with an approaching frontal system. Contrary to this, Sarah moved {{south of the}} expected path and quickly weakened as it interacted with the mountainous terrain <b>of</b> <b>Taiwan.</b> The storm eventually struck the island with winds of 165km/h (105mph) late on September11. Unexpectedly, the typhoon executed a counterclockwise loop and briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall 12hours later along the northeastern coast <b>of</b> <b>Taiwan</b> as a tropical storm. Sarah failed to reorganize as it moved over the Taiwan Strait and later made its final landfall in Zhejiang, China as a minimal tropical storm on September13. The storm was last noted the following day as dissipating over Eastern China.|$|E

5|$|The {{originally}} proposed route {{would have}} taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong.

This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government <b>of</b> <b>Taiwan</b> to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.|$|E
