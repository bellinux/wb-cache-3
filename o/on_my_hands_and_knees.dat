500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2012, Tyler {{announced}} that he would be leaving American Idol after two seasons, with a statement saying, [...] "After some long... hard... thoughts... I've decided it's time for me to let go of my mistress 'American Idol' before she boils my rabbit. I strayed from my first love, AEROSMITH, and I’m back— but instead of begging <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> I got two fists in the air and I’m kicking the door open with my band. The next few years are going to be dedicated to kicking some serious ass— the ultimate in auditory takeover..." [...] However, the reports suggest that Tyler was dumped by the American Idol bosses. Tyler has since indicated that his troubles with his bandmates were the primary reason he signed up to do American Idol. He was replaced by Keith Urban.|$|E
60|$|Then I got down, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> {{and went}} on another {{exploring}} expedition.|$|E
60|$|I did so, {{though it}} turned me cold all over to touch him. Some of his blood came <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> sickened me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rise early, and be by {{me all the}} day. There will be {{much work}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I shall be hurt between my neck and my shoulder." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} I felt her {{pressure}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{then she had}} fled into the house, leaving me standing by the steps looking after her. Comyn's voice aroused me.|$|R
60|$|Elsie shrank {{back against}} the wall of rock. I {{advanced}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> {{to the edge of the}} precipice. It was not quite sheer, but it dropped like a sea-cliff, with broken ledges.|$|E
60|$|The October night comes down; {{returning}} {{as before}} Except for a slight sensation of being {{ill at ease}} I mount the stairs and turn {{the handle of the}} door And feel as if I had mounted <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{went down}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> {{to look for}} him, for I felt very curious to know how young Frogs ought to be amused. After a minute's search, I found him sitting {{at the edge of}} the ditch, by the side of the little Frog, and looking rather disconsolate.|$|E
6000|$|... "You," [...] she said, [...] "are {{going to}} watch, to observe, {{to trace the}} {{external}} only that you may understand the internal. But I am going to work <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees." ...|$|R
50|$|Grace Bell McCance Snyder (April 23, 1882 - December 8, 1982), American quilter, former pioneer and centenarian, whose {{story is}} known through No Time <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>and</b> Pioneer Girl: Growing Up on the Prairie.|$|R
50|$|A trilogy {{of mystery}} thrillers for older YA readers {{includes}} Wish You Were Dead, Blood <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Hands,</b> <b>and</b> Kill You Last, which {{was nominated for}} a 2012 Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America.|$|R
6000|$|I {{went down}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and {{threaded}} {{my way through}} the long grasses and matted boughs as noiselessly as I could. The two old hands watched me. When I emerged several yards off, much to their surprise, Colebrook turned to Doolittle. [...] "Might answer," [...] he said curtly. [...] "Major says, 'Choose your own men.' Anyhow, if they catch him, nobody's fault but his. Wants to go. Will do it." ...|$|E
60|$|I crept <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to the box, to {{see what}} queer thing had found {{his way to the}} crackers, and peeped {{cautiously}} over the edge. There were Killooleet, and Mrs. Killooleet, and the five little Killooleets, just seven hopping brown backs and bobbing heads, helping themselves to the crackers. And the sound of their bills on the empty box made the jolliest tattoo that ever came out of a camping kit.|$|E
6000|$|Propped <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> {{fearful that}} Mrs Bowater might {{interrupt}} me before I was prepared, I stared fixedly at the newspaper. I understood {{all that it}} said, yet it was as strange {{to me as if}} it had been written in Hebrew. I had seen, I had known, Mr Crimble. Who, then, was this? My throat drew together as I turned my head a little and managed to inquire, [...] "What is an inquest, Mrs Bowater?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend," [...] said Dalgetty, [...] "I {{am sorry}} for you; but PATIENZA, as the Spaniard says. If you had but been {{as quiet as}} a log, as you call yourself, I should have saved some excoriations <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees." ...|$|R
50|$|Strasser {{has also}} written {{separate}} stories including Kidnap Kids (about two siblings who kidnap their parents), and Hey Dad! Get a Life, and two sequels to Wish You Were Dead: one called Blood <b>On</b> <b>My</b> <b>Hands,</b> <b>and</b> one called Kill You Last.|$|R
60|$|Misfortunes seldom come alone: {{this was}} the forerunner of my husband's flight; and as my {{expectations}} were cut off <b>on</b> that side, <b>my</b> husband gone, and my family of children <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> nothing to subsist them, my condition was the most deplorable that words can express.|$|R
6000|$|Guy and Viola {{were two}} bright fountains of childish, quaint {{thoughts}} and speeches. I found a ready sale {{for this kind}} of humor, and was furnishing a regular department in a magazine with [...] "Funny Fancies of Childhood." [...] I began to stalk them as an Indian stalks the antelope. I would hide behind sofas and doors, or crawl <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> among the bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play. I had all the qualities of a harpy except remorse.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt that}} I had better move, so, taking up my pistol and hiding it, I crawled <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> {{to the spot}} where I had hidden this book; and then got up on to my feet, and {{staggered}} across the plain, as if sorely wounded, and scarcely able to drag my feet along. As I had hoped, no one seemed to notice me, and I saw three or four other figures, also making their way painfully towards where the Dervishes had encamped.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck me}} that the air might be better nearer the floor, and I proved it when I dropped <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> I rolled Uchino out of his {{blankets}} with a quick jerk, wrapped the blankets about my head, face, and mouth, arose to my feet, and dashed for'ard into the hall. After a couple of collisions with the wood-work I again {{dropped to the floor}} and rearranged the blankets so that, while my mouth remained covered, I could draw or withdraw, a thickness across my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I walked round by Fowler's lodge, {{to bestow}} my little Athenian owl. I brought {{it all the}} way in <b>my</b> pocket, or <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> I put him in Tom Fowler's charge while I am here. I could not think what fashionable young lady you had here. How has that turned out?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Speechless with relief, I nodded. I {{would not}} be arrested or thrown out if they would accept me as a science fiction writer. He kept his grip <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> turned around and {{bellowed}} to his group of chatting friends, [...] "Guess who I've got here. The little woman who wrote 'Incommunicado'!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] replied Dr. May; [...] "and I made enemies {{enough to}} fetter me now. I {{do not mean}} that I have done right--I have not; {{but there is a}} good deal <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I don't write easily. I have been slower to take up new matters than I ought to have been." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me, {{as far as}} I could recollect, {{there was only a}} chair here and there and yonder, five or six of them {{scattered}} over this territory, and I thought maybe after I found that chair I might find the next one. Well, I did. And I found another and another and another. I kept going around <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> having those sudden collisions, and finally when I banged into another chair I almost lost my temper. And I raised up, garbed as I was, not for public exhibition, right {{in front of a mirror}} fifteen or sixteen feet high.|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought that}} before {{dressing}} I would accumulate my clothes. I pawed {{around in the}} dark and found everything packed together on the floor except one sock. I couldn't get on the track of that sock. It might have occurred to me that maybe it was in the wash. But I didn't think of that. I went excursioning <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> Presently I thought, [...] "I am never going to find it; I'll go back to bed again." [...] That is what I tried to do during the next three hours. I had lost the bearings of that bed. I was {{going in the wrong direction}} all the time. By-and-by I came in collision with a chair and that encouraged me.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} Jim {{was gone for}} the raft. I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now, and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So I dropped <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man {{stretched}} {{on the floor and}} tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and saying: ...|$|E
60|$|I started forward restlessly. I did {{not need}} my sight to pace the poop of my ill-starred first command with perfect assurance. Every square foot of her decks was {{impressed}} indelibly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> brain, to the very grain and knots of the planks. Yet, all of a sudden, I fell clean over something, landing full length <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> face.|$|R
5000|$|I am {{called the}} camel girl because my knees turn backward. I can walk best <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet {{as you see}} me in the picture. I have {{traveled}} considerably in the show business {{for the past four}} years and now, this is 1886 and I intend to quit the show business and go to school and fit myself for another occupation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Emily, in a murmuring voice, 'we {{should do}} better if Lily {{would not make}} such a point of that one thing; but she never minds what else is cut short, and she never thinks of helping me. It never seems to enter her head how much I have <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> no one does {{anything}} to help me.' ...|$|R
60|$|Let us {{understand}} one another {{once and for}} all. I cannot at my mature age participate in the sports of children with such abandon as I could wish. I entertain, and have always entertained, the sincerest regard for such games as Hunt-the-Slipper and Blind-Man's Buff. But I have now reached a time of life, when, to have my eyes blindfolded {{and to have a}} powerful boy of ten hit me in the back with a hobby-horse and ask me to guess who hit me, provokes me to a fit of retaliation which could only culminate in reckless criminality. Nor can I cover my shoulders with a drawing-room rug and crawl round <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> under the pretence that I am a bear without a sense of personal insufficiency, which is painful to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here must we pass," [...] said Ayesha. [...] "Be careful lest giddiness {{overcome}} you, or {{the wind}} sweep {{you into the}} gulf beneath, for of a truth it hath no bottom;" [...] and, without giving us any further time to get scared, she started walking along the spur, leaving us to follow her as best we might. I was next to her, then came Job, painfully dragging his plank, while Leo brought up the rear. It was a wonderful sight to see this intrepid woman gliding fearlessly along that dreadful place. For my part, when I had gone but a very few yards, what between {{the pressure of the}} air and the awful sense of the consequences that a slip would entail, I found it necessary to go down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> and crawl, and so did the other two.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will perhaps {{allow me}} to inform you of my cold opinion," [...] he began, {{apparently}} self-possessed, truly bursting with rage: [...] "when I am a glorified saint, I shall see you howling for a drop of water, and exult to see you. That your last word! Take it in your face, you spy, you false friend, you fat hypocrite! I defy, I defy and despise and spit upon you! I'm on the trail, his trail or yours; I smell blood, I'll follow it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> I'll starve to follow it! I'll hunt you down, hunt you, hunt you down! If I were strong, I'd tear your vitals out, here in this room--tear them out--I'd tear them out! Damn, damn, damn! You think me weak? I can bite, bite to the blood, bite you, hurt you, disgrace you ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dad, I don't know women very well, but I reckon {{they live}} by their hearts. You {{can bet that}} {{happiness}} for them {{means a lot to}} me. I felt pretty low down. That's gone. I could crow like Bobby ... but, Dad, I've a big job <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I think I'm equal to it. Are you going to oppose me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Felice--my father-in-law!...I have crawled to {{you more}} than a mile <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees--God, I thought I should never have got here!...I have come to you--be-cause you are the only friend--I have in the world now....I can never go back to Hintock--never--to the roof of the Melburys! Not poppy nor {{mandragora}} will ever medicine this bitter feud!...If I were only well again--" ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{ultimately}} got past my defence, with a jumpy one which broke awkwardly from the off, I had fetched twenty-three {{so that he}} needed twenty to win, a longer hand {{than he had ever}} yet made. As I gave him the bat he looked brave, but something wet fell <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> then a sudden fear seized me lest David should not win.|$|R
