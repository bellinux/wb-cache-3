40|$|Computing {{the natural}} <b>join</b> <b>of</b> {{a set of}} {{relations}} is an important operation in relational database systems. The ordering <b>of</b> <b>joins</b> determines {{to a large extent}} the computation time <b>of</b> the <b>join.</b> Since the number of possible orderings could be very large, query optimizers first reduce the search space by using various heuristics and then try to select an optimal ordering <b>of</b> <b>joins.</b> Avoiding Cartesian products is a common heuristic for reducing the search space, but it cannot guarantee optimal ordering in its search space, because the cheapest Cartesian-product-free (CPF, for short) ordering could be significantly worse than an optimal non-CPF ordering by a factor of an arbitrarily large number. In this paper, we use programs consisting <b>of</b> <b>joins,</b> semijoins, and projections for computing the <b>join</b> <b>of</b> some relations, and we introduce a novel algorithm that derives programs from CPF orderings <b>of</b> <b>joins.</b> We show that there exists a CPF ordering from which our algorithm derives a program whose co [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} is an information technology infrastructure capable of processing theoretically unlimited sequences of data commonly called as data streams. dA heterogeneous sensor network consists of sensing nodes creating the streams of atomic data items and clustering nodes joining several data streams into one stream of complex data items and performing the preliminary data processing. This work investigates the microprogramming implementation <b>of</b> <b>join</b> operation at the clustering nodes. We define a data stream join operation and we prove {{that it can be}} computed in an incremental way. Then, we propose a number of optimisation techniques for its processing. The micro implementation <b>of</b> <b>join</b> operation on 8 -bit microprocessor controller with memory and interfacing ports is derived from the incremental processing algorithm.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} we present a {{technique}} for the parallel optimisation <b>of</b> <b>join</b> queries, that uses the offered coarse-grain parallelism of the underlying architecture {{in order to reduce}} the CPU-bound optimisation overhead. The optimisation technique performs an almost exhaustive search of the solution space for small join queries and gradually, as the number <b>of</b> <b>joins</b> increases, it diverges towards iterative improvement. This technique has been developed on a low-parallelism transputer-based architecture, where its behaviour is studied for the optimisation of queries with many tenths <b>of</b> <b>joins.</b> ...|$|R

Explicit formulae for a polyadic decomposition (i. e., a linear combination of rank- 1 tensors) and a tensor-train decomposition <b>of</b> <b>join</b> tensors are derived on general join semilattices. We discuss conditions under which the obtained decompositions are optimal in rank, and examine numerically the storage complexity of the obtained decompositions for a class of LCM tensors as a special case <b>of</b> <b>join</b> tensors. In addition, we investigate numerically the sharpness of a theoretical upper bound on the tensor eigenvalues of LCM tensors. Comment: 21 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Different {{types of}} data skew can result in load {{imbalance}} in the context <b>of</b> parallel <b>joins</b> under the shared nothing architecture. We study one important type <b>of</b> skew, <b>join</b> product skew (JPS). A static approach based on frequency classes is proposed which takes for granted the data distribution <b>of</b> <b>join</b> attribute values. It comes from the observation that the join selectivity can be expressed as a sum of products of frequencies <b>of</b> the <b>join</b> attribute values. As a consequence, an appropriate assignment <b>of</b> <b>join</b> sub-tasks that takes into consideration {{the magnitude of the}} frequency products can alleviate the join product skew.
