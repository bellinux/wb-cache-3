40|$|OBJECTIVE : To {{assess the}} {{awareness}} and attitude towards AIDS and PLHA in slum dwellers of Chennai, an Indian metropolis by KAP (Knowledge, Attitude, Practice) study. METHODS : A cross sectional {{study was conducted}} in a representative sample of 650 subjects (400 females and 250 females), aged 15 - 45 years, by means of a questionnaire in the local dialect Tamil. RESULTS : The overall literacy rate was 64 &#x 0025;, with males being 70 &#x 0025; and females being 60 &#x 0025; literate. 20 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 11 &#x 0025; of females do not know about a disease called AIDS. Only 67 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 55 &#x 0025; of females are aware of the sexual mode of transmission. 34 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 50 &#x 0025; females opine that AIDS is also a hereditary disease. Also 45 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 62 &#x 0025; of females feel that AIDS also spreads by air, fomites, or mosquito-bite. Only 30 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 22 &#x 0025; females know about the possible symptoms of AIDS. 30 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 45 &#x 0025; of females never ask for a new syringe if not provided, as they are totally unaware of its significance. 43 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 78 &#x 0025; of females do not know about the risk of a barber&#x 2032;s blade. 56 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 71 &#x 0025; of females feel that AIDS can be treated at least by a traditional medicine. Lastly, 48 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 60 &#x 0025; females prefer outcasting an AIDS patient from the slum. CONCLUSIONS : AIDS awareness in the slum dwellers of Chennai is very poor. Corresponding awareness in suburbs and rural areas will be much worse. Conventional IEC methods targeting general population via mass media are not reaching the slum dwellers, even in a metropolitan city. A specially designed targeted intervention is needed...|$|R
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors <b>of</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to establish the frequency of hyperlipoproteinemia, as well as the distribution of desired, elevated and high risk values of certain lipid status parameters among working population of the Gradiška municipality with age and sex distribution. Material and methods This investigation included 250 workers, 109 <b>male</b> <b>and</b> 141 female, 25 - 60 years of age of the Gradiška municipality on a regular checkup. Standard biochemical methods were used to determine values of total serum cholesterol, triglyceride and HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol and LDL to HDL cholesterol ratio were calculated. Results Total serum cholesterol was elevated in 44. 04 % <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 44. 68 % of females, triglyceride in 20. 02 % <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 19. 15 % of females and LDL cholesterol in 31. 96 % <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 21. 43 % of females. High risk values of total cholesterol were established in 43. 12 % <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 39. 01 % of females, and of triglyceride in 37. 61 % <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 9. 93 % of females. HDL cholesterol was decreased in 55. 96 % <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 41. 84 % of females, while highly decreased values were established only in 5. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 1. 42 % of females. Increase of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol correlated with workers' age, but values of triglyceride did not. Hyperlipoproteinemia was evident in 76. 4 % of examinees. Discussion All tested parameters vary dramatically from desired levels. These results are probably associated with unhealthy food habits and lifestyle. Conclusion Our results point to the need to perform regular laboratory diagnostic procedures and routine check-ups in the working population...|$|R

5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments <b>of</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
5|$|During 1977 the World Meteorological Organization {{decided to}} form a {{hurricane}} committee, which held its first meeting during May 1978 and {{took control of the}} Atlantic hurricane naming lists. During 1978 the Secretary of Commerce Juanita Kreps ordered NOAA administrator Robert White to cease the sole usage of female names for hurricanes. Robert White subsequently passed the order on to the Director of NHC Neil Frank, who attended the first meeting of the hurricane committee and requested that both men’s and women’s names be used for the Atlantic. The committee subsequently decided to accept the proposal and adopted five new lists <b>of</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female names to be used the following year. The lists also contained several Spanish and French names, so that they could reflect the cultures and languages used within the Atlantic Ocean. After an agreement was reached between Mexico and the United States, six new sets of male/female names were implemented for the Eastern Pacific basin during 1978. A new list was also drawn up during the year for the Western Pacific and was implemented after Typhoon Bess and the 1979 tropical cyclone conference.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads <b>of</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E

5|$|On 14 January 1882, Maria Deraismes was {{initiated}} into Freemasonry in Loge Libre Penseurs (Freethinkers Lodge), in Le Pecq, just outside Paris. Deraismes was a well known writer and campaigner for democracy, women's rights, and {{the separation of}} church and state. Her lodge, on 9 January, had seceded from la Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise in order to initiate her. She then resigned, to enable her lodge to rejoin their previous jurisdiction. She did, however, persist in her efforts to legitimately become a mason, with the assistance of Doctor Georges Martin, a fellow campaigner for women's rights, and a Freemason. After a decade of trying they started to form their own lodge, and between 1 June 1892 and 4 March 1893, assembled 16 women who wished to become masons. They were initiated as Apprentices on 14 March 1893, Companions on 24 March, and Master Masons on 1 April. This done, on 4 April the now mixed lodge <b>of</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female masons proceeded to elect its officers and constitute itself as La Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise de France, Le Droit Humain, soon to become l’Ordre Maçonnique Mixte International Le Droit Humain. This would flourish as international co-masonry, which Deraismes never lived to see. She died the following February.|$|E

5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union <b>of</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePhlebotomus papatasi (Diptera: Psychodidae) is the Old World {{sand fly}} vector of {{zoonotic}} cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major (Trypanosomatidae: Kinetoplastida), a debilitating and disfiguring protist parasitic disease prevalent throughout southern Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, {{as well as}} southern and eastern European countries, where it {{is regarded as a}} serious public health problem. Little is known of the mating ecology of P. papatasi, and, in particular, the role (if any) of pheromones is not known. In this laboratory- and field-based study, we have shown that a male-produced sex pheromone exists in P. papatasi. Young female P. papatasi are attracted to the headspace volatiles of small groups <b>of</b> <b>males,</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females together, but not females alone. Males were not attracted to males, females, or mixed groups <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females in the laboratory. Larger groups <b>of</b> <b>males</b> or <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females together were repellent in the laboratory study. Field experiments showed that Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps baited with small groups <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females together were attractive to females, but not males. CDC traps baited with large groups <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females together caught significantly fewer females <b>and</b> <b>males</b> than the control traps; however, the proportion of females caught compared with males overall was much higher than with CDC traps baited with small numbers <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females. These results suggest that females may be attracted in preference to males to the vicinity of the baited traps and are highly sensitive to the concentration <b>of</b> <b>male</b> pheromone. It also suggests that P. papatasi mating behavior is fundamentally different from that of Lutzomyia longipalpis, where large mating aggregations <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females occur...|$|R
