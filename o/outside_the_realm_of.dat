5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} of atomic bombs lay <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> the Ministry of Defence. One reason for this was that it was only created in October 1946, by which time Portal had already been appointed as CPAE. Tizard became the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted to gain some control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was answerable to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy.|$|E

One manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in deductive reasoning, {{which leads to the}} development of hypothetical thinking. This provides the ability to plan ahead, see the future consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason against a friend's or parent's assumptions. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.|$|E

25|$|Critiques such {{as those}} based on the {{distinction}} between theory and fact are often leveled against unifying concepts within scientific disciplines. Principles such as uniformitarianism, Occam's razor or parsimony, and the Copernican principle are {{claimed to be the}} result of a bias within science toward philosophical naturalism, which is equated by many creationists with atheism. In countering this claim, philosophers of science use the term methodological naturalism to refer to the long-standing convention in science of the scientific method. The methodological assumption is that observable events in nature are explained only by natural causes, without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, and therefore supernatural explanations for such events are <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> science. Creationists claim that supernatural explanations should not be excluded and that scientific work is paradigmatically close-minded.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Sassanian Persian dynasty {{fell to the}} Muslims (in 651 AD), the Nava Vihara monastery in Balkh came under Muslim rule (in 663 AD), but the monastery {{continued}} to function {{for at least another}} century. In 715 AD, after an insurrection in Balkh was crushed by the Abbasid Caliphate, many Persian Buddhist monks fled east along the Silk Road to the Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan, which spoke a related Eastern Iranian language, and onward into China. Nava Vihara's hereditary administrators, the Persian Barmakids, converted from Buddhism to Islam after the monastery's conquest and became powerful viziers under the Abbassid caliphs of Baghdad. The last of the family's line of viziers, Ja'far ibn Yahya, is a protagonist in many tales from the Arabian Nights.

The film shows the G30S leadership as ruthless and planning [...] "every move to the last detail", taking joy in using excessive violence and torturing the generals, depictions which have been read as portraying [...] "the state's enemies as <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> the human".|$|E

500|$|The PKI {{are portrayed}} as enjoying violence, with the film heavily {{featuring}} [...] "eye-gouging women and decomposed, tortured bodies". The generals are kidnapped, and in several cases killed, {{in front of their}} families; later the captured generals are tortured while the communists dance around a bonfire. The sociologist Adrian Vickers suggests that the film's violence was meant to portray [...] "the state's enemies as <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> the human", similar to monsters in horror films. Yoseph Yapi Taum of Sanata Dharma University notes that members of the leftist women's movement Gerwani are shown as part of a [...] "crazy" [...] Communist Party, dancing in the nude and cutting off the general's penises. However, Vickers considers these portrayals as ambiguous, suggesting that the New Order government was allowed a monopoly on violence. McGregor suggests that the violence in once-tranquil homes shows the [...] "'destruction' of the family". Sen notes the violence belies a [...] "representation of chaos before order" [...] which is common in New Order films.|$|E

She tries to find Laura again nine years after college, and escapes a deranged woman who has a fixation on her, a reflection of a relationship Bannon had with a beautiful, but [...] "very bewildered and unstable person." [...] Beth writes to an author of lesbian books in New York, and goes to meet her in hope of finding Laura. They have a brief relationship, after which Beth finds Laura married to Jack and with a child, then discovers Beebo as well. A fifth book, The Marriage, also {{published in}} 1960, again addresses issues of love <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> socially acceptable relationships, although it is not primarily about homosexuality.

500|$|Assault is {{a summary}} offence in England and Wales, {{with the case}} heard only at a Magistrates' Court. Although R v Little {{considered}} assault a statutory offence, none of the statutes referred to contain any definition of assault. The actus reus, endorsed in R v Ireland, is any act by D that causes V to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. The term [...] "force" [...] rather than [...] "violence" [...] {{is used by the}} Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). As a definition, this has proven stable, but its interpretation has varied. The force must be unlawful [...] <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> defensive or preventative force, for example. Consent of the victim may be enough to prevent the commission of a crime. There is to debate as to whether lack of consent is an element of the actus reus, making it inherent to the commission of a crime, or whether consent is a defence. Andrew Simester and Bob Sullivan argue that the former is more correct, since lack on consent is vital to the crime; since the act may not constitute a harm even if enacted. The disregard for the victim's autonomy and privacy is the actionable part of the offence. The victim need not be frightened by the apprehension of violence, merely not want the person concerned to do it.|$|E
