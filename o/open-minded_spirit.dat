40|$|Teacher {{research}} has been concerned with the generation of knowledge and voice for more than 70 years; teachers are {{invited to join the}} academic dialogue by becoming researchers them-selves. Yet the promised fusion of communities seems as distant as ever. I want to suggest that for these two solitudes to be brought together, the emphasis needs to change from the genera-tion of knowledge to dialogue about what counts as knowledge. Using the work of the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin (1895 - 1975), I argue for dialogic research. In making my case, I present a research problem that was investigated by a group of school administrators and teachers, sketch the previous response of the research community to that issue, take a brief detour through Bakhtin's literary theory, and then show how each of the conceptual resources that he supplies—polyphony, chronotope and carnival—affected the research project and the ensuing dia-logue about knowledge and its relationship to practice. Educational Researcher, Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 4 - 13 It is my firm belief that the emancipation and profession-alizing of the teacher's calling rests far more on the origi-nality, insight, and expertness which the teacher evinces than upon any considerations having to do with salary, tenure, or legal status. Society cannot be compelled to re-spect anybody or anything. The surest way to win respect is to be respectable [...] [Nothing] would so effectively ob-tain for the teaching body the possession of professional expertness [...] . as the open-eyed, <b>open-minded,</b> scientific <b>spirit</b> of inquiry.

40|$|We {{would like}} to express our heartfelt {{gratitude}} to everyone who supported us through our work on this project, both directly and indirectly. First of all, thanks to Allah Almighty for giving us the courage and power to accomplish this project. We {{would like to}} thank our supervisor, Eng. Eman Alajramy, for her optimistic and <b>open-minded</b> research <b>spirit</b> and methods and for her constant guidance, inspiration, generous help, support and patience throughout the development of this project. We have encountered many difficulties during the work on the project, Eng. Eman Alajramy has had the wisdom to point us in the right direction, yet allow us to find our own answers. We would like also to thank our friends at the University of Palestine for making the best of the worst times during our study. Finally, and most importantly, {{none of this would have}} been possible without the love and patience of our families, our fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. Without their unconditional love, faith and unimaginable patience, this project would never have been possible. Nowadays mobile applications are the most important thing in people life because it helped assigning several aspects of our life to it like entertainment, sociality, health, and etc. life Scheduler is a mobile app developed to help people manage and organize their daily tasks and activities. This research aims to provide a mobile application that helps people managing and organizing their tasks. Because of the fast growing and development of the life around us the tasks that we want to do are increasing, so we might forget some of them or we don’t have enough time to manage them which can affect on our life from different sides, so this app came to solve this problem. Extreme programming software development methodology was followed to develop this app, that the functional and non-functional requirements were defined form looking on other similar apps, that we have collected the most important features to the user and adding the new features to contribute with new useful things. Then the functional and non-functional requirements are formed and analyzed using different UML techniques such as use-case diagrams, sequence diagrams and activity diagrams. The design of the system is then presented and analyzed using class diagram, database schema and ER diagram, that was used in implementing the app. Then the app was tested to see if it meets the user specifications, and the results proved that the app works well. Then a user evaluation was conducted using questionnaire to measure the degree of user acceptance about the app, and the results proved that the app is useful and can be launched in the market but need some more improvements.

In the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber. Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an exploration, {{conducted}} in the <b>open-minded</b> <b>spirit</b> of humanistic geography, of the geographical meanings of the personal garden space as it is portrayed in selected contemporary personal gardening literature. Through an interpretive framework based on three geographical metaphors [...] -the personal garden as a microcosm, landscape, and place [...] -the personal garden revealed itself to be a cultural, social and personal space, essentially human, {{as well as a}} biological, ecological and environmental space, essentially nonhuman. This fundamental human-nonhuman duality {{at the core of the}} personal garden reflects the human-physical duality at the heart of the discipline of geography, as such making the personal garden a space of particular geographical significance. This thesis adds a new type of literature, personal gardening books, to geographical inquiry and contributes to growing geographical dialogue on the topic of personal gardens.

30|$|All these {{previous}} points {{raise the}} need for usefully critical research and writing. As the articles in this special issue show, being critical of digital technology in higher education does not entail a blanket dismissal of all things technological. It is all too easy for people to slip into dystopian fears of universities being ruined beyond repair by developments in digital education. Moreover, academic critique of digital higher education should not be conducted with a ‘moralizing undertone’ (Massumi, 2015, p. 14). As Banks and Deuze (2009, p. 425) warn, critical academic observers are not somehow “lifting the veil from the eyes of otherwise hapless participants”. Students, staff and institutions {{who are involved in}} the forms of digital education described above are certainly not ‘dupes’ whose failings are only apparent to the outside academic observer. Thus, critical accounts of higher education and technology should strive to offer different - rather than better - perspectives on the topic. Critical scholars should not be dismissive or discounting of other approaches. As Rita Felski (2015) reminds us, just because other work is not critical does not mean that it is uncritical. Thus, critical studies need to be conducted in a generous, <b>open-minded</b> <b>spirit</b> if they are to find a place in the general educational technology firmament.|$|E
