5|$|The process <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> is easiest {{with two}} rats of young age, {{generally}} {{less than six}} months old. The process <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> is most difficult with two or more adult male rats, as adult males are the least likely to accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established. Unless there is an issue integrating rats together, owners should always keep them in a group of at least three, as rats live in packs and a pack starts with three animals.|$|E
5|$|As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was {{instrumental}} in turning French policy away from the Gaullist policy of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> Germany into a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence. Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality of states (international democracy), not the power politics of domination.|$|E
5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this case study {{research}} {{was to develop a}} theoretical model <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> reporting for Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed companies. Design/Methodology/Approach – The goal of this case study research was to understand how and why integrated reports are prepared, to develop a theoretical model <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> reporting for JSE listed companies through literature review and analysis <b>of</b> published <b>integrated</b> reports. In addition, to investigate the perceived success <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> reporting by examining its requirements, objectives, enforceability and implications to the listed companies. Based on the above, to determine how companies fulfil the requirements <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> reporting and what those requirements are. To determine by comparing published <b>integrated</b> reports <b>of</b> companies, similarities or comparability of the information published on integrated reports ascertaining the measurability {{of the success of the}} application <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> reporting. Practical implications – This case study research provides a useful insight into drivers <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> reporting. Limitations to the study – The lack of responses from industry experts contacted for interviews considered a limitation in validating the outcome of the study.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, toll roads were gaining in {{popularity}} {{as a mechanism}} for funding new superhighways. This trend started with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940, which was mimicked by other toll roads in New York, New Jersey, several New England states, Ohio, and Colorado. In October 1951, the Highway Council of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce researched the possibility <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> the state into a potential cross-country turnpike system. Eastern Kansas was also included in an interstate turnpike system stretching from Galveston, Texas to Saint Louis, Missouri, via Kansas City, that was proposed by Oklahoma governor Johnston Murray. Many firms from construction industries, {{as well as those}} concerned about the state's economic development, worked to have legislation passed to allow the turnpike to be constructed. Governor Ed Arn and Gale Moss, the State Highway Director, were two major proponents of the turnpike concept.|$|E

5|$|After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, {{began the}} process <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> that institution, which had denied {{entrance}} to several well-regarded African American performers based solely on their race, including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, {{who had been the}} first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced to study with Frank Bibb, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A. Jack Thomas, at his request. The Peabody was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter the Peabody Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions for African American and white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. Baltimore is the hometown of African American classical opera tenor Steven Cole.|$|E
5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
