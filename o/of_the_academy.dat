5|$|French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur {{originally}} {{described the}} bluntnose stingray from specimens collected in Little Egg Harbor off the U.S. State of New Jersey.

In 1841, German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle erroneously gave the specific epithet as sayi in their Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, which thereafter became the typical spelling used in literature. Recently, there has been a push to use the correct original spelling again, though it has also been proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) officially emend the spelling to sayi, for consistency with previous usage.|$|E
