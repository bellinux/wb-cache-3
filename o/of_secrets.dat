5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber <b>of</b> <b>Secrets</b> is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E

Furthermore, this secret communication helped them become aware <b>of</b> the <b>secret</b> dimension not only of language but also of human action.

5|$|Harry Potter and the Chamber <b>of</b> <b>Secrets</b> was {{published}} in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999. It immediately took first place in UK best-seller lists, displacing popular authors such as John Grisham, Tom Clancy, and Terry Pratchett, and making Rowling the first author to win the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year for two years in succession. In June 1999, it went straight to the top of three US best-seller lists, including The New York Times.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Chamber <b>of</b> <b>Secrets</b> won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize 1998 Gold Medal in the 9–11 years division.

However, Biblical records also show evidence <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> greetings or handshakes.

5|$|More recently, giant spiders have {{featured}} in {{books such as}} the 1998 fantasy novel Harry Potter and the Chamber <b>of</b> <b>Secrets</b> by J. K. Rowling. This book was later followed by a motion picture of the same name, using the giant spider Aragog from the novel as a supporting character and pet of grounds keeper, Hagrid. In Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a book about many of the creatures within the Harry Potter universe, these giant spiders are also known as Acromantulas.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to class, {{death and}} its impacts, {{experiencing}} adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant {{themes of the}} series.

According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.|$|E

40|$|Using a new {{approach}} relying on news wire reports, we estimate the proportion <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> interventions (i. e., unreported official interventions) in the foreign exchange markets that have been conducted by the three major central banks since 1985. We therefore revisit the estimation of conditional probabilities <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> operations and compute them by both central bank and operation type. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> interventions {{is found to be}} lower for concerted operations and to display a great deal of variability over time as well as across the three major central banks...|$|R

Using the recent experience of the Bank of Japan, we estimate a model that explains the share <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> to reported interventions in the FX market. Two sets of determinants are clearly identified: the first {{is related to the}} probability of detection of the central bank orders by market participants; the second to the central bank’s internal decision to opt for secrecy. Our estimations support the arguments of current microstructure theories that rationalize the use <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> interventions...|$|R
5|$|The {{first film}} in J. K.
