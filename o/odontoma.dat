50|$|An <b>odontoma</b> (also termed odontome) is {{a benign}} tumour of odontogenic origin (i.e. linked to tooth development). Specifically, it is a dental hamartoma, {{meaning that it}} is {{composed}} of normal dental tissue that has grown in an irregular way.|$|E
40|$|<b>Odontomas</b> are {{the most}} common benign, slow-growing and nonaggressive odontogenic tumors of the jaws. They are usually {{clinically}} asymptomatic and are diagnosed on routine radiological examination in the second decade of life.

40|$|Background: <b>Odontomas</b> {{are among}} the most common benign odontogenic tumors, which are mostly {{discovered}} in the first and second decades of life with no clear sex predilection. Materials and Methods: The present retrospective study reviews the clinical, radiological, and the histopathological characteristics of <b>odontomas</b> in 19 Libyan patients seen during the last 18 years in our department. Results: Most <b>odontomas</b> in our study were discovered when they obstruct a tooth from an eruption at its normal eruption time although a few cases were noticed on routine radiological examination of the region. Panoramic radiographs computed Tomography Scan of the area and the histopathological examination are helpful to elicit the diagnosis. Two cases in this series were found associating with dentigerous cyst and in another two cases the <b>odontomas</b> were seen erupting intraorally. Conclusion: <b>Odontomas</b> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the mixed radioopaque radiolucent lesions, especially if they found obstructing the teeth from eruption...|$|R
40|$|<b>Odontomas</b> are {{the most}} common odontogenic tumours. They are {{considered}} as hamartomas - a local tissue malformation without autonomous growth potential - and are non-neoplastic. Clinically and histopathologically, compound and complex <b>odontomas</b> can be differentiated. Compound <b>odontomas</b> consist of a varying number of tooth-like structures and histology show dental tissues in an orderly pattern. Most often compound <b>odontomas</b> are diagnosed in young patients in the anterior maxilla. Patients are rarely complaining of symptoms and they are usually diagnosed during routine radiographic examinations or due to late eruption of permanent or persistence of deciduous teeth. The following case report presents a disturbed eruption of a lateral right incisor of the maxilla in a 8 -year old female patient. Clinical, radiological and histopathological characteristics of this lesion will be discussed as well as therapy and follow-up. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The {{average age}} of people found with an <b>odontoma</b> is 14. The {{condition}} is frequently associated {{with one or more}} unerupted teeth. Though most cases are found impacted within the jaw there are instances where odontomas have erupted into the oral cavity.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compound}} <b>odontoma</b> {{still has}} the three separate dental tissues (enamel, dentin and cementum), but may present a lobulated appearance {{where there is no}} definitive demarcation of separate tissues between the individual [...] "toothlets" [...] (or denticles). It usually appears in the anterior maxilla.|$|E
50|$|This {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} clustering of teeth (compound <b>odontoma,</b> dysplasia and aplasia of teeth), slight craniofacial abnormalities, and dysphagia. The dysphagia {{may be due to}} an over growth of muscle tissue or strictures in the oesophagus. Benign tumors (odontomas) may form at the roots of the teeth.|$|E
40|$|Objective and background: <b>Odontomas</b> are hamartomatous {{developmental}} malformations of {{the dental}} tissues. We present a retrospective study of recent clinical experience using erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) (wavelength 2940 nm) and chromium-doped yttrium scandium gallium garnet lasers (Er,Cr:YSSG) (wavelength 2780 nm) for the surgical treatment of these lesions, and score postsurgical pain. Materials and methods: This retrospective study comprised 35 <b>odontomas</b> treated at the Department of Oral Pathology and Laser-Assisted Surgery, San Martino Hospital, University of Genoa, Italy. Of 35 Caucasian patients (23 male, 12 female; ages 8 - 35; <b>odontomas</b> localized at various oral subsites) those in Group 1 (n= 25) had <b>odontomas</b> excised by laser (Er:YAG laser operating at 2940 nm, pulse width 100 msec, curved handpiece, truncated cone HPX tip, 400 μm with energy output 250 - 400 mJ per pulse, frequency 15 Hz; and Er, Cr: YSGG laser, power 3. 5 W, frequency 20 Hz, 55 % air/ 45 % water spray, H (hard tissue) mode, pulse width 190 - 750 μsec variable). In Group 2 (n= 10) <b>odontomas</b> were excised by conventional surgery. Pain {{was assessed using}} a visual analog scale (VAS). Clinical outcome was determined at 6 - 12 months. Results: Complete responses were achieved in 100 % of the laser-treated <b>odontomas,</b> which compares favorably with reported results of conventional surgery. A statistically significant difference in VAS score was found between patients treated with traditional scalpel surgery (median= 4. 00) and those who underwent laser surgery (median= 3. 00).

5000|$|The calcifying {{epithelial}} odontogenic tumor, {{also known}} as a Pindborg tumor or CEOT, is an odontogenic tumor first recognized by the Danish pathologist Jens Jørgen Pindborg in 1955. [...] It was previously described as an adenoid adamantoblastoma, unusual ameloblastoma and a cystic <b>odontoma.</b> [...] Like other odontogenic neoplasms, it is thought to arise from the epithelial element of the enamel origin.|$|E
50|$|Composite <b>odontoma</b> {{is a rare}} {{defect in}} humans in which a benign tumor forms in the mouth, {{generally}} {{as a result of}} the abnormal growth of a single tooth, causing additional teeth to form within the tumor. Most cases have been found in the upper jaw of patients. Unchecked growth of the tumor can make swallowing and eating difficult, and can also lead to grotesque facial swelling.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, {{surgery is}} {{required}} to remove the extra teeth and tumorous tissue. Prior to 2014, the maximum recorded number of teeth removed in such an operation was 37. However, in July 2014 Ashiq Gavai, a 17-year-old boy in India, suffered from an extreme case of composite <b>odontoma</b> in his lower jaw, which required the removal of more than 232 teeth altogether. The surgery was performed by Dr. Sunanda Dhiware at Sir J. J. Hospital in Mumbai, India.|$|E
40|$|The term ‘Dilated Odontoma’ is a {{malformation}} {{which most}} frequently {{occurs in the}} deciduous, permanent or supernumerary teeth. It can be diagnosed with deep invagination of the enamel inside the crown or root. In other words, the most extreme form of dens in the dente is known as “dilated odontoma”. Although dilated <b>odontomas</b> are usually asymptomatic, their eruption into the mouth can give rise to pain, inflammation, and infection. This report {{is an attempt to}} describe the case of a 22 -year-old female presenting with bilateral cystic lesions associated with erupted dilated <b>odontomas</b> of the maxilla. The patient had no history of pain but she complained about a recurrent swelling which she was suffering from for about two years. Conventional radiographs showed bilateral cystic lesions associated with dilated <b>odontomas.</b> The findings were also confirmed by Dent Scan. The treatment plan consisted of surgical removal of the lesions, followed by histopathologic study in order to confirm the initial diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Osteopetrosis is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease in several mammalian species. Osteopetrotic op/op rats suffer from complete failure of tooth eruption related to reduced bone resorption.

5000|$|Talon Cusp {{is a rare}} dental anomaly. Generally {{a person}} with this {{develops}} [...] "cusp-like" [...] projections located on the inside surface of the affected tooth. Talon cusp is an extra cusp on an anterior tooth. Other names for talon cusp is eagle's talon, dens evaginatus, interstitial cusp, tuberculated premolar, evaginated <b>odontoma</b> and supernumerary cusp. Although talon cusp may not appear serious (and in some people may be completely benign), it can cause clinical, diagnostic, functional problems and alters the aesthetic appeal.|$|E
50|$|An ameloblastic fibroma is a fibroma of the ameloblastic tissue, that is, an odontogenic tumor {{arising from}} the enamel organ or dental lamina. It may be either truly {{neoplastic}} or merely hamartomatous (an <b>odontoma).</b> In neoplastic cases, it may be labeled an ameloblastic fibrosarcoma {{in accord with the}} terminological distinction that reserves the word fibroma for benign tumors and assigns the word fibrosarcoma to malignant ones. It is more common in the first and second decades of life, when odontogenesis is ongoing, than in later decades. In 50% of cases an unerupted tooth is involved.|$|E
40|$|<b>Odontoma</b> {{is a mixed}} odontogenic {{neoplasm}} {{composed of}} epithelial and mesenchymal tissues.
