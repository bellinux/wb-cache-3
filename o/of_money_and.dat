Pohl was unscrupulous and quickly exploited the companies for personal gain. In contrast, Himmler was honest in matters <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> business.|$|E

No.A816 was released for more trials, and produced performances well-below those displayed by the unmodified members of the class. The experiment was ended when the system's developers ran out <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> the locomotive was converted back to standard form between May and August 1935, re-entering service as No.1816.|$|E

5|$|The {{last year}} of Schubert's life was marked by growing public acclaim for the composer's works, {{but also by the}} gradual {{deterioration}} of his health. On March 26, 1828, together with other musicians in Vienna, Schubert gave a public concert of his own works, which was a great success and earned him a considerable profit. In addition, two new German publishers took an interest in his works, leading to a short period of financial well-being. However, by the time the summer months arrived, Schubert was again short <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> had to cancel some journeys he had previously planned.|$|E

Monk finds the same glitter he found on Cullman's hair in the gun and argues the thief stole the watch to replace his one, deducing that the same person committed both crimes.|$|E
