5|$|Although shoe polish is {{primarily}} intended for leather shoes, some brands specify {{that they may}} be used on non-porous materials, such as vinyl. The polish is generally the same colour as the shoes it will be used upon, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be neutral, lacking any intrinsic colour.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{may occur}} {{directly}} under the site of impact, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> occur on the side opposite the impact (coup and contrecoup injury, respectively). When a moving object impacts the stationary head, coup injuries are typical, while contrecoup injuries are usually produced when the moving head strikes a stationary object.|$|E

5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} can be {{produced}} by mechanical (e.g. pinching) or chemical (e.g. inflammation) stimulation of specialized pain-signalling nerve endings found {{in most parts of}} the body (called nociceptive pain), <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be caused by diseased, damaged or compressed nerves, in which case it is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often accompanied by other feelings such as pins and needles.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles {{are highly}} {{vulnerable}} to being eaten by fish, newts, predatory diving beetles, and birds, such as kingfishers. Some tadpoles, {{including those of}} the cane toad (Bufo marinus), are poisonous. The tadpole stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in the spring.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E

5|$|As {{its name}} implies, Parasaurolophus was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} closely related to Saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest. However, it was soon reassessed {{as a member of}} the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids—Saurolophus is an hadrosaurine. It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines, distinct from the helmet-crested Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and Lambeosaurus. Its closest known relative appears to be Charonosaurus, a lambeosaurine with a similar skull (but no complete crest yet) from the Amur region of northeastern China, and the two may form a clade Parasaurolophini. P. cyrtocristatus, with its short, rounder crest, may be the most basal of the three known Parasaurolophus species, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> represent subadult or female specimens of P. tubicen.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E

5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{be interpreted as a}} mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Equal {{protection}} {{may have}} seemed inapt to the litigants or to the Court for a case of sex discrimination in 1942, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have seemed inapt for a case of cross-group challenge. The Sixth Amendment was not again invoked by the Supreme Court against jury discrimination for thirty years; the Sixth Amendment did not (yet) apply to state juries, and in federal cases the Court seemed to prefer its supervisory power over lower federal courts.|$|E
5|$|Foliot was Becket's rival for the Archbishopric of Canterbury. He {{objected to}} the king's choice {{on the grounds that}} Becket was too worldly, the only bishop or magnate known to have opposed the king's choice. When the newly elected {{archbishop}} was presented to the court before his consecration, Foliot remarked that the king had performed a miracle by turning a layman and a knight into an archbishop. Soon after Becket's consecration the king wrote to the pope asking for permission to make Foliot the royal confessor. This may have been a conciliatory move to appease Foliot after the loss of Canterbury, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been that the king and the new archbishop were already having differences of opinion and the king wished Foliot to be a counter-weight to Becket's influence.|$|E

5|$|Nico Ditch was {{constructed}} some {{time between the}} end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman conquest in 1066. Its original purpose is unclear, but it may have been used as a defensive fortification or as an administrative boundary. It possibly marked a 7th-century boundary for the expansionist Anglo-Saxons, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been a late 8th or early 9th century boundary marker between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. In the early medieval period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex struggled for control over North West England, along with the Britons and the Danes. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch {{has been used as a}} boundary since at least the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The church {{features}} two stories: {{while the}} upper story {{was certainly the}} church proper and the place of liturgy, {{the role of the}} lower story is unclear. Its construction may have been necessitated due to the unfavourable rocky terrain, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have served as a tomb or a storage facility. The latter is considered more likely because no human remains have been discovered inside, even though the lower stories of similar churches were commonly used as tombs.|$|E
5|$|The {{many forms}} of dance provide {{entertainment}} for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when {{it is used to}} express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> put in the service of comedy. Since it combines {{many forms of}} entertainment music, movement, storytelling, theatre it provides {{a good example of the}} various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.|$|E

5|$|The mycelia (but not {{the fruit}} bodies) of Armillaria gallica {{are known to}} be bioluminescent. Experiments have shown that the {{intensity}} of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to fluorescent light. Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets {{make up the}} endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin {{into the}} bloodstream. There {{is evidence that the}} beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts {{to reduce the amount of}} insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
