5|$|The General Society of Mayflower Descendants, or The Mayflower Society, is a genealogical {{organization}} {{of individuals who}} have documented their descents from {{one or more of}} the 102 passengers who arrived on the Mayflower in 1620. The Society, founded at Plymouth in 1897, claims that tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> descend from these passengers, and it offers research services to people seeking to document such descents.|$|E
25|$|The zooming {{wealth of}} the top one percent is a problem, but it's not nearly as big a problem as the tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> who have {{dropped out of high}} school or college. It's not nearly as big a problem as the 40 percent of {{children}} who are born out of wedlock. It's not nearly as big a problem as the nation's stagnant human capital, its stagnant social mobility and the disorganized social fabric for the bottom 50 percent.|$|E
25|$|However, war-weariness was a {{major factor}} by 1917, even {{reaching}} the army, as soldiers were reluctant to attack—many threatened to mutiny—saying {{it was best to}} wait for the arrival <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> The soldiers were protesting not just the futility of frontal assaults in the face of German machine guns but also degraded conditions at the front lines and at home, especially infrequent leaves, poor food, the use of African and Asian colonials on the home front, and concerns about the welfare of their wives and children.|$|E

50|$|American print {{news media}} focused the nation's {{attention}} on the issue with hard-hitting investigative reports, while television news outlets brought {{the drama of the}} hearings to the living rooms <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> households, broadcasting the proceedings live for two weeks in May 1973.

25|$|Brandeis was {{becoming}} increasingly conscious of and hostile to powerful corporations and {{the trend toward}} bigness in American industry and finance. He argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added {{a new dimension to}} the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. As early as 1895 he had pointed out the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> Although the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was enacted in 1890, {{it was not until the}} 20th century that there was any major effort to apply it.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the trailing}} interest issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. US Senator Carl Levin raised the issue <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, {{who said that he}} intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry. In 2009, the C.A.R.D. Act was signed into law, enacting protections for many of the issues Levin had raised.|$|E
25|$|As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson {{turned his}} focus to {{hospital}} insurance {{for the aged}} under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake—hospital insurance under Social Security, a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house {{by a margin of}} 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee. Medicare now covers tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.|$|E

25|$|In November 2005, Frist {{told reporters}} that he was less {{concerned}} about possible torture at CIA secret prisons than he was about potentially compromising the security <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> Flying home after visiting the Guantanamo Bay detention center he said September 10, 2006 he expects bipartisan support for putting top captured al-Qaeda figures on trial before military commissions and for guidelines on how they should be treated. Frist visited the detention center in eastern Cuba, which holds some 460 detainees, including 14 top alleged al-Qaida figures recently transferred from CIA custody. He stated that his visit with fellow Republicans Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, was especially poignant coming one day short of {{the fifth anniversary of}} the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Frist said that visiting the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, and recognizing that the 14 individuals who likely contributed to the September 11, 2001 attacks were there, led him to realize how critical it is that the U.S. define the appropriate criteria {{to make sure that the}} government have the information to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again. The senators didn't see the 14 new detainees, but visited Guantanamo to learn of the interrogation techniques. In his mind, the detainees are being treated in a safe and humane way.|$|E
2500|$|After The Guardian {{reported}} {{the existence of}} a NSA data-mining program called Boundless Informant in June 2013, Wyden said [...] "Since government officials have repeatedly told the public and Congress that Patriot Act authorities are simply analogous to a grand jury subpoena, and that intelligence agencies do not collect information or dossiers on millions or hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans,</b> I think the executive branch has an obligation to explain whether or not these statements are actually true," [...] according to The Guardian.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2017, Heller held a joint {{press conference}} with Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, where Heller came fervently against the American Health Care Act, the GOP's repeal and {{replacement}} {{bill for the}} Affordable Care Act. Heller {{said that he could}} not support a bill that “that takes away insurance from tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> {{and hundreds of thousands of}} Nevadans.” In July 2017, Heller voted yes to allow debate on legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Two days later, he voted in favor of [...] "skinny" [...] repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The July 2017 attempt to repeal failed when Republican senators John McCain, Susan Collins and Lisa MurkowskiIn voted against the [...] "skinny" [...] repeal proposal. In August 2017, Heller said that [...] "real pleased at the way this thing turned out", referring to having voted in favor of legislation that ultimately failed.

2500|$|The early 1990s {{recession}} came swiftly {{after the}} Black Monday of October 1987, {{resulting from a}} stock collapse of unprecedented size caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall by 22.6%. This collapse, larger than {{the stock market crash}} of 1929, was handled effectively by the global economy and the stock market began to quickly recover. However, in North America, the lumbering savings and loans industry was facing decline which eventually led to a savings and loan crisis which compromised the wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> The following recession thus impacted the many countries closely linked to the United States, including Australia. Paul Keating, who was Prime Minister at the time, famously referred to it as [...] "the recession that Australia had to have." [...] During the recession, GDP fell by 1.7%, employment by 3.4% and the unemployment rate rose to 10.8%. However, the recession did assist in reducing long-term inflation rate expectations and Australia has maintained a low inflation environment since the 1990s to the present day.|$|E
