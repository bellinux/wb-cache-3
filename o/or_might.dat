5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, <b>or</b> <b>might</b> stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs <b>or</b> <b>might</b> have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E

5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders <b>or</b> <b>might</b> have been a disused poacher's lookout, but {{it is more likely that}} despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E
5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, <b>or</b> <b>might</b> insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.|$|E
