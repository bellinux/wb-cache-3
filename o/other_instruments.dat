5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while <b>other</b> <b>instruments</b> were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Between December 18 and December 28, 1995—during {{which time}} Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times—342 {{images of the}} target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total {{exposure}} times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300nm), 33.5 hours (450nm), 30.3 hours (606nm) and 34.3 hours (814nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by cosmic rays, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by <b>other</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E

Full drum sets, a piano, an organ, and various <b>other</b> <b>instruments</b> are frequently used. The type of music sung is generally popular worship choruses, such as those by Calvary Chapel and Hillsong. Worship is often characterized as intense and enthusiastic.|$|E
5|$|Idiophones were {{extremely}} important in Chinese music, hence {{the majority of}} early instruments were idiophones. Poetry of the Shang dynasty mentions bells, chimes, drums, and globular flutes carved from bone, the latter {{of which has been}} excavated and preserved by archaeologists. The Zhou dynasty saw percussion instruments such as clappers, troughs, wooden fish, and yǔ (wooden tiger). Wind instruments such as flute, pan-pipes, pitch-pipes, and mouth organs also appeared in this time period. The xiao (an end-blown flute) and various <b>other</b> <b>instruments</b> that spread through many cultures, came into use in China during and after the Han dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians {{did not exist}} in Israel between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned from the Bible and the Talmud. The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with Jubal: the ugab (pipes) and kinnor (lyre). <b>Other</b> <b>instruments</b> of the period included the tof (frame drum), pa'amon (small bells or jingles), shofar, and the trumpet-like hasosra.|$|E

5|$|In melody-dominated homophony, {{accompanying}} voices provide chordal {{support for}} the lead voice, which assumes the melody. Some popular music today might be considered melody-dominated homophony, voice typically taking on the lead role, while instruments like piano, guitar and bass guitar normally accompany the voice. In many cases, instruments also take on the lead role, and often the role switches between parts, voice taking the lead during a verse and instruments subsequently taking solos, during which the <b>other</b> <b>instruments</b> provide chordal support.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003. This marks {{the point where}} the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt, discussed in the journal Nature of November 6, 2003. The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since Voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the <b>other</b> <b>instruments</b> on board.|$|E
