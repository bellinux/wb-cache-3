2500|$|According to Human Rights Watch, {{one of the}} {{contributing}} factors to the disproportionate rates of mental illness in prisons and jails is {{the increased use of}} solitary confinement, for which [...] "socially and psychologically meaningful contact is reduced to the absolute minimum, to a point that is insufficient for most detainees to remain mentally well functioning". Another factor to be considered is that most inmates do not get the mental health services that they need while incarcerated. Due to limited funding, prisons are not able to provide a full range <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> and thus are typically limited to inconsistent administration of psychotropic medication, or no psychiatric services at all. Human Rights Watch also reports that corrections officers routinely use excessive violence against mentally ill inmates for nonthreatening behaviors related to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Centre for Mental Health issued a 2008 policy paper proposing that the recovery approach is an idea [...] "whose time has come" [...] and, in partnership with the NHS Confederation Mental Health Network, and support and funding from the Department of Health, manages the Implementing Recovery through Organisational Change (ImROC) nationwide project that aims to put recovery at the heart <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> in the UK.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although {{people with}} serious mental illness (SMI) {{have a high}} {{prevalence}} of physical illness, health-related quality of life (HQoL) has not been sufficiently explored. AIM: To explore the self-reported HQoL <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users in New Zealand. METHODS: Responses on the Medical Outcomes Study 36 Item Short Form (SF- 36) measure of HQoL from 404 adult <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users in a metropolitan district health board area in New Zealand were analysed and compared to {{a representative sample of}} the general population. RESULTS: <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users scored significantly lower on all eight domains of the SF- 36 than the general population, the largest difference being in the role limitation — emotional domain.

Future studies should seek to understand the factors contributing to perceptions <b>of</b> HQoL <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users in New Zealand.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the effects <b>of</b> community <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care {{on the quality}} <b>of</b> life <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users in Britain - especially Scotland - and Germany. The analysis is based on current developments in community care policy and practice in the countries of comparison and the perspective <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users in relation to this. The research strategies adopted include qualitative and quantitative methods, in particular a questionnaire survey among <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users in Scotland and in Germany. The examination of outcomes in community care with a specific focus on the concept 'quality of life' shows that {{quality of life is}} useful as an outcome measure for the comparative evaluation of community care from a user perspective. The study develops a model of quality of life which highlights significant components of community care identified as health, housing, employment, finances, support and social contacts. The examination of some of the foundations of health care and social care in Britain and in Germany, and the comparison <b>of</b> specific <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care policies and legislation emphasise distinct national characteristics and fundamental differences concerning themes and issues in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care. Most significantly, the analysis shows a different national emphasis on major policy objectives and concepts such as quality of life or {{on the role of the}} service user. Furthermore, the examination of significant components of community care shows how different national policies can affect support options and general availability in community <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care. The analysis of the views <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users indicates that their quality of life is directly affected by specific national developments and different national approaches in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care. This concerns the availability (or absence) of different support options, but also the role of service users as participants in service provision (Scotland) or rather as recipients of service provision (Germany). The comparison of different national support options and the analysis of user views in relation to this highlights specifically positive and negative effects on the quality <b>of</b> life <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users. Most appreciated by service users are support options that provide opportunity for choice, independence, personal autonomy and fulfilment. The study shows that community based service provision and especially professional support is extremely important to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users and has a direct and vital impact on their quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite high {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems, only {{a minority}} of elderly people seek treatment. Although need-for-care factors are primary determinants <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use, personal predisposing or enabling factors including health beliefs are important but are not well studied. Method In the National <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> Survey <b>of</b> Elderly in Singapore, 2003, 1092 older adults aged 60 and above were interviewed for diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> disorders (using Geriatric Mental State) and treatment, and their health beliefs about the curability <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> illness, embarrassment and stigma, easiness discussing mental problems, effectiveness and safety of treatment and trust in professionals. Results The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> disorders was 13 %, but only a third of mentally ill respondents had sought treatment. Increased likelihood of seeking treatment was significantly associated with the presence <b>of</b> a <b>mental</b> disorder (OR = 5. 27), disability from mental illness (OR = 79. 9), and poor or fair self-rated <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> (OR = 2. 63), female gender (OR = 2. 25), and formal education (OR = 2. 40). The likelihood of treatment seeking was lower in those reporting financial limitations for medical care (OR = 0. 38), but also higher household income (OR = 0. 31). Negative beliefs showed no meaningful associations, but the positive belief that 'to a great extent mental illness can be cured' was associated with increased <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use (OR = 6. 89). The availability of family caregiver showed a negative association (OR = 0. 20). Conclusion The determinants <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use in the elderly included primary need factors, and female gender and socioeconomic factors. There was little evidence of influences by negative health beliefs, but a positive health belief that 'mental illness can be cured' is a strongly positive determinant The influence of family members and care-givers on senior's use <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> should be further explored. </p...|$|R
