40|$|Purpose. Purpose of researching is {{conclusion}} in carry out of mixed empirical and theoretical methodic for determination of quantity {{of the work}} of deformation during profiled upsetting by longitudinal cylindrical plates and finding the functional connection between work <b>of</b> form <b>changing</b> and relative macroindexes of the process. Design/methodology/approach. Subject of research in article is the process of upsetting of billets by convex longitudinal (cylindrical) plates especially energy power characteristics, work <b>of</b> deformation, <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> macroindexes of forming. The energetic methods for determination of specific work of deformation and method of displaced volumes for finding of deformation degree are used. There approach of dependents of work of deformation and two degree <b>of</b> relative form <b>changing</b> indexes is verified in worked researches. Findings. Functional reciprocity connection of macroindexes <b>of</b> the form <b>changing</b> in longitudinal, transverse and altitude directions with specific work of deformation was arranged to example of profiling upsetting of cooper billets by convex cylindrical plates. Regression dependents of macroindexes <b>of</b> the form <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> billets from geometrical and technological parameters were received before this. A <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> consequence of specific work of deformation during profiling upsetting was analyzed. One of local deduction about macroindex <b>of</b> broad <b>changing</b> confirm not depending from relative radius of cylindrical plates and quantity of relation high and diameter of billet consequently have functionally dependence from work of deformation only. Originality/value. Results of research can use for estimation of energetic contain of technology in the design stage, for prognoses <b>of</b> form <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> billets during profiled upsetting and comparable of technique variants for chose of most advantageous. ?????????? ????????????? ????????

5|$|Although Roanoke {{has never}} had {{international}} passenger service, in 2001, the Airport Commission was prepared to change the airport's name to Roanoke International Airport. This was the case as the U.S. Customs Service increased the radius covered by the inland port in Dublin to include Roanoke. This expansion allowed for the airport to add customs officials to accommodate both international travel and cargo to pass through Roanoke's facilities. However, the renaming did not occur {{as a result of}} the economic downturn in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved under the influence <b>of</b> <b>changing</b> climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E
