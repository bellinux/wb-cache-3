5|$|Rindt {{drove his}} first race at the Flugplatzrennen in 1961, in his grandmother's Abarth Simca 2000. After missing the {{official}} application period, he only entered after a friendly high-ranking motorsport functionary from Graz intervened on his behalf. During the race, {{he was black}} flagged for his dangerous driving style and therefore disqualified; he did not immediately return to the pit lane as {{he was unaware of}} the regulations. Rindt entered several rallies with his Simca but did not achieve good results. It was <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was provided with a race-prepared Alfa Romeo GT 1300 at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer that he became more successful. In the Alfa Romeo, he achieved eight victories.|$|E
5|$|Virdon {{returned}} to the Pirates as the hitting coach under Jim Leyland in 1986, Leyland's first season as a manager. He took the position <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was convinced {{that he would not}} succeed Leyland should the Pirates fire him. Following a contract dispute, the Pirates replaced Virdon with Milt May before the 1987 season. Virdon remained with the Pirates as a minor league hitting instructor for the Pirates from 1987 through 1989. He worked as a spring training instructor for the Cardinals in 1990 and 1991, and then rejoined Leyland's coaching staff in Pittsburgh in 1992.|$|E
5|$|At {{the meeting}} with Roosevelt on October 9, 1941, Bush {{advocated}} cooperating with the United Kingdom, and he began corresponding with his British counterpart, Sir John Anderson. But by October 1942, Conant and Bush agreed that a joint project would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage. Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British {{should be limited to}} technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post-war developments. In July 1943, on a visit to London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology, Bush, Stimson and Bundy met with Anderson, Lord Cherwell and Winston Churchill at 10 Downing Street. At the meeting, Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange, while Bush defended current policy. <b>Only</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British. The Quebec Agreement merged the two atomic bomb projects, creating the Combined Policy Committee with Stimson, Bush and Conant as United States representatives.|$|E

5|$|Hancock {{was born}} on 31May 1907 in Perth, Western Australia, and educated at Hale School in Wembley Downs. He was the elder cousin of future mining magnate Lang Hancock. Val Hancock entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1925 and {{graduated}} as senior cadet in 1928, earning the Sword of Honour. His preferred career path in the military was engineering, and it was <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{found that there was}} no vacancy in his corps of choice, and that he had instead been earmarked for the artillery, that he put his name forward for transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in the RAAF on 1February 1929, and undertook flying instruction at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, later that year.|$|E
5|$|Conflict {{between the}} two rivals was renewed in 948, when Mu'izz al-Dawla again marched against Mosul, but was forced to cut off his {{campaign}} to assist his brother Rukn al-Dawla, who was having trouble in Persia. In exchange, Nasir al-Dawla agreed to recommence the payment of tribute for the Jazira and Syria, {{as well as to}} add the names of the three Buyid brothers after that of the Caliph in the Friday prayer. Another round of warfare erupted in 956–958. While the Buyids were preoccupied with the rebellion of their Daylamite troops under Rezbahan ibn Vindadh-Khurshid in southern Iraq, Nasir al-Dawla the opportunity to advance south and capture Baghdad. After the suppression of the Daylamite revolt, however, the Hamdanids were not able to maintain their position {{in the face of the}} Buiyd counteroffensive, and abandoned the city. Peace was renewed in exchange for the recommencement of tribute and an additional indemnity, but when Nasir al-Dawla refused to send the second year's payment, the Buyid ruler advanced north. Unable to confront the Buyid army in the field, Nasir al-Dawla abandoned Mosul and fled to Mayyafariqin and then to his brother Sayf al-Dawla in Aleppo. The Buyids captured Mosul and Nasibin, but the Hamdanids and their supporters withdrew to their home territory in the mountains of the north, taking with them their treasures as well as all government records and tax registers. As a result, the Buyid army was unable to support itself in the conquered territory, all the more since the predominantly Daylamite troops were resented by the local people, who launched guerrilla attacks on them. Sayf al-Dawla tried to mediate with Mu'izz al-Dawla, but his first approaches were rebuffed. <b>Only</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> agreed to assume the burden of paying his brother's tribute for the entire Diyar Rabi'a, did the Buyid ruler agree to peace. This agreement marks the reversal of roles {{between the two}} Hamdanid brothers, and the establishment of the predominance of the family's Syrian branch.|$|E

25|$|Given that he {{was near}} the end of his career in 1930-31, his centuries total is subject to {{variation}} from this time <b>only,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had already scored over 170 centuries.

25|$|Thomson {{constructed}} a Crookes tube with an electrometer set to one side, {{out of the}} direct path of the cathode rays.

25|$|He fired <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{thought he}} could destroy. Two hundred and fifty yards was the {{distance}} from which he liked best to fire. A couple of short, hard burst from there and that was usually it. He picked his targets off cleanly and decisively, swinging his sight smoothly through them as a first-class shot strokes driven partridges out of the sky. It was a fluent and calculated exercise... For Beurling the confirmed kill was the thing.|$|E
25|$|According to his conception, God {{changes the}} natural order of things <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>He</b> wishes to verify before all people the words of a prophet (Teshubot ha-Ge'onim, ed. Lyck, No. 99). This view was opposed by his {{son-in-law}} Hai Gaon. That in later times he was not termed a heretic, although disparaging criticism was not lacking, was due to his position as gaon (see Weiss, l.c. iv. 198; Menahem Me'iri, Bet ha-Beḥirah, in Adolf Neubauer, M. J. C. ii. 225).|$|E
25|$|As {{a social}} being, man {{is part of}} a greater harmony, and, in order that he may {{contribute}} to the happiness of the whole, he must order his extra-regarding activities so that they shall not clash with his environs. <b>Only</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has regulated his Internal and his social relations by this ideal can he be regarded as rule moral. The egoist and the altruist are both imperfect. In the ripe perfection of humanity, the two impulses will be perfectly adjusted.|$|E

25|$|There was no {{immediate}} reaction to Judge Crater's disappearance.

As {{there was almost}} no communication possible between the different detachements due to the problematic terrain, Lettow-Vorbeck noticed the attack on his rearguard units <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had begun to ascend the northern hills with the withdrawing Abt Göring and Abt Müller.

By early 1949, aged 17, Tetsuo had climbed several positions in the Brazilian national ranking, and entered the South American Championship in Montevideo, his first international competition.
