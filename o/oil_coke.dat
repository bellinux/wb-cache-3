5000|$|Early efforts had {{relied on}} {{education}} such as teaching {{people how to}} build cleaner fires - but this had almost no impact. It was soon realized that real improvement would only come about by switching to a cleaner fuel - gas, <b>oil,</b> <b>coke,</b> or anthracite were all considered but ruled out on cost grounds. The alternative was to wash and size the existing soft coal to make it burn hotter and cleaner, and ensure that all coal sold in St. Louis was of this variety. In February 1937 a smoke ordinance was passed creating a [...] "Division of Smoke Regulation in the Department of Public Safety", forcing larger businesses to burn only clean coal and setting standards for smoke emission and inspection. By 1938 emissions from commercial smokestacks had been reduced by two-thirds.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{properties of the}} combustion of wood blended with coal or <b>oil</b> <b>coke</b> fuels has been studied. Pulverized coal or <b>oil</b> <b>coke</b> and powdered woody materials (larch) were used as the raw materials. These solid fuels were briquetted under pressure of 1 t/cm^ 2 at room temperature, by using a molding press. The measurement of the combustion pattern and the ignition temperatures of these solid fuels was carried out using the differential thermal analysis method. The ignition temperature of the sample from coal or <b>oil</b> <b>coke</b> alone was 345 ℃ for Sunagawa coal and 385 ℃ for <b>oil</b> <b>coke,</b> while for the larch bark and the heart wood, the ignition temperatures were 260 ℃ and 305 ℃ respectively. When the content of woody materials in the blended solid fuels was greater than 20 wt. ％ for Sunagawa coal-wood fuel, 20 wt. ％ for oil coke-bark fuel and 25 wt. ％ for oil coke-heart wood fuel, then the ignition temperature of Sunagawa coal or <b>oil</b> <b>coke</b> fell to the same temperature of larch bark or heart wood.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2002 The {{activation}} of green '"'Smartie"" coke (a mixture of medium temperature pitch and waxy <b>oil</b> <b>coke)</b> {{was investigated in}} a laboratory scale fluidised bed (FB) and a rotary kiln as function of (1) heat treatment temperature (HIT) and (2) heat treatment time (HTt). Activation in the FB was more effective (in terms of surface area development) and the product obtained from this type of reactor had {{a larger percentage of}} mesopores than the products from the rotary kiln. It was possible to produce a product with an iodine number equal to 745 mg iodine per gram carbon. The study revealed {{that it is possible to}} tune the pore structure of "Smartie" coke derived activated carbons by changing the activation device and systematically changing the activation conditions. It was possible to obtain products ranging from a predominantly microporous structure to products with a predominantly mesoporous structure. Unfortunately, in comparison to commercially available activated carbons, the total surface areas were still too low and it will be necessary to perform further investigations focused on increasing the total surface areas. The gold adsorption tests performed on the activated carbon compared well to those of activated carbon currently in use in the gold industry...|$|E
40|$|Although sulphur {{is not a}} major {{reacting}} {{species in}} making cement clinker, it is introduced as a pollutant in both the energy carrier (<b>oil,</b> <b>coke,</b> coal, household waste) and in the reactants (chalk, silica). Due to the huge amounts processed the total theoretical emission of sulphur, as SO 2 can be high. However, because of the kiln design and the presence of calcium and alkalis, sulphur is largely converted to sulphates and captured in the clinker product. In kiln no. 6 at Norcem's Brevik plant there are two sites, named primary and secondary, for injection of coal and coke, one in each end of the rotary kiln. The objective {{of the study was to}} measure which portion of the sulphur introduced in the process from the coal and coke that escapes as SO 2, and how much sulphur will follow the clinker (solid phase) ? Moreover, to see whether there is a difference in SO 2 -emissions when the coal or coke is introduced in the primary and in the secondary injection site. 35 S-tracer in the form of yellow sulphur, α-S 8, absorbed in coke, was prepared by irradiating α-S 8 in a cold position with thermal neutrons in Institute for Energy Technology’s (IFE) JEEP II nuclear reactor. The irradiated sulphur was dissolved in CS 2 and the solution was subsequently absorbed in finely grained coke. Two injections were performed, one in the primary (3, 8 GBq) and one in the secondary site (3 GBq). The results showed clear differences depending on the injection site in the amount of sulphur emitted as SO 2 and also on how fast the sulphur would exit the kiln as part of the produced clinker. 35 S was detected in the exhaust gas only after the injection at the secondary site, but in minute amounts. Thus, the project was able to recommend that in order to avoid emission of SO 2 there is an advantage of injecting coal or coke at the primary site. Mass balance calculations gave more than 80 % recovery of injected sulphur as 35 S...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of energy from fossil fuels {{gives rise to the}} emission of CO 2, NO, and SO 2. The amounts of these compounds formed during the {{production of}} energy from renewables such as wind, sun and biomass are less than those in case of fossil fuels. Therefore, research and development is carried out for the application of renewables now and in the near future. This chapter focuses on the application of biomass, and more specific on the use of catalysts for the conversion technologies of biomass. Promising technologies, which are in a demonstration phase, are pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal upgrading. The products from these types of conversion technologies are: gas, fuel oil or bio-oil transport fuels and chemicals for the food and chemical industry. The production of hydrocarbons is a major objective of most bio-oil upgrading research. Flash and fast pyrolysis are techniques combining high healing rates and short reaction times. Rapid quenching preserves valuable products. Most of the technologies are studied on lab-scale or pilot-scale. For a number of conversion routes catalysts are applied. Char formation and coke deposition are major problems in upgrading of pyrolysis <b>oils.</b> <b>Coke</b> deposition deactivates the catalyst and has to be avoided or minimised. Pyrolysis oils are highly oxygenated, viscous, corrosive, relatively unstable and very complex. However, catalytic upgrading may produce a high valuable chemical feedstock. Oxygen in the oxygenated compounds is, therefore, converted to CO and CO 2 rather than H 2 O to preserve hydrogen for hydrocarbon reactions.

Therefore, {{it is possible to}} make use of H 2 S to react with SO 2 without burning the H 2 S to generate SO 2. However, so far, there has been no such kind of study. In this work, we firstly introduced the separated H 2 S gas into the flue, and replaced the lime water with an aqueous catalyst system to wash the flue gas containing H 2 S, a complete sulfur removal and also sulfur powder recovery process has been developed.|$|R

An increase in the catalyst content of the coke shows a substantial detrimental affect on the overall anisotropy of the carbon microstructure. The catalyst (with a particle size distribution between 0. 5 µm and 78 µm) was found to present a physical barrier around which the anisotropic flow domains formed. At higher catalyst concentrations the catalyst dominates the carbon microstructure; however, there is still evidence of flow patterns albeit with a shorter range. XRD powder data and Raman spectroscopy provide evidence of multiphase graphitisation in both the calcined coke and pre-graphite. The crystal development of the calcined coke is dominated by catalytic graphitisation and that of the pre-graphite showed a greater dependence on thermal graphitisation.
