5|$|During the Red Scare, {{psychology}} professor Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused of}} being a Communist. San Diego representatives persuaded the California legislature along with Governor Earl Warren to attempt to remove him from his teaching position. After the State Board of Education was unable to get an answer from Steinmetz about whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Communist, he was dismissed on February 5, 1954. He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Some historians, such as Frank Barlow and Emma Mason, {{state that}} Stigand {{supported}} Earl Godwin in his quarrel with Edward the Confessor in 1051–1052; others, including Ian Walker, hold {{that he was}} neutral. Stigand, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a supporter of Godwin's, did not go into exile with the earl. The quarrel started over a fight between Eustace of Boulogne, brother-in-law of the king, and men {{of the town of}} Dover. The king ordered Godwin to punish the town, and the earl refused. Continued pressure from Edward undermined Godwin's position, and the earl and his family fled England in 1051. The earl returned in 1052 with a substantial armed force, but eventually reached a peaceful accord with the king. Some medieval sources state that Stigand took part in the negotiations that reached a peace between the king and his earl; the Canterbury manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle calls Stigand the king's chaplain and advisor during the negotiations.|$|E

With an accomplice, he shot and killed Bazin on February 9, 1929, as the Frenchman left his mistress's house. The French {{attributed}} the attack to the VNQDD and reacted by apprehending all the party members they could find: between three and four hundred men were rounded up, including 36government clerks, 13French government officials, 36schoolteachers, 39merchants, 37landowners and 40military personnel. The subsequent trials resulted in 78men being {{convicted and sentenced to}} jail terms ranging between five and twenty years. The arrests severely depleted the VNQDD leadership: most of the Central Committee were captured, though Học and Nhu were among the few who escaped from a raid on their hideout at the Vietnam Hotel.|$|E

The Northwest Territories has no laws recognizing or validating any {{political parties}} operating on the territorial level. Sutherland was defeated, finishing a distant fourth in his district.|$|E

For such crimes, trial and execution would have been almost guaranteed.

500|$|Before the war, Model {{had been}} content to leave {{politics}} to the politicians, preferring instead {{to concentrate on}} military affairs. Despite this, {{he became one of}} the Wehrmacht's field marshals most closely identified with Hitler. Postwar opinions on him have varied. Some historians have called him [...] "blindly loyal", [...] "convinced Nazi" [...] or a [...] "zealous disciple" [...] of Hitler; others take a more nuanced view, seeing in Model a coldly calculating opportunist who used the Führer to his advantage, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> committed to him or the ideals of Nazism. The contradictions between his Lutheran upbringing and his later association with the Nazis have similarly been the subject of comment.|$|E
500|$|Whether {{altering}} the succession was Edward's own idea <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> determinedly at work to exclude his half-sisters {{in favour of}} what he perceived as his jeopardised legacy.

Mary's accession could cost Northumberland his head, but not necessarily so. He tried hard to please her during 1553, and may have shared the general assumption that she would succeed to the Crown as late as early June. Faced with Edward's express royal will and perseverance, John Dudley submitted to his master's wishes—either seeing his chance to retain his power beyond the boy's lifetime or out of loyalty.|$|E
500|$|Several {{injuries}} and three deaths {{were attributed to}} the storm, two of which occurred in Guerrero. The first was an auxiliary member of the Mexican Highway patrol whose vehicle collided with a truck on the Mexico City-Acapulco road during inclement weather. Four others were injured in the same accident. Another 19injuries resulted from two similar accidents that were also attributed to weather caused by the hurricane. The second death associated with the storm occurred after a man was thrown overboard his boat by high waves and drowned. In {{the wake of the}} storm system, the body of a middle aged man was discovered on a beach in Cuyutlan, Colima.

500|$|Miliband {{was portrayed}} during Labour's 2015 {{election}} campaign as being genuine in {{his desire to}} improve the lives of working people and to display progression from New Labour, but was unable to defeat interpretations of him as being ineffectual, or even cartoonish in nature. Political illustrators perceived a resemblance to Wallace of the British animation Wallace and Gromit and greatly exaggerated this in caricatures; various images circulated in the press and online media of Miliband performing day-to-day activities such as eating a sandwich, donating money to a beggar, and giving a kiss to his wife, all while displaying apparently awkward facial expressions. In a March 2015 Newsnight election debate, he was challenged by Jeremy Paxman as to whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> 'tough enough' to be Prime Minister, famously responding, [...] "Hell yes, I'm tough enough," [...] in reference to his reluctance to support air strikes against extremist targets in Syria.|$|E
500|$|Successful on {{his second}} run for office, Lincoln served four {{successive}} terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.

In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> known for his [...] "free soil" [...] stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, [...] " [...] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils." [...] His stance closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa.|$|E
500|$|Comparisons {{have been}} drawn between the {{character}} of Dana Scully and that of FBI student Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs. Rhonda Wilcox and J.P. Williams note the similarities in their appearances, {{as well as their}} positions in a patriarchal working environment. In [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] in particular, parallels can be seen. Like Starling, Scully has an emotional connection with—and a need to prove herself to—her dead father. After William Scully's death, his daughter becomes particularly concerned with whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> proud of her. Although {{by the end of the}} episode, Scully seems to have come to terms with her father's opinion of her, her worries resurface later in the series when she fears that he would have been ashamed of her actions ("Anasazi"). The connection to Clarice Starling is further shown by Scully's encounter with Luther Lee Boggs, an apparently helpful serial killer, which echoes Starling's relationship with serial killer Hannibal Lecter.|$|E

500|$|Writer Mary D.

Dutta feels that the gang rape storyline invokes many of the rape myths that have appeared in literature since the 18th century, which includes [...] "only bad girls get raped," [...] "women ask for it," [...] and [...] "women 'cry rape' only when they've been jilted or have something to cover up". Dutta also includes the myth of the [...] "reformed rake", or [...] "the rapist redeemed by the woman who loves him, not uncommonly the same woman he raped", which [...] "deny or reduce perceived injury, or... blame the victims for their own victimization". Dutta states, [...] "Todd's redemption begins with his rescue of Marty and two children from a car wreck and ends with the discovery that he is the rightful heir to a huge fortune." ...|$|E

In 1971, an affair {{he had with}} Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion.

[...] Five months later, Presley's new girlfriend, Linda Thompson, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him. Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18. Presley became depressed after the break up of his marriage. According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley's marriage [...] "was a blow from which he never recovered." [...] During a press conference in 1972, a reporter asked Presley whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> satisfied with his image, Presley replied [...] "Well, the human being is one thing.
