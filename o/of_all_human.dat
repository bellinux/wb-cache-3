5|$|According to Patrick Drazen, {{the series}} {{contains}} numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi, the Shinto {{vision of the}} primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, the Tree of Life, among many others. The merging <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project {{at the end of}} the series is similar to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam. The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore, and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni (Japanese demons or ogres).|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
5|$|Ivan ends {{his story}} {{deep in thought}} as Vasilisa begins to cry and Lukerya looks on in pain. He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> history and he is filled with joy and awe at life itself.|$|E

5|$|Over half of {{all known}} flatworm species are parasitic, and some do {{enormous}} harm to humans and their livestock. Schistosomiasis, caused by one genus of trematodes, is the second-most devastating <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> diseases caused by parasites, surpassed only by malaria. Neurocysticercosis, which arises when larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium penetrate the central nervous system, is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. The threat of platyhelminth parasites to humans in developed countries is rising because of the popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods, and imports of food from high-risk areas. In less developed countries, people often cannot afford the fuel required to cook food thoroughly, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects increase the dangers presented by poor sanitation and unhygienic farming.|$|E
5|$|Scully brings Gibson to the hospital, {{where it}} is {{determined}} {{that he has the}} alien virus in his blood. The Black-Haired Man (Scott Eberlein) kidnaps him soon after, and brings him to the power plant. They find the alien, who attacks the Black-Haired Man but not Gibson, as witnessed by Mulder from outside the locked door. Mulder and Scully are ordered to not associate with the X-Files and are reassigned under Assistant Director Kersh. Spender is visited by The Smoking Man in his office. Mulder continues to work on restoring the X-Files, and is told by Scully that Fowley's report does not reflect what really happened. Scully tells Mulder that the alien virus DNA is also part <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> DNA, but in Gibson the DNA is active. In the power plant, Gibson is trapped inside with the alien, which sheds its skin, revealing the traditional grey alien form.|$|E
5|$|The Svalbard Environmental Protection Act {{was passed}} on 15 June 2001 and took effect on 1 July 2002, {{replacing}} various regulations. The act {{was created to}} secure a continuous, nearly untouched natural environment on Svalbard, particularly regarding wilderness, landscape, flora, fauna and cultural heritage. The act is enacted by the Ministry of the Environment, the Climate and Pollution Agency, the governor, the Directorate for Cultural Heritage and the Directorate for Nature Management. The act is supplemented by various regulations. Specific issues addressed in the act include the protection of plants and all remains <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> activity up to 1945. It imposes limitations on traffic in permitted areas, particularly motorized vehicles, but allows locals to operate snowscooters in more areas than tourists. Two-thirds of Svalbard is protected through national parks and nature reserves.|$|E

25|$|Mutations in the Ras {{family of}} proto-oncogenes (comprising H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) are very common, being found in 20% to 30% <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> tumors. it is {{reasonable}} to speculate that a pharmacological approach that curtails Ras activity may represent a possible method to inhibit certain cancer types.

25|$|About 70% <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in the skin. Almost 500 genes have an elevated pattern of expression in the skin.

25|$|Because {{these signals}} result in cell growth and division, overactive Ras {{signaling}} can {{ultimately lead to}} cancer. The 3 Ras genes in humans (HRas, KRas, and NRas) {{are the most common}} oncogenes in human cancer; mutations that permanently activate Ras are found in 20% to 25% <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> tumors and up to 90% in certain types of cancer (e.g., pancreatic cancer). For this reason, Ras inhibitors are being studied as a treatment for cancer and other diseases with Ras overexpression.|$|E
25|$|Next is Aristophanes, {{the comic}} playwright. Aristophanes tells a fantastical, mythological {{story about how}} humans were at one time twice {{the people that they}} are now, but this was seen as {{threatening}} to the gods, so Zeus to cut everyone in half. And ever since, humans go about in search of their other half, in order to become whole. Agathon, the host, follows Aristophanes, and his speech sees Eros as youthful, beautiful, and wise; and as the source <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>human</b> virtues.|$|E
25|$|Not surprisingly, {{those who}} are high in global human {{identification}} are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering.
