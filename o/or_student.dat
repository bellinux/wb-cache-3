5|$|At {{some point}} on 28 April or 29 April, General Gotthard Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was {{relieved}} of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin {{at all costs}} and never order a retreat, {{and was replaced by}} General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch <b>or</b> <b>Student</b> was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance.|$|E

5|$|The emperor, {{who enjoyed}} {{paramount}} social status, {{was the head}} of the government administration. His rule was virtually absolute, although civil officials, representing the competing interests of different state organs, scrutinized his decisions. Although the Grand Commandant had a nominal role as commander-in-chief, the emperor served as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The emperor had the sole right to appoint central government officials whose salary-rank was 600-dan or higher. The emperor also appointed the leading officials at the provincial, commandery, and county levels of government. Appointees to office were usually recommended men from the commanderies, family relatives of high officials, <b>or</b> <b>student</b> graduates of the Imperial University. This institution was established in 124 BC, and provided a Confucian-based education for those entering civil service.|$|E

25|$|In January 1979, a new freshmen {{generation}} {{arrived to}} the university. Many {{of them had}} been members of the CEEM <b>or</b> <b>student</b> associations in the public institutes and had participated in the events of October 1978. It was them who took the leadership of the AEU. But it was much more difficult to replace the fallen or exiled faculty, which resulted in a marked decline in the academic quality of the institution. Later, laws that severely restricted the university autonomy were proposed, and violating the constitutional mandate to give 5% of the national budget to the institution became commonplace for the government.|$|E

25|$|Although {{some that}} partner with outside {{groups such as}} Oxfam or Planned Parenthood are more structured, most {{organizations}} are highly informal.

The Reed archive of comic books and graphic novels, the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room), is well into its fourth decade, and Beer Nation, the student group that organizes and manages various beer gardens throughout the year and during Renn Fayre, has existed for many years. Some organizations, such as the Motorized Couch Collective – dedicated to installing motors and wheels into furniture – have become more Reed myth than reality in recent years.|$|E

To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis.

When screening {{results suggest that the}} student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation.
