40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that memory for personal experiences (episodic memory, rather than semantic memory) relies on the conscious review of past experience and thus is unique to humans. In an attempt to demonstrate episodic-like memory in animals, we first trained pigeons {{to respond to the}} (nonverbal) question “Did <b>you</b> <b>just</b> peck <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> refrain from pecking? ” by training them on a symbolic matching task with differential responding required to the two line-orientation samples and reinforcing the choice of a red comparison if they had pecked and the choice of a green comparison if they had not pecked. Then, in Experiment 1, after providing the conditions for (but not requiring) the pigeons to peck at one new stimulus (a yellow hue) but not at another (a blue hue), we tested them with the new hue stimuli and the red and green comparisons. In Experiment 2, we tested the pigeons with novel stimuli (a circle, which they spontaneously pecked, and a dark response key, which they did not peck) and the red and green comparisons. In both experiments, pigeons chose the comparison appropriate to the response made to the test stimulus. Thus, the pigeons demonstrated that they could remember specific details about their past experiences, a result consistent with the notion that they have the capacity for forming episodic-like memories. Current views of human memory divide it according t...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this paper was derived from an {{incident}} I observed some years ago while accompanying a highly talented musician-songwriter friend to a performance. During a break, an audience member approached him to compliment the last song he had performed. He had written both the music and the lyrics to the song, one of many he had written. The audience member queried, “Is that a real song, <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> make it up?” A touch amused, and not knowing whether he should be flattered or insulted, he politely replied, “It is a real song and I made it up. ”This episode puts in mind a similar attitude in the social sciences that Glaser and Strauss (1967) noted, in which a small number of ’theoretical capitalists’ originate what are considered to be “real” theories and others are relegated to the role of “proletariat” testers. The means by which these theorists derived their theories remained largely mysterious. Unleashing proletariat testers was one of the chief rationales behind Glaser and Strauss’ development of grounded theory. It brought a democratic option into the social sciences that enabled anyone who learned the methodology to generate theory. The democratic ethos of the methodology may also have inadvertently unleashed an abundance of aspiring remodelers of the methodology, who unfortunately have eroded its primary purpose—to generate theories that are fully grounded in data rather than speculation or ideology...|$|R

5000|$|Emotions play a {{critical}} role in interpersonal relationships and how people relate to each other. Emotional exchanges can have serious social consequences that can result in either maintaining and enhancing positive relationships, or becoming a source of antagonism and discord (Fredrickson, 1998; Gottman & Levenson, 1992)). Even though people may generally [...] "want to feel better than worse" [...] (Larsen, 2000),) how these emotions are regulated may differ across cultures. Research by Yuri Miyamoto suggests that cultural differences influence emotion regulation strategies. Research also indicates that different cultures socialize their children to regulate their emotions according to their own cultural norms. For example, ethnographic accounts suggest that American mothers think that it is important to focus on their children's successes while Chinese mothers think it is more important to provide discipline for their children. [...] To further support this theory, a laboratory experiment found that when children succeeded on a test, American mothers were more likely than Chinese mothers to provide positive feedback (e.g. [...] "You're so smart!"), in comparison to Chinese mothers who provided more neutral or task relevant feedback (e.g. [...] "Did you understand the questions <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> guess?"; Ng, Pomerantz, & Lam, 2007). This shows how American mothers are more likely to [...] "up-regulate" [...] positive emotions by focusing on their children's success whereas Chinese mothers are more likely to [...] "down-regulate" [...] children's positive emotions by not focusing on their success.Americans see emotions as internal personal reactions; emotions are about the self (Markus & Kityama, 1991). In America, emotional expression is encouraged by parents and peers while suppression is often disapproved. Keeping emotions inside is viewed as being insincere as well as posing a risk to one's health and well being. [...] In Japanese cultures however, emotions reflect relationships in addition to internal states. Some research even suggests that emotions that reflect the inner self cannot be separated from emotions that reflect the larger group. Therefore, unlike American culture, expression of emotions is often discouraged, and suppressing one's individual emotions to better fit in with the emotions of the group is looked at as mature and appropriate.|$|R

40|$|Soya - a {{rich source}} of protein, oil and income Cue: Soya beans are best known for being rich in two {{important}} foodstuffs: oil and protein. Much of the world?s cooking oil is derived from soya, and most of this is grown in the United States, Brazil, China and Argentina. Soya beans, also called soybeans, are widely eaten as a vegetable in East Asia, where the plant originates from, but less so {{in other parts of the}} world. One reason may be that the beans need a long period of soaking and cooking to make them edible. However, because of its high protein content, soya is an excellent food, particularly for those who cannot eat meat - whether for reasons of cost or because they are vegetarian. In Malawi, soya beans are used as an ingredient in phala, a nutritious porridge widely fed to babies. Mrs Linley Banda grows soya on her farm in Thyolo district, in southern Malawi. Patrick Mphaka went to visit her there, to find out more about this nutritious food and cash crop. IN:		?Yes it is easy to grow soya beans? OUT:		? I have benefited from the crop. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mrs Linley Banda from Thyolo in Malawi was talking to Patrick Mphaka. Transcript Banda	Yes it is easy to grow soya beans compared to other cash crops. But it also has its own problems. The advantage of growing soya crops is that it does not require too many inputs compared to maize. The problems are that it is attacked by some pests and diseases and sometimes it is destroyed when the rains are prolonged. Mphaka	So you do not need a lot of rains for soya beans? Banda	The rains are required but not too much. Mphaka	On the two hectares on which you have planted your soya beans this year, how many bags do you think you will realise from there? Banda	As you have seen, this year we did not have enough rains. I am sure I will get about sixty bags of soya from this garden because last year I had about ninety 50 kg bags of soya. Mphaka	Can we talk about money, how much is that? Banda	(Laughter) I am sure you are good at maths, you can calculate. Mphaka	Do you just harvest it and take it to the market or just harvest it and have people come and buy? How do you do it with soya beans? Banda	After harvesting the soya beans, we thresh it and winnow it. And thereafter, we check if there are some stones and some immature seed. After that we pack it in bags and it is ready for sale. Mphaka	Do you put it in different grades <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> sell it as one grade? Banda	It is good to put it in grades so that you can fetch good price. I put in grades. Mphaka	Tell me about the market. Banda	There is a very good established market for soya. There is Rab Processors which is buying soya from us farmers. Transglobe is also buying soya from us. Other NGOs do fetch some seeds from us to give to other farmers so that they can start growing this crop. Mphaka	So why do you sell it to the local market? Banda	I sell to the local market because some farmers just come to my house to buy for their house use. So I cannot refuse to sell to them. Mphaka	What do you think is the reason that not many farmers around here are growing soya beans, when given your experience, it is a very profitable crop? Banda	The problem is that many farmers do not realize the importance of soya beans and the way to process and utilize it. They feel it is difficult to grow the soya beans. Mphaka	Do you think people are used to eating soya or maybe they think that it is something which they do not know about as evidenced by their not growing it in large numbers? Banda	As of now, I can say people are now learning the goodness of eating soya. Many farmers around this area are now coming to buy the crop for their house use. Through the radio and hospitals where the under-five children are going for scales, they are told to feed their children phala (porridge) with soya. Mphaka	Given the two years that you have been growing it, are there any people who are showing interest to start to grow soya beans? Banda	Yes there are so many that this year, around this area more farmers have now started planting this crop because they have seen what I have benefited from the crop. End of track. Linley Banda grows soya beans on her farm in southern Malawi. She likes the crop because it needs less inputs than maize. She sells most of her soya beans to food processors...|$|E
