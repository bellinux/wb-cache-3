5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate <b>orifices</b> for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.|$|E

It can help explain the dissipation of the mechanical energy loss in the flow process for the two flow mechanisms under different operating regimes. The main parameters such as <b>orifice</b> diameter, plate thickness and liquid head were correlated, and a semi-empirical model for <b>orifice</b> coefficient and an empirical model with high precision at the stable region were developed.|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to prevent {{exterior}} spot emission, hollow cathode bodies and <b>orifice</b> plates were constructed from boron nitride which is an electrical insulator, but the <b>orifice</b> plates melted and/or eroded at high interelectrode pressures. The most suitable hollow cathodes tested included a refractory metal <b>orifice</b> plate in a boron nitride body, with the insert insulated electrically from the <b>orifice</b> plate. In addition, the hollow cathode interior was evacuated to assure a low pressure at the insert surface, thus promoting diffuse electron emission. At high interelectrode pressures, the electrons tended to flow through the <b>orifice</b> plate rather than through the <b>orifice,</b> which could result in overheating of the <b>orifice</b> plate. Using a carefully aligned centerline anode, electron flow through the <b>orifice</b> could be sustained at interelectrode pressures up to 500 torr - but the current flow path still occasionally jumped from the <b>orifice</b> to the <b>orifice</b> plate.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{appropriate}} {{index of}} prosthesis internal <b>orifice</b> size {{and its effect}} on operative mortality after aortic valve replacement are controversial. We examined the association between several relevant indices and patient size on operative mortality. Indices examined included projected in vivo effective <b>orifice</b> area and geometric <b>orifice</b> area, with patient size defined as body surface area. MethodsA review of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Database (2000 - 2004) yielded 48, 722 patients who had isolated aortic valve replacement. This analysis is based on the cohort of 42, 310 patients with the 8 most prevalent valve types with manufacturer’s labeled sizes 19 mm through 29 mm. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed {{to determine the effects of}} body surface area, effective <b>orifice</b> area, geometric <b>orifice</b> area, and selected derived indices (eg, effective <b>orifice</b> area/body surface area) on risk-adjusted operative mortality. ResultsIn separate multivariable models, effective <b>orifice</b> area and geometric <b>orifice</b> area were both inversely correlated with operative mortality. However, an unanticipated finding was that with either effective <b>orifice</b> area or geometric <b>orifice</b> area held constant, body surface area was significantly and inversely correlated with operative mortality. When patients were stratified by effective <b>orifice</b> area, geometric <b>orifice</b> area, or manufacturer’s labeled valve size and type, elevations in body surface area were associated with a decrease rather than an increase in operative mortality. ConclusionsProstheses with small geometric <b>orifice</b> area or small effective <b>orifice</b> area are associated with increased operative mortality after isolated aortic valve replacement. Even for valves with small effective <b>orifice</b> area, however, mortality decreases as body surface area increases. With respect to operative mortality, therefore, our results do not support using arbitrary cutoff values of effective <b>orifice</b> area/body surface area to determine the valve to utilize in a given patient...|$|R

25|$|The three openings, two {{ureteric}} <b>orifices,</b> and {{the internal}} urethral orifice mark the triangular area called the trigone of the bladder.

50|$|In {{the natural}} environment, large <b>orifice</b> plates {{are used to}} control onward flow in flood relief dams. In these {{structures}} a low dam is placed across a river and in normal operation the water flows through the <b>orifice</b> plate unimpeded as the <b>orifice</b> is substantially larger than the normal flow cross section. However, in floods, the flow rate rises and floods out the <b>orifice</b> plate which can then only pass a flow determined by the physical dimensions of the <b>orifice.</b> Flow is then held back behind the low dam in a temporary reservoir which is slowly discharged through the <b>orifice</b> when the flood subsides.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The standard <b>orifice</b> plate is used extensively by the natural gas industry for the metering of fuel. Because of the costs associated with errors in flow measurement inherent {{with the use of a}} standard <b>orifice</b> plate, any improvements upon the existing standard <b>orifice</b> plate design would be desirable. Consequently, a new type of <b>orifice</b> plate has been designed. It is termed the "slotted <b>orifice</b> plate". In the slotted <b>orifice</b> plate, the familiar round hole found in the center of standard <b>orifice</b> plates is replaced with a circular array of radially aligned slots. The objective of this project was to compare the performance of the slotted <b>orifice</b> plate to that of the standard <b>orifice</b> plate in order to determine the extent, if any, to which the slotted <b>orifice</b> plate is superior to the standard <b>orifice</b> plate in flow measurement. This was done by investigating pipe-wall pressure distributions and velocity profiles associated with flow through both the standard plate and the slotted plate for a variety of test cases. By using the pressure distribution and velocity profile data, coefficients of discharge were plotted against the second order radial moments of axial momentum. It was determined that the slotted <b>orifice</b> plate was a much more consistent flow measurement device compared to the standard <b>orifice</b> plate, showing less sensitivity to upstream velocity profiles and swir...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The flows sudden-shrink and sudden-enlarge when passing <b>orifice</b> {{plate and}} {{streamlines}} dramatically changes.

The characteristics of flow pressure pulse in the vicinity of <b>orifice</b> plate and its effects on cavications characteristics are researched in this paper. The researches results show that flow pressure’s pulse around <b>orifice</b> plate have two peak values: one is at the front of orifice; the other is at the vicinity of water’s reattachment point, the latter’s pulse amplitude is larger than the former’s. The pressure’s pulse has important effects on <b>orifice</b> plate’s cavications. When computing <b>orifice’s</b> cavitations number, the effects of pulse-pressure should be considered. ...|$|R

25|$|Blow flies {{are usually}} the first insects to colonize a body, {{frequently}} within minutes after death. P. regina adults and larvae are attracted to the body because, during decomposition, the remains go through rapid physical, biological, and chemical changes.
