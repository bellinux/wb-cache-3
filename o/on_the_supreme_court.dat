5|$|Although Minton was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> he {{remained}} casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices Robert H. Jackson and Hugo Black, referring to Black as a demagogue.

In a 1954 letter, after Truman left office, he urged Truman to help focus public attention {{on the economy and}} away from communism, a threat he claimed the Republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{remained}} in Washington {{for a few}} weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, {{and by the time he}} definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E

5|$|Black served <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> for thirty-four years, {{making him}} the fifth longest-serving Justice in Supreme Court history. He was the senior (longest serving) justice on the court for an {{unprecedented}} twenty-five years, from the death of Chief Justice Stone on April 22, 1946 to his own retirement on September 17, 1971. As the longest-serving associate justice, he was acting Chief Justice on two occasions: from Stone's death until Vinson took office on June 24, 1946; and from Vinson's death on September 8, 1953 until Warren took office on October 5, 1953.

5|$|In 1876, he {{returned}} to the Oregon Supreme Court after winning the election. Two years later, the Oregon Legislative Assembly divided the court into the Supreme Court and the Oregon Circuit Court, and reduced the number of justices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> to three. With the new court, all prior judges lost their seats and the three positions were filled by appointment of the governor. Boise was appointed by Governor W. W. Thayer to the new court in 1878, with his term ending in 1880. During his time with the court, he served as chief justice three times; from 1864 to 1866, 1870 to 1872, and 1876 to 1878.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Sotomayor to the Supreme Court {{following the}} retirement of Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 {{by a vote of}} 68–31. Sotomayor has supported, while on the court, the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her tenure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants, calls for reform of the criminal justice system, and making impassioned dissents on issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{appointed}} nine Article III {{federal judges}} during his presidency, all to United States district courts; {{he did not}} appoint a justice to serve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> In April 1866, he nominated Henry Stanbery to fill the vacancy left {{with the death of}} John Catron, but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment, and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony, Samuel Milligan, to the United States Court of Claims, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.|$|E

5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{appointed}} {{two women}} to serve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> {{in the first}} two years of his Presidency.

Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.|$|E

Those restrictions were further relaxed in 1948, when people were allowed to fly the flag on national holidays. In January 1949, the restrictions were abolished and anyone could fly the Hinomaru at any time without permission. As a result, schools and homes were encouraged to fly the Hinomaru until the early 1950s.|$|E
