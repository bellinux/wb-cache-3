5|$|<b>Osteochondrosis,</b> or {{surficial}} pits in bone {{at places}} where bones articulate, {{is also known}} in Edmontosaurus. This condition, resulting from cartilage failing {{to be replaced by}} bone during growth, was found to be present in 2.2% of 224edmontosaur toe bones. The underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Genetic predisposition, trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess thyroid hormones, and deficiencies in various growth factors have been suggested. Among dinosaurs, <b>osteochondrosis</b> (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.|$|E
5|$|In {{osteochondritis}} dissecans, {{fragments of}} cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are {{sometimes referred to}} as joint mice. OCD is a type of <b>osteochondrosis</b> in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, <b>osteochondrosis,</b> and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms <b>osteochondrosis</b> dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E
25|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is {{separation}} of immature articular cartilage from underlying bone. It {{is caused by}} <b>osteochondrosis,</b> which is characterized by abnormal endochondral ossification of epiphyseal cartilage. It is most commonly seen in the stifle, elbow, shoulder, and hock.|$|E
25|$|Spondyloarthropathy {{has been}} {{documented}} in the spine of a 78-million year old hadrosaurid. Other examples of pathologies in hadrosaurs include healed wounds from predators, such as those found in Edmontosaurus annectens, and tumors such as hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastomas, found in genera such as Brachylophosaurus and Edmontosaurus. <b>Osteochondrosis</b> is also commonly found in hadrosaurs.|$|E
25|$|Though not common, Leonbergers do inherit and/or {{develop a}} number of {{diseases}} that range in their impact from mild to devastating. In addition to hip dysplasia, Leonbergers can inherit and/or develop heart problems, Inherited Leonberger Paralysis/Polyneuropathy (ILPN), osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, <b>Osteochondrosis</b> Dissecans, allergies, digestive disorders, cataracts, entropion/ectropion eyelids, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), perianal fistulas, and thyroid disorders. Though rumors persist of Leonbergers being more sensitive to anesthesia than other breeds of dog, they are largely untrue. Leonbergers, like other large breed dogs, require less dosage per pound of sedative than smaller breeds to yield the same effect. The Leonberger Health Foundation, a private nonprofit foundation whose sole mission is to support major researchers who are seeking to identify genetic markers for serious diseases which affect the breed, is currently focusing on osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and Leonberger Polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Osteochondrosis</b> is a {{disturbance}} {{in the normal}} development of cartilage; cartilage becomes abnormally thickened, and small fissures and cracks may develop. Dissecans is when cartilage becomes dissected resulting in cartilage flaps, which may remain attached or become loose and fall into the joint space. In Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs most of these cases occur in the shoulder joints and occasionally in elbows and hocks. Except for very mild cases without flap development, the clinical signs are persistent or intermittent lameness. The dog may be stiff after resting and the lameness is usually aggravated by exercise. It is diagnosed by x-rays, and treatment depends on {{the severity of the}} case. Mild cases without cartilage flaps may be treated and heal with several weeks of rest and treatment with medication and supplements. Many cases require surgery to remove the flaps and loose fragments, and scraping and smoothing of the defective surface. Surgical repair of the shoulder usually has excellent results, surgical results involving other sites are not as predictable.|$|E
500|$|Young {{horses that}} are overfed or are fed a diet with an {{improper}} calcium:phosphorus ratio over time may develop {{a number of}} growth and orthopedic disorders, including <b>osteochondrosis</b> (OCD), angular limb deformities (ALD), and several conditions grouped under the popular term [...] "contracted tendons." [...] If not properly treated, damage can be permanent. [...] However, they can be treated if caught in time, given proper veterinary care, and any [...] improper feeding practices are corrected. [...] Young horses being fed for rapid growth {{in order to be}} shown or sold as yearlings are at particularly high risk. [...] Adult horses with an improper diet may also develop a range of metabolic problems.|$|E
2500|$|... "Juvenile spavin" [...] is the {{occurrence}} of bone spavin in horses less than 3 years old. It usually occurs before the animal has done much work. While <b>osteochondrosis</b> lesions are the likely cause in some cases, this condition can also occur secondary to the distortion of the cuboidal bones which can occur in premature or dysmature foals.|$|E
2500|$|Endal was a {{pedigree}} yellow Labrador retriever. From birth Endal {{suffered from}} the lifelong debilitating joint condition <b>osteochondrosis</b> in both of his front legs, [...] which brought his suitability for assistance dog training into question. However, due to Endal's intelligence and problem-solving abilities he qualified as a fully operational and accredited assistance dog although he was only part trained by the charity Canine Partners for Independence.|$|E
2500|$|Horses {{that are}} fed {{improperly}} may develop colic or laminitis, particularly if fed spoiled feed, subjected to excessive feed, or an abrupt change of feed.

[...] Regularly monitoring the horse's body condition score {{on a regular basis}} assists in helping the horse maintain proper weight.|$|E
2500|$|Radiological {{examination}} of Ötzi's bones showed [...] "age-conditioned or strain-induced degeneration" [...] corresponding to many tattooed areas, including <b>osteochondrosis</b> and slight spondylosis in the lumbar spine and wear-and-tear degeneration {{in the knee}} {{and especially in the}} ankle joints. It has been speculated that these tattoos may have been related to pain relief treatments similar to acupressure or acupuncture. If so, this is at least 2,000 years before their previously known earliest use in China (c. 1000 BCE). Recent research into archaeological evidence for ancient tattooing has confirmed that Ötzi is the oldest tattooed human mummy yet discovered.|$|E

50|$|<b>Osteochondrosis</b> is {{a disease}} that affects the bone and {{cartilage}} in the joints of growing horses. The joints most commonly affected are the fetlocks in the fore- and hind leg, and the hock and stifle of the hind leg. <b>Osteochondrosis</b> lesions include tiny fractures, fluid buildup, loose flaps of cartilage, or chips of cartilage loose within the joint. The last lesion is called <b>osteochondrosis</b> dissecans (OCD), and can develop further into degenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthrosis. <b>Osteochondrosis</b> can also contribute to navicular syndrome and Wobbler disease. Because most horses, especially Hanoverians, which are often used for demanding equestrian sports, work for a living, joint discomfort can {{mean the end of}} a horse's career. Between 7% and 10% of Hanoverians have OCD in the hock joint, and between 12% and 24% have OCD in a fetlock joint.|$|E

50|$|The other {{recognized}} {{types of}} osteochondritis are osteochondritis deformans juvenilis (osteochondritis of the capitular {{head of the}} epiphysis of the femur) and osteochondritis deformans juvenilis dorsi (<b>osteochondrosis</b> of the spinal vertebrae, also known as Scheuermann's disease).|$|E
50|$|Thorough health-screening of {{breeding}} stallions before they stand stud {{has resulted in}} a population largely free of congenital diseases. The size and growth rate of warmbloods in general has made <b>Osteochondrosis</b> (OCD) the primary health concern.|$|E
5000|$|Age: Foals {{are more}} likely to have {{infectious}} causes of lameness (septic arthritis). Horses just starting training may be lame due to a developmental orthopedic disease, such as <b>osteochondrosis.</b> Older animals {{are more likely}} to experience osteoarthritis.|$|E
5000|$|Non-articular: This group {{includes}} Sever's disease (of the calcaneus, or heel), and Kienbock's {{disease of the}} hand, and other conditions not completely characteristic of the <b>osteochondrosis,</b> such as Osgood-Schlatter's disease (of the tibial tubercle) and Osteochondritis dissecans.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>osteochondrosis</b> {{has been}} used to {{describe}} a wide range of lesions among different species. There are different types of the prognosis: latens, which is a lesion restricted to epiphyseal cartilage, manifesta, a lesion paired with a delay in endochondral ossification, and dissecans which is a cleft formation in the articular cartilage.The prognosis for these conditions is very variable, and depends both on the anatomic site and on the time at which it is detected. In some cases of <b>osteochondrosis,</b> such as Sever's disease and Freiberg's infraction, the involved bone may heal in a relatively normal shape and leave the patient asymptomatic. On the contrary, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease frequently results in a deformed femoral head that leads to arthritis and the need for joint replacement.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays it is {{primarily}} used for medical purposes. For massage, nerve problems and detoxification etc. - in balneology and sanatoria in many countries around the Baltic Sea and Russia. It gives a relaxing effect on nerves, improves sleep quality, activates blood-flow, activates limphodrainage and helps with <b>osteochondrosis</b> and body metabolism problems.|$|E
50|$|Scheuermann's {{disease is}} {{considered}} to be a form of juvenile <b>osteochondrosis</b> of the spine. It is found mostly in teenagers and presents a significantly worse deformity than postural kyphosis. Patients suffering with Scheuermann’s kyphosis cannot consciously correct their posture. The apex of their curve, located in the thoracic vertebrae, is quite rigid.|$|E
50|$|Most primary lesions {{are related}} to <b>osteochondrosis,</b> which is a disease of the joint {{cartilage}} and specifically Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD), the separation of a flap of cartilage on the joint surface.
