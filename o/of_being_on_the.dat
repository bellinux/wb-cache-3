The King's 11th Battalion disbanded in April, {{followed}} in May by the temporary {{consolidation of the}} Liverpool Pals as the 17th (Composite) Battalion. Their brief unity ended in May when they reduced to form training cadres for the U.S. 137th Regiment. In August, after four months <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defensive, the Allies launched an offensive against Amiens, in the Somme area. Meticulous preparation gave them {{the element of surprise}} when it began on the 8th. More than 16,000 prisoners were taken within two hours and the German frontline mostly collapsed. In the following Battle of Albert, begun on the 21st, the 13th King's suffered 274 casualties, but captured 150 soldiers and many machine-guns, while the 1st assisted in the taking of Ervillers.|$|E

25|$|The {{vigorous}} {{campaign of}} mine warfare waged by the French and Germans was continued by the British, exploiting the advantage <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dip slope and only having to dig horizontally into the ridge to undermine German positions.

An attack was planned by the Germans to capture the British positions from which mine galleries were being dug under the German defences.

Fernando Alonso attempted to also pass Vettel but was unsuccessful, giving Mark Webber the opportunity to overtake Alonso {{on the outside of}} Turn 7. Both Alonso and Webber went off track as Webber completed the move. Stewards deemed Webber's move illegal and on lap seven he was told to hand the position back to Alonso, which also meant letting Timo Glock through as the German had also passed Alonso on the first lap. Alonso's Renault teammate Romain Grosjean was not having any more luck, having to retire at the end of lap three with a recurring brake problem.|$|E

Although they were not able to determine their exact position, they were convinced <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the Rhine and, in spite of the landmarks they saw, the town beneath them was thought to perhaps be Colmar, which is at a distance of only 22 miles. Since, on the other hand, the Freiburg Air Guard in Hilda Tower on the Loretto mountain identified the aircraft as German, it was only after the attack was already over that air raid warning was given. Starting from 15:59 the planes dropped a total of 69 bombs on the city.|$|E

Another three-pointer with 26 seconds left in the first overtime again tied the game, leading to a second overtime. Fouled {{at the end of the}} second overtime so that he would not be able to rescue the Aggies with another last-second three-pointer, Law deliberately missed his second free throw in the hopes that the Aggies could recover the ball and score again.
