5000|$|In 2007 Craig Thomson {{left the}} {{national}} office. The financial reports {{had not been}} put in. I then attempted to put those reports in, but not under my signature because I could not sign off on them because we'd found allegations of corruption in our union. So therefore, I wrote to Fair Work Australia seeking their advice about how to handle this issue and I followed their <b>advice.</b> I followed <b>other</b> professionals' <b>advice,</b> <b>including</b> the auditors and the union solicitors. And {{for them to come}} out now and to say that I didn't put the report in in time when I actually followed their process is totally outrageous and scandalous on their part.

50|$|Aub Muller (representative {{from the}} Lutheran Church) and David Spanagel (Investigation Committee) searched for {{suitable}} sites and areas considered were at Mooroobool, Clifton Beach, Edmonton and Kamerunga. The preferred site was Kamerunga and was purchased from Lusalda Pty Ltd {{at a cost}} of $500,000 ($20,000 per acre) and settlement was requested by 28 February 1991. There was a six-month delay concerning an objection about an adverse effect that the flow of flood waters might have across the area brought about by any development. <b>Other</b> setbacks <b>included</b> <b>advice</b> from Queensland Transport that they required a portion of the land {{for the construction of a}} roundabout to cater for the intersection of Kamerunga Road and Harley Street. Settlement for the land occurred at 4.44p.m. on 4 October 1991, eight months after the agreed settlement date.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{explored the}} impact of public service modernisation agendas as these were being experienced by public service professionals and volunteers engaged in Law Centres. Law Centres were providing front-line advice to individuals and communities in disadvantaged areas, information and advice services that {{have been identified as}} centrally important to public service modernisation agendas, as governments have been aiming to shift the balance of power and accountability away from public service providers towards more active and informed citizens and service users. Were these policy agendas facilitating the development of more effective, more accountable services? Or conversely were they being experienced as demotivating and demoralising, potentially undermining the occupational values and identities of those involved? More specifically the research also aimed to identify the ways in which these changes were being addressed, what strategies were being adopted to manage competing pressures and demands whilst maintaining professional ethical standards. There are potential implications here for debates {{on the future of the}} public service ethos, more generally. The first stage of the research consisted of a postal/electronic survey of 107 Law Centre staff, volunteers and management committee members and trustees. This survey was followed up with two rounds of interviews, 112 interviews in total, the first round being with Law Centre staff and volunteers (including management committee members and trustees) and the second round being with other stakeholders, including local authority officers and councillors and representatives of <b>other</b> <b>advice</b> agencies. <b>Including</b> the views of other stakeholders gives added weight to the research’s conclusions about the value of Law Centres, as well as the values of those who work in them...|$|R
