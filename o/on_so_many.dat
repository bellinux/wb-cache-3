25|$|There is a {{minority}} line of criticism that denies Christian Doctrine {{as a work}} produced by Milton, but these critics have suggested no authors in place of Milton. These denials are grounded in the assumptions that a blind Milton would struggle to rely <b>on</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> Biblical quotations and that the Christian Doctrine is the sole reason why Milton is viewed as having a heterodox theological understanding. In response to this argument, many critics have focused on defending Milton's authorship e.g. Lewalski and Fallon. The argument also fails {{to account for the}} high Biblical literacy of the time. Currently many scholars support Miltonic authorship of the piece, and most editions of Milton's prose include the work.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with the}} growing threat of piracy, in 1564 the Spanish adopted a convoy system far ahead of its time, with {{treasure}} fleets leaving America in April and August. The policy proved efficient, and was quite successful. Only two convoys were captured; one in 1628 when it was captured by the Dutch, and another in 1656, captured by the English, but by then the convoys were a shadow {{of what they had}} been at their peak {{at the end of the}} previous century. Nevertheless, even without being completely captured they frequently came under attack, which inevitably took its toll. Not all shipping of the dispersed empire could be protected by large convoys, allowing the Dutch, English and French privateers and pirates the opportunity to attack trade along the American and Spanish coastlines and raid isolated settlements. This became particularly savage from the 1650s, with all sides falling to extraordinary levels of barbarity, even by the harsh standards of the time. Spain also responded with no small amount of privateering, using the recaptured city of Dunkirk as a base for its Dunkirk Raiders to molest Dutch, English and French trade. More seriously, the Portuguese part of the empire, with its chronically undermanned African and Asian forts, proved nearly impossible to defend adequately, and with Spain so fully engaged <b>on</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> fronts, it could spare little for their defense. Spain also had to deal with Ottoman backed Barbary piracy in the Mediterranean - a vastly greater menace than Caribbean piracy, as well as Oriental and Dutch piracy in the waters around the Philippines.|$|E

500|$|For {{several years}} after he had turned 40, Miller {{concentrated}} on composing and playing his own music.

500|$|The {{earliest}} known publicly demonstrated {{electronic game}} {{was created in}} 1950.

The large metal computer, which was four meters tall, could only play tic-tac-toe on a lightbulb-backed display, and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from August 25 to September 9, 1950. The game was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees lining up to play it as Kates adjusted the difficulty up and down for players. After the exhibition, Bertie was dismantled, and [...] "largely forgotten" [...] as a novelty.
