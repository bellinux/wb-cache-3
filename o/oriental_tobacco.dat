40|$|AbstractThe Tobacco Heating System (THS 2. 2), {{which uses}} “heat-not-burn” technology, generates an aerosol from tobacco heated {{to a lower}} {{temperature}} than occurs when smoking a combustible cigarette. The concentrations of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) are significantly lower in THS 2. 2 mainstream aerosol than in smoke produced by combustible cigarettes. Different tobacco types and 43 tobacco blends were investigated {{to determine how the}} blend impacted the overall reductions of HPHCs in the THS 2. 2 mainstream aerosol. The blend composition had minimal effects on the yields of most HPHCs in the aerosol. Blends containing high proportions of nitrogen-rich tobacco, e. g., air-cured, and some <b>Oriental</b> <b>tobaccos,</b> produced higher acetamide, acrylamide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxide yields than did other blends. Most HPHCs were found to be released mainly through the distillation of HPHCs present in the tobacco plug or after being produced in simple thermal reactions. HPHC concentrations in the THS 2. 2 aerosol may therefore be further minimized by limiting the use of flue- and fire-cured tobaccos which may be contaminated by HPHCs during the curing process and carefully selecting nitrogen rich tobaccos with low concentrations of endogenous HPHCs for use in the tobacco plug blend...|$|R

40|$|Additives used {{in tobacco}} product {{manufacturing}} {{are currently in}} the focus of public discussions with regard to potentially increased consumer health risks on account of certain additives. In addition, a few additives are suspected to enhance the addictiveness of tobacco products. In 2006, the German Federal Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BundesministeriumfuerErnaehrung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz, BMELV) commissioned a research project intended to provide support {{for the evaluation of}} additives and their influence on the composition and properties of cigarette mainstream smoke. In this paper {{the results of the study}} are reported. Different amounts of glycerol, cocoa powder and sucrose were added to the tobacco of two kinds of filter-ventilated King size test cigarettes with ‘tar’ levels of 6 mg and 10 mg per cigarette. The tobacco of the test cigarettes consisted of a commercially available blend made of Virginia, Burley and <b>Oriental</b> <b>tobaccos.</b> Machine smoking was performed according to the applicable ISO smoking regimen.

Increasing levels of sucrose were correlated with an increase of the amount of formaldehyde but not of acetaldehyde in the mainstream smoke of the test cigarettes. In cigarettes with different levels of added glycerol no substantial change in smoke composition was observed. The addition of cocoa powder to tobacco resulted in a decrease of tobaccospecific N-nitrosamines in mainstream smoke.

40|$|The {{results of}} our {{experiments}} executed to obtain tobacco male sterile lines through interspecific hybridization are summarized. Ten wild species from the genus Nicotiana: N. excelsior (exc), N. amplexicaulis (amp), N. rustica (rus), Nicotianaglauca (gla), N. velutina (vel), N. benthamiana (ben), N. maritima (mar), N. paniculata (pan), N. longiflora (lon) and N. africana (afr) were used as cytoplasmic donors and N. tabacum, cv. HarmanliiskaBasma (HB) as a donor of the nucleus. Genetic effects of cytoplasmic-nuclear interaction of the studied species are discussed. Our results suggested that cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) was expressed when the cytoplasms of the above mentioned wild Nicotiana species were combined with the nucleus of N. tabacum. The 10 sources of CMS obtained in tobacco were characterized by altered flower phenotypes. Flowers are classified into types according the stamen, pistil and corolla modification. All these CMS sources were backcrossed to <b>Oriental</b> <b>tobaccos,</b> cvs. Tekne, Nevrokop B- 12, Kroumovgrad 90 and Djebel 576, to develop corresponding CMS lines. The investigated cytoplasms produced compete male sterility in all those cultivars. The CMS lines preserved flower types, specific for every “sterile” cytoplasm. The extent of male organ modifications varied from apparently normal (but pollenless) stamens in CMS (pan), (afr), some plants of (vel) (mar) through different degrees of malformations (shriveled anther on shortened filaments (lon), pinnate-like anthers on filaments of normal length (amp), petal - (ben), pistil- or stigma-like structures (rus), (gla)) to lack of male reproductive organs in (exc) and in some plants of (vel), (mar), (rus) and (gla). Most of the above mentioned cytoplasms had normal female gametophyte and good seed productivity. Alterations of the pistils were observed in CMS (rus), (exc) and (ben) causing reduction of the seed set. Electrophoresis of seed proteins of the tobacco cultivars and their CMS lines also suggested that the nuclei of wild species was entirely displaced by the nucleus of N. tabacum.

40|$|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural products in Greece. The accumulation of heavy metals in tobacco leaves in accordance with a possible risk of transferring them to people by smoke is well known. To monitoring heavy-metal contents in soils, as well as in tobacco leaves, a 6 -year survey was conducted in the Thessaly region (central Greece). The concentration of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) was measured both in soils and in air-cured (Burley), flue-cured (Virginia), and sun-cured (Oriental-filling) tobacco leaves in lower and upper leaves (primings). Regression analysis was conducted between soil and tobacco heavy-metal content to examine the possibility of predicting tobacco heavy-metal levels based on the results of soil analysis [diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) -extractable levels]. The results showed a high correlation between <b>Oriental</b> <b>tobacco</b> heavy-metal content and DTPA-extracted heavy-metal level in soils.

Classification of genotypes using agro-morphological data by means of un-weighted pair-group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) algorithm based on squared standardized Euclidean distances resulted four distinguishable groups that pursuit own geographical distribution. In the molecular marker investigations, a total of 13 simple sequence repeats (SSR) primer pairs were used to determine polymorphism of the test germplasm.
