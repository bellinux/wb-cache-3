60|$|There was {{but little}} weed cast up here, and that kelp chiefly, there being {{scarcely}} a rock for rockweed to adhere to. Who {{has not had}} a vision from some vessel's deck, when he had still his land-legs <b>on,</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> great brown apron, drifting half upright, and quite submerged through the green water, clasping a stone or a deep-sea mussel in its unearthly fingers? I have seen it carrying a stone half as large as my head. We sometimes watched a mass of this cable-like weed, as it was tossed up on the crest of a breaker, waiting with interest to see it come in, as if there were some treasure buoyed up by it; but we were always surprised and disappointed at the insignificance of the mass which had attracted us. As we looked out over the water, the smallest objects floating on it appeared indefinitely large, we were so impressed by the vastness of the ocean, and each one bore so large a proportion to the whole ocean, which we saw. We were so often disappointed in the size of such things as came ashore, the ridiculous bits of wood or weed, with which the ocean labored, that we began to doubt whether the Atlantic itself would bear a still closer inspection, and wold not {{turn out to be a}} but small pond, if it should come ashore to us. This kelp, oar-weed, tangle, devils-apron, sole-leather, or ribbon-weed,--as various species are called,--appeared to us a singularly marine and fabulous product, a lit invention for Neptune to adorn his car with, or a freak of Proteus. All that is told of the sea has a fabulous sound to an inhabitant of the land, and all its products have a certain fabulous quality, as if they belonged to another planet, from sea-weed to a sailor's yarn, or a fish-story. In this element the animal and vegetable kingdoms meet and are strangely mingled. One species of kelp, according to Bory St. Vincent, has a stem fifteen hundred feet long, and hence is the longest vegetable known, and a brig's crew spent two days to no purpose collecting the trunks of another kind cast ashore on the Falkland Islands, mistaking it for drift-wood. (See Harvey on Algæ) This species looked almost edible; at least, I thought that if I were starving I would try it. One sailor told me that the cows ate it. It cut like cheese: for I took the earliest opportunity to sit down and deliberately whittle up a fathom or two of it, that I might become more intimately acquainted with it, see how it cut, and if it were hollow all the way through. The blade looked like a broad belt, whose edges had been quilled, or as if stretched by hammering, and it was also twisted spirally. The extremity was generally worn and ragged from the lashing of the waves. A piece of the stem which I carried home shrunk to one quarter of its size a week afterward, and was completely covered with crystals of salt like frost. The reader will excuse my greenness,--though it is not sea-greenness, like his, perchance,--for I live by a river-shore, where this weed does not wash up. When we consider in what meadows it grew. and how it was raked, and in what kind of hay weather got in or out, we may well be curious about it. One who is weatherwise has given the following account of the matter.|$|E

This turn towards the positive follows a change in his inner attitude and his standards of evaluation, {{with the help of the}} glass-imp, who had given him a deadline of eight days.

40|$|Fundamental instabilities {{have been}} {{observed}} {{in the performance of}} the majority of the algorithms for three dimensional motion estimation from two views. Many geometric and intuitive interpretations have been offered to explain the error sensitivity of the estimated parameters. In this paper, we address the importance of the form of the error norm to be minimized with respect to the motion parameters. We describe the error norms used by the existing algorithms in a unifying notation and give a geometric interpretation of them. We then explicitly prove that the minimization of the objective function leading to an eigenvector solution suffers from a crucial instability. The analyticity of our results allows us to examine the error sensitivity in terms of the translation direction, the viewing angle and the distance of the moving object from the camera. We propose a norm possessing a reasonable geometric interpretation in the image plane and we show by analytical means that a simplificati <b>on</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> norm leading to a closed form solution has undesirable properties...|$|E
40|$|Typically, those {{committed}} to metaphysical naturalism believe that evolution {{by natural selection}} provides a good explanation for the ability of our cognitive faculties to produce true beliefs. What we might consider the familiar picture goes something like this. Sometime {{during the course of}} history, the ancestors of Homo sapiens evolved a cognitive structure that allowed for belief production. Not only did our ancestors evolve this cognitive ability, but this ability was selected for. That is, it gave our ancestors a competitive advantage that aided in their survival, and thus allowed for the passing <b>on</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cognitive structure through their genes. One way to account for the reliability of our cognitive faculties to produce true beliefs is to claim that true beliefs are more likely to cause appropriate survival behaviors. A belief being true helps the subject to appropriately judge a given situation and take action. False beliefs on the other hand would not facilitate appropriate behavior, and so genotypes 1 that produce cognitive structures prone to such beliefs would become a liability when the resulting phenotype was exposed to selection pressure 2. This intuitive story seems to provide a naturalistic, evolutionary, explanation for human cognitive reliability...|$|E
