500|$|Stankonia {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from contemporary}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 95, based on 20 reviews. Derek A. Bardowell of NME noted that with Stankonia, OutKast [...] "hit that rare balance of creative eccentricity and mass appeal" [...] and {{wrote that the}} album contains [...] "eternal qualities that will unravel in time on an emotional, intellectual and spiritual level." [...] Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone called the record [...] "one of the best albums of the year" [...] noting {{that all of the}} tracks contain [...] "a down-home generosity and accessibility" [...] and that [...] "even the most street-oriented songs have some sort of commentary in them." [...] Tony Green of The Village Voice praised OutKast's [...] "feel for sonics and structure" [...] and stated, [...] "they've moved toward harder, darker textures, in service of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, [...] "given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort <b>of</b> <b>reset</b> button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it's striking how few weak tracks there are". Aishah Hight of PopMatters stated, [...] "Within Stankonia, Outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But on the surface, phat beats and pure funk should suffice." [...] Alternative Press commented that [...] "experienced, acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as Stankonia, because they have too much to lose", but felt that [...] "OutKast don't care", writing that they [...] "coalesced the political and societal challenges of hip hop's past into what is one of the genre's most artistically unorthodox releases so far." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of overdamped Brownian particles diffusing in conservative force fields and undergoing stochastic resetting to a given location at a generic space-dependent rate <b>of</b> <b>resetting.</b> We present a systematic approach involving path integrals and elements of renewal theory {{that allows us to}} derive analytical expressions for a variety of statistics of the dynamics such as (i) the propagator prior to first reset, (ii) the distribution of the first-reset time, and (iii) the spatial distribution of the particle at long times. We apply our approach to several representative and hitherto unexplored examples <b>of</b> <b>resetting</b> dynamics. A particularly interesting example for which we find analytical expressions for the statistics <b>of</b> <b>resetting</b> is that <b>of</b> a Brownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential with a rate <b>of</b> <b>resetting</b> that depends on the instantaneous energy of the particle.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} {{and extent of}} rapid or acute <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> the aortic baroreceptors were studied in long-term renal hypertensive rats during 30 minutes of sustained hypertension produced by phenylephrine infusion. The aortic baroreceptors of hypertensive rats exhibited complete resetting to hypertension because during the control period the systolic threshold pressure for activation of the baroreceptors was similar (137 ± 5 vs. 142 ± 4 mm Hg) to the control diastolic pressure. Five minutes after onset <b>of</b> hypertension, a <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> 32 % (percent change of mean pressure threshold divided by total change of mean pressure) was demonstrable. The extent <b>of</b> <b>resetting</b> was 39 %, 38 %, and 41 % after 10, 20, and 30 minutes of hypertension, respectively. When the percent change of systolic threshold pressure divided by total change of control diastolic pressure was {{used to calculate the}} extent <b>of</b> <b>resetting,</b> similar results were obtained.

2500|$|After {{months of}} {{considering}} different options {{for their new}} venture, the group decided to do things {{on their own and}} officially changed their name to [...] "Mutemath." [...] Joining up with Tedd and lawyer/manager Kevin Kookogey, they started an independent label Teleprompt Records. Within a couple months Teleprompt was able to put together a developmental-deal with Warner Music, and Mutemath's debut Reset EP would be released that Fall on Warner's CCM label Word Records in an attempt to capitalize on the group's fan base from Earthsuit. By December 2004, the band finally recruited bass player Roy Mitchell-Cárdenas to become the official fourth member. They began touring to promote the release while using popular social networking sites like MySpace to spread word of the group. As their fan base grew, the band began to see an increasing number of shows sell out by the Spring of 2005. By the fall of that year, they joined The Music is Much Too Loud Tour opening for Mae and Circa Survive where they began to chronicle their shows and updated their video blogs on a nightly basis gradually attracting more and more people to the Mutemath ground-swell.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the practice <b>of</b> <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> {{the terms of}} previously-issued executive stock options. We identify the properties <b>of</b> the typical <b>reset</b> option, characterize the firms that have reset options, and develop a model to value options that may be reset. In our sample of 396 executives whose options had terms reset in 1992 - 95 period, a large majority had exercise prices reset to the market price. This resulted in a reduction of the typical option's exercise price by about 40 %. Slightly {{less than half of}} these options also had their maturities extended, generally receiving a new expiration of 10 years. We find that resetting has a strong negative relationship with firm performance even after correcting for industry performance. Resetting is also significantly more common among small firms than among large firms. However, few other industry- or firm-specific factors appear to matter. Finally, we find that the possibility <b>of</b> <b>resetting</b> does not have a large impact on the ex-ante value of an option award, but the ex-post gain can be substantial. ...|$|R
