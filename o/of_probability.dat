40|$|Some {{philosophers}} {{have claimed}} that it is meaningless or paradoxical to consider the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a <b>probability.</b> Others have however argued that second-order probabilities do not pose any particular problem. We side with the latter group. On condition that the relevant distinctions are taken into account, second-order probabilities can {{be shown to be}} perfectly consistent. May the same be said of an infinite hierarchy <b>of</b> higher-order <b>probabilities?</b> Is it consistent to speak <b>of</b> a <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a <b>probability,</b> and <b>of</b> a <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a <b>probability,</b> and so on, ad infinitum? We argue that it is, for it can be shown that there exists an infinite system <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> that has a model. In particular, we define a regress <b>of</b> higher-order <b>probabilities</b> that leads to a convergent series which determines an infinite-order probability value. We demonstrate the consistency of the regress by constructing a model based on coin-making machines. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{basic rules}} <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> amplitudes {{that will be}} used are that a) if an event can happen in a variety of {{different}} ways then its probability amplitude is the sum of the probability amplitudes of the possible ways and b) if a process involves a number of independent sub-processes then its probability amplitude is the product of the component probability amplitudes.|$|E

It {{was in this}} part {{that two of the}} most important of the twelvefold ways—the permutations and combinations that would form the basis of the subject—were fleshed out, though they had been introduced earlier for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> theory. He gives the first non-inductive proof of the binomial expansion for integer exponent using combinatorial arguments. On a note more distantly related to combinatorics, the second section also discusses the general formula for sums of integer powers; the free coefficients of this formula are therefore called the Bernoulli numbers, which influenced Abraham de Moivre's work later, and which have proven to have numerous applications in number theory.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} a nite group and the set <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> associated with evaluating words over the group. Given a nite group, a group element and a word, one may consider the probability that a uniformly random evaluation of the associated verbal mapping yields that particular element of the group. For a xed group, we consider the set <b>of</b> such <b>probabilities</b> obtained by varying over all words and all group elements. It is known that properties of the group are re ected in this associated set <b>of</b> <b>probabilities.</b> For example, if a group is nilpotent then the set <b>of</b> non-zero <b>probabilities</b> associated with that group has a positive lower bound. We seek to further establish the link between a nite group and its set <b>of</b> <b>probabilities.</b> We show how properties of the group, such as nilpotency and verbal subgroup structure are manifested in the properties of its set <b>of</b> <b>probabilities,</b> such as cardinality, the inmum and the corresponding set of accumulation points.
