Today this section is called Alte Potsdamer Straße, a pedestrianised cul-de-sac severed by post-World War II developments and subsequently by-passed by a new section– the Neue Potsdamer Straße, leading due west and then curving southwards to rejoin its old course at the Potsdam Bridge, over the Landwehrkanal.|$|E
25|$|The War Committee met (3 November 1916) without Robertson, so Lloyd George could, in Hankey’s words “air {{his views}} freely unhampered by the {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>old</b> dragon Robertson”. He complained that the Allies had not achieved any definite success, that the Germans had recovered the initiative, had conquered most of Romania, had increased her forces in the East (after increased mobilisation the German Army had increased in size from 169 ½ divisions on 1 June to 197 divisions (of which 70 were in the East, up from 47 ½ on 1 June)) and still had 4 million men in reserve. On this occasion Asquith backed him and the committee’s conclusion, which was neither printed nor circulated, was that “The offensive on the Somme, if continued next year, was not {{likely to lead to}} decisive results, and that the losses might make too heavy a drain on our resources having regard to the results to be anticipated.” It was agreed to consider offensives in other theatres. The ministers again (7 November) discussed, after Robertson had left the room, the plan to send Robertson to a conference in Russia (all except possibly McKenna were in favour) and a further inter-Allied conference to upstage the forthcoming conference of generals at Chantilly. Robertson rejected the idea as “the Kitchener dodge” and was angry at the discussion behind his back and, concerned that Lloyd George wanted to “play hanky panky”, refused to go.|$|E

[...] Zyvex founder James von Ehr remarked that [...] "Eric [...] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a pissing match with a Nobel-prize winner."

500|$|Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club was not {{positive}} in his review, describing [...] "Future Husband" [...] as the [...] "laziest" [...] {{episode of the}} fourth season. Nonetheless, Pierce responded favorably to Tracy's one-man show, calling it the [...] "shortest and best of the plots" [...] and [...] "even manages to get a laugh out <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>old</b> 'I'd watch him reading the phone book' chestnut." [...] Sean Gandert for Paste magazine said in his recap that part of this episode was disappointing, writing that the main plot was not [...] "too awful, [...] just comparatively dull." [...] Though, he was positive towards the show's interpretation of the NBC and Kabletown storyline, saying {{it was a nice}} [...] "little riff" [...] on the actual merger between NBC and Comcast. Gandert was appreciative to Elizabeth Banks' small part, and hoped to see her in future episodes. Entertainment Weekly contributor Margaret Lyons opined it was a [...] "strange" [...] episode of 30 Rock, and concluded [...] "It's not that 'Future Husband' was radically terrible or anything, but wow, that episode just did not click into place." [...] Bob Sassone of TV Squad did not enjoy Jenna's involvement in Tracy's story, and that overall he did not find their antics [...] "too funny". Nonetheless, Sassone enjoyed Brian Williams' cameo.|$|E
500|$|By June {{the stench}} {{from the river}} had become so bad that {{business}} in Parliament was affected, and the curtains on the river {{side of the building}} were soaked in lime chloride to overcome the smell. The measure was not successful, and discussions were held about possibly moving the business of government to Oxford or St Albans. The Examiner reported that Disraeli, on attending one of the committee rooms, left shortly afterwards with {{the other members of the}} committee, [...] "with a mass of papers in one hand, and with his pocket handkerchief applied to his nose" [...] because the smell was so bad. The disruption to its legislative work led to questions being raised in the House of Commons. According to Hansard, the Member of Parliament (MP) John Brady informed Manners that members were unable to use either the Committee Rooms or the Library because of the stench, and asked the minister [...] "if the noble Lord has taken any measures for mitigating the effluvium and discontinuing the nuisance". Manners replied that the Thames was not under his jurisdiction. Four days later a second MP said to Manners that [...] "By a perverse ingenuity, one of the noblest of rivers has been changed into a cesspool, and I wish to ask whether Her Majesty's Government intend to take any steps to remedy the evil?" [...] Manners pointed out [...] "that Her Majesty's Government have nothing whatever to do with the state of the Thames". The satirical magazine Punch commented that [...] "The one absorbing topic in both Houses of Parliament... was the Conspiracy to Poison question. Of the guilt <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>old</b> offender, Father Thames, there was the most ample evidence".|$|E

2500|$|William Bell Scott has {{an anecdote}} of Burchett, who [...] "had chosen {{the subject as}} a glorious example {{of the power of}} the Church and the faith of the prince at that blessed period in Merry England" [...] failing to sell the {{painting}} to an [...] "extreme Radical" [...] shipping magnate: [...] ""I admire the picture, Mr. Burchett, it is excellently painted, and I like it for its subject these men in full armour won't go in, they won't end the day completely after risking all their lives, because <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>old</b> priest with the jack-in-the-box! Superstition, you see, turns them into caitiffs!" [...] This knocked over poor Burchett so much, the transaction came to nothing" [...] Scott comments that Burchett: [...] "gave himself up to historical painting on a rather large scale, just the kind of art which English taste and the R. Academy as the mediocre exponent of the same would like to crush out of existence".|$|E
2500|$|Reception for {{the album}} {{has been largely}} positive. Classic Rock {{magazine}} described the album as [...] "an album of stunning songs and startling musicianship… breathtaking." [...] Allmusic praised the album's quality [...] and its more commercial direction, and called the tracks [...] "Feel So Low" [...] and [...] "The Rest Will Flow" [...] "flat out two of Wilson's best tunes anywhere." [...] ArtistDirect warned that while it is different than later Porcupine Tree releases such as Fear of a Blank Planet, and conventional progressive rock in general, [...] "Porcupine Tree achieves something altogether more enjoyable here. And, while audiophiles may find the dense harmonies and musical arrangements intriguing in surround sound, the strength of Lightbulb Sun is in melancholic melodies that would sound every bit as good in mono." [...] The Real Musician music website echoed similar sentiments, and considered it to be [...] "the last 'old' Porcupine Tree cd" [...] (prior to their move into a more metal direction with 2002's In Absentia), and continued [...] "Out <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>old</b> band, Lightbulb Sun is the very best album they created".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{positive}} review {{centering on}} the science fiction elements of the film was relayed by Janet Maslin of The New York Times. She praised the theme saying, [...] "Alien Nation has the best science-fiction idea this side of The Terminator." [...] However, Maslin was quick to admit the film [...] "settles down, with remarkable ease, into the routine of a two-cop buddy film, extraterrestrials and all. Matthew and Sam (whom Matthew refuses to address that way, renaming him George) {{go through all the}} familiar stages of forging a friendship between partners: cool antipathy, exchanges of insults, growing mutual respect on the job and, finally, an all-night drinking binge to solidify their buddyhood." [...] On a negative front, author Jay Carr of The Boston Globe commented on James Caan's performance viewing him [...] "Looking like a Paul Newman gone wrong, ..." [...] He went on further stating that [...] "the film's air of enlightenment is only makeup deep. And while [...] 'Alien Nation' [...] is no smarter than, say, a [...] 'Lethal Weapon' , it hasn't got the juice or the level of sensory jolt a [...] 'Lethal Weapon' [...] supplies." [...] Other critics such as Gene Siskel acknowledged the similarities between other police thriller movies, but still found the film to be a [...] "Genuinely entertaining version <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>old</b> reliable; a cop buddy picture with two very different detectives." [...] He explained, [...] "Now {{this is an example of}} how a you can put a nice twist on a familiar story, and it will work if it's been fully written. Caan and Patinkin have special characters to play." [...] Compelled by the acting, he felt [...] "The buddy combination here, worked for me." [...] He ultimately gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Up" [...] review. Not nearly as impressed with the film was author NF of TimeOut Magazine calling it, [...] "Worthy, predictable, and dull." [...] A summation of the negativity was described as being, [...] "Played hard and fast, the film might just have worked, but the decision to soft-pedal the violence merely emphasises the obviousness of the liberal point-scoring (parallels with Vietnamese or Nicaraguan refugees are so facile as to be crass)." [...] Critic Leonard Maltin bluntly referred to the film as [...] "A great concept that doesn't quite pay off." [...] But in a hint of commendation, he remarked how the film contains [...] "many clever touches and terrific performances by Caan and Patinkin." ...|$|E
