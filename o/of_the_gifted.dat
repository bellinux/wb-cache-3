5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but the core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> curriculum remained the individualized approaches and {{learning by doing}} that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater {{to the needs of}} gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Coonley School (ACS), {{commonly}} called Avery Coonley, is an independent, coeducational day school serving academically gifted students in preschool through eighth grade (approximately ages 3 to 14), and {{is located in}} Downers Grove, Illinois. The school was founded in 1906 to promote the progressive educational theories developed by John Dewey and other turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model for progressive education well into the 1940s. From 1943 to 1965, Avery Coonley {{was part of the}} National College of Education (now National-Louis University), serving as a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted.</b>|$|E

25|$|Just as fruit {{should be}} {{evident in the}} life of every Christian, Pentecostals believe that every Spirit-filled believer is given some {{capacity}} for the manifestation of the Spirit. It {{is important to note that}} the exercise of a gift is a manifestation of the Spirit, not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> person, and though the gifts operate through people, they are primarily gifts given to the Church. They are valuable only when they minister spiritual profit and edification to the body of Christ. Pentecostal writers point out that the lists of spiritual gifts in the New Testament do not seem to be exhaustive. It is generally believed that there are as many gifts as there are useful ministries and functions in the Church. A spiritual gift is often exercised in partnership with another gift. For example, in a Pentecostal church service, the gift of tongues might be exercised followed by the operation of the gift of interpretation.|$|E

Testimony given at the trial of John Surratt showed that at his death, Booth had a Catholic medal on his person.

500|$|The {{kindergarten}} {{reading program}} {{was the first}} step in the Avery Coonley School's transition to a new focus on the education <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted,</b> which coincided with a growing public awareness of the needs of gifted children in the late 1960s. The increasing focus on gifted education was symbolized by the 1972 Marland Report to the United States Congress, which was the first acknowledgment of the characteristics of gifted children and their specific educational needs. The report found that [...] "gifted children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs". The report highlighted the necessity for educational services for the gifted, and the near total lack of such programs in the public schools at the time. Malach believed that the educational philosophy of Avery Coonley was well aligned with the most important objectives of a gifted program, namely, [...] "the stimulation of individual interests... the development of student initiative, the development of self-acceptance, concept development, and recognition of the early ability to undertake complex learning tasks." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1916, Hand {{realized}} that the Progressive Party had no future, as the liberal policies of the Democratic government were making much of its program redundant. Roosevelt's decision not {{to stand in the}} 1916 presidential election dealt the party its death blow. Hand had already turned to an alternative political outlet in Herbert Croly's The New Republic, a liberal magazine which he had helped launch in 1914. Hand wrote a series of unsigned articles for the magazine on issues of social reform and judicial power; his only signed article was [...] "The Hope of the Minimum Wage", published in November 1916, which called for laws to protect the underprivileged. Often attending staff dinners and meetings, Hand became a close friend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> young editor Walter Lippmann. The outbreak of war in Europe in 1914 had coincided with the founding of the magazine, whose pages often debated the events in Europe. The New Republic adopted a cautiously sympathetic stance towards the Allies, which Hand supported wholeheartedly. After the United States entered the war in 1917, Hand considered leaving the bench to assist the war effort. Several possible war-related positions were suggested to him. Nothing came of them, aside from his chairing a committee on intellectual property law that suggested treaty amendments for the Paris Peace Conference.|$|E

2500|$|Organ gifting entails two {{simultaneous}} gifts: {{the gift}} of the organ itself and {{the gift of}} life. The first form of gift is a transaction where the giver provides an object to the receiver. [...] This action leads {{to the creation of a}} relationship among individuals where the receiver is compelled to provide a counter-gift. The obligation to return the gift has received various interpretations, but one common assumption is that the object that is given tends to keep a portion of the identity of the giver (hau used by Mauss). In the case of organ gifting, this personalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> object reaches extreme proportions because the gift is actually a piece of the giver's body.|$|E
