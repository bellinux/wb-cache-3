40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} {{externally}} registered indicator dilution curves show a {{relation between the}} height of the curve and the detected volume. If this re lationship were established on a quantitative basis {{it might be possible to}} de termine the volume difference between paired organs or symmetrical locations in the body from the difference between two detected volumes. Cardiac stroke volume might also be measured from the difference between diastolic and sys tolic volumes. A systematic series of experiments were first carried out on models to determine the feasibility of such measurements. This paper presents the results of studies with single tube model systems in which the height of externally registered dilution curves are measured at different detected volumes. The quantitative relationship between these two variables is determined and the effect of dilution volume and flow rate on the height is evaluated.

To investigate the ball screw slipping mechanism, transformed coordinate system should be established firstly.

Later, the influence of the contact angle, helix angle and screw diameter for ball screw slipping will be analyzed according to the ball slipping model and slipping speeds equation and the slipping analysis will be obtained. Finally, curve of slipping analysis and that of mechanical efficiency of the ball screw analysis by Lin are compared, which will indirectly verify the correctness of the slipping model.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the requirements for}} sta-ble control of simple devices that consist of a permanent magnet rigidly attached to a <b>screw</b> <b>operating</b> in soft tissue. Placing these devices in a rotating magnetic field causes the device’s permanent magnet to rotate synchronously with the applied field, making the attached screw generate forward propulsion. Although there has been significant {{research in the area}} of magnetic screws, this paper describes magnetic phenomena that have not been addressed in prior work, yet will be critical in the design of future steering and control strategies for medical applications. Using a time-averaged model of magnetic torque, we analyze the magnetic torque present when intentionally steering the screw or due to naturally occurring disturbances in the screw’s heading. We predict and experimentally demonstrate the existence of magnetic torques that simultaneously act to stabilize and destabilize magnetic <b>screws</b> <b>operating</b> in tissue. We find that there exists an applied field rotation speed, above which screws may become unstable, and we find that the interaction between the stabilizing and destabilizing magnetic torques may cause potentially undesired but predictable behavior while steering.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in the Kwaebibrim District of the Eastern Region of Ghana to study the {{production}} practices and the profitability of palm oil production among small scale processors using focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews and participant observations. Three categories of processing equipment namely digester screw press combined, digester with separate hand operated hydraulic press and digester with separate hand <b>operated</b> <b>screw</b> press were found in the district with the latter constituting about 80 % of the processing equipment used by the processors. The major activities involved in the processing of fruits into oil are removal of the fruit containing spikelets from the fresh fruit bunches, fruit loosening and storage, boiling and digestion of fruits and pressing and clarifying of the oil produced. Fruits are usually stored for a period ranging from one to four weeks before processing leading often to high levels of free fatty acids in the oil produced. Due to scarcity of firewood in the district, waste lorry tyres and mesocarp fibres are used in place of firewood generating a lot of smoke with serious health risk to processors and other mill workers and the environment. Constraints in the small scale processing industry include inaccessibility to remunerative market especially during the peak fruit production period of February to May, lack of credit and skills and knowledge in good processing practices. The financial appraisal of palm oil production shows that in the peak fruit production period of April-May, processors make a loss of 38 % of every cedi in sale in their operations and that the production of palm oil can be a profitable venture only during the lean fruit production season (from September – December) when oil is relatively scarce. The study suggests that to improve the income of small scale processors, there is the need to help the processors change their practices through research {{but at the same time}} it also requires work to create entry into the existing value chains through policy (e. g. bye-laws).   </p...|$|R
