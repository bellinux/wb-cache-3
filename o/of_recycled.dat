40|$|The overall {{performance}} of a two-phase anaerobic wastewater treatment system was determined {{as a function of}} the extent <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> <b>of</b> the effluent from the methanogenic reactor to the acidification reactor. The system consisted of a well mixed continuous reactor as the acidification stage, which was controlled at pH 6 by automatic addition of caustic soda, and a fluidized sand bed reactor for the methanogenic stage, which was left uncontrolled. The results showed that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> could minimize the total operational costs of treatment due mainly to a considerable saving in alkali addition. The results confirmed earlier model predictions. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> acidified the methanogenic reactor, thereby removing dissolved carbon dioxide to the gas phase; this reduction in the concentration of weak acids was the principal cause of the decrease in the caustic consumption. The effects <b>of</b> the <b>recycle</b> rate on other operating variables such as effluent pH and COD, biomass loss and methane content of the exit gas were also assessed...|$|R

The purpose <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> economy is to insure circulation utilization of resources and positive conversion of ecosystem on the premise of keeping economic development. Its mechanism should be "Government instructs, Enterprise acts, Society participates, Markets operate". Enterprise is the subject of economy, so the development <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> economy must be put into effect in enterprises. In this paper, how to advance enterprise to develop recycle economy by carrying out environmentally friendly manufacturing methods and the relationship between government and enterprise in Game Theory are discussed.

40|$|Recycling can {{be defined}} as the “act of {{processing}} used or abandoned materials for use in creating new products”. A recycling bin is a container which used to keep garbage or disposed item before being act by the respective authority to bring it the recycling centre. Recycling bins can be found in various forms and sizes. Nowadays, there are a lot <b>of</b> models <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> trash bin which do not have the correct specification and yet have the disadvantage. The trash was not compacted, so it will requires a lot of space at the landfill. As a result, some of the landfill cannot afford to take all the trash. Part of the objective of this project is to overcome the problems occur nowadays by fabricating and designing the new concept <b>of</b> the <b>recycle</b> trash bin. The main scopes of this research are for two type of trasher, which are the 325 ml cans and 600 ml bottles. The design of the new concept <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> trash bin for this project is basically from the research of existing models found in the current market. It comes with the lots of advantages from two major models, which are “separated trash model” and “un separated trash model”. The main materials that being use to fabricate the recycle trash bin is metal. The cover <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> trash bin is made from acrylic. In creating and fabricate the recycle trash bin it will use a lot of machines. After the fabrication process, this recycle trash bin will be able to compact the trash successfully. Compare to the other model that exists in today’s market, this new recycle trash bin in more suitable {{for the use of the}} household. It is because the size <b>of</b> this <b>recycle</b> trash bin is smaller and the specialty is that in one recycle trash bin, consumer will found two different containers. So it will able to reduce the space used. The shaft will connect to the compactor and the handle shaft <b>of</b> the <b>recycle</b> trash bin can support the load when being use to compress the trash. There are no failures found during compacting the trash. As the conclusion from this project, this new design <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> trash bin will be able to help and overcome the problems occurs nowadays and give advantages to users...|$|R

The physical properties <b>of</b> the <b>recycles</b> and waste feed blends fit well to correlations based on sodium concentration and temperature.

Strontium was found to precipitate during neutralization of the acid cleaning solution and remain precipitated during evaporation. Mercury was found to be significantly soluble in Envelope A simulants and the solubility of mercury increased during evaporation. No mercury was detected in the offgas system after evaporation using Envelope A simulants. Mercury was significantly less soluble in a simulant of AZ- 102.

Also, the reduction <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> NOx by fuel-N was investigated under various conditions. The results show that fuel-N conversion to NO in O₂/CO₂is lower than that in O₂/N₂.

The char-N conversion ratios are 11 – 28 % and 30 – 50 % under fuel-rich and fuel-lean conditions, respectively. The influences of temperature on the conversion of volatile-N to NO under fuel-rich and fuel-lean conditions are contrary. A significant difference for char-N conversion in fuel-rich and fuel-lean conditions is observed. The experimental data <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> NO reduction indicate that the reduction <b>of</b> <b>recycle</b> NO by gas-phase reaction can be enhanced by volatile-N addition in fuel-lean condition at high temperature, while in fuel-rich condition, the volatile-N influence cancelled out and the overall impact is small.
