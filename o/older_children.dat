5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in <b>older</b> <b>children</b> and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in <b>older</b> <b>children</b> is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E

40|$|Abstract &nbsp; &nbsp; Background and Aim: Auditory {{discrimination}} is {{one component of}} central auditory processing skills or auditory perception, that has {{an important role in}} acquisition and production of speech sounds. Auditory discrimination test is a tool for screening or diagnosis of auditory discrimination. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate of auditory discrimination development process in 4 - 6 years <b>old</b> <b>children</b> in Semnan city. &nbsp; Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional survey was done on 200 normal 4 - 6 years <b>old</b> <b>children</b> in semnan city. Auditory discrimination skill was evaluated by Wepman auditory discrimination test (WADT). The level of significancy in this study was 0. 05. &nbsp; Results: Auditory discrimination skills based on percentage of 5 and 95 for 4 years <b>old</b> <b>children</b> were 20 and 36, 21. 85 and 38 for 5 years old, 23. 30 and 39. 35 for 6 years <b>old</b> <b>children.</b> There was significant differences between 4 years <b>old</b> <b>children</b> with 5 and 6 years <b>old</b> <b>children</b> In auditory discrimination skill (P= 0. 003), but there&nbsp; was no significant difference between 5 and 6 years old children(P= 0. 21).

5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, <b>older</b> <b>children</b> are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. <b>Older</b> <b>children</b> add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (1) to investigate the differences in the level of children's knowledge and reasoning skills due to the sloping phenomenon according to their ages and the types of tasks they were asked to perform, and (2) to investigate whether children’s prior knowledge is changed to post knowledge through their reasoning. A total of 120 subjects, forty from each of the age groups 4, 6 and 8 were selected for the study. The major findings are presented below： 8 -year <b>old</b> <b>children</b> showed higher levels of prior knowledge than 6 -year <b>old</b> <b>children.</b> The prior knowledge level of the “size ” task was higher than that of the “weight ” task. 6 -and 8 -year <b>old</b> <b>children</b> showed higher levels of reasoning than 4 -year <b>old</b> <b>children.</b> The reasoning level of the “size ” task was higher than that of the “weight ” task. 6 -and 8 -year <b>old</b> <b>children</b> showed higher levels of post knowledge than 4 -year <b>old</b> <b>children.</b> However, {{there was no difference in}} children’s post knowledge according to task difference.
