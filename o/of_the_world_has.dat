5|$|View <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>has</b> been parodied by Ted Rall, Columbia Pictures, The New Yorker, The Economist and Mad Magazine, among others. The {{work has}} been imitated and printed without {{authorization}} {{in a variety of}} ways. The Columbia parody led to a ruling by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. in favor of Steinberg because of copyright violations by Columbia Pictures. The work is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest magazine covers of recent generations and is studied by art students around the world.|$|E
5|$|The National Archives of Malta, {{like its}} {{counterparts}} {{in other areas}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>has</b> been moving to increase the availability of its services on the Internet. A number of items in its collection have been, or {{are in the process}} of being, digitised, and a catalogue listing search, along with a short description of each item, is available online on the Archives' web site. The Archives releases many of its publications, including periodical newsletters, its annual report and the State of the Archives report, on its web site, and maintains an 'e-shop' to facilitate the sale of copies of some of its text and image holdings to interested members of the public. It is also possible to search the holdings of Malta's National Memory Project, a memory of those who have contributed to the history of Malta, through the Archives' web site.|$|E

25|$|While {{welcoming}} {{the benefits that}} have been achieved through globalization and free market trade in the developing countries, the ministers expressed their concerns that a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> not benefited from it. In this context, they reiterated their commitment to pursue and implement policies which are inclusive, integrative and equitable. Toward this end, they reaffirmed their stand to carry out negotiations on Doha round of talks, through which the developed countries might eliminate some of their protectionist and trade-distorting practices, thereby providing {{a level playing field}} for the developing countries in the field of international trade.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, camels have regained {{recognition}} for their food-producing potential in arid and semi-arid areas of Sudan. After having been dismissed as uneconomical by the Sudanese government, their vital role in supporting human populations {{in some of the}} poorest and frequently drought-stricken areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> now been widely acknowledged (Hjort af Ornäs, 1988). The devastating African drought in 1984-1985 demonstrated that camel ownership can give pastoralists a competitive edge and an excellent chance for survival. Whereas entire herds of cattle, sheep and goats succumbed to the arid conditions, camel populations survived relatively unscathed.|$|E
25|$|Research {{advanced}} {{so quickly}} {{that the need for}} an up-to-date checklist became apparent. Mary Parke (1902–1981), who was a founder member of the British Phycological Society, produced a preliminary checklist of British marine algae in 1953, corrections and additions of this were published in 1956, 1957 and 1959. In 1964 M.Parke and Peter Stanley Dixon (1929–1993) published a revised check-list, a second revision of this was produced in 1968 and a third revision in 1976. Distribution was added to the checklist in 1986 with G.R.South and I.Tittley's A Checklist and Distributional Index of the Benthic Marine Algae of the North Atlantic Ocean. In 2003 A Check-list and Atlas of the Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland was published by Gavin Hardy and Michael Guiry with a revised edition in 2006. This shows how rapidly knowledge of algae, at least in the British Isles, advanced. First efforts had been made by interested biologists and people capable of identifying the algae, this required books using the botanical names. Botanical keys to identify the plants then developed, followed by checklists. As more information was brought to light by interested workers, some volunteers, the checklists were improved and eventually a mapping scheme brought together all this information. The same pattern of knowledge developed with birds, mammals and flowering plants, though to a different time-scale and knowledge in other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> developed to this degree.|$|E

In February 2010, The Guardian could not name Jonathan Rees as he was involved in a new criminal trial.|$|R
500|$|The {{evacuation}} {{was presented}} to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory. On 5 June 1940, Hitler stated [...] "Dunkirk has fallen! 40,000 French and English troops are all that remains of the formerly great armies. Immeasurable quantities of material have been captured. The greatest battle in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> come to an end." [...] Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, the German armed forces high command) announced the event as [...] "the greatest annihilation battle of all time".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to these works on astronomical timekeeping, he also wrote De natura rerum, or On the Nature of Things, modelled in part after {{the work of the}} same title by Isidore of Seville. His works were so influential that late in the 9th century Notker the Stammerer, a monk of the Monastery of St. Gall in Switzerland, wrote that [...] "God, the orderer of natures, who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation, in the sixth day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth".|$|E
500|$|The Prussians {{themselves}} {{recognized the}} importance of the battle, not merely as a setback in the war but as a crucial advancement for the Revolution as a whole. The German writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who was present at the battle with the Prussian army, later wrote that he was approached by some of his comrades in a state of dejection. He had previously cheered them up with memorable and clever quotes but his only consolation this time was, [...] "Here and today, a new epoch in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> begun, and you can boast you were present at its birth." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Anh Duc Ngo {{and colleagues}} of the University of Texas Health Science Center {{published}} a meta-analysis that exposed {{a large amount}} of heterogeneity (different findings) between studies, a finding consistent with a lack of consensus on the issue. Despite this, statistical analysis of the studies they examined resulted in data that the increase in birth defects/relative risk (RR) from exposure to agent orange/dioxin [...] "appears" [...] to be on the order of 3 in Vietnamese funded studies but 1.29 {{in the rest of the}} world. With a casual relationship near the threshold of statistical significance in still-births, cleft palate, and neural tube defects, with spina bifida being the most statistically significant defect. The large discrepancy in RR between Vietnamese studies and those in the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> been ascribed to bias in the Vietnamese studies.|$|E
500|$|These {{separate}} spheres lead Stace {{to reflect on}} both proofs for God and acosmism. He writes that proofs and disproofs for God are equally false, as God is only accessible by intuition and not logic. [...] "… the production by philosophers of proofs of the unreality of space, time, and the temporal world generally, {{is a direct result}} of their mistaking of their mystical propositions for factual propositions." [...] Further, proofs of God actually harm religion as they make him a part of the natural order - a point on which he says that he agrees with Kant. Conversely acosmism (the denial of the reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world)</b> <b>has</b> its root in the mystical moment, within which there is no other truth, God is the supreme reality and there is no naturalistic world. However this is a symbolic truth, rather than a statement of fact. Its counterpart in naturalism is atheism, which denies the reality of God.|$|E
500|$|View <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>has</b> been imitated without {{authorization}} in {{a variety}} of ways. The work has been imitated in postcard format by numerous municipalities, states and nations. Steinberg had stated that he could have retired on royalties from the many parodies made of the painting, had they been paid, a motivation for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the Moscow on the Hudson use. Fulford, writing in The National Post, noted that the metaphor of the world as a suburb of Manhattan was [...] "understood and borrowed" [...] by the whole world. Local artists, especially poster artists, presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions. Fulford demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban Ottawa made imitating View of the World an assignment in its graphic arts class. He also noted that the result of this assignment was a worldwide variety of global foci from which the students viewed the world.|$|E

500|$|Hand's {{study of}} {{philosophy}} at Harvard left a lasting imprint on his thought. As a student, {{he lost his}} faith in God, and {{from that point on}} he became a skeptic. Hand's view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> been identified as relativistic; in the words of scholar Kathryn Griffith, [...] "t was his devotion to a concept of relative values that prompted him to question opinions of the Supreme Court which appeared to place one value absolutely above the others, whether the value was that of individual freedom or equality or the protection of young people from obscene literature." [...] Hand instead sought objective standards in constitutional law, most famously in obscenity and civil liberties cases. He saw the Constitution and the law as compromises to resolve conflicting interests, possessing no moral force of their own. This denial that any divine or natural rights are embodied in the Constitution led Hand to a positivistic view of the Bill of Rights. In this approach, provisions of the Constitution, such as freedom of press, freedom of speech, and equal protection, should be interpreted through their wording and in the light of historical analysis rather than as [...] "guides on concrete occasions". For Hand, moral values were a product of their times and a matter of taste.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationships}} between Betty and Rita, and Diane and Camilla have been variously described as [...] "touching," [...] "moving," [...] {{as well as}} [...] "titillating". Film critic Glenn Kenny, {{in a review of}} the film for Premiere, stated that the relationship between Betty and Rita is [...] "possibly the healthiest, most positive amorous relationship ever depicted in a Lynch movie", whereas the French critic Thierry Jousse, in his review for Cahiers du cinéma, noted that the love between the women depicted is [...] "of lyricism practically without equal in contemporary cinema". In the pages of Film Comment, Philip Lopate held that the pivotal romantic interlude between Betty and Rita was made so poignant and tender by Betty's [...] "understanding for the first time, with self-surprise, that all her helpfulness and curiosity about the other woman had a point: desire... It is a beautiful moment, made all the more miraculous by its earned tenderness, and its distances from anything lurid." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon magazine maintained that the scene's [...] "eroticism [...] so potent it blankets the whole movie, coloring every scene that came before and every one that follows". Betty and Rita were chosen by the Independent Film Channel as the emblematic romantic couple of the 2000s. Writer Charles Taylor states, [...] "Betty and Rita are often framed against darkness so soft and velvety it's like a hovering nimbus, ready to swallow them if they awake from the film's dream. And when they are swallowed, when smoke fills the frame as if the sulfur of hell itself were obscuring our vision, we feel as if not just a romance has been broken, but the beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> been cursed." [...] The co-dependency in the relationship between Betty and Rita–which borders on outright obsession–has been compared to the female relationships in two similar films, Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966) and Robert Altman's 3 Women (1977), which also depict identities of vulnerable women that become tangled, interchanging and ultimately merge: [...] "The female couples also mirror each other, with their mutual interactions conflating hero(ine) worship with same-sex desire".|$|E
