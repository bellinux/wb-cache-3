25|$|Although, in Cuba, many composers {{have written}} both {{classical}} and popular creole types of music, the distinction became clearer after 1960, when (at least initially) the regime frowned on popular music and closed {{most of the}} night-club venues, whilst providing financial support for classical music rather than creole forms. From then on most musicians have kept their careers {{on one side of}} the invisible line or the other. After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, a new crop of classical musicians came <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> The most important of these is guitarist Leo Brouwer, who made significant innovations in classical guitar, and is currently the director of the Havana Symphonic Orchestra. His directorship in the early 1970s of the Cuban Institute of Instrumental and Cinematographic Arts (ICAIC) was instrumental in the formation and consolidation of the nueva trova movement.|$|E

25|$|All {{classes were}} still {{taught in the}} one room - the {{original}} old school, which still exists next to the Parish Church. The school did see some development. Science and Modern Languages had recently {{been added to the}} curriculum. The subjects examined for a scholarship within the school were: English History (1066-1603), Geography of the British Isles, English Grammar, Arithmetic, English Composition and Dictation. A more successful headmaster, the Rev. E.V. Hodge, headmaster from 1879 to 1902, saw numbers increase, to 125 in 1896, with slightly more boarders than day boys. Then followed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> three successful headmasters - Walter Lee Sargant (1902-29) under whom numbers rose to over 200 with consequent new buildings, Francis Cecil Doherty (1929-34), who went on to be headmaster of Lancing), and Grosvenor Talbot Griffith (1935-57) who took the numbers to over three hundred - before the advent of John Buchanan.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese were {{assigned}} the Zhejiang city of Ningbo as their {{port of entry}} into China, and were allowed to present tribute once every 10 years. These Japanese missions to Ming China continued up to Japan's Sengoku period, when the hold of the Ashikaga shogunate waned and power became divided by the warring regional daimyo. These internecine feuds reached China in the Ningbo Incident of 1523, when traders from the Ōuchi clan fought {{with those of the}} Hosokawa clan in Ningbo for the right to present tribute, which spiralled out of hand and resulted in the widespread pillage of Ningbo. When a Ming fleet appeared <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> to restore peace, the fleet was defeated instead and the Japanese traders got away. After this episode, the Ming banned all Japanese from trading in Ningbo, who would have to join the pirates on offshore islands in order to trade Chinese goods.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{civilian}} deaths occurred during PAF air strikes on 10 April 2010 in the Khyber tribal region. According to a Pakistani military source, the first bombing was targeted at {{a gathering of}} militants in a compound. Local people, who had quickly moved <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> to recover the dead and wounded, were then killed during a second air strike. There was no confirmed death toll but at least 30 civilian deaths had occurred according to the military source, whereas a local official stated at least 73 locals, including women and children, were killed. A six-member committee of tribal elders from the area, tasked with finding {{the exact number of}} civilian casualties, reported that 61 civilians were killed and 21 wounded. This was not confirmed by military or political leaders but Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, General Ashfaq Kayani, gave a public apology on 17 April. It is reported that BBC news and several other media correspondences were not allowed to take interviews from injured which makes the whole episode more mysterious.|$|E

25|$|The 2008 season {{marked the}} first year that Barry Bonds was {{not a member of}} the team since first signing with them in 1992 and the 50th season in San Francisco. The Giants signed former Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Aaron Rowand to a 5-year, $60 million contract. Barry Zito once again got off to a poor start, losing his first eight decisions. However, the team found hope in pitcher Tim Lincecum. After going 7–5 in his first stint in 2007 with the Giants, he {{exploded}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> this year winning four straight before losing his 1st game of the year on April 29, 2008, to the Colorado Rockies. Lincecum was selected to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium but was unable to pitch due to being hospitalized with flu-like symptoms. He went on to win the 2008 NL Cy Young Award, finishing at 18–5. He was the first Giant to do so since Mike McCormick won it in 1967. The Giants finished the season in fourth place in the NL West with a record of 72–90.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> the headstrong {{and ambitious}} Zhao Wenhua came {{into conflict with}} the coastal military and administration. He plotted against grand coordinator Cao Bangfu (曹邦輔), whose rapid action against bandit forces at Lake Tai prevented Zhao from claiming credit for the success there. When his own forces were forced to retreat at Taozhai, Zhao placed the blame for his own failure on Cao, {{and was able to}} have him arrested and exiled. Of greater consequence was his role in the downfall of the supreme commander Zhang Jing. Zhao Wenhua had urged Zhang Jing, who had been gathering his strength, to attack the pirates, but Zhang resisted and would not even discuss his strategy with him. Zhao Wenhua retaliated by writing a memorial to the throne accusing Zhang Jing of deliberately delaying the operation for his own profit. However, soon after Zhao Wenhua sent out the memorial, Zhang Jing achieved a major victory over the pirates at Wangjiangjing (王江涇) on 10 May 1555. Too late to recant his earlier statement, Zhao was quick to claim the credit for himself and his protege Hu Zongxian; as a result he was able to successfully petition the Court for the execution of Zhang Jing.|$|E
25|$|The {{scene is}} laid {{in a vast}} forest sacred to Diana, where Adonis (soprano en travesti), as a {{follower}} of the chaste goddess, abhors love as a terrible monster jeopardizing humans’ peace of mind, {{but at the same}} time complains about no longer feeling the lure of sylvan life. Cupid himself (soprano en travesti) descends into the forest and approaches Adonis in order to tear him from Diana and to hand him over to Venus, who is in love with him. When Venus (soprano) arrives upon the scene, she easily succeeds in getting the better of Adonis’ scruples and, supported by Cupid, they resolve to flee in order to shun Diana’s dreadful wrath. When Diana (soprano) enters the scene, she charges Cupid with the abduction of credulous Adonis and entreats vengeance of heaven and hell. Mercury (haute-contre) then descends <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> assuring the enraged goddess that Venus will return Adonis to her, and the goddess of love re-enters over a cloud accompanied by Cupid and Adonis disguised as Cupid, so that Diana cannot tell them apart. Since Adonis refuses to reveal himself, Diana decides to withdraw for fear of possibly choosing Cupid, her bitterest enemy. The entrée goes on firstly to a ballet celebrating the coming wedding of Venus and Adonis, as in the distance Diana herself (ballerina) is shown to be falling in love with a sleeping Endymion (male dancer), and then to further more elaborate ballets representing Diana and Cupid’s(ballerina en travesti) meeting, Cupid's wakening Endymion and eventually Endymon's making love to Diana and his admission onto her cart. The entrée ends in a festive chorus accompanied by a general dance.|$|E

50|$|Ben Folds {{has spoken}} of feeling a social outcast {{at times and}} finding it hard to make friends as a child because his family was {{constantly}} moving. As he found initial success with the band Majosha and then forming Ben Folds Five with Darren Jessee and Robert Sledge, he began to recognize members of his audiences as similar types of outcasts. He noted that these types of people, who were in search of their own identities, would often find themselves gravitating towards <b>the</b> underground <b>scenes</b> (punk, ska, hardcore, etc.) of independent music.

25|$|The {{team that}} had been so {{successful}} in the 1990s began to break up {{at the start of}} the 2000s. Since winning their last trophy in 1998, the team has lost eight semi-finals and two finals. In 2008 Lancashire managed to finish second in the County Championship. The competition was divided into two divisions for the 2000 season, with Lancashire in the first division. Lancashire's one day form began to fluctuate in 2000, losing to Gloucestershire in the semi-finals of both the B Cup and the NatWest Trophy, and being relegated in the National League. In 2001, Lancashire avoided relegation by just 5 points and were not promoted in the National League. The end of the season saw the retirement of Ian Austin from first-class cricket and of Mike Atherton from all forms of cricket. John Crawley left the club in the winter after not being retained as captain. Between 2001 and 2002 saw the squad change significantly, with players recruited from Essex, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Yorkshire; the most notable additions to the squad were Stuart Law and David Byas– the Yorkshire captain of the previous season. After a quiet 2001 season– finishing mid-table in the county championship and again failing to secure promotion in the National League– 2002 was far more encouraging. Mike Watkinson was appointed cricket manager, and Stuart Law and Alec Swann both scored over 1,000 first-class runs and Peter Martin and Glen Chapple both took more than 50wickets; the find of the season was that of James Anderson, who burst <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> with 50wickets in the second half of the season, earning him a promotion to the England side. At the end of the season, Lancashire stalwarts Neil Fairbrother and Graham Lloyd retired.|$|E
