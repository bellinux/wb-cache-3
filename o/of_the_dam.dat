5|$|An {{important}} function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> is to control flooding, {{which is a}} major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze. Millions of people live downstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river. Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1985, {{the last}} {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> project were eliminated when the 8.96 million acres (36,300km2) {{set aside for}} development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> were released by the Bureau of Land Management for other uses.|$|E
5|$|The three gorge dam is a steel-concrete gravity dam. The {{water is}} {{held back by}} the innate mass of the {{individual}} dam sections. As a result, damage to an individual section should not affect other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> Due to the sheer size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> {{it is expected to}} withstand tactical nuclear strikes.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dams,</b> <b>the</b> river's depth {{has increased}} from 3 m in some areas below <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> to well over 100 m throughout the reservoir's length.|$|R

5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E
5|$|Power {{generation}} is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC)—a Central Enterprise SOE administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity {{hydroelectric power station}} with 34generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50MW, making a total capacity of 22,500MW. Among those 32 main generators, 14 are installed in the north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> 12 in the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> The expected annual electricity generation will be over 100TWh.|$|E
5|$|Riprap {{was laid}} on the {{upstream}} face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> beginning November 9 of that year. In 1962, a series of labor strikes impacted communities in the Central Valley, also affecting construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> which was temporarily halted on May 3 of that year. After work restarted on June 26, pervious core material for the dam was soon out of supply, so impervious material was used to complete the dam core.|$|E

5|$|Spring Creek Dam {{was begun}} in 1961, {{when a company}} named Gibbons and Reed was awarded the contract. The {{clearing}} operations began in July of that same year, and the dam was officially dedicated by the Bureau of Reclamation on September 12, 1961. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> began on October 20, 1961, with the placing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> embankment, which at least partially consists of acidic sediment dredged from Spring Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{final cost}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> was {{significantly}} less than had been originally budgeted for, and the work was completed on schedule to a date that was calculated seven years previously.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydroelectric}} {{plant at}} the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> has four generators capable of producing 203 MW combined. The TID's share is 139 MW or 68.47%, while MID receives 64 MW or 31.53%. Three generators, each with a capacity of 55 MW, {{were included in the}} original design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> while an additional 38 MW generator was incorporated in 1989. The plant generates an average of 618.4 million kilowatt hours (KWh) of electricity each year, equal to an average output of 70.6MW. The cities of Modesto and Turlock receive a large share of their power supplies from New Don Pedro Dam.|$|E

The center serves as a water and fish monitoring research lab while offering visitors information about hydropower and water/electrical safety.|$|E
5|$|Control {{of water}} {{was the primary}} concern in the {{building}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds {{from the sale of}} power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.|$|E
5|$|Fargo {{developed}} {{new methods}} {{for construction of}} earth embankment dams on foundations of soft soils, which made use of hydraulic sluicing. The dam was built during the summer, between 25 June and 3 September 1907. The powerhouse and spillway sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> were completed first, and used conventional contemporary engineering designs.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, when Syria was a French mandate, it was {{proposed}} {{to build a}} dam in the Euphrates near the Syro–Turkish border. After Syria became independent in 1946, the feasibility of this proposal was re-investigated, but the plan was not carried out. In 1957, the Syrian government reached {{an agreement with the}} Soviet Union for technical and financial aid {{for the construction of a}} dam in the Euphrates. Syria, as part of the United Arab Republic (UAR), signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 for a loan to finance the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> After Syria left the UAR in 1961, a new agreement about the financing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> was reached with the Soviet Union in 1965. A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> In the early 1960s Swedish geomorphologist Åke Sundborg worked as advisor in the dam project with the task of estimating the amount and fate of sediments that would enter into the dam. Sundborg developed for this purpose a mathematical model on the prognosed growth of a river delta in the dam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} letter, Gruening also {{promoted}} the possibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> creating a thriving tourism industry in Interior Alaska, a hypothesis that {{was raised by}} other dam supporters as well. Greuning stated that the project {{would be similar to}} Lake Powell, in that it would create a range of recreational activities, including water skiing and picnicking.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt's successor, Woodrow Wilson, {{signed the}} Raker Act into law on December 13, 1913, which {{authorized}} construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> Hetch Hetchy Reservoir grew as the valley was flooded behind the O'Shaughnessy Dam in 1923. The Raker Act also gave {{the city the}} right to store water in Lake Eleanor and Cherry Lake, both located northwest of Hetch Hetchy in the park.|$|E

5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, {{along with one}} further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E
