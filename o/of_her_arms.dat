5|$|Jane sits at {{her kitchen}} table with a pistol when a figure leaps through her window and hacks off one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer {{continues}} to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated {{him when he was}} a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane.|$|E
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Melanie Chisholm: Chisholm (also called Mel C) {{was called}} Sporty Spice because she usually wore a {{tracksuit}} paired with athletic shoes, wore her long dark {{hair in a}} high ponytail, and sported a tough girl attitude as well as tattoos on both <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> She also possessed true athletic abilities, her signature being her ability to perform back handsprings.|$|E

25|$|In March 1934, Manon and {{her mother}} {{traveled}} to Venice for the Easter holiday. There, Manon contracted polio, which left her totally paralyzed. She returned to Vienna, where she recovered some use <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and hands. Still determined to act, teachers from the famous Reinhardt-Seminar made house calls. Alma also encouraged visitors, including a younger Austrofascist, a bureaucrat named Erich Cyhlar, to court Manon {{in the hopes that}} pending nuptials would compel her to walk again.|$|E
25|$|With war in Europe looming, Roger {{enlisted in}} the Green Howards as an officer cadet and {{received}} his commission to the 2nd Derbyshire Yeomanry in July 1941. Florance joined the Women's Land Army and moved {{to live and work}} on a farm near Bempton. She often recounted a tale in which she had a second daughter, Bridget, who was blown out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> during an air raid on Bristol in 1941, leading to Florance requiring psychiatric care. No record of Bridget's birth or death has survived, and her eldest son Peter was never able to confirm the story.|$|E
25|$|As of 2014, Jameson has {{undergone}} extensive tattooing, almost completely covering both <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> in sleeve tattoos. In 2013, self-proclaimed socialite and writer Britney Markham became Jameson's personal assistant after having met on Twitter. In a 2014 interview with LA Weekly, Markham claimed that Jameson would make requests for drugs. Markham posited that the pills of choice were Xanax, Ambien and Suboxone along with alcohol. At the same time, Markham denied that Jameson {{had been taking}} Oxycodone, in spite of previous rumors. Markham stated that she was assaulted and battered by Jameson following an incident in a hair salon in Los Angeles in 2013 when Jameson punched Markham in the stomach with a brass knuckles iPhone case. The blow was so severe, Markham claims she vomited blood and was hospitalized.|$|E

25|$|After {{destroying}} part of Tokyo {{with shock}} waves generated by her beating wings, Megaguirus {{heads to the}} waterfront and faces Godzilla. Being territorial, Megaguirus considers the city to be her hunting ground. As they engage in a lengthy battle, she uses her speed to avoid Godzilla's attacks, but Godzilla eventually uses his speed against her. As she flies toward Godzilla, it lunges forward with its dorsal fins in her path. She flies into the fins, and one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> is severed. Megaguirus, having been mutated by Godzilla's energy, generates a blast similar to Godzilla's atomic breath and knocks Godzilla down. Megaguirus speeds forward with the stinger on her long tail lowered, trying to stab Godzilla between the eyes. In a climactic moment, Godzilla catches the stinger in its mouth and crushes it in its jaws. Godzilla finally blasts Megaguirus with atomic breath, causing her {{to burst into flames}} and die.|$|E
25|$|Parvati, {{the gentle}} aspect of Devi Shakti, is usually {{represented}} as fair, beautiful, and benevolent. She typically wears a red dress (often a sari), {{and may have}} a head-band. When depicted alongside Shiva, she generally appears with two arms, but when alone, she may be depicted having four. These hands may hold a conch, crown, mirror, rosary, bell, dish, farming tool such as goad, sugarcane stalk, or flowers such as lotus. One <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> in front {{may be in the}} Abhaya mudra (hand gesture for 'fear not'), one of her children, typically Ganesha, is on her knee, while her younger son Skanda may be playing near her in her watch. In ancient temples, Parvati's sculpture is often depicted near a calf or cow - a source of food. Bronze has been the chief metal for her sculpture, while stone is next most common material.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 1990, a woman {{threw her}} four-month-old {{daughter}} onto {{the tracks of}} the park's monorail. The baby supposedly fell at least eight feet. The event occurred {{at one of the}} monorail's loading stations located at the Anheuser-Busch Hospitality Center. A monorail operator spotted the baby and immediately shut off the power. Although the baby did have extensive injuries to her head, she ultimately recovered. The mother was in an altercation with the baby's father when the baby was reportedly tossed over a fence and into the path of the monorail. Although the mother stated that the baby slipped out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> that claim was dismissed due to the height of the fence. A source stated that the mother confessed to throwing her baby girl onto the tracks in order to prove to the baby's father that it was her baby and she could have done whatever she wanted to her. Both the father and mother were charged with child endangerment.|$|E

500|$|Louise O'Malley {{arrives at}} the hospital, and asks Torres to decide if O'Malley's organs will be donated. The victim of a {{speedboat}} accident, Clara Ferguson (Zoe Boyle), {{arrives at the}} hospital in an ambulance, with both <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{and one of her}} legs amputated. She is attended to by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who informs her that her cut-off arms can be reattached. The hospital's president, Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), explains to neurosuregon Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) that Webber has not been substantially completing his role as chief of surgery, and offers Shepherd the job. Karev reveals O'Malley's death to Stevens, and Torres seeks her help in deciding whether or not to donate O'Malley's organs. Stevens opinionates that O'Malley would give all his organs, and the two come to a mutual conclusion that donation is the correct option. Prior to the harvesting of his organs, O'Malley's former mentor Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) is uneasy about donating his organs, but soon comes to terms with the situation. Several days later, at O'Malley's funeral, the woman O'Malley saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio) is shown hysterically crying while Karev, Stevens, Meredith, and Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) are laughing—unable to deal with their true emotions. After the funeral, O'Malley's former best friend Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is designated the job of emptying out his locker, but breaks down. Bailey subsequently discharges Stevens, and Robbins' body pain patient returns, with chronic pain, though Robbins is unable to diagnose him. Torres approaches Webber, seeking information {{as to whether or not}} her application to become an attending surgeon has been accepted. Webber explains that the job is no longer available, as the surgeon who was going to retire, ultimately did not. Torres becomes enraged, saying that the current surgeon who has the job is a dinosaur, and storms out while yelling: [...] "I'm a superstar". The episode closes with Lexie consoling the speedboat victim, Ferguson.|$|E
2500|$|Amelda [...] "Amy" [...] Hunter was a 47-year-old African American woman. Hunter, a {{beautician}} and {{a mother}} of three, did not {{live in the area}} where her body was found, but she did visit frequently. A previous injury left her unable to use one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> Her family did not report her missing until after police began removing bodies from Sowell's house.|$|E
2500|$|Genter Vôlei Bauru {{reached for}} the first a Brazilian Superliga quarterfinals berth, but they were {{defeated}} by Minas 0-2 in the Best-of-three playoff. After losing the first match 0-3, Castillo tattooed the [...] Bible verse in one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> saying that these passage guided her life. However, Castillo was chosen among the tournament's best players, winning the Best Digger individual award, after she spent the season leading those statistics. She thanked God and expressed the satisfaction for being among {{the best of the}} league and described the accomplishment of playing with teamwork, helping her teammates in every match.|$|E

2500|$|As a whole, {{the shape}} of Finland's {{boundaries}} resembles a figure of a one-armed human. In Finnish, parallels are drawn between the figure and the national personification of Finland – Finnish Maiden (Suomi-neito) – and {{the country as a}} whole can be referred in the Finnish language by her name. Even in official context the area around Enontekiö in northwestern part of the country between Sweden and Norway can be referred to as the [...] "Arm" [...] (käsivarsi). After the Continuation War Finland lost major land areas to Russia in the Moscow Armistice of 1944, and the figure was said to have lost the other <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> as well as a [...] of her [...] "skirt".|$|E
2500|$|A {{garbage bag}} {{was used to}} suffocate her, as it was found around her head. She had also been {{physically}} abused and raped. Creek had been bitten on the neck and was beaten and slashed in the facial area. The bite had caused compression to her neck, which {{played a role in}} her death. The word [...] "hi" [...] was written on the girl's palm, which was raised in an upward position. A price tag from a bookstore was observed to have been present on one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> She wore few clothes, as some were likely removed in the process of the assault, including her jacket and backpack containing personal items. Her underwear was later discovered inside of her pants pocket. A possible explanation to why some of her belongings were not found at the scene is that the murderer may have taken souvenirs. Authorities surmise that Creek may have been murdered by someone that may have received prostitution services from her.|$|E
