50|$|Traditional {{preparation}} of fried green tomatoes begins by cutting the tomatoes into approximately 1/4-inch (~0.6 cm) slices. They are then seasoned {{with salt and}} pepper, coated with plain, coarse cornmeal, and shallow fried in bacon fat {{for a few minutes}} each side, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>golden</b> brown. Shallow frying is preferred, as the tomatoes do not float in the oil, which allows the weight of the tomato to press the cornmeal to the underside of the tomato. This negates the need for a 'wash' (see below).|$|E
