5|$|Imaginos was re-issued only <b>once,</b> <b>through</b> Sony BMG sub-label American Beat Records in December 2007. The 2007 reissue was remastered {{to adjust}} the volume levels and {{included}} a CD sleeve with corrected, but not complete, credits. A new remastered version of Imaginos is included in The Columbia Albums Collection boxed set, issued by Sony/Legacy in November 2012.|$|E
5|$|<b>Once</b> <b>through</b> this door, which swung inward, Booth barricaded it by wedging a stick {{between it}} and the wall. From here a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is {{evidence}} that, earlier in the day, Booth had bored a peephole in this second door, though this is not certain.|$|E
5|$|The {{publisher}} only changed <b>once</b> <b>through</b> {{the lifetime}} of the magazine, when Gernsback sold Wonder Stories in 1936. However, Gernsback changed {{the name of his}} company from Stellar Publishing Corporation to Continental Publications, Incorporated, with effect from December 1933. Thrilling Wonders publisher went by three names: Beacon Publications initially, then Better Publications from the August 1937 issue, and finally, starting with the Fall 1943 issue, Standard Magazines.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes <b>once</b> <b>through</b> the hole of the donut. An example is the red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a union of such circles.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod, like {{a number}} of other Murray-Darling native fish species, have also managed to cross the Great Dividing Range at least <b>once</b> <b>through</b> natural river capture events, leading to several species and {{subspecies}} of coastal cod. The best known are eastern freshwater cod of the Clarence River system in northern New South Wales, and Mary River cod of the Mary River system in south eastern Queensland, both of which are endangered, but survive today. Coastal cod were also found in the Richmond River system in northern New South Wales and the Brisbane River system in southern Queensland, but are now extinct.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass <b>once</b> <b>through</b> the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E

5|$|In both games, {{there are}} many {{circumstances}} when a previous item can be upgraded into a more useful form. The latter three dungeons in both games will hold a more powerful version of an item received earlier in the game. Both the sword's offensive power and the shield's defensive abilities can be upgraded twice, <b>once</b> <b>through</b> passwords and again through side quests. If Link swings an enhanced sword at full health, a sword-shaped beam will escape from the sword as a ranged attack. The number of bombs and Mystical Seeds that can be held can also be increased through the same ways as the shield and sword. Roc's Feather and the Power Bracelet are special cases, as, while the two are in both games, the former can only be upgraded in Oracle of Seasons while the latter only in Oracle of Ages.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. <b>Once</b> <b>through,</b> the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{lieutenant}} on 25 August 1916, Cherry {{returned to}} his unit on the Somme in November. The following month he was made a temporary captain and transferred back to the 26th Battalion as the commanding officer of C Company. His rank was confirmed on 14 February 1917, and on 1–2 March {{he was involved in}} the battalion's actions around the village of Warlencourt. At 03:00 on 2 March, Cherry led his company in an attack on the German held position of Malt Trench, situated between the villages of Warlencourt and Bapaume. Artillery fire had failed to adequately cut the barbed wire lines for the advancing troops, and Cherry led a section of men along the wire until he found a break in it. <b>Once</b> <b>through</b> the gap, he rushed two machine gun posts, capturing one single-handed, and turned one on the fleeing Germans before being wounded himself. For his actions during the engagement, Cherry was awarded the Military Cross, the notification of which was published in a supplement of the London Gazette on 26 April 1917.|$|E

5|$|US4 {{begins at}} the {{concurrency}} of US9 and US20 in East Greenbush. Heading northward, it has an interchange with I-90, continuing northward into Troy. In Troy, it passes by Hudson Valley Community College {{as well as the}} headquarters of the 42nd Infantry Division. US4 then heads downhill, passing the historic South End Tavern as Burden Avenue, named for the historic Burden Iron Works. Later, US4 assumes Fourth Street, which splits into parallel one-way streets (Third Street handles southbound traffic from downtown). At Congress Street, {{in the middle of the}} Central Troy Historic District with St. Paul's Episcopal Church on the corner, it intersects NY2. <b>Once</b> <b>through</b> downtown, the streets meet and pass by the Green Island Bridge, later passing under the Collar City Bridge and onto Second Avenue in Lansingburgh.|$|E

25|$|<b>Once</b> <b>through</b> the wire, the sappers {{scattered}} toward key targets: the FSB's artillery, {{the bunker}} serving as Battalion Tactical Operations Center (B-TOC), the company command post, {{and many of}} the perimeter bunkers. Their attack was aided by tear gas, delivered either by sappers (using grenades) or mixed in with regular high-explosive mortar rounds as part of the bombardment.|$|E
25|$|The tunnel {{has created}} {{problems}} of its own. The toads originally refused {{to use the}} tunnel and so the tunnel was lit to encourage its use. The toads then died from {{the heat of the}} lamps inside the tunnel. <b>Once</b> <b>through</b> the tunnel, the toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing hole in the ground. The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town.|$|E
25|$|The English innings {{began with}} Marcus Trescothick hitting nine {{boundaries}} off Brett Lee, while Andrew Strauss preferred Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz. Their 112-run partnership {{was the highest}} by England in the series thus far; the Australians had only surpassed that <b>once,</b> <b>through</b> Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke's 155 at Lord's. To add to Australia's woes, Trescothick was caught off a no-ball on 32, and eventually went on to make 90, being the second man out shortly after lunch, with the score 164 for 2 after 32.3 overs.|$|E

25|$|In {{the postwar}} era, the {{development}} of new precision bombsights essentially ended. At first this was due to the military drawdown, but as budgets increased again during the opening of the Cold War, the bomber mission had passed to nuclear weapons. These required accuracies on the order of , well within the capabilities of existing radar bombing systems. Only one major bombsight of note was developed, the Y-4 developed on the Boeing B-47 Stratojet. This sight combined the images of the radar and a lens system in front of the aircraft, allowing them to be directly compared at <b>once</b> <b>through</b> a binocular eyepiece.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{departed}} {{the navy}} yard on 23 August with an escort of three destroyers. She sailed {{south to the}} Panama Canal and traversed the locks on 28 August. <b>Once</b> <b>through,</b> she continued west into the Pacific, arriving off Nukuʻalofa, the capital of Tonga, on 14 September. She was chosen by Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee, Jr., to be his flagship. Washington was assigned to Task Force 17, based around the aircraft carrier , on the 15th. Along with various other ships, Washington operated out of Nouméa and Espiritu Santo and took part in various elements of the Solomon Islands campaign, including protecting the convoys moving needed materiel to the Battle of Guadalcanal, until early November.|$|E
25|$|In June 1864, Hooker was the {{adjutant-general}} for the First Brigade, Second Division, Eighteenth Army Corps, {{in charge}} of nine regiments during the Battle of Cold Harbor. Hooker received several serious wounds during the battle: he was shot five times, twice in the legs, twice in the body, <b>once</b> <b>through</b> the left shoulder, and one that shattered his collar bone, leaving the subclavian artery bare. Hooker, however, recovered and {{was assigned to the}} Third Division, Twenty-fourth Corps and served with the First Brigade. After the surrender of Richmond {{and the end of the}} war, Hooker tendered his resignation but was refused twice. Hooker was able to muster out with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1865.|$|E
