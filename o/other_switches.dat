All layer-2 ethernet switches have a family or model-number below the 6000 and {{are based on}} Marvell hardware. Each model has its own family of firmware with different CLI and GUI (the PCT5500 series offer very limited layer-3 options, but is mainly a layer-2 switch).The switches with a model-number above 6000 are based on Broadcom hardware. Although each switch has its own firmware images; the options and capabilities on these switches are the same or similar. The PCT6200 (rack) series continue to run in the major-release number 3: new features or capabilities released in the <b>other</b> <b>switches</b> under firmware 4 or 5 are not available for the PCT6200 series.All <b>other</b> <b>switches</b> that are based on Broadcom hardware run on major release 4 or 5.|$|E

40|$|Candida glabrata {{undergoes}} reversible, high-frequency core switching between phenotypes {{that include}} dark brown (DB), light brown (LB) and white (Wh). These phenotypes in turn can {{switch to the}} irregular wrinkle (IWr) phenotype. Natural isolates, however, express predominantly the DB phenotype, leading to the hypothesis {{that it has a}} colonization advantage over the <b>other</b> <b>switch</b> phenotypes. Using the mouse model of systemic infection, results are presented which support this hypothesis. DB has an advantage over <b>other</b> <b>switch</b> phenotypes in colonizing the two major target organs in the mouse model, the spleen and liver. A time-course study reveals that colonization of the major target organs occurs very rapidly (within 2 h) after host injection, and that the DB advantage for spleen and liver colonization is immediate. The DB advantage is maintained during clearing from spleen, liver and kidneys, and during delayed transient brain colonization. These results demonstrate that DB has a colonization advantage over <b>other</b> <b>switch</b> phenotypes, and that the switch phenotype expressed by a colonizing population therefore plays a fundamental role in virulence. It is therefore essential that switching be considered in both in vivo and in vitro studies of C. glabrata virulence...|$|R

50|$|After 1945, a {{continued}} annual 2% {{increase in productivity}} (as opposed to 1% from 1835-1935) led to further increases in farm size and corresponding reductions {{in the number of}} farms.

5000|$|The {{direction}} {{which represents}} [...] "on" [...] also varies by country. In the US and Canada, it is usual for the [...] "on" [...] {{position of a}} toggle switch to be [...] "up", whereas in many other countries such as the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand it is [...] "down". In multiway switching, the correspondence between a single switch's state and whether lights are on or off depends on <b>other</b> <b>switches</b> in the circuit.|$|E
50|$|When {{a device}} is first {{attached}} to a switch port, it will not immediately start to forward data. It will instead go {{through a number of}} states while it processes BPDUs and determines the topology of the network. When a host is attached such as a computer, printer or server the port will always go into the forwarding state, albeit after a delay of about 30 seconds while it goes through the listening and learning states (see below). The time spent in the listening and learning states is determined by a value known as the forward delay (default 15 seconds and set by the root bridge). However, if instead another switch is connected, the port may remain in blocking mode if it is determined that it would cause a loop in the network. Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDUs are used to inform <b>other</b> <b>switches</b> of port changes. TCNs are injected into the network by a non-root switch and propagated to the root. Upon receipt of the TCN, the root switch will set a Topology Change flag in its normal BPDUs. This flag is propagated to all <b>other</b> <b>switches</b> to instruct them to rapidly age out their forwarding table entries.|$|E
