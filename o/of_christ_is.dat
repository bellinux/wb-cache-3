5|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of Black Hebrew {{organizations}} were established. In Harlem alone, {{at least eight}} such groups were founded between 1919 and 1931. The Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations is the oldest-known Black Hebrew group and the Church of God and Saints <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the largest}} Black Hebrew organizations. The Commandment Keepers, founded by Wentworth Arthur Matthew in New York, are noted for their adherence to traditional Judaism. The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem are widely known for having moved from the United States, primarily Chicago, to Israel in the late-20th century.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} narthex entrances sits below a tympanum. These 3 tympana were {{designed}} and sculpted by John Angel. The tympanum above the main, west entrance depicts Jesus {{as described in the}} Book of Revelation, together with the four beasts and other relevant iconography. It resembles the tympanum of the Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral. Beneath the figure <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>is</b> Princeton University's shield, illustrating the university's motto, Dei sub numine viget ("Under the power of God she flourishes"). The tympana above the north and south entrances depict the Annunciation and the Baptism of Christ, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brownâ€“green tabard at the feet <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>is</b> probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E

5|$|The {{colourful}} Buhl altarpiece is {{the work}} of a group of followers of Martin Schongauer, who drew their inspiration both from his woodcuts and from his paintings, especially the Altarpiece of the Dominicans, now kept in the Unterlinden Museum. The Buhl painters closely followed their model's designs, but on a larger scale and in a simpler and technically cruder manner. While it is not documented that the altarpiece was commissioned by the convent of Saint Catherine, the closeness to the designs of Schongauer but also, to a lesser degree, of Caspar Isenmann (the panel depicting the Flagellation <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>is</b> reminding of the same scene in the altarpiece of St Martin's Church) indicate without a doubt that it has been painted in Colmar; furthermore, both Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula, who figure prominently in the Crucifixion scene, were particularly venerated by the Dominican sisters of Saint Catherine.|$|E
