5|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} {{books of}} the Bhagavata Purana are widely {{considered to be a}} poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the Harivamsa. Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (lila), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king. Krishna's life is closer to that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> in Harivamsa, but is a symbolic universe in the Bhagavata Purana, where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The Bhagavata Purana manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pelvis}} {{is not entirely}} like that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> (<b>being</b> {{markedly}} wide, or flared, with laterally orientated iliac blades), these features point to a structure radically remodelled to accommodate a significant degree of bipedalism. The femur angles in toward the knee from the hip. This trait allows the foot to fall closer to the midline of the body, and strongly indicates habitual bipedal locomotion. Present-day humans, orangutans and spider monkeys possess this same feature. The feet feature adducted big toes, making it difficult if not impossible to grasp branches with the hindlimbs. Besides locomotion, A. afarensis also had a slightly larger brain than a modern chimpanzee (the closest living relative of humans) and had teeth that were more human than ape-like.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>human</b> <b>being’s</b> new {{experience}} {{is created by}} the a priori method, irrespective of its scale. For example, according to Orudzhev, the three well-known stages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being’s</b> temporal existence can be characterised as the dominance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being’s</b> homogenous (mass) abilities in the first (primitive) stage; group abilities in the second (historical) stage; and individual, creative abilities in the third (post-historical) stage. All these changes took place gradually, of course, {{over the course of}} tens of thousands <b>of</b> years, as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the changing modes of thought that controlled the actions of <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b>|$|R
25|$|Thomas Aquinas {{claimed that}} X’s soul was X’s only {{substantial}} form, although X also had numerous accidental forms {{that accounted for}} X’s nonessential features. Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X's matter constitute X, which in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> is rational capacity. He attributed all other features <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> to accidental forms. However, Aquinas did not claim that the soul was identical to the person. He held that a proper human being is a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> but are nonetheless not identical to that person. So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.|$|E

25|$|To refute Hegel's {{claim that}} Christianity should be {{understood}} {{as a part of the}} necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of Abraham to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being)</b> and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.|$|E
25|$|A {{crash test}} dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. The Crash Test Dummy is widely used by researchers and automobile companies to predict the biomechanics, force, impact, and injury <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> in an automobile crash. This data can include variables such as velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, folding, or torque of the body, and deceleration rates during a collision for use in crash tests. The more advanced dummies are sophisticated machines designed to behave as a human body and with many sensors to record the forces of an impact; they may cost over US$400,000.|$|E

As the series progresses, she eventually comes to discover that she is, in reality, merely an autonomous, sentient computer program in the physical and corporeal form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> designed to sever the invisible barrier between the Wired and the real world. In the end, Lain is challenged to accept herself as a de facto goddess for the Wired, having become an omnipotent and omnipresent virtual being with worshipers of her own, as well as an ability to exist beyond the borders of devices, time, or space.|$|E

25|$|The {{human body}} can express {{the symbol of}} world axis. Some of the more {{abstract}} Tree of Life representations, such as the sefirot in Kabbalism and in the chakra system recognized by Hinduism and Buddhism, merge {{with the concept of}} the human body as a pillar between heaven and earth. Disciplines such as yoga and tai chi begin from the premise of the human body as axis mundi. The Buddha represents a world centre in human form. Large statues of a meditating figure unite the human figure with the symbolism of temple and tower. Astrology in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient Colossus of Rhodes combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the Vitruvian Man represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis.|$|E
