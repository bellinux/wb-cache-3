500|$|Also preen gland; <b>oil</b> <b>gland.</b> A gland {{found at}} the , {{at the base of}} the [...] that {{produces}} a waxy secretion made up of oils, fatty acids, fats and water that the majority of birds use in daily [...] of their feathers. Though feathers [...] periodically, they are inert structures without a nourishment system and would deteriorate rapidly without such application during preening. The applied waxy secretion aids in waterproofing, helps maintain feather moistness to keep them from becoming brittle and maintain flexibility, and is thought to promote the growth of nonpathogenic fungi, to deter feather lice and some forms of keratin-eating fungi and bacteria. The gland, a bilobed structure, is usually surrounding by a tuft of downy feathers that can act like a wick for the secreted oils.|$|E
2500|$|The uropygial gland, informally {{known as}} the preen gland or the <b>oil</b> <b>gland,</b> is a bilobate sebaceous gland possessed by the {{majority}} of birds. [...] It is located dorsally {{at the base of the}} tail (between the fourth caudal vertebrae and the pygostyle) and is greatly variable in both shape and size. [...] In some species, the opening of the gland has a small tuft of feathers to provide a [...] for the preen oil (see below). [...] It is a holocrine gland enclosed in a connective tissue capsule made up of glandular acini that deposit their oil secretion into a common collector tube ending in a variable number of pores (openings), most usually two. Each lobe has a central cavity that collects the secretion from tubules arranged radially around the cavity. The gland secretion is conveyed to the surface via ducts that, in most species, open at the top of a papilla (nipple-like structure).|$|E
6000|$|Besides these {{races and}} sub-races {{a number of}} other kinds have been described, and about one hundred and fifty {{varieties}} can be distinguished. It {{is interesting to note that}} almost every part of the bird, whose variations can be noted and selected, has led to variations of a considerable extent, and many of these have necessitated changes in the plumage and in the skeleton quite as great as any that occur in the numerous distinct species of large genera. The form of the skull and beak varies enormously, so that the skulls of the Short-faced tumbler and some of the Carriers differ more than any wild pigeons, even those classed in distinct genera. The breadth and number of the ribs vary, as well as the processes on them; the number of the vertebrae and the length of the sternum also vary; and the perforations in the sternum vary in size and shape. The <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> varies in development, and is sometimes absent. The number of the wing-feathers varies, and those of the tail to an enormous extent. The proportions of the leg and feet and the number of the scutellae also vary. The eggs also vary somewhat in size and shape; and the amount of downy clothing on the young bird, when first hatched, differs very considerably. Finally, the attitude of the body, the manner of walking, the mode of flight, and the voice, all exhibit modifications of the most remarkable kind.[35] ...|$|E
40|$|Anatomical {{changes in}} lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swingle) {{reproductive}} organs were investigated, {{with emphasis on}} the ontogeny of essential <b>oil</b> <b>glands</b> and their relation to organ development. Perianth had a leaf-like internal structure, with the developmental changes restricted to the ground system. Ovary diameter increased by cell divisions until fruit color change and by increase in size, wall thickness and intercellular space towards fruit maturity. Development of <b>oil</b> <b>glands</b> in flower and fruit peel revealed a similar pattern and was investigated in the ovary wall. Glands seemed to develop from some epidermal and subepidermal cells, into a conical stalk and a globular or oblong structure consisting of a central cavity surrounded by a protective sheath. Initiation of ovary <b>oil</b> <b>glands</b> started at preanthesis and was restricted to young green fruit. Mature <b>oil</b> <b>glands</b> continued to enlarge throughout fruit growth. Disputes regarding the manner of cavity opening in Citrus could be resolved by considering the three dimensional aspect of the <b>oil</b> <b>glands...</b>|$|R

40|$|The natural {{occurrence}} of <b>oil</b> <b>glands</b> in various organs such as bark and leaves {{is well established}} as a characteristic of Eucalyptus, {{but this is the}} first reported case of traumatic <b>oil</b> <b>glands</b> induced in response to wounding. The new phloem enveloping the wound, which had developed within the 2 years following branch pruning in 5 -year-old Eucalyptus globulus Labill., was morphologically distinct from healthy stem phloem. Histological examinations revealed this wound-associated phloem to be largely composed of secretory cavities similar in appearance to <b>oil</b> <b>glands.</b> Subsequent analysis of the wound-associated phloem extracts by GC-MS confirmed the presence of volatile terpenes and phenols. The total extracted oil content determined for woundassociated phloem extracts was significantly higher (> 4 times) than for healthy stem phloem extracts. A comparison of the relative abundances of ten individual terpenoids from wound-associated phloem and healthy phloem revealed a number of significant differences in terpene composition. Implications of the role of terpenes as inducible secondary metabolites in tree wound responses are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Peripheral factors seem {{relatively}} unimportant {{in controlling}} dust bathing. Deprivation of dust bathing {{results in an}} increase in lipids on the feathers and a subsequent increase in dust bathing activity when this is allowed. [...] However, although it has been speculated that the function of dust bathing is probably removal of excess lipids on the feathers, lipid accumulation as a major cause of dust bathing has not been proven. A 1991 experiment by Van Liere, et al. of the Wageningen Agricultural University of the Netherlands could only increase the duration of dust bathing bouts marginally by spreading lipids, equivalent to 1-2 months' accumulation, on birds’ feathers. Moreover, removal of the <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> in chicks, which eliminated the main source of lipids, had no effect on subsequent dust bathing. It therefore seems that the main effects of deprivation of dust bathing in hens act through a central mechanism and not a peripheral one.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the currently approved Australian citrus disinfestation protocol for export to Japan, degreened `Eureka' lemons [Citrus limon (L.) Burm. ] were cold-stored for 2 weeks at 1 C. Following cold treatment, fruit were stored at 5 C for 3 weeks, then transferred to 20 C for an additional week to simulate transportation and handling. Fruit harvested {{early in the season}} were more susceptible to chilling injury than fruit harvested later, with 62 % having lesions > 1 cm 2 after 2 weeks at 1 C. Most of the chilling injury occurred after subsequent storage (at 5 C) rather than immediately after the 1 C treatment. Injury was different from surface pitting or oleocellosis, manifesting as large uniform surface lesions 2 to 3 cm in diameter that rapidly discolored following storage at 20 C. Although the oil glands were flattened, the collenchyma layer immediately above the <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> remained intact. Cellular discoloration was localized around the <b>oil</b> <b>gland,</b> possibly indicating a lateral release of <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> contents.

40|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} {{based on}} ultrastructural correlation, specific labeling, and subcellular fractionation studies indicates {{that at least}} the early steps of monoterpene biosynthesis occur in plastids. (4 S) -Limonene synthase, {{which is responsible for}} the first dedicated step of monoterpene biosynthesis in mint species, appears to be translated as a preprotein bearing a long plastidial transit peptide. Immunogold labeling using polyclonal antibodies raised to the native enzyme demonstrated the specific localization of limonene synthase to the leucoplasts of peppermint (Mentha × piperita) <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> secretory cells during the period of essential oil production. Labeling was shown to be absent from all other plastid types examined, including the basal and stalk cell plastids of the secretory phase glandular trichomes. Furthermore, in vitro translation of the preprotein and import experiments with isolated pea chloroplasts were consistent in demonstrating import of the nascent protein to the plastid stroma and proteolytic processing to the mature enzyme at this site. These experiments confirm that the leucoplastidome of the <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> secretory cells is the exclusive location of limonene synthase, and almost certainly the preceding steps of monoterpene biosynthesis, in peppermint leaves. However, succeeding steps of monoterpene metabolism in mint appear to occur outside the leucoplasts of <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> cells...|$|E
40|$|Study {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which some environmental parameters influence oil yield in the newly established tea tree oil industry. Young oil glands of Melaleuca alternifolia possessed a densely cytoplasmic epidermal lining, and cell fragments were observed in mature glands indicating a lysigenous mode of formation. The glands were capped by modified epidermal cells. Oil was observed to pass through these cells when the leaf was subjected to vacuum. The yield and composition of tea tree oil was recorded over a 48 hour period and showed no significant variation. Short term (8 days) water stress did not affect oil yield or composition. Further, varying nitrogen and phosphorous nutrition and light levels over a three month period did not influence <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> density or oil yield from leaves formed under the imposed conditions. The lack of a diurnal variation in oil content, together with observations of the mode of formation and development of the gland and effects of environmental conditions on <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> density and oil yield, support the concept of a one way developmental pathway for <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> formation and oil content. Thus the oil yield of a leaf should be determined by the growth conditions prevailing at the time of leaf expansion, gland formation and oil synthesis. <b>Oil</b> <b>gland</b> initials were first apparent in immature leaves (c. node 3) within shoot apical growth of Melaleuca alternifolia. Glands continued to form, while density per unit area decreased, as the leaf expanded. Under the growth conditions employed, a maximum number of ca. 550 glands was reached as the leaf matured at node 12. Variation in the number of glands present in the most recently fully expanded leaf was less within a plant than between plants of the same seed source, indicating a genetic component to <b>oil</b> <b>gland</b> density. Micropropagation of M. alternifolia Cheel. (tea tree) was achieved using nodal explants from mature trees. A culture procedure involving nodes sourced from 1. 5 to 3 cm fromthe shoot tip, cultured into a shoot induction medium of MS basal salts supplemented with 1 mg. L-¹ 6 -benzylaminopurine and 60 mM sucrose for 12 weeks, followed by subculturing for root induction on medium containing MS basal salts, 60 mM sucrose and 0. 1 or 1 µM indole acetic acid for 8 weeks, is recommended. A comparison of the source of explant material and the form of cytokinin and mineralised nitrogen on the production of multiple shoots per node was made. Further, an investigation of the effect of shoot induction treatment, the age of plant used for explants and the value of the presence of charcoal, sucrose and light on subsequent root formation in plantlets is reported...|$|E
