5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The tips <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) {{he found that}} standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He {{found that there was}} only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E
5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> on the typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.|$|E
5|$|With massive {{radio and}} video play, Blink-182 played to larger crowds {{when they began}} touring in support of Enema of the State. The Loserkids Tour {{commenced}} {{in the autumn of}} 1999 and was the band's first arena tour. The band was forced to postpone remaining dates of a spring European tour in 2000 when both DeLonge and Barker came down with strep throat. The band played to sold-out audiences and performed worldwide during the summer of 2000 on The Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour. The tour was staged as a drive-in movie, with a giant retro billboard suspended from the ceiling, and films were projected on the screen behind the band– including vintage gay porn as a joke. The tour {{was one of the most}} anticipated rock tours of the season and the band headed out on the road with Bad Religion and Fenix TX. Barker broke one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> during an altercation with two men who kept flirting with his girlfriend in Ohio, and Damon Delapaz, guitarist of Fenix TX, stepped in on drums for Barker. Hoppus recalled an overwhelming emotional feeling when the band sold out the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|Entwistle's playing {{technique}} incorporated fingerstyle, plectrum, tapping, {{and the use}} of harmonics. He {{changed his}} style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from pick-up to the E string and occasionally even positioning his thumb near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between his thumb and forefinger, with the rest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> outstretched for balance.|$|E
25|$|In November 1987, the ARW was {{tasked with}} {{setting up a}} {{checkpoint}} in Urlingford, County Kilkenny to assist Gardaí in catching suspects linked to the kidnapping of a dentist and his family by the IRA, in an ordeal during which the dentist had two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> cut off by the gang and a Garda officer suffered serious gunshot wounds. Acting on information, Gardaí were expecting a green BMW car {{with two of the}} gang's suspects. As the car approached, snipers from the ARW opened fire more than a dozen times killing one suspect and seriously injuring another. The surviving IRA terrorist had been linked to 26 murders and was jailed for 40 years by the Special Criminal Court.|$|E
25|$|According to Art O'Leary, {{as early}} as March 1934, Dillinger {{expressed}} an interest in plastic surgery and had asked O'Leary to check with Piquett on such matters. At the end of April, Piquett paid a visit to his old friend Dr. Wilhelm Loeser. Loeser had practiced in Chicago for 27 years before being convicted under the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1931. He was sentenced to three years at Leavenworth, but was paroled early on December 7, 1932, with Piquett's help. He later testified that he performed facial surgery on himself and obliterated the fingerprint impressions on the tips <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> by the application of a caustic soda preparation. Piquett said Dillinger would have to pay $5,000 for the plastic surgery: $4,400 split between Piquett, Loeser and O'Leary, and $600 to Dr. Harold Cassidy, who would administer the anaesthetic. The procedure would take place at the home of Piquett's longtime friend, 67-year-old James Probasco, at the end of May.|$|E

That he, namely, the man who before I scorned should eat with the dogs of my flock, that before I slighted and had no regard of, that I shut out of door; send him, 'that he may dip the tip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> in water, and cool my tongue.' ...|$|R

25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to {{open the front door}} of the {{residence}} and the driver got out to open the door for Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded to the right of the second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and went in and out of his chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|Besieged by reporters, Ethan checks into a motel. He {{receives}} {{a letter from}} the killer, which leads to a shoebox containing a mobile phone, a handgun, and five origami figures. The killer calls him and explains that each of the figures contains instructions on how to complete a trial, which will allow him to determine how much Ethan loves his son. If he chooses to complete them, then he will receive a piece of the address where Shaun is held. The trials force Ethan to make increasingly difficult moral decisions, including driving against traffic at high speeds on the highway, crawling through a maze composed of broken glass and active electrical pylons, cutting off one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> breaking into the apartment of a drug dealer and murdering him in front of his family, and drinking a glass of poison on camera. While undergoing the trials, he meets Madison Paige, a journalist who occasionally checks into the motel to deal with her chronic insomnia. She sympathizes with Ethan's plight, and decides to conduct her own investigation into the Origami Killer.|$|E
25|$|The Hebron Yeshiva, {{a branch}} of the famed Slobodka yeshiva, was also {{attacked}} during the riots. On Friday, 23 August, an Arab crowd gathered outside it and threw stones through the windows. Only two people were inside, a student and the sexton. The student was grabbed by the Arab crowd, who stabbed him to death; the sexton survived by hiding in a well. The next day, a crowd armed with staves and axes attacked and killed two Jewish boys, one stoned to death and the other stabbed. More than 70 Jews, including the Yeshiva students, sought refuge in the house of Eliezer Dan Slonim, the son of the Rabbi of Hebron, but were massacred by an Arab mob. Survivors and reporters recounted the carnage that occurred at the Slonim residence. Moses Harbater, an 18-year-old was stabbed and two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> were severed. He described at a later trial of some Arab rioters how a fellow student had been mutilated and killed. Forty-two teachers and students were murdered at the yeshiva.|$|E

25|$|The MCC touring team left Tilbury Docks on the S.S. Stratheden amidst {{calls to}} cancel the Ashes tour because of the {{weakness}} of the team led by Freddie Brown. Such critics were, of course, ignored and the team traveled in first-class luxury on the P liner. Though it took several weeks for them to reach Fremantle in Western Australia this method avoided jet lag and allowed the team to relax and get to know each other. The teenager Brian Close had been excused from National Service in the British Army and was particularly active in exploring the whole ship from top to bottom. Apart from the normal deck exercises some of the MCC players formed a short lived band and Godfrey Evans gave his well-known impression of Carmen Miranda in the fancy dress party. They stopped in Ceylon for a one-day game which was drawn, but saw Arthur Macintyre make 104 and Len Hutton damage one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> They otherwise arrived safely and found that steak and fried eggs were regularly served in Australian hotels (virtually unobtainable in ration-bound Britain) and soon put on weight.|$|E
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E
