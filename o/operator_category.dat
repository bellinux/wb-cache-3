50|$|Radio {{contests}} {{typically have}} different <b>operator</b> <b>categories</b> for Single or Multiple people using a single {{station in the}} contest. SO2R is an operating technique used by some competitors in the single-operator categories in contesting. While single-operator means that only one transmitter can be active at any time, in SO2R, a single station operator uses two radios to listen simultaneously to two different radio frequencies. When the two radios are on different radio bands, an operator can be listening to one radio while the other is transmitting. This can result in increased operating efficiency, as the operator can always be looking for new contacts to increase his or her score.

40|$|Mobile network {{operators}} {{have a significant}} interest {{in the performance of}} streaming video on their networks because network dynamics directly influence the Quality of Experi-ence (QoE). However, unlike video service providers, net-work operators are not privy to the client- or server-side logs typically used to measure key video performance met-rics, such as user engagement. To address this limitation, this paper presents the first large-scale study characterizing the impact of cellular network performance on mobile video user engagement {{from the perspective of a}} network operator. Our study on a month-long anonymized data set from a ma-jor cellular network makes two main contributions. First, we quantify the effect that 31 different network factors have on user behavior in mobile video. Our results provide {{network operators}} direct guidance on how to improve user engage-ment — for example, improving mean signal-to-interference ratio by 1 dB reduces the likelihood of video abandonment by 2 %. Second, we model the complex relationships between these factors and video abandonment, enabling operators to monitor mobile video user engagement in real-time. Our model can predict whether a user completely downloads a video with more than 87 % accuracy by observing only the initial 10 seconds of video streaming sessions. Moreover, our model achieves significantly better accuracy than prior mod-els that require client- or server-side logs, yet we only use standard radio network statistics and/or TCP/IP headers available to network <b>operators.</b> <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptor...|$|R

Category theory provides a variety of notions which expand on the lattice theoretic concept of closure operator which leads to a never ending stream of examples and applications in all areas of mathematics. Actions of a monoid have always been a useful tool to study the math-ematical structures, and recently have captured the interest of some com-puter scientists. For this reason and because of its closed relation to the category of sets, one can take the topos MSet of M-sets, for a monoid M, as the ”universe of discourse ” to study mathematical notions in it.
