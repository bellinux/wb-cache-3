5|$|Guinea pigs also {{practice}} alloparental care, {{in which}} a female may adopt the pup or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. This behavior is common, and is seen in many <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> species such as the elephant.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are omnivores, eating insects, other arthropods, small {{birds and}} reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar and {{miscellaneous}} vegetation. A 1984 {{study of the}} Sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> prey. A more detailed study of another Sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% nectar, 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> prey. The most common dietary item was nectar from flowers of the Bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis). The Sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell.|$|E

5|$|Like Le Guin's earlier novel The Word for World Is Forest, {{this story}} {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} humans and their natural environment. The story also makes repeated references to the poetry of Andrew Marvell, including in the title. The story was republished in Le Guin's collections The Wind's Twelve Quarters and Buffalo Gals and <b>Other</b> <b>Animal</b> Presences, {{as well as in}} many other anthologies. It was nominated for the Hugo Award in 1972.|$|E

40|$|In using sociological {{perspectives}} {{to examine}} <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> in society Animals and Sociology aims to challenge traditional {{assumptions about the}} very nature of sociology. Kay Peggs seeks to explore the significant contribution that sociology can make to our understanding of human relations with <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> and the important contribution that the study of <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> in society can make to sociology. Alasdair Cochrane believes the book {{can be thought of as}} a manifesto for future sociological work on animals...|$|R
40|$|What {{calls for}} justice? Are we called {{to do justice}} to <b>other</b> <b>animals?</b> How ought we to {{understand}} and relate to the <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> around us? The work of Jacques Derrida offers a strong foundation from which to consider these questions, and I build on his work by developing a set of clear conceptual tools to understand justice and animality (or animal alterity) through the demands they make on us. I argue that this interrelation between justice and animality can be addressed in a profound way by considering the figure of 2 ̆ 2 the call 2 ̆ 2 —including the calls of <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> and the call of justice. I use the 2 ̆ 2 the call 2 ̆ 2 to offer the reader a tool for opening up their own relations to <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> their responsibilities to them, and the richly differentiated lives of those <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> all of which can be addressed by carefully listening to the call...|$|R
5|$|Many {{insects are}} parasites of other insects {{such as the}} {{parasitoid}} wasps. These insects are known as entomophagous parasites. They can be beneficial due to their devastation of pests that can destroy crops and other resources. Many insects have a parasitic relationship with humans such as the mosquito. These insects are known to spread diseases such as malaria and yellow fever and because of such, mosquitoes indirectly cause more deaths of humans than any <b>other</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Performing {{addition}} {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} numerical tasks. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, , can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some members of <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given {{the age of the}} species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals. However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> species have not been observed, and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Four orthopoxviruses cause {{infection}} in humans: variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox. Variola virus infects only humans in nature, although primates and <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> {{have been infected}} in a laboratory setting. Vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> in nature.|$|R

5000|$|An anthroponotic disease, or anthroponosis, is an {{infectious}} disease {{in which a}} disease causing agent carried by humans is transferred to <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b> It may cause the same disease or a different disease in <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b> Since humans do not generally inflict bite wounds on <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> the method of transmissions is always a [...] "soft" [...] contact such as skin to skin transmission. An example is chytridiomycosis which can be spread by humans with the fungus on their skin handling frogs with bare hands.|$|R
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{survey the}} {{damage in the}} city, which {{appears to have been}} caused by an {{elephant}} even though none was seen. Ed Meecham, an animal handler at the zoo, recounts how he came to the elephant's locked cage to find it empty. His boss, Willa Ambrose, tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> disappearances. She blames the zoo's decline on an animal rights group which is known to free captive animals. The group's leader, Kyle Lang, denies any involvement in the elephant's release. Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla she took from their country ten years prior.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the chronicles {{of earlier}} {{travelling}} naturalists, including Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin and especially William Henry Edwards, Wallace {{decided that he}} too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist. In 1848, Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the Mischief. Their intention was to collect insects and <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> specimens in the Amazon Rainforest for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the transmutation of species.|$|E
5|$|Mercury was {{ingested}} {{through the}} consumption of homemade bread, meat and <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> products obtained from livestock given treated barley, vegetation grown from soil contaminated with mercury, game birds that had fed on the grain and fish caught in rivers, canals, and lakes into which treated grain had been dumped by the farmers. Ground seed dust inhalation was a contributing factor in farmers during sowing and grinding. Consumption of ground flour through homemade bread {{is thought to have}} been the major cause, since no cases were reported in urban areas, where government flour supplies were commercially regulated.|$|E
5|$|The ox and the ass, {{as well as}} <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> {{became a}} part of nativity scene tradition.

5|$|Part of {{the network}} of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), the Tualatin River refuge {{is one of only}} ten urban refuges in the United States. Habitats in the refuge include forested areas, wetlands, oak and pine grassland, and meadows, with mixed {{deciduous}} and coniferous forests common to Western Oregon. The refuge was established as an urban refuge to provide wetland, riparian, and upland habitats for a variety of migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, fish and other resident wildlife. The refuge is home to nearly 200 bird species and more than 70 <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> species.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{entirely on}} carrion. It will eat roadkill or <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> carcasses. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot {{make the first}} cut into the carcass of a larger animal as its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. After a few days, the greater yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion, as the meat will begin to decay and become contaminated with microbial toxins. It will drink water from a pool, pond, or any receptacle provided. Like other vultures, they {{play an important role in}} the ecosystem by disposing off carrion which could otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
5|$|The lion is {{probably}} represented more frequently and diversely than any <b>other</b> <b>animal.</b> In most forms, the lion has no apotropaic meaning and was merely decorative. However, it sometimes has an astrological or symbolic meaning. One {{of the popular}} forms of the lion is explicitly heraldic form, including in the Persian coat of arms (the lion and sun); the animal in the coat of arms of the Mamluk Baybars and perhaps also in that of the Rum Saldjukids {{of the name of}} Kilidi Arslan; and in numismatic representations.|$|E

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is a highly}} {{successful}} animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success {{is due in part}} to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> waste. In functional terms, the spotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2–5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60km/h.|$|E
5|$|The terns are {{birds of}} open {{habitats}} that typically breed in noisy colonies and {{lay their eggs}} on bare ground {{with little or no}} nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The white tern, uniquely, lays its single egg on a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the clutch. Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern may see more daylight in a year than any <b>other</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> {{stories that}} uses words humans use, the feline {{characters}} of the Warriors series use different words for certain concepts and objects in the natural world. The most common terms found within the books are 'Twolegs' (humans), 'kittypets' (house cats), 'monsters' (cars), 'the Thunderpath' (a road) or 'the horseplace' (a stable). The cats also have their own terms for time and measurement, such as sundown or moonhigh representing different times of day according to {{the positions of the}} moon, sun, and stars overhead. The seasons are given names according to the trees and foliage in the forest, with 'newleaf' meaning spring, 'greenleaf' meaning summer, 'leaf-fall' meaning autumn, and 'leaf-bare' meaning winter.|$|E
