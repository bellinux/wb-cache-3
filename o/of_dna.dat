5|$|Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider {{right-handed}} spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological {{conditions in}} partly dehydrated samples <b>of</b> <b>DNA,</b> {{while in the}} cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, {{the opposite of the}} more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.|$|E

In several works {{it was discovered that}} double-stranded (ds) DNAs are conductors: metals or semiconductors [1 - 6]. However in other works [7] the absence <b>of</b> <b>DNAs</b> conductivity has been observed even for the molecules with ordered base pairs structure. Here we show that the absence of conductivity is caused by a very large compression deformation <b>of</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Thickness <b>of</b> such compressed <b>DNAs</b> is 2 - 4 times less than the diameter (about 2 nm) of native Watson-Crick B-DNA.

5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a type}} {{of genetic}} recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules <b>of</b> <b>DNA.</b> It is most widely used by cells to accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands <b>of</b> <b>DNA,</b> known as double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination also produces new combinations <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences during meiosis, the process by which eukaryotes make gamete cells, like sperm and egg cells in animals. These new combinations <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> represent genetic variation in offspring, which in turn enables populations to adapt during the course of evolution. Homologous recombination is also used in horizontal gene transfer to exchange genetic material between different strains and species of bacteria and viruses.|$|E
5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist {{at the end}} of an {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand <b>of</b> <b>DNA.</b> However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands <b>of</b> <b>DNA,</b> complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E

5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E

5|$|All the {{functions}} <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically {{to a single}} DNA sequence.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for the computation {{of the first}} neighbour frequencies <b>of</b> <b>DNA's</b> is presented. This procedure {{is based on the}} first neighbour approximation of Gray and Tinoco. We show that the knowledge of all the ten elementary CD signals attached to the ten double stranded first neighbour configurations is not necessary. One can obtain the ten frequencies <b>of</b> an unknown <b>DNA</b> with the use of eight elementary CD signals corresponding to eight linearly independent polymer sequences. These signals can be extracted very simply from any eight or more CD spectra <b>of</b> double stranded <b>DNA's</b> <b>of</b> known frequencies. The ten frequencies <b>of</b> a <b>DNA</b> are obtained by least square fit of its CD spectrum with these elementary signals. One advantage of this procedure {{is that it does not}} necessitate linear programming, it can be used with CD data digitalized using a large number of wavelengths, thus permitting an accurate resolution of the CD spectra. Under favorable case, the ten frequencies <b>of</b> a <b>DNA</b> (not used as input data) can be determined with an average absolute error < 2 %. We have also observed that certain satellite <b>DNA's,</b> those <b>of</b> Drosophila virilis and Callinectes sapidus have CD spectra compatible with those <b>of</b> <b>DNA's</b> <b>of</b> quasi random sequence; these satellite DNA's should adopt also the B-form in solution...|$|R

5|$|Genes are {{the primary}} units of {{inheritance}} in all organisms.

All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into proteins. Cells transcribe a DNA gene into an RNA version of the gene, and a ribosome then translates the RNA into a sequence of amino acids known as a protein.
