5|$|Twelve {{days after}} the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese {{property}} consultant, became the first arguido. Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in {{the direction in which}} the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had been asking a lot <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age.|$|E

25|$|During a {{greeting}} ritual, {{the person who}} has entered the contact answers a series <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> his or her whole family, from the person who was already there. The answer is sewa, which means that everything is fine. Then the Dogon who has entered the contact repeats the ritual, asking the resident how his or her whole family is. Because the word sewa is so commonly repeated throughout a Dogon village, neighboring peoples have dubbed the Dogon the sewa people.|$|E

25|$|Early {{clinical}} trials with DMSO were stopped because <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> its safety, especially {{its ability to}} harm the eye. The most commonly reported side effects include headaches and burning and itching on contact with the skin. Strong allergic reactions have been reported. DMSO can cause contaminants, toxins, and medicines to be absorbed through the skin, which may cause unexpected effects. DMSO is thought to increase the effects of blood thinners, steroids, heart medicines, sedatives, and other drugs. In some cases this could be harmful or dangerous. It is a developmental neurotoxin.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{depleted}} uranium (DU) in munitions is controversial because <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> potential long-term health effects. Normal {{functioning of the}} kidney, brain, liver, heart, and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because uranium is a toxic metal. The aerosol produced during impact and combustion of {{depleted uranium}} munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites leading to possible inhalation by human beings. During a three-week period of conflict in 2003 in Iraq, 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes of DU munitions were used.|$|E
25|$|The Castle Bravo {{incident}} itself {{raised a}} number <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the survivability {{of a nuclear}} war. Government scientists in both the U.S. and the USSR had insisted that fusion weapons, unlike fission weapons, were cleaner, as fusion reactions did not produce the dangerously radioactive by-products of fission reactions. While technically true, this hid a more gruesome point: the last stage of a multi-staged hydrogen bomb often used the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions to induce fissioning in a jacket of natural uranium, and provided around half of the yield of the device itself.|$|E

25|$|S. 4893 was {{considered}} by the House of Representatives on March 2, 1921, with two days remaining in the congressional session. Ohio's Warren Gard had asked a number <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> previous coin bills when they passed through the House. Gard asked Vestal if the Missouri bill was identical to the earlier bills, and if it contained the same safeguards, and Vestal confirmed these. The bill {{was passed by the}} House without recorded objection, and was enacted into law with the signature of the new president, Warren G. Harding, on his inauguration day, March 4, 1921.|$|E
25|$|In September 2000, up to $50 {{million worth}} of Taco Bell-branded shells were {{recalled}} from supermarkets. The shells contained a variety of genetically modified corn called StarLink that was not approved for human consumption. StarLink was approved only for use in animal feed because <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> whether it can cause allergic reactions in people. It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type. In 2001, Tricon Global announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.|$|E
25|$|A {{crucial point}} in the {{dialogue}} is when Socrates tells Meno {{that there is no}} such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or anamnesis. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows geometric principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct answers to the questions – he intrinsically knows the Pythagorean proposition.|$|E

25|$|Allegedly paid 100,000 francs (some sources state 500 pounds), Renée Garry's {{actions have}} been {{attributed}} by some, at least partially to Garry's suspicion she had lost the affections of SOE agent France Antelme to Inayat Khan. After the war, she was tried, but escaped conviction by one vote. On or around 13 October 1943, Inayat Khan was arrested and interrogated at the SD Headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris. During that time, she attempted escape twice. Hans Kieffer, {{the former head of}} the SD in Paris, testified after the war that she did not give the Gestapo a single piece of information, but lied consistently. However, other sources indicate that she chatted amiably with an out-of-uniform Alsatian interrogator, and provided personal details that enabled the SD to answer random checks in the form <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> her childhood and family.|$|E
25|$|Through many initiatives, which {{includes}} the Diversity League Table consultation, Nwokolo has led BSN to work consistently {{in the direction of}} widening meaningful participation and access to legal services in the United Kingdom. She is noted for progressive vision in the following words: “Working with our partners we’re trying to move things forward in terms of creating a legal workforce drawn from the most meritorious. The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the social background of lawyers, and lawyers to be, represents an important new phase of the consultation.” This crucial Diversity League Table reporting has four main diversity areas; namely: gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disabilities. Focusing on the demographic composition of law firms and chambers, results are shown as a sequence of organisation profiles and successive leagues tables; ranking participants in major areas, and also showing an overall ranking on the complete Diversity League Table.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{waters and}} wetland acreage {{likely to be}} removed from the section 404 {{permitting}} program {{as a result of the}} SWANCC decision are very difficult to assess, in part because <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Corps and EPA interpretation of the ruling, but the decision may affect up to 79% of wetland acreage. One likely result is that case-by-case evaluations will then be required to determine if regulatory jurisdiction exists, the length of time to obtain section 404 permits will be longer than in the past. If federal jurisdiction is diminished, the responsibility to protect affected wetlands falls on states and local governments. A comprehensive picture of their ability to protect wetlands, under various possible state and local authorities, is difficult to draw together. Whether states will act to fill in the gap left by removal of some federal jurisdiction by new laws or programs raises difficult political and resource questions.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1999 season, the Blue Jays traded Clemens to the Yankees for {{starting}} pitcher David Wells, second baseman Homer Bush and relief pitcher Graeme Lloyd. They also fired manager Tim Johnson during spring training after {{he lied about}} several things (including killing people in the Vietnam War) in order to motivate his players. The Blue Jays had initially been willing to stand by Johnson. A blizzard <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> his credibility during spring training, however, led Ash to fire him {{less than a month}} before opening day. Johnson was replaced with Jim Fregosi, who managed the Phillies when they lost to the Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series. The offense picked up somewhat in 1999, but the pitching suffered without Clemens, as the Blue Jays finished at 84–78, in third place. After the 1999 season, the Blue Jays' original mascot for 20 years, BJ Birdy, was replaced by a duo named Ace & Diamond.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E
