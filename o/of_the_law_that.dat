Since {{she was young and}} inexperienced, Rio Branco could not rely on Imperial intervention to help push through passage of the Emperor's anti-slavery legislation. By this time, the Conservative elders were no more, and he had risen to lead the Conservative Party. Rio Branco formed his Cabinet on 7 March 1871 and it would last until 25 June 1875—the second longest in the Empire's history. Rio Branco became the longest-serving prime minister. With a single exception, all ministers he appointed were young and inexperienced. Only one achieved prominence: João Alfredo Correia de Oliveira, who as President of the Council of Ministers would, on 13 May 1888, secure passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> extinguished the last vestiges of slavery in Brazil.|$|E

The government had little interest in enforcing measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> were not related to Clarín. Clarín launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary. The government released an anti-Clarín advertisement claiming it refused to obey the law and may be subverting democracy. The conflict led to disputes with the judiciary. Minister Julio Alak said that extending an injunction that allowed Clarín to keep its assets during the trial would be an insurrection, and it was rumored that judges who did not rule as the government wished might face impeachment. The court extended the inunction.|$|E

25|$|Since {{characterisation}} and {{the choice}} of law rules were operating inflexiblly, the solution has been to allow the growth of judicial discretion within both parts of the system.

25|$|Explaining {{the origins}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> {{one can see}} in the Cities of Refuge, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that early forms of legal {{procedure}} were grounded in vengeance.

Holmes reported that in Anglo-Saxon practice, the feud was pretty well broken up by the time of William the Conqueror. The killings and house-burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson, and then the legal actions now familiar to lawyers.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the critics}} of the views put forward in this book was a Jesuit, Francis Line (1595–1675), and it was while {{answering}} his objections that Boyle made his first mention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> the volume of a gas varies inversely to {{the pressure of the}} gas, which among English-speaking people is usually called Boyle's Law after his name. The person who originally formulated the hypothesis was Henry Power in 1661. Boyle in 1662 included a reference to a paper written by Power, but mistakenly attributed it to Richard Towneley. In continental Europe the hypothesis is sometimes attributed to Edme Mariotte, although he did not publish it until 1676 and was likely aware of Boyle's work at the time.|$|E

After two years, the impact of the ban was mixed; some pubs suffered declining sales, while others developed their food sales. The Wetherspoon pub chain reported in June 2009 that profits were at the top end of expectations; however, Scottish & Newcastle's takeover by Carlsberg and Heineken was reported in January 2008 as partly the result of its weakness following falling sales due to the ban.

25|$|The Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998 {{gives the}} board power in areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> were {{previously}} uncertain.

Before {{the removal of the}} zero hour rule, the Real Time Gross Settlement system had been violated because payments in the system should inherently not be reversed. Some payments systems had previously agreed to pay and receive obligations to the whole system, rather than merely maintaining their own. But {{in the event of a}} bankruptcy, the bankrupt institution did not pay what it owed back to the solvent parties, while they had to pay their dues to the failed bank. This was later changed, when cheques were deemed void if the bankrupt institution doesn't have the funds to back them up, after the Cheques Act 1986 was amended in 1998. The Trade Practices Act 1974 generally does not allow competitors to make cooperative agreements, but if the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is permitted to make exceptions for competitors making agreements among themselves.
