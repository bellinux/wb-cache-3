The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments.

Widely used theories of charitable giving, based on warm-glow or the provision of public goods, provide insight but are not fully satisfactory as explanations of giving for the specific purpose of development. Instead, an "identification" approach to individual giving is proposed here that combines the results focus of the public goods formulation with the scale of the warm-glow model. The theoretical model is used to examine the implications for public policy, including the extent to which official aid crowds out private giving and how public policy should take account of private willingness to make charitable transfers <b>overseas.</b> Giving <b>Development</b> <b>assistance</b> Charities Social welfare...|$|R

40|$|Around {{the turn}} of the {{millennium}} a growing consensus emerged on the dos and don'ts of <b>development</b> <b>assistance,</b> based on lessons drawn from failed aid. Donors now increasingly see aid as a leverage to induce or support governance reforms in recipient countries. The EC, which considers itself to be a forerunner of the new aid approach, has recently launched a new instrument to incentivise such reforms: the 'Governance Incentive Tranche'. However, the evidence presented in this article suggests that, in design and practice, the incentive tranche is surprisingly similar to some of the unsuccessful aid modalities of the past.

It categorises these donors according to form, content, size and modality of their aid. It finds that their return increases external financial flows, in particular to countries not targeted by DAC donors. Moreover, for some donors like China and India the flows are closely related to other financial flow s such as trade and investment. Furthermore, it finds that the return of non-DAC donors may conflict with plans to harmonise aid and may simultaneously raise transaction costs for recipients. Copyright (c) The Author 2008.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health to countries {{of central and}} eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CEE-CIS). METHODS: We used the International Development Statistics database of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the database on <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health compiled for the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health to quantify health <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> to the region, compared to global and overall <b>development</b> <b>assistance.</b> We based our analysis on standard health indicators, including child mortality, life expectancy at birth and health expenditures. FINDINGS: Although total <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> per capita to CEE-CIS was higher than that for most other regions of the world, <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health was very low compared to other countries with similar levels of child mortality, life expectancy at birth and national expenditures on health. CONCLUSION: The allocation of <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health on a global scale seems to be related far more to child mortality rather than adult mortality. Countries of CEE-CIS have a high burden of adult morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases, which does not appear to attract proportionate <b>development</b> <b>assistance.</b> Levels of <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health should be determined in consideration of the region's particular burden of disease...|$|R
