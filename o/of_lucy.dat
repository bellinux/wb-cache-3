5|$|One {{source of}} {{opposition}} to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which {{before and during the}} Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, {{with the passage of the}} Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association <b>of</b> <b>Lucy</b> Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The Lucy Stone Home Site {{is owned}} and managed by The Trustees of Reservations, a {{non-profit}} land conservation and historic preservation {{organization dedicated to}} preserving natural and historic places in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The site includes 61 acres of forested land {{on the side of}} Coys Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. Although the farmhouse in which Stone was born and married burned to the ground in 1950, its ruins {{are at the center of}} the property. At the time of Stone’s wedding, both her parents and a married brother and his family lived in the two-and-one-half-story house, and family descendants continued to live there until 1936. In 1915, a pilgrimage of suffragists placed a memorial tablet on the house, which read: “This house was the birthplace <b>of</b> <b>Lucy</b> Stone, pioneer advocate of equal rights for women. Born August 13, 1818. Married May 1, 1855, died October 18, 1893. In grateful memory Massachusetts suffragists placed this tablet August 13, 1915.” That tablet, severely damaged but surviving the 1950 fire, is now in the Quaboag Historical Society Museum. After the fire, the surrounding farmland was abandoned and left to revert to forest, and it is now used for hunting and harvesting timber. The Trustees acquired the home site in 2002 and have been maintaining the property ever since.|$|E
5|$|The poems {{were written}} during {{a short period}} while the poet lived in Germany. Although they {{individually}} deal {{with a variety of}} themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing impatience with his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character <b>of</b> <b>Lucy,</b> an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.|$|E

5|$|Valene Ewing first {{appears in}} Dallas in 1978, {{as the mother}} <b>of</b> <b>Lucy</b> Ewing (Charlene Tilton) and the ex-wife of Gary Ewing (David Ackroyd, later played by Ted Shackelford), the middle son and the black sheep of the Ewing family. Valene and Gary Ewing were first married in their {{adolescence}} in 1961, when Gary was 17 years old and Valene was 15. When a pregnant Valene persuades Gary {{to take her to}} the Southfork Ranch in order to introduce her to his family, they settle down at Southfork, and Miss Ellie gave Gary a job as ranch foreman. However, Gary and Valene were soon pressured and manipulated by Gary's older brother, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), who constantly tried to undermine and destroy their marriage. Meanwhile, Gary's father, Jock Ewing, put pressure on Gary to stand up and face his responsibilities for becoming a teenage husband and father-to-be. When Valene gives birth to their daughter Lucy, J.R. makes it clear that the child is an Ewing and will be raised by the Ewings themselves. J.R.'s constant interference causes Gary and Val's marriage to collapse. Under the pressure, Gary fell victim to alcoholism, became violent in the process and walked out on Val and Lucy. With Gary gone, Valene is then driven off Southfork by J.R., but she soon returns to get baby Lucy and flees to Virginia, and later to Tennessee, where she tries to get help from her mother, Lilimae Clements (Julie Harris), to take them in, but they are turned away. At this point, Valene and Lucy had already been tracked down by heavies that were hired by J.R. and the heavies rip Lucy right out of Valene's arms, and take Lucy back to Southfork to be raised by her paternal grandparents. When Valene later tried to take legal action to get Lucy back, J.R. warned Valene that he'd kill her if she came back to the state of Texas. Valene is prevented from seeing her daughter again for many years as a result of this.|$|E
5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss <b>of</b> <b>Lucy</b> is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they {{got to know each}} other. They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E

Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) gains custody <b>of</b> <b>Lucy</b> and Billy leaves town without disclosing his whereabouts to his wife. Victoria later pursues divorce proceedings in Billy's long absence. After their divorce, Victoria and Billy's mother, Jill Fenmore, try unsuccessfully to locate Billy whose daughter has Leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. The pair find each other in a New York airport bar, reunite, and remarry in December 2011. As they return home from their honeymoon, Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan) arrives, announcing she is pregnant with Billy’s child. Chelsea barters with Billy demanding 3 million dollars.

However, Victoria and Stitch's relationship comes to an end soon thereafter when Stitch develops feelings for Victoria's half-sister, Abby (Melissa Ordway). Victoria and Billy end up reuniting again, much to Victor's chagrin.|$|E
