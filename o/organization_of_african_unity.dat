5|$|About 1,500 {{members of}} the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC) invaded Shaba Province (modern-day Katanga Province) in Zaire from eastern Angola on 7 March 1977. The FNLC wanted to {{overthrow}} Mobutu, and the MPLA government, suffering from Mobutu's support for the FNLA and UNITA, {{did not try to}} stop the invasion. The FNLC failed to capture Kolwezi, Zaire's economic heartland, but took Kasaji and Mutshatsha. The Zairean army (the Forces Armées Zaïroises) was defeated without difficulty and the FNLC continued to advance. On 2 April, Mobutu appealed to William Eteki of Cameroon, Chairman of the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Unity,</b> for assistance. Eight days later, the French government responded to Mobutu's plea and airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops into Kinshasa. This force worked in conjunction with the Zairean army, the FNLA and Egyptian pilots flying French-made Zairean Mirage fighter aircraft to beat back the FNLC. The counter-invasion force pushed the last of the militants, along with numerous refugees, into Angola and Zambia in April 1977.|$|E

After he spoke at the University of Ibadan, the Nigerian Muslim Students Association bestowed on him the honorary Yoruba name Omowale ("the son who has come home").

Already, at the Congress of the UDV-RDA in 1962, he invited the legislators of the country to achieve unity within the National Union of workers of Upper Volta (UNST-HV). Since this did not happen, the National Assembly voted on 27 April 1964 to pass a law requiring unions to join the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> Trade Union <b>Unity</b> (OATUU), under penalty of immediate dissolution.

Starting at 9 : 15 a. m., {{there will be a}} public plenary session that will include a panel {{discussion}} followed by the keynote address by International Criminal Court Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. The afternoon program will consist of closed workshop sessions. “Children are a central concern of international criminal justice,” said Diane Marie Amann, conference organizer and the holder of the law school’s Woodruff Chair in International Law, who also serves as a special adviser to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor in relation to children in and affected by armed conflict. “Both the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the International Criminal Court have recently returned convictions for the recruitment and use of children in combat. Furthermore, the Rome Statute has importantly defined other international child-related crimes: killings, sexual violence, and other harms to children, their families and their homes; trafficking; attacks on schools and hospitals; and denial of access to humanitarian aid. ” Experts in attendance will be academics and legal professionals from international organizations such as UNICEF and the Office of the Special Representative to the U. N. Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, in addition to nongovernmental organizations including Human Rights Watch, the International Center for Transitional Justice, the International Committee of the Red Cross, No Peace Without Justice, Save the Children and the Carter Center. The discussions will assist the special adviser to advise the Office of the Prosecutor, in the process of its development of a Policy Paper on Children. Bensouda will deliver the keynote address at 11 : 30 a. m. She was sworn in as chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in June 2012. Previously, she had served as that court’s deputy prosecutor and, before that, as a senior legal adviser and trial attorney at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania. From 1987 to 2000, she served her home country, Gambia, in a variety of positions. As attorney general and minister of justice, she was the chief legal adviser to the president and cabinet of Gambia. Bensouda, who has been included in Time magazine’s 100 most influential people list, also played a role in negotiations on the treaty of the Economic Community <b>of</b> West <b>African</b> States, the West African Parliament and the ECOWAS Tribunal. She served as a delegate to United Nations conferences on crime prevention, to the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Unity’s</b> ministerial meetings on human rights and to the Preparatory Commission for the International Criminal Court.
