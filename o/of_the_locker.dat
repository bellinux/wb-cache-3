25|$|Hart's {{imminent}} move to WCW {{created a}} tense situation, {{as he had}} won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1997 from The Undertaker. Hart's WCW contract was scheduled to begin on December 5, {{one month after the}} WWF's annual Survivor Series event, which was to be held in Montreal. Shawn Michaels, the leader of the emerging stable D-Generation X had been booked into a main event title match with Hart. McMahon, anxious for Hart to give up the title, sought Hart's consent to job to Michaels. Hart didn't want to give up the title to a member of The Kliq (which included Michaels, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Sean Waltman), apparently standing up for the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room. As part of their rivalry storyline, Michaels had repeatedly performed acts insulting the Canadian flag and Canadian fans, which had also upset Hart. Wrestling fans also knew of Hart's long-standing personal difficulty with Michaels—Hart had been angered at Michaels' forfeiture of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in February 1997, which ruined plans for a Hart–Michaels rematch at WrestleMania 13 where Michaels was expected to lose the title to him. Hart also believed that Michaels had faked a knee injury and talked about major surgery just to get out of their planned match. While Michaels denied rumors {{that he did not want}} to lose to Hart, and indeed Hart wound up winning the title shortly after Michaels relinquished it, Hart felt certain that Michaels would not have offered a loss in return if he had been staying with the WWF. The two had been involved in a real fight after Michaels implied that Hart was having an affair with WWF valet Sunny. The recent storyline rivalry had also seen Michaels make insulting remarks about Hart's father Stu Hart, which had left Bret and others in the Hart family upset. McMahon's offering of an estimated $3 million contract to Hart in 1996 had reportedly also upset Michaels.|$|E

2500|$|With Bourque, by now {{established}} as a star, beginning to hit the prime of his career, the Bruins decided that {{the time was right}} to pay a proper tribute to Esposito's accomplishments and announced {{before the start of the}} 1987–88 season that he would become the seventh Bruin to have his number retired by the team. Unbeknownst to those in attendance the night of the ceremony, Bourque had a surprise in store for everyone. When the team took to the ice for the presentation, Bourque skated over to Esposito and removed his #7 jersey. He then handed it to Esposito in a symbolic gesture, effectively [...] "surrendering" [...] the number out of respect for everything Esposito accomplished while playing for the Bruins.

2500|$|Xavier, {{the third}} {{seed in the}} West, {{defeated}} seventh seed West Virginia, 79-75 in overtime thanks to two B.J. Raymond three-pointers in the final 78 seconds. Raymond scored all eight of his points in the bonus round after being held scoreless in regulation, and poor free-throw shooting by the Mountaineers, missing four out of six free throws, sealed the victory. Josh Duncan led the Musketeers in scoring with a career high 26 points, followed by Joe Alexander's 18 points and 10 rebounds. Xavier led {{by as much as}} 18 during the game, but trailed six late in OT, counting on Raymond's threes to give them the victory. [...] Number one seed UCLA would play the Musketeers in the final, after outlasting 12th seeded WKU, 88-78. WKU came to within four late in the game, taking advantage of several sloppy Bruin mistakes. Kevin Love led UCLA with 29 points and 14 rebounds, aided by James Keefe's 18 points and 12 rebounds and Russell Westbrooks' 14 and 11. Trailing 41-20 at the half, WKU came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room determined to win, as evidenced by Hilltopper star Tyrone Brazelton's 31 points, 25 of which came in the second half.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Insane Clown Posse {{received}} {{a telephone call from}} Jim Johnston of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The WWF heard that Bruce and Utsler were fans of wrestling and asked them to perform the entrance theme for the wrestling group Oddities. The WWF also wanted Bruce and Utsler to appear on their SummerSlam pay-per-view (PPV) program in August 1998 and rap live while The Oddities entered the ring. Insane Clown Posse composed the song [...] "The Greatest Show" [...] and agreed to appear on the program. Once the duo arrived at the arena, they realized their wrestling dreams had come true; they had been contacted by wrestling's top company and were now set to appear on their PPV program at the company's most historic venue, Madison Square Garden. Bruce and Utsler met backstage with various wrestlers, including the owner of the WWF, Vince McMahon, and his son, Shane McMahon. Bruce and Utsler paid Mick Foley, a wrestler with the WWF, his royalty payments from the ICP Strangle-Mania DVD, as Foley appeared in almost every match, and a friendship began among the three. Bruce and Utsler were assigned to the locker room with Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker, who were to wrestle during the main event that night. The duo immediately felt the animosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room that had previously driven them away from wrestling. Insane Clown Posse performed and were asked to return for the live broadcast of Monday Night Raw the following night. At the broadcast, Bruce and Utsler requested for more than just a rapping role; they wanted to wrestle. McMahon favored the idea and allowed them to participate.|$|E

2500|$|On January 17 Kentucky {{traveled}} to Tuscaloosa to defeat Alabama 70 to 48. Kentucky used two big runs {{to take a}} 35 to 17 lead by halftime. Alabama trimmed the lead in half with a 13-4 run coming out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room, when the Wildcats missed their first five shots. The rally was short-lived, and then it got worse for the Tide. The Wildcats reclaimed control with 10 straight points {{en route to a}} 16-2 run that featured two 3-pointers by Ulis, one by Booker and a powerful dunk by Cauley-Stein. Freshman Devin Booker scored 13 points and remained solid from the perimeter. On January 20 Kentucky defeated Vanderbilt 65 to 57 at Rupp Arena. The Wildcats didn't lead by double digits until early in the second half, and that 45 to 33 advantage lasted briefly as the Commodores began answering from the perimeter to stay within reach. Five combined 3-pointers by Vanderbilt's Riley LaChance (16 points) and Matthew Fisher-Davis (13) helped Vanderbilt pull within 58 to 54 with 2:36 left. The Commodores never got closer as the Harrisons closed it out for the Wildcats. On January 24 Kentucky {{traveled to}} Columbia to defeat South Carolina 58 to 43. In the season prior, Kentucky lost 72 to 67 on this same floor only weeks before their run to the National Championship game. However, the Wildcats turned up the defense to make sure that didn't happen this time after South Carolina's Sindarius Thornwell hit a 3-pointer for a 24 to 23 South Carolina lead with 4:31 left that sent the fans into a frenzy. Ulis started the comeback for Kentucky with a steal and basket before Booker made two fouls shots and a dunk and the Wildcats were on their way. Booker scored seven points in Kentucky's 14 to 0 run that spanned both halves, closing the surge with a 3-pointer that put the Wildcats ahead 37 to 24 with 18:28 remaining. On January 29 the Wildcats again traveled to Columbia, this time to defeat Missouri 69 to 53. The Tigers looked game for most of the first half. Milking the clock with crisp ball movement, Missouri was able to crack Kentucky's long and lean front line for easy baskets. Missouri's Keanau Post started it with a rim-rattling dunk a few minutes in, and a pair of dunks by Ryan Rosburg had the fans in Mizzou Arena on their feet. Another dunk by Jakeenan Gant late in the half allowed the Tigers to close within 32 to 25. The Wildcats struggled some more early in the second half, throwing up a series of ugly jumpers and missing a couple shots at the rim. Missouri struggled to take advantage, but did close within 38 to 32 on Clark's basket with 14:25 to go. Foul trouble began to set in, though, with Missouri's Namon Wright and Montaque Gill-Caesar each picking up their fourth with more than 15 minutes left in the game. The Wildcats, with more quality depth, were able to capitalize on their absences and put together a 10 to 2 run to gain control. The Harrison twins led the way. Aaron knocked down a jumper, and after Andrew did the same, he proceeded to the foul line on the next four trips down the floor. Wright fouled out with 8:52 to go. Gill-Caesar joined him less than a minute later. And by the time the Wildcats had hit those free throws, their lead had swelled to 56 to 36. On January 30 Kentucky faced off against Alabama for the second time this season at Rupp Arena, defeating the Crimson Tide 70 to 55. Towns scored all 12 of his points in the first half to put Kentucky ahead. Cauley-Stein snapped out of a mini-slump with 12 points and four rebounds, Booker added 11 points with three 3-pointers and Aaron Harrison had 10. Kentucky quickly rolled to a double-digit lead and positioned itself to blow out Alabama before settling for a 37 to 24 advantage at the break. Kentucky controlled the paint 28 to 14 while their bench dominated the Tide 31 to 8. Kentucky also committed just five turnovers while forcing Alabama into 13 mistakes that resulted in 20 points.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} [...] in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> hip-hop was <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> eight-counts, {{a method}} of counting dance steps to stay {{in sync with the}} music. Toni Basil introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s. Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell, <b>the</b> creator <b>of</b> locking and founding member <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lockers</b> dance crew. She is responsible for teaching <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lockers</b> how to dance to counts. In an interview with NPR, Lockers member Adolfo [...] "Shabba-Doo" [...] Quiñones stated [...] "I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our Abe Saperstein in terms of how she was able to organize us into a professional dance troupe. I remember her teaching us how to count music. She was like, okay, we were like, count music? How do you count soul? It was crazy, you know?... all of our cues kind of went something like this, boom, pop, do boom, pada da boom, pada like that. And she was like, how do you guys get in sync like that? I said it's a feeling, you know?" [...] Traditionally hip-hop dance, or any form of street dance, is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting. So <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip-hop dance from the street into the studio. Even with this addition, it would be years before commercial hip-hop developed into its current form.|$|R
