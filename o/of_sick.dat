5|$|After a brief stay {{among the}} Mormon {{community}} of southern Utah, Harrison {{enlisted in the}} Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1917 and was stationed at a French hospital, where he tended {{to the needs of}} the Chinese Labour Corps. Quickly learning the language and customs of this group of some 200,000 men, Harrison successfully treated many bilharzia, catarrh and tuberculosis cases, significantly reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>sick</b> members of the Corps during the winter of 1917â€“18.|$|E

He continued to strengthen the central government by expanding the Navy and Army. In July 1798 Adams signed into law the Act for the Relief <b>of</b> <b>Sick</b> and Disabled Seamen, which authorized {{the establishment of a}} government-operated marine hospital service.|$|E

5|$|Cases <b>of</b> <b>sick</b> {{and dying}} trees of C.australis were first {{reported}} {{in the northern part}} of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} associations with service there, Nolan had deliberately {{transferred to a}} regiment operating in India. He initially travelled to Maidstone, where the 15th maintained a troop to train new recruits, {{under the command of}} Captain George Key. He then caught a troopship to Bombay, the Malabar, which arrived on 9 November. Soon after arrival he fell ill and was granted two years <b>of</b> <b>sick</b> leave, starting from 26 March 1840, and returned to Britain. He returned to active service in June 1841, again to the Maidstone depot, and became a Lieutenant on the 19th. He went on leave again in August to take the riding master's course and exam, and returned on 8 March 1842, newly qualified.|$|E
5|$|Downes, in {{his role}} as DGMS, pressed for the {{construction}} of major military hospitals in the capital cities. He argued that, after the war, they should be handed over to the Repatriation Commission for the care <b>of</b> <b>sick</b> and disabled ex-service personnel. Despite strong opposition on the grounds of cost, Downes won his case in October 1940. Time soon vindicated his judgement; and today the major military hospitals in the state capital cities, the Concord Repatriation General Hospital in Sydney, the Austin Hospital in Melbourne and Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane remain his greatest legacy.|$|E

5|$|Legends {{of female}} vampire-like beings who can detach {{parts of their}} upper body occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo ("blood-sucker") and the Visayan manananggal ("self-segmenter"). The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that {{takes the form of}} an {{attractive}} girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, thread-like tongue by night. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses off pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm <b>of</b> <b>sick</b> people. The manananggal is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim.|$|E
5|$|The film {{references}} Resident Evil, {{with the}} crash site of the helicopter being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the Resident Evil series began. Other similarities include Jill's moves from the first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue {{can be seen in}} the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the Resident Evil series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort <b>of</b> <b>sick</b> game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.|$|E

5|$|Vampires have {{appeared}} in Japanese cinema since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin. The Nukekubi is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night. Legends of female vampire-like beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo ("blood-sucker") and the Visayan Manananggal ("self-segmenter").

5|$|The Conference of Nyon was {{arranged}} in September 1937 for all parties with a Mediterranean coastline by the British, despite appeals by Italy and Germany that the Committee handle the piracy {{and other issues}} the conference was to discuss. It decided that French and British fleets patrol the areas of sea west of Malta, and attack any suspicious submarines. Warships that attacked neutral shipping would be attacked. On 18 September, Juan NegrÃ­n requested that the League of Nations' Political Committee examine Spain. He also demanded an end to non intervention. Eden claimed that non-intervention had stopped European war. The League did report on the Spanish situation, noting the 'failure of non-intervention'. On 6 November, the Committee met once again, with the plan to recognise the Nationalists as belligerents once significant progress had been made was finally accepted, down in part to Eden's patience. The Nationalists accepted on 20 November, the Republicans on 1 December. The former suggested 3,000 would be a reasonable number; this was, in reality the number <b>of</b> <b>sick</b> and unreliable Italians Franco wished to withdraw. This was countered by British suggestions fifteen or twenty thousand might be enough. These talks were subsumed by bilateral Anglo-Italian discussions. In trying to protect non-intervention in the Anglo-Italian meetings, which he grudgingly did, Eden would end up resigning from his post in the Foreign Office. On 17 March 1938, France reopened the border to arms traffic to the now weakened Republic. Between mid-April and mid-June, 21 British seamen were killed by attacks on British shipping in Spanish waters, {{as well as several}} Non-Intervention Committee observers.|$|E
