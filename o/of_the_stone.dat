5|$|Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian {{consul-general}} in Egypt, {{was able}} to inspect a fragment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported {{that it had a}} pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There are reportedly a few white or yellow spots on the face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone,</b> and it is officially described as being white {{with the exception of the}} face.|$|E
25|$|About {{one third}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> in <b>the</b> museum are Class II in nature (stones with symbols carved in relief and usually bearing a Christian cross). Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> date to <b>the</b> 9th or 10th century AD and were {{intended}} as tombstones. <b>The</b> <b>stones</b> are carved {{from the local}} sandstone, which is suitable for fine sculpture. Some stylistic elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> show <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> Northumbria. <b>The</b> Pictish <b>stones</b> at Meigle have a distinct local style that includes an emphasis on aggressive biting beasts, <b>the</b> decorating <b>of</b> crosses with a diagonal key pattern and <b>the</b> usage <b>of</b> rounded heads on cross-slabs.|$|R
50|$|About 80 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> {{feature a}} {{circular}} hole, although only 37 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones,</b> with 47 holes, are still standing. They {{have been of}} interest to Russian and Armenian archaeoastronomers who have suggested that <b>the</b> standing <b>stones</b> {{could have been used}} for astronomical observation. Seventeen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> were associated with observations of sunrise or sunset at the solstices and equinoxes, and 14 with the lunar extremes. However, this must remain conjectural as the holes are relatively unweathered and may not even be prehistoric in origin.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stone</b> circle {{consists}} <b>of</b> thin standing <b>stones</b> {{arranged in}} <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> an ellipse measuring 21.6 by 18.9 metres. Five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> are standing and two have fallen. <b>The</b> <b>stones</b> vary from 2 to 3.3 metres in height. A slab, 1.4 metres, long lies in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western <b>stone,</b> pointing towards <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle. <b>The</b> <b>stone</b> circle surrounds a cairn with {{a diameter of}} 8.5 metres.|$|R

5|$|Anne's daughter, Margaret, married John Tufton, the Earl of Thanet. John's son, Thomas, {{stripped}} the castle around 1695 {{to support the}} reconstruction of Appleby Castle. The furnishings were sold in 1714 and in 1763 much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> from Clifford's Tower was plundered {{for use in the}} construction of Brough Mill; the castle was subsequently completely abandoned. The south-west corner of the keep partially collapsed around 1800.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>the</b> {{northern}} focus <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> <b>of</b> Shap Avenue 'north' {{appears to}} be a burial mound at Skellaw Hill, <b>the</b> southern focus <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> <b>of</b> Shap Avenue 'south' also seems to be a burial mound or mounds.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> are {{constructed}} <b>of</b> plaster {{applied to a}} wire mesh frame However, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>stones</b> are real, large, and probably unmovable without heavy equipment.|$|R

5|$|Clemuel Ricketts, the {{architect}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> house, {{was very interested}} in architecture from the colonial period and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which examined the British and European sources of colonial architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed the house in the colonial or Georgian style in the early 1850s; construction began in either 1851 or 1854 and finished the next year.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{enhancements}} {{are specific}} treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which {{are designed to}} better the gemological characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> {{in one or more}} ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond.|$|E

5|$|About 3,000 runestones {{from the}} Viking Age have been {{discovered}} in Scandinavia of which c. 2,700 were raised within what today is Sweden.

The Viking Age coincided with the Christianisation of Scandinavia, and in many districts c. 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> inscriptions have traces of Christianity. In Uppland, c. 70% of the inscriptions are explicitly Christian, which is shown by engraved crosses or added Christian prayers, while only a few runestones are explicitly pagan.
