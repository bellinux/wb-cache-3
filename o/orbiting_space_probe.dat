The first <b>orbiting</b> <b>space</b> <b>probe,</b> Sputnik 1, was {{launched by the}} Soviet Union in 1957. Over time, a massive system of artificial satellites was placed into orbit around Earth. These satellites greatly advanced navigation, communications, military intelligence, geology, climate, and numerous other fields. Also, {{by the end of}} the 20th century, unmanned probes had visited the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and various asteroids and comets.

50|$|During each <b>orbit,</b> the <b>space</b> <b>probe</b> {{captured}} radar data {{while the}} spacecraft was {{closest to the}} surface, and then transmit it back to Earth as it moved away from Venus. This maneuver required extensive use of the reaction wheels to rotate the spacecraft as it imaged the surface for 37-minutes and as it pointed toward Earth for two hours. The primary mission intended for the spacecraft to return images of at least 70 percent of the surface during one Venusian day, which lasts 243 Earth days as the planet slowly spins. To avoid overly-redundant data at the highest and lowest latitudes, the Magellan probe alternated between a Northern-swath, a region designated as 90 degrees north latitude to 54 degrees south latitude, and a Southern-swath, designated as 76 degrees north latitude to 68 degrees south latitude. However, due to periapsis being 10 degrees north of the equatorial line, imaging the South Pole region was unlikely.|$|R

This article will deal only with the mathematical aspect, hovever one must {{keep in mind that the}} stratification of the <b>orbit</b> <b>spaces</b> represents the possible schemes of symmetry breaking and that the phase transitions appear when the minimum of an invariant potential function shifts from one stratum to another, so the exact knowledge of the <b>orbit</b> <b>spaces</b> and their stratifications might be useful to single out some yet hidden properties of phase transitions...|$|R

40|$|A toric origami {{manifold}} is a {{generalization of}} a symplectic toric manifold (or a toric symplectic manifold). The origami symplectic form {{is allowed to}} degenerate in a good controllable way {{in contrast to the}} usual symplectic form. It is widely known that symplectic toric manifolds are encoded by Delzant polytopes, and the cohomology and equivariant cohomology rings of a symplectic toric manifold can be described in terms of the corresponding polytope. Recently, Holm and Pires described the cohomology of a toric origami manifold $M$ in terms of the <b>orbit</b> <b>space</b> $M/T$ when $M$ is orientable and the <b>orbit</b> <b>space</b> $M/T$ is contractible. But in general the <b>orbit</b> <b>space</b> of a toric origami manifold need not be contractible. In this paper we study the topology of orientable toric origami manifolds for the wider class of examples: we require that every proper face of the <b>orbit</b> <b>space</b> is acyclic, while the <b>orbit</b> <b>space</b> itself may be arbitrary. Furthermore, we give a general description of the equivariant cohomology ring of torus manifolds with locally standard torus actions in the case when proper faces of the <b>orbit</b> <b>space</b> are acyclic and the free part of the action is a trivial torus bundle.
