The call is traced to a sports shop in Occoquan, Virginia where a Carbo-Bar wrapper is left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> Later, Modell is holding {{a picture of a}} young woman in a house where a man is covered in Cerulean Blue paint.|$|E
5|$|A throw-in by Hagi led to Şükür {{attempting}} to reach Erdem, {{who was in}} the penalty area, but was tackled and match play continued, which saw Arsenal attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> under Parlour, whose volley shot went wide. Overmars then had an opportunity, after being given the ball by Henry, but the shot was off target. In the 70th minute, Korkmaz exchanged passes with Erdem, but his effort was successfully blocked by Tony Adams. Three minutes later, Parlour attempted a bending cross for Henry, but Taffarel read it easily. A well-played pass by Nwankwo Kanu ensured the ball reached Henry on the left area, who proceeded to give it to Overmars in the penalty area – however, Overmars's shot fell flat, but still enough for Taffarel to make a save. With four minutes of normal time remaining, the Turks came close to a winning goal, when Şükür collected the ball from the centre and entered Arsenal's area, but lost his footing before he could make an effort on goal, allowing Seaman to pick up the ball for a goal kick. Two minutes of extra time were added on, just when a free-kick was awarded to Galatasaray. Şükür took the shot, but the ball headed wide around the wall. It proved to be the final event in normal time, as the match entered extra time.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the second}} half, no substitutions {{were made by}} either teams as Galatasaray kicked-off the match. During the third minute, Vieira picked Parlour, but his shot hit {{the outside of the}} goal. Galatasaray almost scored the opening goal, when Okan Buruk played in Hakan Şükür, whose shot hit the right post. Arsenal {{attempted}} to strike, with Sylvinho passing Hagi, and finding Henry, who in turn put in a cross for Keown, only for his shot to go over. Later throughout the match, Parlour sent a long ball into the Galatasaray midfield, but no Arsenal player was there to pick up the ball. A free-kick was given to Bergkamp after a foul on Overmars, which was cleared with a Popescu header. Galatasaray attempted an attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> – Capone gave the ball to Hagi, who lost his balance while preparing to take a shot. After receiving a pass, Hagi put in a wide cross for Şükür, but he was denied a shot on target after a clearance. Arsenal had another chance, when Henry snatched the ball from Korkmaz, and entered the penalty area, only to see his shot to go off target.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E
5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E

5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide {{it would be best}} to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler, making a joke for the last time.

When the couple go after Krug and Sadie, they find Justin in possession of Krug's gun; Justin gives the gun to John so that he can kill Krug. Sadie awakens and interrupts John, allowing Krug to escape from the couple: he then realizes that they are Mari's parents. After Emma shoots Sadie in the head, John chases Krug. With a combined effort from Emma, John, and Justin, Krug is knocked unconscious. John paralyzes Krug from the neck down and leaves him to die with his head in an active microwave oven (his head explodes), then he, Emma, Mari, and Justin take the boat to the local hospital.|$|E
25|$|The Socceroos {{defeated}} Japan 3–1 {{during their}} first game in the 2006 World Cup final stages, with Tim Cahill scoring two goals (84', 89') and John Aloisi scoring one (92') all {{in the last eight}} minutes to claim their first World Cup goals and victory ever. An early controversial call by the Egyptian referee that awarded a goal to the Japanese team, despite an apparent foul to Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, had the Australians playing catch up until the last eight minutes. After scoring the first goal, Cahill was lucky to get away with a potential foul when he tripped Japan's Yūichi Komano, who had dribbled into the Australian penalty area. The referee missed the incident, and Cahill then broke to score the second <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> FIFA's spokesman for refereeing Andreas Werz said that while Japan's first goal was irregular, Egyptian referee Essam Abdel Fatah should also have given Japan a penalty.|$|E
25|$|After an {{international}} break which saw Sebastian Giovinco further cement {{his place in}} Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's plans for Euro 2012 the following summer, Parma travelled to Champions League side Napoli, who had beaten giants Internazionale in their previous game by three goals to nil. Napoli had much of {{the ball in the}} early stages, but failed {{to make the most of}} their control of the ball, while Parma looked dangerous <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> This pattern continued into the second half before a Massimo Gobbi goal give Parma an unexpected lead just before an hour had passed. The left-back surged forward through Napoli's pedestrian midfield and laid the ball off to Sergio Floccari, who flicked the ball back into Gobbi's path, allowing Gobbi to slot home from point blank range. Napoli continued to press and eventually found an equaliser in a similar fashion to Parma's opener, Ezequiel Lavezzi supplying the backheel flick and playing the one-two with substitute Giuseppe Mascara. The sides were level for five minutes before Parma once again proved to have the more clinical instinct in front of goal. Francesco Valiani worked the ball out wide to Giovinco, who found Francesco Modesto sliding in at the back post to give Parma a 2–1 in the 82nd minute to momentarily put Parma seventh.|$|E

[...] Goetz was not particularly kind to Ernst either: [...] Ernst was not Gebhard's superior; the victory that placed him in the Electorate belonged to his brothers' influence and to that of the Curia (papacy), not to his own striving ambition; Ernst was, fundamentally, riding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Reformation tide that lifted all boats. [...] Philip Motley described Gebhard thus: despite his swearing an oath to renounce his See if he should marry, [...] "the love of Truchsess for Agnes Mansfeld had created disaster, not only for himself but for all of Germany." [...] Like Goetz, he describes both Gebhard and Ernst as cut from the same cloth: [...] "two pauper Archbishops without men or means of their own were pushed back and forth, like puppets, by the highwaymen" [...] on either side, while murder and robbery, in the name of Catholicism and Protestantism, were the [...] "for a time the only motive or result of the contest." ...|$|E
