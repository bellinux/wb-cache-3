5|$|A. pinnatum and the <b>other</b> <b>three</b> tree waratah species {{lie in the}} {{subtribe}} Embothriinae, {{along with}} the true waratahs (Telopea), Oreocallis and the Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red flowers that are terminal (arising {{at the ends of}} branches), and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predates the splitting of the supercontinent Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest that they are bird-pollinated, and have been so since the radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters in the Eocene. Triporopollenites ambiguus is an ancient member of the proteaceae known only from pollen deposits, originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of the Tasmanian waratah (Telopea truncata), A. pinnatum and Oreocallis grandiflora. Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed A.pinnatum to be the earliest offshoot within the genus and sister to the <b>other</b> <b>three</b> species. Along with members of other genera in the Embothriinae, A.pinnatum has crimson pollen, while the <b>other</b> <b>three</b> Alloxylon species have yellow pollen. Hence {{it is likely that the}} ancestral pollen colour was red, and remained so with the emergence of the genus Alloxylon, yet changed to yellow after the divergence of A.pinnatum.|$|E
