It further examines how the Patani 2. 0 social interaction enabled by social media such as YouTube leads to group cohesion among certain actors and the formation of a collective identity that is clustered around the notions of Muslim victimization and defensive jihad; and how, at the same time, it reinforces antithetical identities and fosters group identity competition, where one religious group is often pitted against another. As a result, the Janus effect of Patani neojihadist YouTube online propaganda, while it primarily seeks to radicalize, also generates a reactionary, often virulent, anti-Muslim response from the movement 2 ̆ 7 s critics...|$|R

50|$|Norton {{recognizes that}} {{identity}} is shaped {{not only by}} material conditions and lived experiences, but also by learners’ imagined futures and imagined identities. She asserts that learners invest in particular language and literacy practices because of their desire to be affiliated with a given target language community. While Benedict Anderson focused on the theorization {{of the nation as}} an <b>imagined</b> <b>community,</b> Norton considers that a wide range of <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> can be desirable, from membership in a local book club or successful professional network to an <b>online</b> transnational <b>community.</b> By <b>imagining</b> themselves allied with others across time and space, language learners are encouraged to seek opportunities for social interaction through diverse language and literacy practices. Norton argues that such <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> can be even more powerful than face-to-face communities in shaping the investment of learners. She argues further that a lack of awareness of learners’ <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> and <b>imagined</b> identities could hinder a teacher’s ability to construct productive language learning activities. The constructs of <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> and <b>imagined</b> identities have been further developed, and have proved productive in a range of research contexts.|$|R

40|$|From Herder to Benedict Anderson, {{language}} and nation {{have been at}} the centre of ideas about (<b>imagined)</b> <b>community.</b> This hypothesis, however, poses a problem for analysing ideas about Europe. How can we understand ‘Europe’ as a concept or form of identity when {{language and}} nationality are considered the foundation of <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> and loyalties? This article addresses this difficulty. It uses J. G. A. Pocock’s definition of ‘sub-languages’ to suggest that one can investigate the rhetorical strategies, images and vocabularies with which texts articulate ideas about Europe. These sub-languages evoke <b>imagined</b> <b>communities,</b> most obviously when texts name and identify particular groups of people as ‘Europeans’. But by using images and rhetorics about Europe, these texts also appeal to a readership who comprehends – even if it does not fully accept – certain assumptions about the continent. In this way, texts evoke an <b>imagined</b> <b>community</b> of readers who purportedly share a similar way of understanding Europe, or who can perhaps be persuaded to think about it in similar terms. These processes are historically particular, and so the article concludes with concrete examples. It focuses on how early nineteenth-century philhellenes evoke a European <b>imagined</b> <b>community</b> to solicit support for the Greek Revolution...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown the {{importance}} of identity in language learning and how the desire to belong to an <b>imagined</b> <b>community</b> drives individuals to invest in their learning (Norton, 2000). This work has documented that a mismatch between students' <b>imagined</b> <b>community</b> and the community envisioned by the teacher can have negative outcomes on students' learning trajectories. Other research has explored how institutional policies and their linked educational practices reflect differences in the <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> each institution sees their students potentially joining in the future (Kanno, 2003) and how reading materials and the discourses reflected in them can affect learners' visions of themselves(Pavlenko, 2003). However few studies have tried to document how an `imagined community' might be collectively constructed for others through a complex interaction {{of social and cultural}} structures, circulating discourses, institutional discourses, educational practices, group dynamics and personal histories that produce visions of potential identities (I) and their respective <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> (IC's) in which newcomers get socialized. There is a gap in current research on how `imagined communities' and `identities' for second language learners get constructed, circulated and made available to learners within institutional contexts. Through this qualitative study involving questionnaires and autobiographical research I studied the construction of <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> in an English language major in Mexico.

It concludes that the production of local identities and dynamics in global, local and regional level represents a challenge for the political projection of <b>imagined</b> <b>communities.</b> Nevertheless, that production is not absolutely questioned. Denationalisation dynamics are produced in sovereignty and delimitation becomes more porous but it carries on the cultural production of community limits by education, army and communications. In addition, some global alternatives to national communities arise, but the nationalist grammar remains intact as a base of community categories and identifications...|$|R

40|$|Online {{newspapers}} (and other spaces) {{are increasingly}} seeking to utilise user-generated content alongside professionally developed material. However, this might leave websites increasingly vulnerable to trolls, who work to disrupt online communications in online spaces.

One means of controlling is through the manipulation of the online space to create social norms of polite behaviour through the founding of ‘imagined communities’ online. Approaching the issue from a discursive psychological perspective, this paper draws upon comments published in two online British newspaper comment sections responding to the publication of an academic article on trolling. <b>Imagined</b> <b>communities</b> are shown to arise irrespective of the presence of the virtual infrastructure to support the development of these <b>imagined</b> <b>communities.</b> Key features of <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> identified here are: individuation (as opposed to deindividuation); mutual influence between posters; shared history for both the users and the online space; the use of humour to cement social bonds.

40|$|In his {{exploration}} of nationalism and <b>imagined</b> <b>communities,</b> Anderson (1991) claims that nations are “imagined” (that is, they are constructions), insomuch {{that people are}} convinced of the comradeship of unknown fellow compatriots, often ignoring any actual inequality and exploitation that exists in such an <b>imagined</b> <b>community.</b> In a similar fashion, we argue that the subdiscipline or community of organizational communication scholars is also imagined, as much organizational communication scholarship conducted within the global context is performed and interpreted from the dominant Euro-American intellectual tradition, privileging those concepts as well as particular voices and traditions and often ignoring inequality and exploitation within the scholarly community. This forgetting and the <b>imagined</b> scholarly <b>community</b> it creates continue to reify and legitimate a particular form of rationality and, in practice, lead to further colonization, subordination, and oppression of native/indigenous/other forms of understanding and organizing within our disciplinary field.

40|$|Since its {{publication}} {{more than a}} decade ago, Benedict Anderson's <b>Imagined</b> <b>Communities</b> has offered an enticing, if romantic, way of conceptualising nationalism.

This specific case study of political activism through sport provides a compelling example of the ways in which a dominant symbol of French national identity is usurped and upstaged by a minority group so as to reinvent or re-imagine a new kind of community...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} also to identify the role of learning English for migrant workers in relation to <b>imagined</b> <b>community</b> and self. The study showed how these migrant ESOL learners conceptualize self in relation to two aspects: learning English and investment, gaining social and cultural capitals and access to <b>imagine</b> <b>community,</b> and being transmigrants.

40|$|This {{version of}} the Thesis has been redacted: for more {{information}} please contact the author. A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Despite the upsurge in fact-based and verbatim theatre in recent years (Fogarth and Megson 2009 : 1), engagement with the form as a technique equally suitable for poetry has been especially limited. This thesis examines the deployment of verbatim methods {{in a series of}} poems which constitute the creative element, written in order to (re) present expressions of identity and ideas of <b>imagined</b> <b>community</b> during the 2011 riots in Birmingham. Located {{in the context of this}} particular disorder, United We Stand explores both individual and group experiences of the events that took place in Birmingham. The series of verbatim poems draws on data extracted from 25 semi-structured, life-story interviews with participants who lived or worked in the city during these incidents. In doing so, both the thesis and the creative practice that informs it critique Benedict Anderson s earlier model of the nation as an <b>imagined</b> <b>community</b> (1983; 1991; 2006). While quantitative network analysis is deployed to establish the ties between media channels and ordinary citizens that were maintained online through social networking, creative and reported responses published by these same media sources are analysed in relation to national narrative conventions (Billig 2001; Mihelj 2011). This demonstrates that new and popular media played a significant role in (re) presenting <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> in this setting. By providing evidence for the existence of these shifting <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> across various geographical, social and cultural scales, the thesis suggests that Anderson s decision to focus on the nation is problematic. It argues that his framework is partial and that a new definition of <b>imagined</b> <b>community</b> as both fluid and emergent is necessary. Literary context for the thesis is found in the origins and developments of verbatim; exploring early documentary theatre practice and contemporary verbatim productions by Richard Norton-Taylor, Alecky Blythe, and Gillian Slovo. Through an analysis of Bhanu Kapil Rider s The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers (2001), the thesis illustrates how existing poets have organised comparable methods in their own work. This culminates in a demonstration of practice as research by producing a ground-breaking body of work: United We Stand is a series of poems crafted through the deployment of verbatim methods. The thesis demonstrates that deploying verbatim methods in poetry is suitable for (re) presenting expressions of identity and ideas of <b>imagined</b> <b>community</b> in this context. By transforming the voices of ordinary people of Birmingham, United We Stand reflects the media narratives that precede it: the poems are a direct engagement with the same fluid and emergent <b>imagined</b> <b>communities</b> that they argue existed. More importantly, though, this thesis goes beyond contemporary techniques of verbatim and establishes the evolutionary nature of it as a poetic practice. The combination of verbatim methods and visual-digital tools that I deploy throughout United We Stand results in a new creative process which I have termed Digital Poetic Mimesis...|$|R
