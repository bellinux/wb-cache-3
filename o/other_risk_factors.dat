5|$|A {{predisposition}} for bladder infections may run in families. <b>Other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> include diabetes, being uncircumcised, {{and having}} a large prostate. In children UTIs are associated with vesicoureteral reflux (an abnormal movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys) and constipation.|$|E
5|$|There is {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} VAD {{is more common in}} men or in women; an aggregate of all studies shows that it is slightly higher incidence in men (56% versus 44%). Men are on average 37–44 years old at diagnosis, and women 34–44. While dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries accounts for only 2% of strokes (which are usually caused by high blood pressure and <b>other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> and tend to occur in the elderly), they cause 10–25% of strokes in young and middle-aged people.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or <b>other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. <b>Other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. About 70% {{of the risk}} is {{believed}} to be genetic with many genes usually involved. <b>Other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> include a history of head injuries, depression, or hypertension. The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based {{on the history of the}} illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis. Mental and physical exercise, and avoiding obesity may decrease the risk of AD; however, evidence to support these recommendations is not strong. There are no medications or supplements that decrease risk.|$|E
5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of <b>other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines {{recommend that the}} decision to treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E

5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There {{is likely to be a}} predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or <b>other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect {{the risk of}} developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. Native Americans however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. <b>Other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among Native Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.|$|E
5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have <b>other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for heart disease.|$|E

40|$|Cigarette smoking {{has been}} {{reported}} to worsen high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and <b>other</b> cardiac <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> yet no studies have examined this issue among rural African Americans. This study examines the association between cigarette smoking and cardiac <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> among rural African Americans. A population-based sample of 403 African-American adults from two rural Virginia counties underwent total cholesterol (TC), HDL, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), body mass index (BMI), serum glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin (GlyHb) measurements. Cross-sectional multivariate analyses were used to compare <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> across categories of cigarette use. Age, BMI, alcohol consumption, and the use of antihypertensive medications were covariates in the analysis. Results indicated that female light smokers had significantly lower SBP and DBP, and lower HDL. Female heavy smokers had significantly lower HDL and BMI and significantly higher TC/HDL ratios. Male heavy smokers had significantly higher SBP. More than 33 % of males and more than 50 % of females were overweight, and increasing BMI was associated with significantly or nearly significantly worsening of all <b>other</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> levels. Both cigarette smoking and obesity adversely affect <b>other</b> cardiac <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Novel approaches are needed to decrease both smoking and obesity in this difficult to reach population...|$|R
