25|$|The Captain John Smith Monument {{currently}} lies in disrepair off {{the coast}} of New Hampshire on Star Island, part of the Isles of Shoals. The <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> was built in 1864 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of John Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles. It was a tall pillar set on a triangular base atop a series of steps surrounded by granite supports and a sturdy iron railing. At the top of the original obelisk were three carved faces, representing the severed heads of three Turks that Smith lopped off while in combat during his stint as a soldier in Transylvania.|$|E

During the renovation, the <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> to the 72 people killed in the fire was replaced by an exact replica. The documentary Saving Grace-Resurrecting American History, written and directed by Emmy Award-winning writer and director Eric Futterman, follows the process of using laser scanning to recreate the monument in computers, then sending the data to Ireland, where stonecutters used both high technology computer equipment and old-fashioned stone-cutting tools to create a new 7,000 pound monument.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} architectural achievements of the Qutb Shahi dynasty is the fortified city of Golkonda. The Jami Masjid (1518) erected by Quli-Qutb-ul-Mulk, the tomb of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1611), the tomb of Muhammad Qutb Shah (1626) and the mosque of Hayat Bakshi Begam (1666) are the notable monuments in Golkonda. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah decided to shift the capital to Hyderabad, 8km east of Golkonda. Here, he constructed the most <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> in the Deccan, the Char Minar {{in the heart of}} the new city. This monument (completed in 1591) has four minarets of 56 m. height. The construction of the Mecca Masjid, located at the immediate south of Char Minar was started in 1617 during the reign of Muhammad Qutb Shah but completed only in 1693. The other important monuments of this period are the Toli Masjid (1671) and the Jami Masjid at Gandikota.|$|E

500|$|All of the {{surviving}} megalithic tombs from the Early Neolithic period have suffered from neglect and the ravages of agriculture. Although Ashbee noted that the Coldrum Stones represent [...] "Kent's least damaged megalithic long barrow", it too has suffered considerable damage, having become dilapidated and fallen apart over the six millennia since its original construction. Most prominently, the eastern side has largely collapsed, with the stones that once helped {{to hold up the}} side of the barrow having fallen to the bottom of the slope. Conversely, it is possible that the sarsens at the bottom of the slope were not part of the <b>original</b> <b>monument,</b> but were stones found in nearby fields which were deposited there by farmers.|$|E
500|$|The camp site {{remained}} unexplored {{after the}} war due to {{the depth of the}} gorges where bodies were disposed and {{the fact that some of}} them had been filled with concrete by Yugoslavia's Communist authorities.

Commemoration ceremonies honouring the victims of the camp have been organized by the Serb National Council (SNV), the Jewish community in Croatia, and local anti-fascists since 2009, and 24 June has since been designated as a [...] "Day of Remembrance of the Jadovno Camp" [...] in Croatia.

500|$|A small cairn at {{the foot}} of the Niagara Escarpment marks the spot where Brock fell. In 1824, Brock's and Macdonell's remains were moved into Brock's Monument, which {{overlooked}} the Queenston Heights. That <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> was bombed and heavily damaged in 1840. (This action was reputedly by Irish-Canadian terrorist Benjamin Lett [...] although a subsequent Assize failed to confirm this.). It was replaced by a larger structure [...] high, built at public expense, that still stands. Brock's remains were reinterred inside the new Monument on 13 October 1853. An inscription reads: [...] "Upper Canada has dedicated this monument to the memory of the late Major-General Isaac Brock, K.B. provisional lieutenant-governor and commander of the forces in the province whose remains are deposited in the vault beneath. Opposing the invading enemy he fell in action near these heights on 13 October 1812, in the forty-third year of his age. Revered and lamented by the people whom he governed and deplored by the sovereign to whose services his life had been devoted." ...|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{continuing}} shortage {{of money in the}} district of Rügen, which was the owner of the monuments, little work was carried out in the following years, {{with the exception of the}} completion of a capital. One of the factors in this situation was, for example, the fact that in allocating funds, the making of replicas had a lower priority over the restoration of <b>original</b> <b>monuments.</b>|$|R

50|$|By 1954, {{the greater}} part of the cemetery’s gravestones and {{memorials}} had been removed, although some of the inscription plaques had been saved and placed within the north and south walls. Over the next 23 years, the cemetery was gradually cleared. By late 1977, only three <b>original</b> <b>monuments</b> still stood in their original locations. In the clearing of the graves, the authorities did, however, save a number of plaques which were then bricked into the west wall of the cemetery.|$|R
500|$|In 1961 President John F. Kennedy—encouraged by Stewart Udall, an Arizonan who {{was then}} Secretary of the Interior—added [...] of cactus lands in the Tucson Mountains to the monument. This western {{district}} of the monument was carved from Tucson Mountain Park, managed by Pima County. In the 1920s, the Tucson Game Protective Association had persuaded the Department of the Interior to withdraw about [...] in the Tucson Mountains from homesteading and mining and to set it aside as a park and game refuge. Land leased by the county in this set-aside became the Tucson Mountain Recreation Area in 1932. Between 1933 and 1941 CCC workers built structures at eight picnic areas in the county-park portion of the set-aside, five of which later {{became part of the}} TMD of the national monument. Their other projects involved road- and trail-building, landscaping, erosion control, and enhancing water supplies for wildlife. Kennedy's 1961 proclamation created the TMD from {{the northern part of the}} county park and renamed the <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> lands east of Tucson the RMD. Expansions in 1976 and 1994 brought the total TMD acreage to [...] In 1994 Congress elevated the combined TMD and RMD to National Park status.|$|E
2500|$|The Gibraltar Memorial {{was erected}} by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It commemorates 91 {{soldiers}} who {{died during the}} Second World War and were buried at sea. In addition to {{the names of those}} military men, the names of seven of the fallen of the First World War have been added. Those seven soldiers died when the SS Woodfield was attacked by a submarine on 3 November 1915 and sunk [...] off Ceuta. The <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> to the men in North Front Cemetery was demolished.|$|E
2500|$|On the copy, the reliefs of {{the four}} Danish {{officers}} were replaced with a single image of the German officer Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia, in effect reversing {{the meaning of the}} <b>original</b> <b>monument.</b> In 1938, the Danish press reported the existence of the copy of the historic monument, and at roughly the same time, the zinc copy was moved to Heckeshorn near the Wannsee, where it remains today. This location is close to the building housing what would later be known as the Wannsee Conference. The statue in Berlin was repaired in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the <b>original</b> <b>monuments</b> {{had fallen}} into {{disrepair}} {{and many of the}} hundreds of elm trees planted had died. Hennepin County and the State of Minnesota funded a $6.7 million project to repair the Parkway. Victory Memorial was rededicated in June, 2011.

2500|$|Later {{inscriptions}} {{are known}} as [...] "scholastic", and are post 6th century in date. The term 'scholastic' derives {{from the fact that}} the inscriptions are believed to have been inspired by the manuscript sources, instead of being continuations of the <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> tradition. Unlike orthodox ogham, some mediæval inscriptions feature all five Forfeda. Scholastic inscriptions are written on stemlines cut into the face of the stone, instead of along its edge. Ogham was also occasionally used for notes in manuscripts down to the 16th century. A modern ogham inscription is found on a gravestone dating to 1802 in Ahenny, County Tipperary.|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 1808, {{there was}} a {{ceremony}} to lay the cornerstone of a planned vault. A grand ceremony of re-interment followed on May 26, 1808. A small square building stood above the 1808 vault with an eagle mounted {{at the point of}} the roof. [...] It was located on a triangular plot of land near the Brooklyn Navy Yard waterfront (Wallabout Bay) in what is now called Vinegar Hill. A wooden fence with thirteen posts and bars painted with the names of the original thirteen states was erected in front. At the entrance through the fence, an inscription said: [...] "Portal to the tomb of 11,500 patriot prisoners, who died in dungeons and prison-ships, in and about the City of New York, during the Revolution." [...] The remains were put in long coffins made of bluestone. Extra space was provided in case more bones were discovered during continuing renovations in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Little was done to repair or upkeep the vault and eventually, the <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> {{was in a state of}} disrepair and neglect. In 1839, Benjamin Romaine purchased the land where the Martyrs were buried, in a tax sale from Henry Reed Stiles for $291.08. Later that year on July 4, 1839, Benjamin Romaine made an appeal for support (governmental or civic) to build a monument. In this appeal, Romaine talked about the monument and his intention to use his Revolutionary War pension for the monument. On January 31, 1844, Benjamin Romaine died and was also interred in the crypt as he had been a prisoner of war on the ships.|$|E
2500|$|By 1893, the <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> {{had been}} radically changed. The plain {{sarcophagus}} walls were replaced with more ornate ones, although the inscription had been retained. The lid {{was replaced by}} one modeled after the Ark of the Covenant described in the Book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible. [...] The Rodman guns were placed muzzle-down into the earth, and the large pyramid of shot removed from the lid. [...] Four small pyramids of shot were placed {{on either side of}} the east and west pathways leading to the memorial. The memorial was also raised off the earth onto a slightly larger base of rough-hewn dark grey granite blocks mortared together. This base is three stones high, or about [...] A second base of large light grey granite slabs about [...] high was placed on top of the first base. A third base, consisting of a single light grey granite slab, was installed above the second base. This third base was slightly smaller than the first two, but slightly larger than the memorial itself. Four light grey granite sections about [...] high sat atop the original sides, decorated with pilasters. Like the walls of the sarcophagus, these consisted of two long, unbroken sections with smaller sections inserted between them at the ends. These sections were mortised, so that all four sections appear to meet at the corners. A slightly larger light grey granite base flared out above the pilaster section. Unlike the lower section, longer sections were sandwiched between the end sections. (This enables friction to help tie the monument together.) The new cover of the sarcophagus consisted of a single large light grey granite slab. Twenty-two bas-relief stars inside circles were added above the lip of the lid. Four stylized, partial fleur-de-lis faced outward at each corner. The top of the lid was rounded. The entire monument was about [...] high at the uppermost portion of the lid.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Greenwood {183b} quotes Halliwell-Phillipps's Works of Shakespeare (1853), {{in which}} {{he says that the}} design in Dugdale's book [...] "is evidently too {{inaccurate}} to be of any authority; the probability being that it was not taken from the monument itself." [...] Indeed the designer is so inaccurate that he gives the first word of the Latin inscription as [...] "Judicyo," [...] just as Oudry blunders in the Latin inscription of a portrait of Mary Stuart which he copied badly. Mr. Greenwood proceeds: [...] "In his Outlines Halliwell simply ignores Dugdale. His engraving was doubtless too inconvenient to be brought to public notice!" [...] Here Halliwell is accused of suppressing the truth; if he invented his minute details about the repeated reparation of the writing hand,--not represented in Dugdale's design,--he also lied with circumstance. But he certainly quoted a genuine [...] "contemporary account" [...] of the orders for repairing and beautifying the <b>original</b> <b>monument</b> in 1748, and I presume that he also had records for what he says about reparations of the hand and pen. He speaks, too, of substitutions for decayed alabaster parts of the monument, though not in his Outlines; and I observe that, in Mrs. Stopes's papers, there is record of a meeting on December 20, 1748, at which mention was made of [...] "the materials" [...] which Hall was to use for repairs.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Stopes herself {{discovered}} the documents which disprove her theory. They {{were known to}} Halliwell-Phillipps, who quotes an unnamed [...] "contemporary account." [...] {181a} This account Mrs. Stopes, with her tireless industry, found in the Wheler manuscripts, among papers of the Rev. Joseph Greene, in 1746 Head Master of the Grammar School. In one paper of September 1740 [...] "the original monument" [...] {{is said to be}} [...] "much impaired and decayed." [...] There was a scheme for making [...] "a new monument" [...] in Westminster Abbey. THAT, I venture to think, would have been in Hanoverian, not in Jacobean taste and style. But there was no money for a new monument. Mrs. Stopes also found a paper of November 20, 1748, showing that in September 1746, Mr. Ward (grandfather of Mrs. Siddons) was at Stratford with [...] "a cry of players." [...] He devoted the proceeds of a performance of Othello to the reparation of the then existing monument. The amount was twelve pounds ten shillings. The affair dragged on, one of the Church- wardens, a blacksmith, held the 12 pounds, 10s., and was troublesome. The document of November 20, 1748, was drawn up to be signed, but was not signed, by the persons who appear to be chiefly concerned in the matter. It directed that Mr. Hall, a local limner or painter, is to [...] "take care, according to his ability, that the monument shall become as like as possible to what it was when first erected." [...] This appears to have been the idea of Mr. Greene. Another form of words was later adopted, directing Mr. Hall, the painter, [...] "to repair and beautify, or to have the direction of repairing and beautifying, THE <b>ORIGINAL</b> <b>MONUMENT</b> of Shakespeare the poet." [...] Mrs. Stopes infers, justly in my opinion, that Hall [...] "would fill up the gaps, restore what was amissing as he thought it ought to be, and finally repaint it according to the original colours, traces of which he might still be able to see." [...] In his History and Antiquities of Stratford-on-Avon, {182a} Mr. Wheler tells us that this was what Hall did. [...] "In the year 1748 the monument was carefully repaired, and the original colours of the bust, &c., as much as possible preserved by Mr. John Hall, limner, of Stratford." ...|$|E
