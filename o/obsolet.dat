The problem to define a Lorentz invariant stochastic dynamics for the wave-function is solved by assuming that the stochastic time flow is running orthogonal to the deterministic, unitary time evolution inside the four-dimensional space-time, which makes the direction of causality independent from the chosen reference frame. This new view allows to accept Bell's position on the implication of quantum non-locality on relativity, without having {{to give up the}} Lorentz invariance of the specified dynamics.

In the present paper we capture the higher order asymptotics, at least away from some resonance regions. In particular we prove that the decay rate is $O(t^{- 1 / 2 }) $. Our proof relies on the asymptotic analysis of the associated Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem, which is here set on a hyperelliptic curve. As in previous studies of the free Toda lattice, the higher order asymptotics arise from "local" Riemann-Hilbert factorization problems on small crosses centered on the stationary phase points. We discover that the analysis of such a local problem {{can be done in}} a chart around each stationary phase point and reduces to a Riemann [...] Hilbert factorization problem on the complex plane.

The new non-invasive diagnostic methods of transvaginal sonography and serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) monitoring now challenge this pivotal role of laparoscopy. In this prospective study the diagnostic value of an algorithm, combining transvaginal sonography with an HCG cut-off level between 1000 and 1500 IU/l (IRP) was tested in 208 consecutive women at risk for ectopic pregnancy. Three diagnostic categories are designated by the algorithm: intra-uterine pregnancy (n = 73), ectopic pregnancy (n = 89), and trophoblast in regression (n = 46). The latter category represents patients in whom no pregnancy could be located by transvaginal sonography, with an initial HCG concentration < 1500 IU/l, declining during follow-up. The algorithm has a sensitivity of 0. 97, a specificity of 0. 95, a likelihood ratio for a positive test of 19. 4, and a likelihood ratio for a negative test of 0. 03.

Mosaicism for IDH 2 mutations has not previously been reported as a cause of D- 2 HGA. Here we describe three cases: one MC-HGA case with IDH 1 mosaic mutations, and two D- 2 HGA type II cases.

Upon this foundation, the study seeks to examine and discuss {{the impact of the}} decline of Ghana’s textile industry on textiles education in Ghana. The population for the study consisted of students, lecturers and heads of departments of selected textiles education institutions in Ghana as well as operatives in Ghana’s textile factories. The methodology employed was the qualitative approach and the descriptive survey. Observation and interviews were the research instruments used to gather data. Some findings were that, of excessive influx of textile products from foreign countries, exorbitant utility cost affecting production, intellectual dishonesty on the part of foreign textile producers and obsolete technology by local textile manufacturers. This has also contributed adversely to the reduction of the intake of textile students in textile education institutions. The study recommends among others that the government of Ghana invests massively in the local textile industry by giving bailouts for the acquisition of new machinery, human resource and manpower development.

The {{effects of the}} small external perturbation torques upon the rotational motions of the forced symmetric gyrostat are investigated using the equation of the Melnikov integral. The real zeros of the Melnikov integral determine the transversality of the homoclinic orbits leading to {{a necessary condition for}} the existence of chaos. The equations of the 3 D oscillators are then reduced to the Euler equations of the perturbed rotational motions of symmetric gyrostats. Algorithms are established to compute the required parameters for the gyrostat to represent the 3 D oscillators at initiating the transversality. These parameters include the angular momenta of the wheels and the principal moments of inertia. The existence of real zeros of the Melnikov integral for the symmetric gyrostat implies the existence of transversal intersections of the perturbed solutions of the 3 D oscillators.

40|$|We {{present a}} useful {{function}} for describing the profiles of dark-matter haloes with a varying asymptotic inner slope -α, {{ranging from a}} cusp to a core, where the profiles of density, mass-velocity and potential are simple analytic expressions for any α. The idea is to express the mean-density profile as a simple functional form, and obtain the local density by derivative. The model involves a concentration parameter c analogous to the NFW profile. More flexibility is provided by a sum of two such functions, with concentrations c_ 1 and c_ 2. An optional additional parameter is the asymptotic outer slope -γ, which allows more flexibility in the outskirts of haloes. For γ different than 3, there are analytic expressions for the profiles of density and mass-velocity {{but not for the}} potential. We match the proposed function, in different variants, to the dark-matter profiles of haloes in cosmological simulations, with and without baryons, spanning inner profiles that range from steep cusps to flat cores, and find excellent fits. The analytic potential profile is useful in modeling the evolution of the inner halo due to episodes of gas inflow and outflow. The analytic profile, especially with a free γ, is useful for a study of environmental effects in the outer halo. In general, these analytic profiles can serve for straightforwardly quantifying the shapes of simulated and observed rotation curves, without the need for numerical integrations.

Tot i així, davant d'un escenari en què hi ha diferents amples de banda, diferents resolucions de pantalla i característiques del terminal, l'streaming com el coneixíem fins ara (una sola qualitat independentment de les característiques del terminal, i una taxa constant o variable, però que no s’adapta a les condicions del canal) ha quedat <b>obsolet.</b> Fa un parell d'anys que s'està utilitzant el concepte de streaming adaptatiu, un concepte que implica ajustar el flux audiovisual a les necessitats de cada terminal i a les característiques del canal.

Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) és un nou estàndard de la família MPEG que neix amb la intenció d'estandarditzar i unificar aquestes solucions. Aquest treball ha consistit en entendre i descriure l’estàndard DASH, fer proves amb el software disponible, i treure’n conclusions. Entre les eines disponibles hi ha segmentadors, reproductors i validadors, que hem configurat per comprovar el funcionament de DASH amb diversos escenaris de proves. Per emular el comportament hostil de la xarxa s’ha utilitzat l’emulador Dummynet. S'ha aconseguit crear streams DASH personalitzats amb els diversos segmentadors, reproduir correctament l'stream amb els reproductors DASH, i hem verificat que només alguns d'aquests són realment capaços d'adaptar-se a les condicions de la xarxa. S'ha observat també les mancances de l’estàndard, com ara el contingut live o la reproducció d'uns casos especials de perfils.

Therefore, the current scenario for streaming services over IP includes many screen resolutions and different terminal characteristics. This is an environment that current streaming protocols (capable of handling only one resolution, independently of the characteristics of the terminal, and a single rate, either variable or constant, but unable to adapt to the changes in the transmission channel) cannot cope with. Two years ago the concept of adaptive streaming was launched commercially. This concept includes the adaptation of the stream to both the terminal capabilities and the channel characteristics. Apple, Microsoft and Adobe have developed proprietary implementations of the concept, thus fragmenting the market. Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP is the new MPEG standard that tries to standardize and unify these solutions. This thesis has focused on understanding the DASH standard, set up testbed scenarios for testing the new DASH-compliant software, and extract conclusions regarding its functionality and performance, using currently available tools such as segmenters, players and validators.

Den so erschlossenen Archiven aus Ägypten – das des Jedanja (traditionell der Mibtahja, TAD B 2. 2 - 4 + 6 - 11), des Anani und seiner Frau Jehoišma (TAD B 3. 2 - 13) und des Nahthor (TAD A 6. 3 - 16) – werden neben den Texten vom Wadi Daliye auch die Schriftrollen an die Seite gestellt, die Abschriften ursprünglich eigenständiger Dokumente enthalten und somit auch ein Art Archiv darstellen. Eine kritische Durchsicht der Dokumente ergibt ein erstaunlich eindeutiges Bild: In den Archiven werden nur Dokumente aufbewahrt, die für den Besitzer des Archivs von unmittelbarer Bedeutung sind. So enthalten die Archive der Privatpersonen grundsätzlich nur Dokumente, die für ihre Rechts- und Besitzansprüche bedeutsam sind, das Briefarchiv des Beamten Nahthor nur Briefe, die im Hinblick auf seinen Amt und seine Dienstgeschäfte Bedeutung haben. Auch die Texte vom Wadi Daliye, die möglicherweise einem institutionellem Archiv zuzuschreiben sind, betreffen im Wesentlichen nur den Problembereich des Besitzstandes an Unfreien und zuweilen an Immobilien. Das Ergebnis, dass die Archivtexte für den aktuellen Archivbesitzer von konkreter Bedeutung waren, spiegelt sich auch darin, dass die Texte eines Archivs nur aus einem überschaubaren Zeitraum von kaum mehr als 60 Jahren, in den meisten Fällen aber deutlich weniger, stammen. Dementsprechend wurden auch die Sammelrollen offenkundig nach einem relativ kurzen Zeitraum <b>obsolet.</b> In {{different}} places in Egypt – {{but also in}} Palestine –, Aramaic documents have been found which were written {{during the time of}} the Achaemenid empire. Mainly based on observations concerning their content, several of these have been interpreted as parts of ancient archives. The question whether the various documents of a supposed archive were in fact found in the same spot has been mostly neglected. Of course, any analysis of an archive reconstructed in this way would in fact produce the very same picture which modern scholars already had in mind when they reconstructed the archive. Thus, to answer the question of what kind of documents were stored in an archive and for what purpose, my paper will take into consideration only documents whose assignment to a certain archive can be proved or at least regarded as highly probable on account of the archeological evidence. Besides archives from Egypt which can be established in this way – the archive of Jedanja (TAD B 2. 2 - 4 + 6 - 11), of Anani and his wife Jehoišma (TAD B 3. 2 - 13), and of Nakhthor (TAD A 6. 3 - 16) – and the texts from Wadi Daliye, I have also taken into account scrolls which contain copies of several documents and thus form a kind of archive by themselves. A critical analysis of these documents provide an astonishingly consistent picture: only those documents which had direct relevance to the owner of the archive were preserved. Thus, the archives of private individuals contain only those documents which were relevant to their own legal entitlements or property rights. The archive of the official Nakhthor contains only letters concerning his position and duties. Also the bulk of the texts from Wadi Daliye, which possibly belonged to an official archive, concerns the ownership of unfree persons and sometimes of real estates and were thus important for the community. The conclusion that such archives only contain documents of actual relevance entails that the documents of an archive generally concern only a timeframe of up to 60 years–and in most instances even a shorter one. But also the scrolls containing collections of copied documents became obsolete after a relatively short time and could be used afterwards for other purposes...|$|E
40|$|Diese Arbeit versucht die Frage zu beantworten, warum der Konflikt in Tschetschenien in einen epischen Teufelskreis von Gewalt und Gegengewalt ausarten konnte, der erst mit der Etablierung von Ramsan Kadyrows Regime sein weitgehendes Ende fand. Zu diesem Zweck geht diese Untersuchung von der Hypothese aus, dass sich der zu Beginn genuin politische Konflikt aufgrund der Inexistenz eines Gewaltmonopols in Kombination mit ausbeutbaren ökonomischen Ressourcen in einem Prozess der Gewaltökonomisierung zu einem Gewaltmarkt transformierte, in dem zu Gewaltunternehmern mutierte Politiker, Feld-kommandeure und Militärs entlang rationaler Kosten-Nutzen-Kalküle ihre partikularen öko-nomischen und politischen Interessen verfolgten. Damit entwickelten diese Akteure ein aus-geprägtes Interesse an der Fortsetzung des Konflikts und unterminierten gleichzeitig den Aufbau eines tschetschenischen Staatswesens. Politische Ideologien wie der tschetschenische Nationalismus und der von der arabischen Halbinsel eingesickerte militante Islamismus (Salafismus) wurden dabei zu ökonomischen Ressourcen der Gewaltunternehmer, welche von diesen zur Akkumulation von Kapital, politischer Unterstützung und der Mobilisierung von Kämpfern instrumentalisiert wurden. Der entstandene Gewaltmarkt perpetuierte sich selbst, und seine unerbittliche Logik führte zu einer politischen und militärischen Marginalisierung der primär ideologisch motivierten säkularen tschetschenischen Nationalisten um Aslan Maschadow. Damit war eine auf diesen Kräften basierende Lösung des Konflikts <b>obsolet</b> geworden. Den beiden mit äußerster Grausamkeit geführten russischen Militärinterventionen in Tsche-tschenien war es nicht gelungen, ein Gewaltmonopol zu etablieren. Vielmehr fachten sie die zerstörerische Dynamik des Gewaltmarktes weiter an, da sich Teile der russischen Truppen selbst zu Gewaltunternehmern gewandelt hatten, die vom Krieg ökonomisch profitierten und daher ein Interesse an seiner Fortsetzung entwickelten. Erst die mit skrupellosen Methoden betriebene Wiederherstellung eines Gewaltmonopols durch Ramsan Kadyrow, die mit dem Abzug des größten Teils der russischen Truppen einher ging, konnte den tschetschenischen Gewaltmarkt beenden. Die daraus resultierende {{relative}} Normalisierung der Sicherheitslage für die Bevölkerung verschaffte Ramsan eine gewisse politische Legitimität, die durch das umfangreiche russische Wiederaufbauprogramm für die kriegszerstörte Republik noch vergrößert wurde. Im Gegenzug für seine bedingungslose politische Loyalität gegenüber dem Zentrum stellte ihm die Administration Putin einen politischen und ökonomischen Blankoscheck aus, der auch eine Lizenz zu seiner persönlichen Bereicherung umfasst. Somit ist Rasman Kadyrow die Durchsetzung einer weitgehenden Autonomie Tschetscheniens innerhalb der völkerrechtlichen Grenzen der Russischen Föderation gelungen, die er für die Ausgestaltung seiner eigenen kleinen Privatdiktatur nützt. Als zentrale Stützen seines Regimes fungieren, neben seinen Sicherheitskräften, ein System der politischen Korruption und eine Islamisierung der Gesellschaft zum Zweck ihrer politischen Kontrolle. Wie das Experiment des Kadyrow’schen Privatstaates ausgehen wird, bleibt abzuwarten. This master thesis {{tries to}} answer the question, why the conflict in Chechnya has escalated into an obviously epic vicious circle of violence {{that could only be}} stopped, at least to a large extent, by the creation of Ramazan Kadyrov’s regime. In order to achieve this goal, it draws upon the hypothesis, that the Chechen conflict was a genuinely political one, that changed its logic due to the absence of a monopoly of violence and the existence of exploitable economic resources in a process termed „economization of violence”, which led to the establishment of a market of violence. Given the strong economic incentives in such a market of violence to follow an „economized” logic, leading actors like politicians, field commanders and officers turned into entrepreneurs of violence who pursued their private economic and political interests. By doing so, they started to profit from the war. As a consequence, they developed a vested interest in the continuation of hostilities and undermined efforts to establish Chechen statehood. This logic of economization transformed political ideologies like secular Chechen nationalism or the militant version of Islam (Salafism), imported from the Arabian peninsula, into economic resources of the market of violence, which became a tool for the entrepreneurs of violence to accumulate capital, political support and recruit fighters. The fully fledged market of violence in Chechnya perpetuated itself and marginalized the secular Chechen nationalists led by Aslan Maschadov, since they were primarily motivated by their ideology, rather than short-term economic profit. Hence, a political solution based upon these forces {{turned out to be an}} increasingly illusionary option. Although waged with awesome cruelty, both Russian military campaigns failed to establish a monopoly of violence in Chechnya. On the contrary, Russian involvement exacerbated the situation, because it fueled the vicious dynamic of the Chechen market of violence, since parts of the Russian forces deployed there developed into entrepreneurs of violence themselves. Therefore, they too became interested in the prolongation of violence. Only the ruthless methods of Ramzan Kadyrov to establish a monopoly of violence, accom-panied by the withdrawal of the vast majority of Russian troops, eventually ended the Che-chen market of violence. The resulting normalization of the security situation supplied Ram-san Kadyrov with a certain degree of political legitimacy, which was accelerated by the vast reconstruction program launched by Moscow for the war-torn republic. In return for his un-conditional political loyalty, the Kremlin provided him with a carte blanche in political and economic terms, which included a license for his personal enrichment. In any case, Ramzan Kadyrov obviously accomplished a high degree of autonomy for Chechnya within Russia’s international borders, which he utilizes for the establishment of his private little dictatorship. As the main pillars of his regime besides his security forces, he entrenched a system of political corruption and initiated an extensive Islamization campaign in order to control Chechen society. The consequences of this experiment to create a privatized state, ruled by a former warlord, remain to be seen...|$|E
