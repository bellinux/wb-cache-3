40|$|In {{the study}} area {{predominantly}} three <b>marketing</b> <b>options</b> were available for the dairy farmers; unorganized vendors, formal / organized dairy cooperatives and integrated contract system. A majority of dairy farmers around 57. 3 percent had shifted from one <b>marketing</b> <b>option</b> to another. The rest 42. 7 per cent of dairy farmers remained in the same <b>marketing</b> <b>option</b> from the day they began commercial milk production. A major shift from vendors (informal system) to contract (39. 5 per cent), followed by vendor to co-operative (24. 4 per cent) and co-operative to vendor (19. 8 per cent) was noticed. Irregularity in payment and stoppage of procurement by vendor system made dairy farmers shift from vendor system to others. After the weakening of vendor- farmer relationship and initiation of Milk Producer Cooperatives at the village level, {{there has been a}} shift from vendor to co-operative system. When the dairy sector opened for private investment coupled with poor performance of cooperatives, farmers shifted towards new <b>marketing</b> <b>option</b> the 'integrated contract system'. Irregularity in payment, distant location of collection centre and inability to milk the animals were reasons for shifting back to vendor from other <b>marketing</b> <b>options.</b> Prompt payments, sustainability of marketing systems in business were major factors responsible for retaining members and attracting new dairy farmers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple empirical approach to modeling and forecasting <b>market</b> <b>option</b> prices using localized option regressions (LOR). LOR projects <b>market</b> <b>option</b> prices over localized regions of their state space and is robust to assumptions regarding the underlying asset dynamics (e. g. log-normality) and volatility structure. Our empirical study using 3 years of daily S&P 500 options shows that LOR yields smaller out-of-sample pricing errors (e. g. 32 % 1 -day-out) relative to an efficient benchmark {{from the literature}} and produces option prices free of the volatility smile. In addition to being an efficient and robust option-modeling and valuation tool for large option books, LOR provides a simple-to-implement empirical benchmark for evaluating more complex risk-neutral models.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the impact of market {{activity}} on the percentage bid-ask spreads of S&P 100 index options using transaction data. We propose a new market microstructure theory called a derivative hedge theory, in which <b>option</b> <b>market</b> percentage spreads will be inversely related to the <b>option</b> <b>market</b> maker's ability to hedge his positions in the underlying market, as measured by the liquidity of this underlying market. In a perfect hedge world, spreads arise from the illiquidity of the underlying market, rather than from inventory risk or informed trading in the <b>option</b> <b>market</b> itself. We estimate three models to investigate various market microstructure theories. In the static model, option spreads are a function of moneyness, time to maturity, option prices, hedge ratios and volatility. The dynamic model includes time between trades or duration and average volume per transaction while the cross-market model adds cross <b>option</b> <b>market</b> activity and spreads in the underlying <b>market.</b> We find <b>option</b> <b>market</b> volume is not a significant determinant of <b>option</b> <b>market</b> spreads, which challenges the validity of volume as a proxy for liquidity and supports my theory. <b>Option</b> <b>market</b> spreads are positively related to spreads in the underlying market, again supporting our theory. However, <b>option</b> <b>market</b> duration does affect <b>option</b> <b>market</b> spreads, with very slow and very fast <b>option</b> <b>markets</b> both leading to bigger spreads. Only the fast market result would be predicted by asymmetric information theory. Inventory models predict big spreads in slow markets. Neither would be observed if the underlying securities market provided a perfect hedge. We interpret these mixed results to mean that the <b>option</b> <b>market</b> maker is able to only imperfectly hedge his positions in the underlying securities market. Our result of insignificant option volume casts doubt on the price discovery argument between stock and <b>option</b> <b>markets</b> (Easley, O'Hara, and Srinivas (1997)). Asymmetric information costs in either market are naturally passed to the other market by market maker's hedging and therefore it is unimportant where the informed traders trade...|$|R
