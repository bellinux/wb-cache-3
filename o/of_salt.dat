30|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity at 25  °C ranges from 1380 to 14, 830  µS/cm {{with an average}} of 5557.76  µS/cm. The factors responsible for large variation in EC are attributed to geochemical processes such as ionic exchange, reverse exchange, evaporation, silicate weathering, rock–water interaction, sulphate reduction and oxidation processes and anthropogenic activities (Ramesh and Elango 2012). Rao et al. (2002) classified EC as type I, if the enrichments <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are low (EC <  1500  μS/cm); type II, if the enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are medium (EC: 1500 and 3000  μS/cm); and type III, if the enrichments <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are high (EC >  3000  μS/cm), (Prasanth et al. 2012). According to the above classification of EC, the entire groundwater samples come under the type III (high enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts)</b> except well 42 under type II (medium enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts).</b> High EC in the study area indicates the high enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> in the groundwater. Semi-arid climate, high evaporation rate and nutrient enrichment may be responsible for the enrichment of EC.|$|R
30|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} is {{a measure}} of water capacity to convey the electrical current. The most desirable limit of EC in drinking water is prescribed as 1, 500  μS/cm. The value of EC is between 580 and 7, 250  μS/cm. EC measures the ability of a material to conduct an electric current such that the higher EC indicates enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> in the groundwater. Thus, the EC can be classified as type I, if the enrichments <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are low (EC <  1, 500  μS/cm); type II, if the enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are medium (EC: 1, 500 and 3, 000  μS/cm); and type III, if the enrichments <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are high (EC >  3, 000  μS/cm; Sarath Prasanth et al. 2012). According to the classification of EC, 63  % of the total groundwater samples (1, 3 – 9, 12, 15, 18, 20 – 23) falling under the type I (low enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts),</b> 25  % <b>of</b> the samples (13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 24) under the type II (medium enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts),</b> and 12  % of the samples (2, 10, 11) under the type III (high enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts).</b>|$|R

30|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} (EC) is {{a measure}} of an ability to conduct current and higher EC indicates the enrichment of salts/dissolved matter in the groundwater. The EC values ranged from 29.3 to 1775  μS/cm, with a mean of 163.64  μS/cm. The water can be classified based on EC as type I, if the enrichments <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are low (EC: < 1500  μS/cm); type II, if the enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are medium (EC: 1500 and 3000  μS/cm); and type III, if the enrichments <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are high (EC: > 3000  μS/cm) (Subba Rao et al. 2012).

30|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} is {{a measure}} of water capacity to convey electric current. The most desirable limit of EC in drinking water is prescribed as 1, 500  μmhos/cm (WHO 2004). The EC of the groundwater is varying from 64.02 and 2199.57  μmhos/cm with an average value of 514  μmhos/cm (Fig.  3 b). Higher EC in the study area indicates the enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> in the groundwater. The value of electrical conductivity may be an approximate index of the total content of dissolved substance in water. It depends upon temperature, concentration and types of ions present (Hem 1985). The EC can be classified as type I, if the enrichments <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are low (EC <  1, 500  μmhos/cm); type II, if the enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are medium (EC 1, 500 and 3, 000  μmhos/cm); and type III, if the enrichments <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> are high (EC >  3, 000  μmhos/cm). According to the above classification of EC, 96  % of the total groundwater samples come under the type I (low enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts)</b> and 4  % under type II (medium enrichment <b>of</b> <b>salts).</b> The effect <b>of</b> saline intrusion may be the reason for medium enrichment of EC in the study area. The effect of pH may also increase the dissolution process, which eventually increases the EC value.|$|R

The results were as follows : 1) Combination of 2 or 3 kinds <b>of</b> <b>salts,</b> such as Na_ 2 CO_ 3, Na_ 2 HPO_ 4 and Na_ 2 SO_ 4 in the culture media was proved to be effective on the flagellation at 37 ℃, but was less effective than a single salt. 2) The combined effect <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> on the flagellation was neither additive nor synergistics. 3) The pH value of the culture media {{was one of the most}} important factors for the flagellation. Especially, the pH values before and after adding <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> to the culture media remarkably affected the flagellation at both 27 ℃ and 37 ℃. The optimal pH values before and after adding <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> at 27 ℃ were between 5. 2 and 7. 4, and between 7. 4 and 9. 8, respectively.
