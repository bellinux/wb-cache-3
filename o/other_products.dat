5|$|At independence, a King George V 5 pence {{registered}} {{envelope and}} 1 shilling telegram form were printed in green {{for use in}} Ireland until domestic products became available. Irish telegram forms were only produced in 1/- and 1/6 values. Registered envelopes have appeared in many values and sizes. The printed (but non-stamped) registered envelopes were produced by private firms and stored by the Irish post office until needed, so envelopes from former periods, showing out-dated fees in the text, often received an impressed stamp for the current postal rate, creating many subtypes for collectors. <b>Other</b> <b>products</b> have carried post-paid imprint, such as commemorative and special issue postcards, including a series of St. Patrick's Day cards issued annually since 1984.|$|E

San Antonio de Petrel produced leather, jerky, soles, tallow, and cordovan, as well as <b>other</b> <b>products</b> which would later be exported to Peru, or sold in Santiago and Valparaíso. San Antonio de Petrel was bordered by properties of Lauriano Gaete and Ninfa Vargas, and Pedro Pavez Polanco.|$|E
