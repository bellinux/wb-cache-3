5|$|Turnbull's {{willingness}} {{to negotiate with}} the government was met with opposition from some Coalition MPs. By September 2009, The Australian was reporting that only 12 of the 59 Liberal backbenchers supported negotiations. On 18 October 2009, Turnbull fronted a meeting <b>of</b> <b>Coalition</b> MPs with a proposal to negotiate amendments to the government's ETS. This meeting supported his proposal, in what was seen as a test of Turnbull's leadership. However, there was speculation that a number <b>of</b> <b>Coalition</b> Senators would defy Turnbull and cross the floor of the Senate to vote against any ETS legislation. The ETS opponents argued that it would be premature for Parliament to pass ETS legislation before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature <b>of</b> <b>coalition</b> governments {{in a number of states}} means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing on the nature of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E
30|$|The {{variations}} <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>coalitions</b> over different γ {{values are}} given in Fig. 3. As multiplicity factor (γ) is increased, the number <b>of</b> <b>coalitions</b> increases, because, when multiplicity factor is relaxed then more number of tuples {{are included in the}} coalition which leads less number <b>of</b> <b>coalitions</b> i.e., if γ value is increased then there is a possibility for tight segregation which causes more number <b>of</b> <b>coalitions.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>coalitions</b> is constant until some fixed value γ which relatively depends upon the weight factor β. Another observation {{is that there is a}} sudden climb after certain value (sum of β and γ is around 1.75 for our sample data set) and the growth rate <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>coalitions</b> decreases according to decrease in the weight factor β (See Fig. 3).|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, argumentation {{frameworks}} have been successfully applied to multi agent systems. Recently, argumentation {{has been used to}} provide a framework for reasoning about coalition formation. At the same time alternatingtime temporal logic has been used to reason about the behavior and abilities <b>of</b> <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> agents. However, ATL operators account only for the existence of successful strategies <b>of</b> <b>coalitions.</b> They do not consider whether coalitions can be actually formed. This paper is an attempt to combine both frameworks and to develop a logic through which we can reason at the same time (1) about abilities <b>of</b> <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> agents and (2) about the formation <b>of</b> <b>coalitions.</b> We provide a formal extension of ATL, ATL c, in which the actual computation <b>of</b> the <b>coalition</b> is modelled in terms of argumentation semantics.

5|$|The Allied command {{structure}} in the South West Pacific Area faced the challenges <b>of</b> <b>coalition</b> warfare in several ways, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative and informative one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E

5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, {{elements}} of the division, including its special troops battalion and the 1-87th Infantry deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001. The division headquarters arrived at Karshi-Khanabad, under Major General Hagenbeck, on 12 December 2001 to function as the Combined Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) (Forward). This command served as the representative for Lieutenant General Paul Mikolashek, the Third US Army/CFLCC commanding general (CG) in the theater of operations. As such, Hagenbeck's headquarters was responsible for commanding and controlling virtually all Coalition ground forces and ground force operations in the theater, to include security <b>of</b> <b>Coalition</b> airfields in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan, {{as well as the}} logistics operations set up to support those forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} for the French was dire. Not only had they been trounced in southwestern Germany, the legendary Alexander Suvorov {{was on his way}} to northern Italy with 60,000 Russians, to take command <b>of</b> <b>Coalition</b> forces there. Count Heinrich Bellegarde, positioned with 20,000 men in the Grisons, effectively isolated Masséna's force from any assistance out of Italy. Most threatening, Archduke Charles' main army lay less than a day away; in size alone, it could overwhelm him, or, if he withdrew to the west, its position cut off his avenue of withdrawal toward France. If Charles' left wing, commanded by Nauendorf, united with Hotze's force, approaching from the east, Masséna knew Charles would attack and very likely push him out of Zürich.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design of scalable, fuzzy adaptive, {{decision}} making systems constructed from sets of heterogeneous classifiers.

The small size constraint on individual coalitions is intended for both the interpretability of fuzzy measures and low complexity of fuzzy integral operators. In addition, the sparse connection constraint guarantees realizable good independent coalitions amenable to further information fusion stages. Simple rules regarding the number <b>of</b> <b>coalitions,</b> the number <b>of</b> classifiers per <b>coalition</b> and the number <b>of</b> <b>coalitions</b> where each classifier should participate are presented.

This entails the name and PIN of each candidate, {{and the names of}} political parties endorsing the candidate (or a note that the candidate is running as an independent. The names are preceded by ordinal numbers. Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate {{and the name of the}} person heading the list, in addition to candidates, who is not necessarily a candidate on the particular list, but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the list—usually head of the party <b>of</b> <b>coalition</b> at the national level. The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number. Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid.

5|$|The loss of Schmitt was a {{significant}} blow to the Austrian military organization. Called out of retirement for this specific task, {{he was the most}} experienced Habsburg general staff officer, second only to the Archduke Charles. From mid-1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, the Lower Rhine, the Rhine and the Army of Germany. Furthermore, he was a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. He had helped to design several of Charles' more important victories at Emmendingen, Schliengen, the sieges at Kehl and Hünigen, the battles at Ostrach and Stockach, and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included battles at Winterthur and Zürich. An experienced officer and excellent tactician, he might well have made a more effective Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of Austerlitz than his eventual replacement, Franz von Weyrother. In Schmitt's absence, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at Hohenlinden in 1800, was chosen to develop the general battle plan <b>of</b> <b>Coalition</b> action at Austerlitz. Schmitt, undoubtedly a far better tactician than Weyrother, and possessor of superior training and mapping skills, would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for Austerlitz. Schmitt's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory, but it would have mitigated the magnitude of the Coalition's losses; Austerlitz was considered one of Napoleon's finest triumphs.|$|E

These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army.
