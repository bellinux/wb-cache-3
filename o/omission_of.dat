5|$|The team {{itself was}} {{significantly}} different from the Invincibles squad. Bradman had retired; Sid Barnes, Don Tallon, Ernie Toshack and Bill Brown were unavailable, while the <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> Keith Miller caused a furore. Miller later joined the tour after an injury sustained in a car crash sidelined Bill Johnston for an extended period {{at the start of the}} tour. However, Johnston recovered, and both he and Miller took their places in all five Tests, eliminating any disadvantage caused by the controversial initial <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> the latter.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Polish film Sekret Enigmy (The Enigma Secret) is a {{generally}} fair, if superficial, {{account of the}} Cipher Bureau's story. Twenty-two years later, the 2001 Hollywood film Enigma was criticized for its many historical inaccuracies, including <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> Poland's fundamental work in Enigma decryption.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} also {{particularly}} well-received critically, with multiple critics praising the <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> the Wall and Dothraki plotlines giving this episode a relatively more focused feel. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 2.58 {{million in its}} initial broadcast.|$|E

5|$|As expected, Chapman {{was named}} as captain for the Australian tour. The MCC touring team was {{regarded}} as a strong one by commentators; the only controversy was the <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> Frank Woolley which was not fully explained. Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible for leaving Woolley out as he was jealous of his county team-mate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Between 1995 and 2004 {{there were}} 2,630 {{accidents}} involving GA aircraft, of which 139 were fatal, {{resulting in the}} loss of 317 lives. The majority of accidents involved small fixed-wing aircraft engaged in private flights, and analysis attributes the most common causes of these to: flight handling skills; poor judgement or airmanship; lack of training or experience; and <b>omission</b> <b>of,</b> or inappropriate, action.|$|E

5|$|During the drawn Third Test, Barnes {{was injured}} and Ian Johnson {{was used as}} a {{makeshift}} opener because Morris was the only specialist opener left in the team after the <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> Brown. In the meantime, Barnes's injury had opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Harvey managed only ten and Brown only eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} titles, Ninja Gaiden III received mostly positive reviews from critics. Early reviews praised the game for its plot, gameplay, and difficulty; later reviews criticized it for that plot being overly outlandish, inconsistent level designs, and the game's difficulty level, in which the North American version was intentionally made harder than the Japanese version through limited continues, stronger enemies, and <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> a password system. The Atari Lynx port, while receiving general praise for graphics and controls, received poor reception for its sound and for the inability for players to see characters and items, attributing it to the Lynx's small screen.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} if social distance, i. e. in- vs. out-group membership, {{had an effect}} on moral judgments <b>of</b> acts vs. <b>omissions.</b> 164 participants judged the morality <b>of</b> acts vs. <b>omissions</b> <b>of</b> lethal harm, that affected an in- vs. out-group member of the participant, in order to save five other people. The results showed that acts of lethal, but utilitarian, harm were judged more immoral than <b>omissions</b> <b>of</b> equivalent harm. It was also shown that if the victim was an in- group member of the participant the behavior was judged more immoral than if the victim was an out-group member of the participant. However, the acts and <b>omissions</b> <b>of</b> harm were not judged differently when the victim was an in. - vs. out-group member of the participant, indicating that this kind of social distance might not influence the moral judgment <b>of</b> acts and <b>omissions.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Australia {{made three}} changes. Having taken only seven wickets {{in the first}} four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Ian Johnson was {{replaced}} by leg spinner Doug Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium pacer Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who had missed the Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> his deputy Ron Saggers.|$|E
5|$|Content {{with their}} convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made no changes to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young {{due to a}} {{combination}} of injury and poor form. Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall {{played a key role in}} a heavy 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets. His bowling also led to the controversial <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. This decision pleased the Australians, who regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent with the bat.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a change}} in the rules made for the 79th Academy Awards, the Academy {{published}} a shortlist of nine films on January 15, 2008, prior to the selection of the final five nominees. The Academy engendered controversy with its selections, notably the <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> Romania's 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, which had won the Palme d'Or at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, and France's Persepolis, the winner of the Jury Prize at the same Cannes Film Festival. After revealing the shortlist, the Academy released a list of nominees on January 22, 2008. The winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was Austria's The Counterfeiters, which was directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived {{version of}} the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main {{differences}} with the Spector-produced version was the <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl {{at the time of}} the music's original American release.|$|E
5|$|In Demosthenes's initial {{judicial}} orations, {{the influence}} of both Lysias and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed. Most of his extant speeches for private cases—written early in his career—show glimpses of talent: a powerful intellectual drive, masterly selection (and <b>omission)</b> <b>of</b> facts, and a confident assertion of the justice of his case, all ensuring the dominance of his viewpoint over his rival. However, {{at this early stage}} of his career, his writing was not yet remarkable for its subtlety, verbal precision and variety of effects.|$|E
5|$|Mozart did {{not write}} down a cadenza for the movement, or at least there is no {{evidence}} of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E

5|$|Reception towards Colin McRae Rally was mixed. The primary {{criticism}} among professional reviewers was {{the lack}} of content and <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> important features. However, the attempt to replicate the driving experience of classic Colin McRae Rally games was complimented. Critics generally believed that the level of difficulty and realistic driving model would appease rally fans and experienced players but might deter beginners. Upon release, the PC version was received negatively by players who were not expecting a mobile game port. The reaction prompted Codemasters to offer refunds to the players.|$|E
5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning that word order in Nahuatl is basically free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> all noun phrases or independent pronouns, not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are used only for emphasis. It allows certain kinds of syntactically discontinuous expressions.|$|E

The movement restated the demand that Bengali be declared an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq, Shawkat Ali, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, Abdul Wahed and others were arrested during the rallies. Rally leader Mohammad Toaha was hospitalised after attempting to snatch a rifle from a police officer. Student leaders, including Abdul Matin and Abdul Malek Ukil {{took part in the}} procession.|$|E
