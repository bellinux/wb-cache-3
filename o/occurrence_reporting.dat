Evaluation of the Implementation of an Electronic <b>Occurrence</b> <b>Reporting</b> System at Eastern Health, Newfoundland and Labrador (Phase One) [...] In June 2008, Eastern Health {{completed}} {{the implementation of}} an electronic <b>occurrence</b> <b>reporting</b> system (Phase One). Phase One included a pre-go-live site (an integrated services site in a rural setting) and three go-live sites (acute care, long term care and community health in an urban setting). The evaluation study had a dual purpose: (a) to assess and report {{on the impact of}} the implementation of the electronic <b>occurrence</b> <b>reporting</b> system on achieving its stated objectives, particularly those that could be measured within the timelines of the project and (b) to analyze findings to identify contributions to the literature in the recently developing field of implementations of electronic <b>occurrence</b> <b>reporting</b> systems in health care. [...] The evaluation was guided by the framework outlined in the report, "Towards an Evaluation Framework for Electronic Health Records Initiatives" (Neville et al., 2004), which emphasizes stakeholder involvement in evaluation studies, pre/post comparative study design, and triangulation of data where possible. Data were collected from several sources such as project documentation, administrative <b>occurrence</b> <b>reporting</b> records, surveys, focus groups and key informant interviews. [...] The findings of this study provide evidence that frontline staff and managers support the implementation of the electronic <b>occurrence</b> <b>reporting</b> system, that there is little difference in results between the various sectors of the continuum of health services and the new system had both positive and negative impacts on the role of frontline managers. There were limitations related to some of the findings due to the small sample size, particularly the long term care sector. [...] Many benefits were realized such as: (a) {{an increase in the number}} of occurrences reported, (b) increase in the number of occurrences reported within 48 hours, (c) increase in the number of occurrences reported by staff other than registered nurses, (d) increase in the number of close calls reported, (e) positive changes in the patient safety culture, (f) improved timelines for notification of high alert occurrences to managers, and (g) satisfaction with the electronic tool related to ease of use, accessibility, and consistency. [...] The implementation process also encountered challenges, such as issues related to customizing the software and development of the classification system for coding occurrences. These issues impacted on the ability of the managers to obtain timely customized reports and to close out files. These challenges are currently being addressed by the Project Implementation Team. Participants noted that resolving these issues will enhance the many positive impacts of the system already realized. Lessons learned during the Phase One implementation process (including the identification of facilitators and barriers) resulted in recommendations that can assist with future implementations...|$|E

We hypothesized that hospitals could improve the accuracy of adverse drug event self-reporting by comparing adverse drug events recorded in an <b>occurrence</b> <b>reporting</b> tool with those detected by surveillance of “rescue ” drugs administered to treat adverse drug events. We conducted a prospective cohort study of all adult inpatient discharges from a 200 -bed rural acute care hospital in West Virginia dur-ing a 6 -month period.

40|$|Background: Eastern Health, a large {{health care}} {{organization}} in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), started a staged implementation of an electronic <b>occurrence</b> <b>reporting</b> system (used interchangeably with “clinical safety reporting system”) in 2008, completing Phase One in 2009. The electronic clinical safety reporting system (CSRS) {{was designed to}} replace a paper-based system. The CSRS involves reporting on occurrences such as falls, safety/security issues, medication errors, treatment and procedural mishaps, medical equipment malfunctions, and close calls. The electronic system was purchased from a vendor in the United Kingdom that had implemented the system in the United Kingdom and other places, such as British Columbia. The main objective {{of the new system}} was to improve the reporting process with the goal of improving clinical safety. The project was funded jointly by Eastern Health and Canada Health Infoway. Objective: The objectives of the evaluation were to: (1) assess the CSRS on achieving its stated objectives (particularly, the benefits realized and lessons learned), and (2) identify contributions, if any, that can be made to the emerging field of electronic clinical safety reporting. Methods: The evaluation involved mixed methods, including extensive stakeholder participation, pre/post comparative study design, and triangulation of data where possible. The data were collected from several sources, such as project documentation, <b>occurrence</b> <b>reporting</b> records, stakeholder workshops, surveys, focus groups, and key informant interviews...|$|E

DOE G- 830. 120, Implementation Guide for Use with 10 CFR Part 830. 120, Quality Assurance, [10] provides additional guidance on establishing and implementing effective QA processes to control S/CIs. DOE O 232. 1, <b>Occurrence</b> <b>Reporting</b> and Processing of Operations, [11] specifies requirements for reporting S/CIs under the DOE <b>Occurrence</b> <b>Reporting</b> and Processing System (ORPS). DOE promulgated the requirements and guidance to control or eliminate the hazards posed by S/CIs, which can lead to unexpected equipment failures and undue risks to the DOE mission, the environment, and personnel. This Guide is a compendium of information contained in the referenced DOE directives and other documents concerning S/CI controls. It incorporates, updates, and supersedes earlier guidance issued in Plan for the Suspect/Counterfeit Products Issue in the Department of Energy, dated October 1993, [4] and in memoranda issued by Defense Programs (DP) [12 - 16] and other DOE program offices. This guidance was developed to strengthen the procurement process, identify and eliminate S/CIs, and improve the reporting of S/CIs.

40|$|Abstract. Deficient safety <b>occurrence</b> <b>reporting</b> by {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} {{is an important issue}} in many air traffic organizations. To understand the reasons for not reporting, practitioners formulated a number of hypotheses, which are difficult to verify manually. To perform automated, formally-based verification of the hypotheses an agent-based modeling and simulation approach is proposed in this paper. This approach allows modeling both institutional (prescriptive) aspects of the formal organization and social behavior of organizational actors. To our knowledge, agent-based organization modeling has not been attempted in air traffic previously. Using such an approach four hypotheses related to consequences of controller team composition in particular organizational contexts were examined. Keywords: Agent-based simulation, organization modeling, formal analysis, air traffic. ...|$|E
