5|$|The {{campaign}} {{was perceived as}} a decisive Israeli victory, causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command and the birth <b>of</b> <b>heroic</b> tales in Israel. However, Syria made a small territorial gain and certain actions were criticized within Israel, such as the retreat from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} risk taking, some types of risk, such as {{physical}} or heroic risk for others' benefit, are viewed more favorably than other types of risk, such as taking drugs. Males and females valued different degrees <b>of</b> <b>heroic</b> risk for mates and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic risk taking by male friends, but preferred less of it in female mates. Females valued heroic risk taking in male mates and less of it in female friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children. Males may prefer heroic risk taking by male friends {{as they could be}} good allies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the tales}} <b>of</b> <b>heroic</b> Greece, royal {{succession}} often passed from father-in-law to son-in-law, and some historians {{have seen in}} this an early example of the epikleros pattern. Some examples include Pelops, Bellerophon, Melampus, Peleus, Telamon, and Diomedes. Not all such heroic era royal successions followed the epikleros pattern however, {{as in the case}} of Menelaus, who married Helen of Troy and succeeded Helen's father Tyndareus, even though Tyndareus had living sons, Kastor and Polydeukes. Another example is Arete of Phaeacia in the Odyssey, who was an heiress married to her father's brother Alcinous.|$|E
5|$|Middlesex {{has several}} allusions to Greek {{classical}} myths; for example, the protagonist {{is named after}} Calliope, the muse <b>of</b> <b>heroic</b> poetry. Eugenides was partly inspired by the explorations of hermaphrodism in Greek myths to write the novel about an intersex man. In Middlesex, Cal acts out the story of Hermaphroditus, the Greek deity of bisexuality and effeminacy, while eking out a living in San Francisco. While narrating, Cal enters his ancestors' thoughts and empathizes with them, an ability possessed by Hermaphroditus. The protagonist compared himself to another mythical figureTiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes; the omniscient seer lived sevenyears as a woman because of a curse.|$|E
5|$|Walton {{worked for}} many years on his only {{full-length}} opera, Troilus and Cressida, both before its premiere and afterwards. It has never been regarded as a success. The libretto is generally considered weak, and Walton's music, despite many passages that have won critical praise, is not dramatic enough to sustain interest. Grove calls the work a partially successful attempt to revivify the traditions of nineteenth-century Italian opera in a post-war era wary <b>of</b> <b>heroic</b> Romanticism.|$|E
500|$|The age <b>of</b> heroes (<b>heroic</b> age), where divine {{activity}} was more limited. The last and greatest <b>of</b> the <b>heroic</b> legends {{is the story}} of the Trojan War and after (which is regarded by some researchers as a separate, fourth period).|$|R
50|$|After stanzas of {{heightened}} poetic language, the poet, in three short lines, wraps up a pathos-laden story with mundane and practical details. The effect yanks the reader {{out of the}} poetic world, simultaneously offering commentary on the finality of death and the transience <b>of</b> <b>heroics.</b>|$|R
60|$|She smiled again, {{this time}} at the boyish touch <b>of</b> <b>heroics.</b> Experience, responsibility, and he would get over that. She remembered once, long ago, when his mother had shut him up in his room for a punishment, and he had {{tortured}} her by remaining there for two whole days.|$|R
5|$|Unlike most earlier Spanish art, Goya's {{rejects the}} ideals <b>of</b> <b>heroic</b> dignity. He refuses {{to focus on}} {{individual}} participants; though he drew from many classic art sources, his works pointedly portray the protagonists as anonymous casualties, rather than known patriots. The exception is , Que valor! (What courage!), which depicts Agustina de Aragón (1786–1857), the heroine of Zaragoza, who brought food to the cannoneers at the city defensive walls during the siege in which 54,000 Spaniards died. When all the cannoneers had been killed, Agustina manned and fired the cannons herself. Although it is agreed that Goya could not have witnessed this incident, Robert Hughes believes {{it may have been}} his visit to Zaragoza in the lull {{between the first and second}} phases of the siege that inspired him to produce the series.|$|E
5|$|Voroshilov {{began her}} postwar {{modernization}} in April 1954, but encountered {{the same issues}} as Maxim Gorky. Unlike her half-sister, she was selected for conversion as a testbed for missile development as Project 33 on 17 February 1956. The conversion process was quite prolonged, as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts; {{and she was not}} recommissioned as OS-24 until 31 December 1961. She was modernized under Project 33M from 11 October 1963 to 1 December 1965. Converted to a floating barracks on 6 October 1972, she was briefly redesignated as PKZ-19 before being sold for scrap on 2 March 1973. Voroshilovs 14-ton propeller and 2.5-ton stop anchor are on display at the Museum <b>of</b> <b>Heroic</b> Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol on Sapun Mountain in Sevastopol.|$|E
5|$|Voroshilov was {{inspected}} in 1946 {{and found}} unsatisfactory, {{but she was}} given routine servicing. She began her postwar modernization in April 1954, but the Navy reevaluated {{the scope of the}} work in 1955 and deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship. Unlike her half-sister , she was selected for conversion as a testbed for missile development as Project 33 on 17 February 1956. The conversion process was prolonged, as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts. She consequently was not recommissioned as OS-24 until 31 December 1961. The ship was modernized under Project 33M from 11 October 1963 to 1 December 1965. Her final conversion was to a floating barracks on 6 October 1972 and she was redesignated as PKZ-19.
