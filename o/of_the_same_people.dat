5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe was {{compelled}} to cede the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also increased their military presence on the frontier, building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together, and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> and concerned similar issues.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly {{different times of}} life. Pleased with the effect he achieved {{with the return of}} Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people.</b> Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.|$|E

5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then {{it may be that the}} marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people.</b> Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E
25|$|During Reconstruction, Congress enacted race-conscious {{programs}} {{primarily to}} assist newly freed slaves who had personally been denied many advantages earlier in their lives. Such legislation was enacted by many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who framed the Equal Protection Clause, though that clause {{did not apply}} to such federal legislation, and instead only applied to state legislation. Likewise, the Equal Protection Clause does not apply to private universities and other private businesses, which are free to practice affirmative action unless prohibited by federal statute or state law.|$|E
25|$|In 1662, {{after the}} {{restoration}} of the monarchy, in revenge for the support Coventry gave to the Parliamentarians during the Civil War, the city walls were demolished on the orders of King Charles II and now only a few short sections and two city gatehouses remain. When his brother, King James II visited the city in 1687, he received a magnificent reception in an outward show of loyalty to the Crown, but within two years most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> were celebrating the coming of William of Orange.|$|E

Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of homosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: [...] "From going to places where you had to knock on a door and speak to someone through a peephole in order to get in. We were just out. We were in the streets." ...|$|E
500|$|David John, who {{had also}} worked on {{expansion}} packs for the original Neverwinter Nights, composed the score for Mysteries of Westgate, which took several months. In an interview soon after the game's release, Scull said [...] "Some of [...] tracks are so good, I actually listen to them alongside my usual eclectic mix." [...] Mysteries of Westgate's voice acting was recorded in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, with over 12,000 words of new voice-over material. [...] The cast included some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who previously acted in [...] and other BioWare games.

500|$|Around 2008, {{the company}} saw that gaming {{consoles}} had developed features for connectivity and social play. They also {{recognized that the}} market for such trivia games was slim {{at the time and}} saw a possible opportunity to revitalize the series. Near this time, Jellyvision Labs was spun out to its own company, Jellyvision Games, LLC, which would later be reincorporated in 2011 as Jellyvision Games, Inc. Harry Gottlieb, the founder of Jellyvision, recognized that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> that worked on the original games were still in the company, and proposed the idea of a new You Don't Know Jack title to publishers. After securing THQ as a publisher, full-time development for the game started in February 2010. Steve Heinrich, the game's producer, said the development process was [...] "insanely quick", allowing them to work concurrently on writing, art, sound, and programming, and had the flexibility to make design decisions to keep the game simple and funny. However, the question writing staff found some of the deadlines to be too short, preventing them for doing extensive audience feedback.|$|E
500|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT scanning) is a {{more sensitive}} test for pulmonary contusion, and it can identify abdominal, chest, or other injuries that accompany the contusion. In one study, chest X-ray detected pulmonary contusions in 16.3% of people with serious blunt trauma, while CT detected them in 31.2% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people.</b> Unlike X-ray, CT scanning can detect the contusion almost immediately after the injury. However, in both X-ray and CT a contusion may become more visible over the first 24–48hours after trauma as bleeding and edema into lung tissues progress. CT scanning also helps determine {{the size of a}} contusion, which is useful in determining whether a patient needs mechanical ventilation; a larger volume of contused lung on CT scan is associated with an increased likelihood that ventilation will be needed. [...] CT scans also help differentiate between contusion and pulmonary hematoma, which may be difficult to tell apart otherwise. However, pulmonary contusions that are visible on CT but not chest X-ray are usually not severe enough to affect outcome or treatment.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Sunday {{probably}} preached to more than one hundred million people face-to-face—and, to the great majority, without electronic amplification. Vast numbers [...] "hit the sawdust trail." [...] Although the usual total given for those who came forward at invitations is an even million, one modern historian estimates the true figure to be closer to 1,250,000. Sunday did not preach to a hundred million different individuals but to many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> repeatedly over {{the course of}} a campaign. Before his death, Sunday estimated that he had preached nearly 20,000 sermons, an average of 42 per month from 1896 to 1935. During his heyday, when he was preaching more than twenty times each week, his crowds were often huge. Even in 1923, well into the period of his decline, 479,300 people attended the 79 meetings of the six-week 1923 Columbia, South Carolina, campaign–23 times the white population of Columbia. Nevertheless,"trail hitters" [...] were not necessarily conversions (or even [...] "reconsecrations") to Christianity. Sometimes whole groups of club members came forward en masse at Sunday's prodding. By 1927, Rodeheaver was complaining that Sunday's invitations had become so general that they were meaningless.|$|E

500|$|During an interview, Tempah {{commented on}} his second album: [...] "I always {{like to work with}} {{different}} people on each project I do, just so you get a different sound and angle.

[...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing at what he does. I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz". Tempah's vocals from the song are also sampled on the hidden track [...] "5 Minutes".|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} NAVSEA responsibility, he further states: [...] "I {{always felt that}} the {{investigators}} closed their eyes to the most likely cause {{because they did not}} want to acknowledge their own involvement in this tragedy.

Hypoallergenic pets still produce allergens, but because of their coat type, absence of fur, or absence of a gene that produces a certain protein, they typically produce fewer allergens than others <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species. <b>People</b> with severe allergies and asthma may still be affected by a hypoallergenic pet.|$|R
