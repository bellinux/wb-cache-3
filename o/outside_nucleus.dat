40|$|We present J-band long-slit spectroscopic {{observation}} of NGC 1068 {{classified as a}} Seyfert 2 galaxy. J-band observations with OAO/ISLE provide clear detection of spatially extended [Fe II] 1. 257 um and [P II] 1. 188 um lines. We found that [Fe II] 1. 257 um/[P II] 1. 188 um increases with distance from a central continuum peak. Observed line ratios around the nucleus (continuum peak) are consistent with a typical value expected from photoionization models, while the ratios at 3 " - 4 " (210 - 280 pc) east and west of the nucleus are slightly higher than this. In the off nucleus region of NGC 1068 we also found a possible association between [Fe II] 1. 257 um/[P II] 1. 188 um and the radio continuum. This suggests a mild contribution of shock ionization induced by a radio jet <b>outside</b> <b>nucleus</b> while photoionization by the central energy source is dominant near the nucleus.

40|$|The ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) gene in Arabidopsis is {{important}} for a plethora of morphological phenotypes. Recently, AN was also reported {{to be involved in}} responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. It encodes a homolog of the animal C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs). In contrast to animal CtBPs, AN does not appear to function as a transcriptional co-repressor and instead functions <b>outside</b> <b>nucleus</b> where it might be involved in Golgi-associated membrane trafficking. In this study, we report a novel and unexplored role of AN as a component of stress granules (SGs). Interaction studies identified several RNA binding proteins that are associated with AN. AN co-localizes with several messenger ribonucleoprotein granule markers to SGs in a stress dependent manner. an mutants exhibit an altered SG formation. We provide evidence that the NAD(H) binding domain of AN is relevant in this context as proteins carrying mutations in this domain localize to a much higher degree to SGs and strongly reduce AN dimerization and its interaction with one interactor but not the others. Finally, we show that AN is a negative regulator of salt and osmotic stress responses in Arabidopsis suggesting a functional relevance in SGs...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del póster presentado a la 5 ª Reunión de la Red Española de Canales Iónicos: "Present {{and future}} in ion channel research", celebrada en Barcelona (España) del 4 al 6 de octubre de 2015. DREAM, also named calsenilin or KChIP 3, is a {{neuronal}} calcium sensor that regulates multiple genes after binding to DRE {{sites in the}} nucleus. <b>Outside</b> <b>nucleus,</b> DREAM regulates diverse cellular functions by binding to several proteins, one of them the Kv 4. 3 channel. Kv 4. 3 channels, after assembling with different modulatory subunits, generate a fast and transient outward potassium current. In the heart, Kv 4. 3 binds with KChIP 2 subunits, generating the Ito 1, {{one of the main}} repolarizing cardiac currents. In neurons, they associate to KChIP 1 or KChIP 3 and generate the IA, which is implicated in very specialized functions as learning, memory and behavior. Here, we describe the electrophysiological effects of new compounds designed to bind with high affinity to KChIP 3, in Kv 4. 3 and Kv 4. 3 +KChIP 3 channels expressed in CHO cells. PC 342 inhibited Kv 4. 3 and Kv 4. 3 +KChIP 3 to a similar extent, whereas PC 332 and PC 358 inhibited Kv 4. 3 +KChIP 3 to a greater extent. Block induced by PC 332 was time- and voltage-dependent, consistent with binding to a closed-active state. Therefore, PC 332 and PC 358 may represent good compounds to develop new drugs that selectively modulate the neuronal electric activity in distinct neuronal populations. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{activation}} of GABAB receptors hyperpolarizes 5 -HT neurons and reduces cell firing.

As shown previously in the DR, the application of baclofen in the MnR increased the local 5 -HT output. Thus, although 5 -HT neurons contain inhibitory GABAB-RI receptors, baclofen increased 5 -HT release in some brain areas, likely by a preferential action on terminal GABAB autoreceptors in inhibitory inputs to 5 -HT neurons.

40|$|An {{equation}} of state for hot, dense matter is presented {{in a form that}} is sufficiently rapid to use directly in hydrodynamical simulations, for example, in stellar collapse calculations. It contains an adjustable nuclear force that accurately models both potential and mean-field interactions, and it allows for the input of various nuclear parameters, some of which are not yet experimentally well-determined. These include the bulk incompressibility parameter, the bulk and surface symmetry energies, the symmetric matter surface tension, and the nucleon effective masses. This permits parametric studies of the {{equation of}} state in astrophysical situations. The {{equation of state}} is modelled after the Lattimer, Lamb, Pethick, and Ravenhall (LLPR) compressible liquid drop model for nuclei, and includes the effects of interactions and degeneracy of the nucleons <b>outside</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Account is also taken of nuclear deformations and the phase transitions from nuclei to uniform nuclear matter at subnuclear densities.
