5|$|Regular series {{character}} designer Yoshitaka Amano's concept art {{became the}} basis for the models in the full motion videos produced for the game's PlayStation re-release. Tetsuya Takahashi, one of the graphic directors, drew the imperial Magitek Armors seen in the opening scene. By doing so, he disregarded Sakaguchi's intention to reuse the regular designs from elsewhere in the game. The sprite art for the characters' in-game appearance was drawn by Kazuko Shibuya. While in the earlier installments, the sprites were less detailed on the map than in battle, Final Fantasy VIs had an equally high resolution regardless of the screen. This enabled the use of animations depicting a variety of movements and facial expressions. Though it was not the first game to utilize the Super NES' Mode 7 graphics, Final Fantasy VI made more extensive use <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>than</b> its predecessors. For instance, unlike both Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V, the world map is rendered in Mode 7, which lends a somewhat three-dimensional perspective to an otherwise two-dimensional game.|$|E
5|$|The Hippodrome of Constantinople (really a Roman circus, not {{the open}} space that the {{original}} Greek hippodromes were) {{was connected to the}} emperor's palace and the Church of Hagia Sophia, allowing spectators to view the emperor as they had in Rome. Citizens used their proximity to the emperor in the circuses and theatres to express public opinion, like their dissatisfaction with the Emperor's errant policy. It has been argued that the people became so powerful that the emperors {{had no choice but to}} grant them more legal rights. However, contrary to this traditional view, it appears, based on more recent historical research, that the Byzantine emperors treated the protests and petitions of their citizens in the circuses with greater contempt and were more dismissive <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>than</b> their Roman predecessors. Justinian I (r. 527–565), for instance, seems to have been dismissive of the Greens' petitions and to have never negotiated with them at all.|$|E
25|$|Stop {{signs are}} used globally. However, most {{countries}} see fewer <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>than</b> North America and South Africa, because all-way stops are never used {{and may even}} be legally prohibited. In a majority of European and Central Asian countries, as well as Cuba in North America, junctions without traffic lights or roundabouts are controlled by stop signs on minor roads and by white, yellow and black priority diamond signs on the major road. In the UK, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, New Zealand and Australia, stop signs are restricted to situations wherein coming to a dead stop is actually necessary because of severely limited sight lines. At {{the vast majority of}} minor intersections in these countries Give Way signs and/or equivalent road markings are used. Finally, at the busier crossing streets, Give Way signs may be replaced by (mini) roundabouts, which also work on the give way (rather than stop) principle.|$|E

25|$|The Mongols {{also used}} {{deception}} {{very well in}} their wars. For instance, when approaching a mobile army the units would be split into three or more army groups, each trying to outflank and surprise their opponents. This created many battlefield scenarios for the opponents where the Mongols would seem to appear {{out of nowhere and}} there were seemingly more <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>than</b> in actuality. Flanking and/or feigned retreat if the enemy could not be handled easily {{was one of the most}} practiced techniques. Other techniques used commonly by the Mongols were completely psychological and were used to entice/lure enemies into vulnerable positions by showing themselves from a hill or some other predetermined locations, then disappearing into the woods or behind hills while the Mongols' flank troops already strategically positioned would appear as if out of nowhere from the left, right and/or from their rear. During the initial states of battlefield contact, while camping in close proximity of their enemies at night, they would feign numerical superiority by ordering each soldier to light at least five fires, which would appear to the enemy scouts and spies that their force was almost five times larger than it actually was.|$|E

500|$|Kinship {{structure}} in the [...] "totok" [...] community follows the patrilineal, patrilocal, and patriarchal traditions of Chinese society, a practice which has lost emphasis in [...] "peranakan" [...] familial relationships. Instead, kinship patterns in indigenized families have incorporated elements of matrilocal, matrilineal, and matrifocal traditions found in Javanese society. Within this community, both sons and daughters can inherit the family fortune, including ancestral tablets and ashes. Political, social, and economic authority in [...] "peranakan" [...] families is more evenly distributed between the two genders than in [...] "totok" [...] families. Kin terms do not distinguish between maternal and paternal relatives, and polygyny is strongly frowned upon. Western influence in [...] "peranakan" [...] society {{is evidenced by the}} high proportion of childless couples.

500|$|On 11 February 1963, the Beatles {{recorded}} ten songs {{during a}} single studio session for their debut LP, Please Please Me. The album was supplemented {{by the four}} tracks already released on their first two singles. Martin originally considered recording the Beatles' debut LP live at The Cavern Club, but after deciding that the building's acoustics were inadequate, he elected to simulate a [...] "live" [...] album with minimal production in [...] "a single marathon session at Abbey Road". After the moderate success of [...] "Love Me Do", the single [...] "Please Please Me" [...] met with a more emphatic reception. Released in January 1963, two months ahead of the album of the same name, the song reached number one on every chart in London except Record Retailer, where it peaked at number two. Recalling how the Beatles [...] "rushed to deliver a debut album, bashing out Please Please Me in a day", AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments, [...] "Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins." [...] Lennon said little thought went into composition at the time; he and McCartney were [...] "just writing songs à la Everly Brothers, à la Buddy Holly, pop songs with no more thought <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>than</b> that – to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Epstein {{managed the}} Beatles from 1962 until his {{untimely}} death in 1967. He had no prior experience managing artists, {{but he had}} a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, [...] "I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me". McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Pete Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would entertain millions of fans until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, [...] "Love Me Do", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, [...] "Twist and Shout". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With few exceptions—one being the album title itself—Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: [...] "We were just writing songs... pop songs with no more thought <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>than</b> that—to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John: [...] "He was like our own little Elvis... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest." ...|$|E

In the 20 states that reported the disease back in 1916, 27,363 cases were counted. New York alone had 9,023 cases, of which 2,448 (28%) resulted in death, and a larger number in paralysis. However, polio did not gain national attention until 1921, when Franklin D. Roosevelt, former vice presidential candidate and soon to be governor of New York, came down with a paralytic illness, diagnosed {{at the time as}} polio. At the age of 39, Roosevelt was left with severe paralysis and spent most of his presidency in a wheelchair.|$|E

2500|$|The {{developmental}} feminist {{perspective is}} {{closely tied to}} the social constructionist perspective. It is specifically interested in how society's gender norms affect adolescent development, especially for girls. For example, some researchers on the topic hold the view that adolescent girls are still strongly affected by gender roles imposed on them by society and that this in turn affects their sexuality and sexual behavior. Deborah Tolman is an advocate for this viewpoint and states that societal pressures to be [...] "good" [...] cause girls {{to pay more attention to}} what they think others expect <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>than</b> looking within themselves to understand their own sexuality. Tolman states that young girls learn to objectify their own bodies and end up thinking of themselves as objects of desire. This causes them to often see their own bodies as others see it, which causes them to feel a sense of detachment from their bodies and their sexualities. Tolman calls this a process of disembodiment. This process leaves young girls unassertive about their own sexual desires and needs because they focus so much on what other people expect of them rather than on what they feel inside.|$|E
