5|$|COPD often occurs {{along with}} a number of other {{conditions}}, due in part to shared risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, lung cancer, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, and depression. In those with severe disease, a feeling <b>of</b> <b>always</b> being tired is common. Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating White Stag {{from any}} other {{leadership}} program for youth is its spirit and traditions, including campfires, ceremonies, skits, yells, cheers, and emblems, all of which give it a distinctive character. These are used to communicate an ethic <b>of</b> <b>always</b> striving for self-improvement and personal achievement, and values that include characteristics of servant leadership, compassion, enthusiasm, kindness, and selflessness.|$|E
5|$|Playtex Products {{continued}} to erode Tampax's' market share throughout the late 20th century. The two companies had divided the market almost evenly {{by the late}} 1990s. Both makers increased profits primarily by reducing the tampon count per box, and prepared to enter emerging markets, particularly in Asia, where many women still used homemade pads. In 1997 Procter & Gamble (P), makers <b>of</b> <b>Always</b> sanitary napkins and pantiliners, bought Tambrands for $1.25 billion, its largest acquisition up to that point, returning to the tampon sector almost two decades after pulling Rely from the market over Toxic Shock Syndrome concerns.|$|E

5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity is {{beautiful}} and true. Living under time's influence is a problem. Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in between life and death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable <b>of</b> <b>always</b> reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E

25|$|In 1794, Lagrange was {{appointed}} professor of the École Polytechnique; and his lectures there, described by mathematicians {{who had the}} good fortune to be able to attend them, were almost perfect both in form and matter. Beginning with the merest elements, he led his hearers on until, almost unknown to themselves, they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject: above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage <b>of</b> <b>always</b> using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation.|$|E
25|$|In Norse mythology, Odin, {{the chief}} god, carried a javelin or spear called Gungnir.

It had the property <b>of</b> <b>always</b> finding its mark ("the spear never stopped in its thrust"). During the final conflict of Ragnarok between the gods and giants, Odin will use Gungnir to attack the wolf Fenrir before being devoured by him.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of its simplicity, Smoluchowski's 1D model can only qualitatively {{describe}} Brownian motion. For a realistic particle undergoing Brownian motion in a fluid many of the assumptions cannot be made. For example, the assumption that on average there occurs an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion. Also, there would be a distribution of different possible ΔVs instead <b>of</b> <b>always</b> just one in a realistic situation.|$|E
25|$|Gummo Marx, {{the fifth}} of the Marx brothers, who quit the act during the family's {{vaudeville}} days and thus never appeared in a Marx Brothers film, was nicknamed by Art Fisher based on his habit <b>of</b> <b>always</b> wearing gumshoes. While all the other performers wore street shoes, and thus made a loud noise when they walked on a hardwood stage, Milton (Gummo) was known for startling people by appearing suddenly from out of nowhere, because the gumshoes on his feet gave him a nearly soundless footfall.|$|E
25|$|Many of our {{important}} source documents, {{such as the}} Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments.

Thiers took his seat as the head of Finance Committee, and leader of the conservative republicans.
