25|$|The {{success of}} Big White Fog in Chicago {{prompted}} Ward to seek wider reaching theatrical success in New York City. He traveled east {{as an actor}} in the chorus of the FTP's 1939 production of The Swing Mikado, and settled in with Wright in Harlem where he was writing for the Communist newspaper, the Daily Worker. Without warning, however, Congress announced that they were shutting down the increasingly incendiary productions of the Federal Theatre Project, and Ward promptly found himself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>job.</b> Determined to continue his theatrical experiments and bolstered by Wright's socialist agenda, Ward began searching for private funding and a New York venue to revive the Big White Fog. After a series of fundraisers and new alliances with New York artists, the play re-opened Off-Broadway in 1940 at Harlem's Lincoln Theatre as the inaugural production of Ward's new collaborative project, the Negro Playwrights Company, a theatrical organization born out of the burgeoning culture of the Harlem Renaissance and featuring such up-and-comers as Wright, Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, Powell Lindsay, and Edna Thomas among others. Although both critics and Ward's contemporaries celebrated the work for its somber realism and politically relevant tone, the general public disapproved of its heavy-handed leftist rhetoric and, as a result, Big White Fog closed after only sixty-four performances, taking the still fledgling Negro Playwrights Company down in its wake.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the 2006 season, Compton was replaced by Marcos Ambrose and returned to the Truck Series, sharing the No. 09 Ford with Joey Clanton for nine races. In 2006, Compton founded Turn One Racing, LLC, as a way of promoting talented young drivers in the southeastern United States. He made a total of fourteen starts that season, ten for Wood Brothers/JTG, as well as one for Key Motorsports and three for Xpress Motorsports. He bought into Bobby Hamilton Racing in 2008, and was named driver of the No. 4 Dodge for the team during the season. After the race at Bristol Motor Speedway the No. 4 team shut down, leaving Compton <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>job.</b> He drove the No. 60 Toyota for Wyler Racing in 2009, finishing with 8 top-tens and finishing 11th in points. Despite the new sponsorship, Jeff Wyler was unsure if the team would continue into 2010, so Compton and Turn One Racing bought the No. 60 from Wyler, though the team continued into 2010 under the Wyler Racing banner. Compton would split the No. 60 Truck with former Formula 1 driver Narain Karthikeyan and Red Bull development driver Cole Whitt, while also changing manufacturers to Chevrolet. Compton later took sole ownership of the team and renamed it Turn One Racing. Compton scored only five top tens and finished 20th in points. Karthikeyan left {{at the end of the}} year to drive for Hispania Racing in F1, while Safe Auto left the team to sponsor ThorSport Racing's No. 13 Truck.|$|E

25|$|Parma's dismal winless run {{extended}} to 8 games as {{they lost to}} Napoli by three goals to one. Parma opened the scoring through Raffaele Palladino, but Napoli hit back with three goals in a second half that yet again saw a Parma player sent off; {{this time it was}} Daniele Galloppa. Parma finally ended their winless streak and boosted their survival chances on 20 March 2011, overcoming fellow relegaton battlers Sampdoria with a solitary goal midway through the second half. The following week, a 2–1 defeat at home to Bari in a match that Parma dominated was enough to see head coach Pasquale Marino lose his job with Parma two points clear of the relegation zone. He was replaced by Franco Colomba, who was signed on a 14-month deal and had been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> since the previous summer, two days later. Colomba's first match in charge, a tricky trip to Rome to face Champions League qualification-chasing Lazio ended in defeat by two goals to nil, a goal coming in each half. On 16 April, national and continental and world champions Internazionale paid a visit to the Tardini, as Parma recorded a historic two-goal victory with goals from Juventus loanees Giovinco and Amauri. The next week, a second consecutive 2–0 win – their first in Udine since 2001 – over ten-man Udinese thanks to two Amauri goals boosted Parma's chances of salvation, but other relegation candidates' result meant the club remained just three points clear of the relegation zone. Parma faced Europe-chasing Palermo on 1 May and recorded yet another win at home. Two early first-half goals saw Parma lead 2–0 before a second half Palermo goal put Parma on edge. Two minutes from time, Antonio Candreva restored Parma's two-goal lead and confirmed Parma's first three-game winning streak of the season. Six points clear of the relegation zone with just three games remaining, Parma looked to have secured their participation in Serie A for the following season. Parma then travelled to meet Bologna in the Emilian Derby the following weekend, with both sides knowing that three points would secure their Serie A status for the season to come. The match ended goalless and results in other matches meant that relegation could not be ruled out at the final whistle, but a late goal in a later game saw Genoa defeat Sampdoria in the Derby della Lanterna, confirming Parma's place in next year's Serie A. Parma celebrated their safety in style in the Stadio Ennio Tardini the week after with a win over injury-hit bitterest rivals Juventus, the only goal of the game coming from the man on loan from Juventus, Sebastian Giovinco, who had scored two goals in the reverse fixture and secured Colomba's fourth win in six games. The season ended in a low-key affair away to Cagliari. Valeri Bojinov opened the scoring for Parma before a Rolf Feltscher own goal levelled the scoreline, as Parma finished the league season in twelfth position.|$|E
500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>job.</b> O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E

40|$|Unions make {{differences}} to employee satisfaction {{that correspond to}} their effects on individual economic advantage. Panel data reveal how changes in economic circumstance and changes in job satisfaction are linked to changes in union coverage. When individuals move into <b>a</b> union covered <b>job</b> they receive <b>a</b> wage mark-up and express enhanced pay satisfaction. Conversely, those moving from <b>a</b> union covered <b>job</b> on average lose any mark-up and have significantly reduced satisfaction. Similar findings emerge for working hours. On average individuals prefer shorter hours, something they tend to (not to) achieve on moving into (<b>out</b> <b>of)</b> <b>a</b> unionized <b>job,</b> resulting in higher (lower) satisfaction. Switching into union coverage lowers satisfaction with job security, even though coverage {{has no effect on}} the risk of unemployment.

30|$|The Burdett and Mortensen (1998) {{model of}} labor predicts that {{steady-state}} wage dispersion occurs {{despite the presence}} of many employers in the market. Wage offers are continuously distributed across all firms; firms offering high wages hire more workers but make lower profits per worker. Search-and-matching frictions create differences in the wage offers that workers receive. Some receive wage offers at the reservation rate, inducing them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> non-employment, while others receive offers higher than current wages, inducing them to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lower-paying <b>job.</b> The labor supply <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firm is determined by the number of recruits it attracts (rising with wage) and the rate of separation (decreasing with wage). The behavior and flow of these separation and recruitment decisions is the most important idea of monopsony theory and informs the empirical analysis—the elasticity of labor supply is determined by the wage elasticity of separation and recruitment.|$|R
