He continued his research into malaria by showing that certain mosquito species (Culex fatigans) transmit malaria to sparrows and he isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands <b>of</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> that had fed on infected birds.

5|$|In Tokelau, many of {{the local}} {{officials}} feared about contamination since the cyclone had scattered human waste, trash, and other debris in the ocean and across the island. There was also an increase <b>of</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> and other insects, increasing {{the threat of a}} dengue fever outbreak. In addition, the storm damaged {{many of the}} hospitals, making treatment of the injured or displaced difficult. Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as emergency plans were not easily understood by the local population. In Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no early warning system. Also, many of the population had little time to prepare for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|In April 1894, a Scottish {{physician}} Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at {{his house}} on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit {{was the start of}} four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands <b>of</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.|$|E
5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because <b>of</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} component of arbovirus surveillance is monitoring the vector for presence of the pathogen. Intervention and preventive programs need early detection of arboviral activity in mosquito populations. In this report, we examine the factors affecting the probability <b>of</b> detection <b>of</b> <b>mosquito</b> infections. Since arbovirus infection rates in mosquito populations are very low, observations <b>of</b> zero-infected <b>mosquito</b> samples are common. Using statistical models, we describe methods to estimate the probability of detection and upper bounds of confidence intervals <b>of</b> <b>mosquito</b> infection rates as measures of confidence for observations of zero infection. Our results show that detection of low levels <b>of</b> <b>mosquito</b> infections requires large samples (greater than 1, 600 individuals) for a high probability (0. 8) of detection. Due to focal transmission of arboviruses, grouping samples over different sampling sites and times is often inappropriate for detection <b>of</b> <b>mosquito</b> infection. We emphasize sample size as a key determinant in detection <b>of</b> <b>mosquito</b> infections and recommend intensified entomologic surveys at sentinel sites to detect arboviral activity. Mosquito-borne arbovirus diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), pose severe threats to public health. For implementation of intervention and pre-vention programs, early detect arbovirus activity in mosquito populations is important. Factors affecting detection of arbo...|$|R
