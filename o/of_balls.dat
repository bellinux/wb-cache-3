40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} all-electric injection molding machines, {{as well as the}} application <b>of</b> clamping <b>ball</b> screw, and elaborates the significance of researching lubrication <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> screw mechanism. The formula for calculating the minimum film thickness <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> screw is induced according to Hamrock-Dowson formula and contact parameters <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> screw mechanism. Using the parameters for a specific ball screw model calculates the minimum film thickness at the screw and ball contact. The lubrication state <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> screw is discussed. It provides a theoretical basis for the rational <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> screw lubrication and proper use...|$|R

25|$|In {{the sport}} <b>of</b> cricket, <b>ball</b> {{tampering}} is an action {{in which a}} fielder illegally alters the condition <b>of</b> the <b>ball.</b> The primary motivation <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> tampering is {{to interfere with the}} aerodynamics <b>of</b> the <b>ball.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{celebrations}} {{following the}} marriage of Catherine’s daughter Marguerite to the Protestant Henry of Navarre in Paris on 18 August 1572, were based on Huguenot themes. The match was controversial because Marguerite was marrying a Huguenot. The pope refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage, and the different faiths of the bridal couple made for an unusual wedding service. After a nuptial lunch, four days <b>of</b> <b>balls,</b> masques and banquets ensued.|$|E

5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched {{for weeks at a}} time.|$|E

5|$|Chanderpaul {{made his}} Test debut in March 1994, {{selected}} as an all-rounder who could bowl leg breaks, against England. He reached his first century three years later, scoring an unbeaten 137 against India at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. During the initial phase of his career, Chanderpaul was criticised for {{his inability to}} convert half-centuries into centuries, but he proved his critics wrong during the 2001–02 series against India when he scored three centuries in five matches, thus earning {{the man of the}} series accolade. During that tournament, he batted for 1,513 minutes between dismissals, a record in Test cricket. Despite being well known for his patient batting, Chanderpaul scored a 69-ball century against Australia in 2003, which at the time was the third fastest century in terms <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> faced. His highest score in Test cricket is 203 not out, a total he achieved twice, first against South Africa in 2005, and then against Bangladesh in 2012. He has scored centuries against every Test playing nation with the exception of Sri Lanka, and has scored seven centuries against India, more than any other team.|$|E
5|$|The {{first player}} {{to score a}} century in the tournament was Pakistan's Moin-ul-Atiq, who made 105 against Bangladesh in the third edition (1988). In the same match, his team mate Ijaz Ahmed scored 124 not out. India's Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar were the lone centurions of the 1990 and 1995 tournaments, respectively. The 2008 edition saw 13 centuries—the highest for a tournament—while no centuries were made in 1986 and 1988. Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya holds the record for most number of centuries, with six, {{followed}} by his compatriot Kumar Sangakkara, who has made four. Virat Kohli (India) and Shoaib Malik (Pakistan) follow these two with three centuries each. Sangakkara's three centuries in the 2008 tournament is a record for a single edition. Pakistani batsman Shahid Afridi made two centuries in the 2010 edition while playing as a captain, {{the most in the}} tournament history. His second century, which came against Bangladesh when he made 124 at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, is the fastest in terms <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> faced in Asia cup matches. Kohli's 183 against Pakistan in 2012 is the highest individual score as of 2014. Lahiru Thirimanne's (Sri Lanka) 108 against Pakistan in the final of the 2014 edition is the most recent century.|$|E
5|$|Warner {{made his}} Test debut against New Zealand in December 2011, and scored his first {{century in the}} second match of the series when he made 123 not out. He carried the bat in the fourth innings of the match, which Australia lost by seven runs. He {{followed}} that with a 69-ball century in the third match of home series against India in January 2012. It was the joint-fourth fastest in terms <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> faced at the time, and remains the fastest century by an opener in Tests. In November 2015, Warner made 163 and 116 in a match against New Zealand, and became the third batsmen in Test cricket to score centuries in both innings of a Test match on three occasions. In the next game at the WACA Ground in Perth, he scored 253, which remains his highest score in the format. In January 2017, while playing against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground, he became the fifth cricketer to score a century before lunch {{on the first day}} of the Test match and the first to do so in Australia. , he has twenty centuries in the format, with four centuries each against India, New Zealand and South Africa.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Current ceramic {{is used as}} the {{material}} for high speed ball bearing for its low density and lubricant performance; however the most common material for the high speed ball screw is chromium-molybdenum steel rather than the ceramic. Following the hertz contact and raceway control theory <b>of</b> the <b>ball</b> screw and considering the centrifugal force and gyroscopic moment acting on the ball screw, the dynamic model <b>of</b> high-speed <b>ball</b> screw was set up. The effects of different types <b>of</b> working ceramic <b>ball</b> chains on the mechanical properties <b>of</b> the <b>ball</b> screw were studied and compared through multi-body dynamic simulation. The result has shown that these factors affect the dynamic characteristic <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> screw dramatically, and the dynamic characteristic <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> screw at high speed is greatly different from that <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> screw made by chromium-molybdenum steel...|$|R

5|$|The next day, England resumed {{hoping for}} more of what {{happened}} on the opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people squashed in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were in a good position, they hoped that time would not be lost to rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred at a number <b>of</b> <b>balls.</b> As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield Denis Compton and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, {{it was not until the}} 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser then glanced a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{the purpose}} of {{altering}} the state <b>of</b> the <b>ball</b> is to achieve more favourable bowling conditions. Examples <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> tampering would include a fielder applying a substance, such as lip balm or sweetened saliva, to shine one side <b>of</b> the <b>ball</b> or pick the seam <b>of</b> the <b>ball</b> to encourage more swing. Conversely, roughening one side <b>of</b> the <b>ball</b> by use <b>of</b> an abrasive or cutting surface (such as boot spikes or bottle caps) is also ball tampering.|$|R

40|$|Ball {{bearings}} {{have been}} used to support rotating shafts in machines such as wind turbines, aircraft engines, and desktop computer fans. There has been extensive research in the areas of condition monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> bearings. As the identification <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> bearing defects by inspection interrupts the operation of rotating machines and can be costly, the assessment of the health <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> bearings relies on the use of condition monitoring techniques. Fault detection and life prediction methods have been developed to improve condition-based maintenance and product qualification. However, intermittent and catastrophic system failures due to bearing problems still occur resulting in loss of life and increase of maintenance and warranty costs. Inaccurate life prediction <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> bearings is <b>of</b> concern to industry. This research focuses on prognostics <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> bearings based on vibration and acoustic emission analysis to provide early warning of failure and predict life in advance. The failure mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> bearings in cooling fans are identified and failure precursors associated with the defects are determined. A prognostic method based on Bayesian Monte Carlo method and sequential probability ratio test is developed to predict time-to-failure <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> bearings in advance. A benchmark study is presented to demonstrate the application of the developed prognostic method to desktop computer fans. The prognostic method developed in this research can be extended as a general method to predict life of a component or system...|$|R
