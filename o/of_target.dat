The final letter is usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting the musculoskeletal system ever received an INN.

We are {{particularly interested in the}} cases in which the probability distribution of the number <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> is not necessarily Poisson. We will show that the Poisson assumption on the number <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> as well as the number of false alarms is not only sufficient but also necessary for the commonly used standard multiplicative hypothesis evaluation formula.

The target track algorithm predicts {{a belief in the}} position and pose for a set <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> and an automatic target recognition algorithm uses the pose estimate to calculate an accumulated target-belief classification confidence measure.

One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy {{for the purposes of the}} treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share <b>of</b> <b>target</b> ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E

40|$|Therapeutic {{doses of}} {{radiation}} can be selectively {{directed to the}} bone marrow either directly using vectors that bind to myeloid and/or lymphoid specific antigens or indirectly by targeting bone matrix. The combination <b>of</b> an accessible <b>target</b> tissue and relatively radiation sensitive malignant cells favours the use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> radiotherapy {{in the treatment of}} haematopoietic malignancies. Dose escalation <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> radiation can increase tumour cell destruction and has led to the use of myelosuppressive and possibly myeloablative doses <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> radiation. A natural development has been the use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> radiation in conditioning prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Several groups are actively exploring the use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> radiotherapy in the context of HSCT as treatment for haematological malignancies. Although no randomised trials using targeted radiotherapy in HSCT have been published, phase I and II trials have shown very encouraging results stimulating further clinical research in this field.

The M20 combination mount had 20Â° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Targeted therapies {{have become}} {{important}} treatment options for cancer care in many countries. This study aimed to examine recent trends in utilization of antineoplastic drugs, particularly the use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> therapies {{for treatment of}} cancer, by geographic region in Taiwan (northern, midwestern, southern, and eastern regions and the outer islands). Methods This was a retrospective observational study of antineoplastic agents using 2009 - 2012 quarterly claims data from Taiwanâ€™s National Health Insurance Research Database. Yearly market shares by prescription volume and costs for targeted therapies among total antineoplastic agents by region were estimated. We used multivariate regression model and ANOVA to examine variations in utilization <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> therapies between geographic regions and used ARIMA models to estimate longitudinal trends. Results Population-adjusted use and costs of antineoplastic drugs (including targeted therapies) were highest in the southern region of Taiwan and lowest in the outer islands. We found a 4 -fold difference in use of antineoplastic drugs and a 49 -fold difference in use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> therapies between regions if the outer islands were included. There were minimal differences in use of antineoplastic drugs between other regions with about a 2 -fold difference in use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> therapies. Without considering the outer islands, the market share by prescription volume and costs <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> therapies increased almost 2 -fold (1. 84 - 1. 90) and 1. 5 -fold (1. 26 - 1. 61) respectively between 2009 and 2012. Furthermore, region was not significantly associated with use of antineoplastic agents or use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> therapies after adjusting for confounders. Region was associated with costs of antineoplastic agents {{but it was not}} associated with costs <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> therapies after confounding adjustments. Conclusions Use of antineoplastic drugs overall and use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> therapies for treatment of cancer varied somewhat between regions in Taiwan; use was notably low in the outer islands. Strategies might be needed to ensure access to cancer care in each region as economic burden of cancer care increase due to growing use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> therapies...|$|R

40|$|The Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) and Cardinalized PHD (CPHD) {{filters are}} popular {{solutions}} to the multi-target tracking problem due to their low complexity and ability to estimate the number and states <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> in cluttered environments. The PHD filter propagates the first-order moment (i. e. mean) of the number <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> while the CPHD propagates the cardinality distribution in the number <b>of</b> <b>targets,</b> albeit for a greater computational cost. Introducing the Panjer point process, this paper proposes a second-order PHD filter, propagating the second-order moment (i. e. variance) of the number <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> alongside its mean. The resulting algorithm is more versatile in the modelling choices than the PHD filter, and its computational cost is significantly lower compared to the CPHD filter. The paper compares the three filters in statistical simulations which demonstrate that the proposed filter reacts more quickly {{to changes in the}} number <b>of</b> <b>targets,</b> i. e., target births and target deaths, than the CPHD filter.
