500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents {{confirms}} the suspicion widely expressed in circles of Latin American literature that North Americans {{choose not to}} differentiate between political and economic exile. Alvarez pointedly demonstrates the North American tendency to undervalue cultural diversity by highlighting instances of American ignorance toward distinctions between different Hispanic-Caribbean groups. The García girls are quite conflicted upon their arrival in the United States as they find that distinct cultural groups are lumped together under one broad [...] "immigrant" [...] category and newcomers are encouraged to assimilate silently to the American norm. Yolanda’s conflict with her father regarding the potentially controversial speech she has prepared for the Teacher’s Day Address provides {{a classic example of}} {{the manner in which the}} García girls are pressured to conform to the norm. Yolanda feels as though she has sacrificed her principles and sold out to the hyper-sensitive authorities when her father forces her to discard her empowering, rebellious achievement of artistic self-expression for [...] "two brief pages of stale compliments and the polite commonplaces <b>on</b> <b>teachers.</b> A speech wrought by necessity and without much invention". Julie Barak affirms that [...] "although this incident is in many ways a defeat for both Yolanda and her mother, it does teach them the lesson of conformity that is so important to living peacefully in America. Yolanda learns to fit in, to do the expected". The girls go on to attend the best schools, lose their Spanish accents and acquire the same psychological disorders as their upper-class American counterparts. Sandra battles anorexia, Carla and Yolanda both have failed marriages, Yolanda and Sandra are both institutionalized for psychiatric issues at one time or another, and Sofía is impregnated out of wedlock.|$|E

2500|$|Standardized testing {{places a}} lot of stress and {{pressure}} on children and teachers. Teachers are put under {{a lot of}} stress because the better students do on the test the more federal funding that school and district will receive. This causes teachers to teach to the test rather than teach to the life skills children will [...] use and need. In some cases, schools have shortened or removed recess so that more time can be spent preparing and practicing for the standardized tests. The pressure of this and the removal of a stress outlet, recess, means that children, along with teachers, are going to become depressed and sleep-deprived. Being depressed and sleep-deprived causes children to act out more than usual which places more stress on the teachers. Teachers do not get the results back {{until the end of the}} summer which means they will not be able to use those results to help those children because they will already be on to the next grade. Standardized tests place an unnecessary amount of stress <b>on</b> <b>teachers</b> and students without yielding any information in a timely manner.|$|E
