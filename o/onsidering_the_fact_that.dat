Our results provide support for all four explanations of coresidence behavior but especially for the life cycle and dynasty models (both of which assume selfishly motivated parents) and social norms and traditions: <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> parents who were self-employed before retirement are more likely to live with their children, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> parents are less likely to live with sons who adopt their wife’s surname, and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> parents are more likely to live with daughters whose husbands adopt their surname constitute evidence in favor of the dynasty model. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> parents who were (relatively wealthy) executives before retirement and parents who are homeowners are more likely to live with their children and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> parents are more likely to live with less educated children constitute evidence in favor of the selfish life cycle model (or the altruism model).
