5|$|In Hindu philosophy, yoga is {{the name}} of one of the six {{orthodox}} (which accept the testimony of Vedas) philosophical schools. Karel Werner, author <b>of</b> <b>Yoga</b> And Indian Philosophy, believes that the process of systematization <b>of</b> <b>yoga</b> which began in the middle and Yoga Upanishads culminated with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.|$|E
5|$|Pre-{{philosophical}} speculations <b>of</b> <b>yoga</b> {{begin to}} emerge in the texts of c. 500–200 BCE. Between 200 BCE–500 CE philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system <b>of</b> <b>yoga</b> began to emerge. The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions <b>of</b> <b>yoga.</b> Yoga {{came to the attention of}} an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy.|$|E
5000|$|The Bhagavadgita may {{be treated}} as a great {{synthesis}} of the ideas of the impersonal spiritual monism with personalistic monotheism, <b>of</b> the <b>yoga</b> <b>of</b> action with the <b>yoga</b> <b>of</b> transcendence of action, and these again with <b>yogas</b> <b>of</b> devotion and knowledge.|$|R
25|$|Later {{developments}} in Hind meditation include the compilation <b>of</b> Hatha <b>Yoga</b> (forceful yoga) compendiums like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the development <b>of</b> Bhakti <b>yoga</b> {{as a major}} form of meditation and Tantra.

5|$|The Mantra yoga is {{stated by}} the Yogatattva as a {{discipline}} of auditory recitation of mantras but stated to be an inferior form <b>of</b> <b>yoga.</b> It is the practice of mantra recitation or intonations of the sounds of alphabet, for 12 years. This gradually brings knowledge and special powers of inner attenuation, asserts the text. This mantra-based method <b>of</b> <b>yoga,</b> asserts Yogatattva, is suited for those with dull wit and incapable of practicing the other three types <b>of</b> <b>yoga.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chapter 5 of the Varaha Upanishad is {{dedicated}} to Yoga, as a discussion between Ribhu and his student Nidagha. There are three types <b>of</b> <b>Yoga,</b> states the text, and these are Laya (soft), Mantra (mystic), and Hatha (middle), recommending Hatha Yoga as foremost of three. It discusses various aspects <b>of</b> <b>Yoga,</b> ranging from recommending that healthy food should be eaten in temperate quantities, in small portions, several times a day, to recommending that Yoga should not be performed when one is not feeling well or is very hungry. The goal <b>of</b> <b>Yoga,</b> states Varaha, is manifold, including the gain of body strength and suppleness, acquisition of knowledge of one's own body and its auras, meditation, and Self (soul) knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Description of {{an early}} form <b>of</b> <b>yoga</b> called nirodhayoga (yoga of cessation) is {{contained}} in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter (Shanti Parva) of the Mahabharata. The verses of the section are dated to c. 300–200 BCE. Nirodhayoga emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts, sensations etc. until purusha (Self) is realized. Terms like vichara (subtle reflection), viveka (discrimination) and others which are similar to Patanjali's terminology are mentioned, but not described. There is no uniform goal <b>of</b> <b>yoga</b> mentioned in the Mahabharata. Separation of self from matter, perceiving Brahman everywhere, entering into Brahman etc. are all described as goals <b>of</b> <b>yoga.</b> Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe them as being identical. Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation.|$|E
