25|$|The {{author of}} The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album is Matt Groening, {{the creator of}} the {{animated}} series The Simpsons on which the book is based. It was released by Harper Paperbacks on November 20, 1991. The book's cover, which features the character Bart Simpson lying naked on his stomach on a bearskin rug, is a reference to a 1972 centerfold of Cosmopolitan in which American actor Burt Reynolds posed naked in a similar way. Newer printings feature Homer naked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug.</b>|$|E
25|$|King's addictions {{to alcohol}} and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he {{acknowledged}} in On Writing in 2000, he can barely remember writing Cujo. Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> {{in front of him}} evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.|$|E
25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, static friction does no work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box {{in the same direction}} that the box moves, doing positive work.|$|E

2500|$|Lhasa {{contains}} several businesses of note. Lhasa Carpet Factory, [...] {{a factory}} south of Yanhe Dong Lu near the Tibet University, produces traditional Tibetan rugs that are exported worldwide. It {{is a modern}} factory, the largest manufacturer of rugs throughout Tibet, employing some 300 workers. Traditionally Tibetan women were the weavers, and men the spinners, but both work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rugs</b> today.|$|R
500|$|At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the rug in Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, he bent down and picked it up from where it lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E
500|$|Though Whistler himself resented {{attempts}} to analyse {{the meaning of}} his art, this has not deterred later critics from doing so. The 19th-century French art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary saw in the painting symbols of lost innocence, a theme that has been picked up by later critics. Art historian Wayne Craven also sees the painting {{as more than a}} formalist exercise, and finds [...] "enigmatic, expressive and even erotic undercurrents" [...] in the image. He points to the contrasts presented by the imagery, with the white lily representing innocence and virginity, and the fierce animal head <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> symbolising the loss of innocence. Beryl Schlossman, coming from the perspective of literary criticism, sees allusions to the Madonna of religious art in the work. To Schlossman, the rug under the woman's feet is the cloud on which the Virgin is often seen standing, and the bear is the serpent, crushed under her heel.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of August 16, 1977, Presley was {{scheduled}} to fly out of Memphis to begin another tour. That afternoon, Ginger Alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on his bathroom floor. According to her eyewitness account, [...] "Elvis looked as if his entire body had completely frozen in a seated position while using the toilet and then had fallen forward, in that fixed position, {{directly in front of}} it. [...] It was clear that, from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor, Elvis hadn't moved." [...] Joel Williamson writes: [...] "For some reason— perhaps involving a reaction to the codeine and attempts to move his bowels— he experienced pain and fright while sitting on the toilet. Alarmed, he stood up, dropped the book he was reading, stumbled forward, and fell face down in the fetal position. He struggled weakly and drooled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug.</b> Unable to breathe, he died." [...] Attempts to revive him failed, and death was officially pronounced at 3:30p.m. at Baptist Memorial Hospital.|$|E

Nobody will want lamb and green peas after this splendid pow-wow,' said Mrs Jo, {{surveying}} the picturesque confusion of the long hall, where people lay about <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rugs,</b> all more or less bedecked with feathers, moccasins, or beads.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} tools {{may be used to}} shear <b>the</b> wool depending <b>on</b> how <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> is trimmed as the weaving progresses or when <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> is complete. Often in Chinese <b>rugs</b> <b>the</b> yarn is trimmed after completion and the trimming is slanted where the color changes, giving an embossed three-dimensional effect.|$|R
2500|$|After {{escaping}} the musketeers, Don Quixote and Sancho ride {{to a nearby}} inn. Once again, Don Quixote imagines the inn is a castle, although Sancho is not quite convinced. Don Quixote is given a bed in a former hayloft, and Sancho sleeps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> next to the bed; they share the loft with a muleteer. When night comes, Don Quixote imagines the servant girl at the inn, Helen, to be a beautiful princess, and makes her sit on his bed with him, scaring her. Seeing what is happening, the muleteer attacks Don Quixote, breaking the fragile bed and leading to a large and chaotic fight in which Don Quixote and Sancho are once again badly hurt. Don Quixote's explanation for everything is that they fought with an enchanted Moor. He also believes that he can cure their wounds with a mixture he calls [...] "the balm of Firearbras", which only makes them sick. Don Quixote and Sancho decide to leave the inn, but Quixote, following {{the example of the}} fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho, however, remains and ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed up in the air (blanketed) by several mischievous guests at the inn, something that is often mentioned over the rest of the novel. After his release, he and Don Quixote continue their travels.|$|E
2500|$|By September 1949, the {{memorial}} was still [...] "nowhere near finished." [...] None {{of the tower}} rooms in floors three through nine were finished, although the observation deck was under construction. The Scottish Rite agreed to fund the observation deck. The observation deck was accessible only by a circular stairway. In late 1949, the Cryptic Lodge Room (also known as the [...] "North Room") was finished and the two elevators were installed on {{the north and south}} side of the building. The room contained seating for 450 and an organ (which was used for the first time during the room's dedication ceremony). To avoid piercing the second floor's memorial hall, the elevators slanted inward at 7.5 degrees. They were [...] apart on the first floor, but only [...] apart at the observation deck. They were the only slanting elevators in the world when installed, and the motors for them had to be passed up through the shafts in order to get them to the roof. Other decorative changes were made by late 1949 as well. [...] A woven Persian carpet, the largest in the world and worth $1 million, was donated to {{the memorial}} by Sarkis Nahigian (a Masonic member from Chicago). (It was installed in the Alexandria-Washington Replica Lodge Room. [...] But it had to be folded in order to fit in the room, which caused wear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug.</b> [...] The rug was removed after several years and reinstalled in the memorial hall on the second floor.) In the Memorial Hall, two stained glass windows designed and manufactured by Robert M. Metcalf were being installed. Bronze doors, grillwork, and window sashes had been installed throughout the first floor, the first floor assembly hall was completed, the kitchen and dining room were finished, the north and south corridors on the first floor were completed, and an addition to the heating plant installed. The [...] "Hall of Presidents" [...] was also finished. [...] This walkway on the upper level of the auditorium contained plaques depicting Presidents of the United States who were Masons. The Shriners, too, completed their rooms on the first floor.|$|E

50|$|Due to its {{geographical}} position, Transylvania {{has been}} an important trade center between East and West during the 15th-17th century. Pile woven carpets from Anatolian manufacturers were part of the merchandise, and were traded in large numbers. Anatolian carpets were also appreciated as objects of high value and prestige, and collected as such by Transylvanian municipalities and individual persons. Inscriptions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rugs</b> and church records prove that rugs and carpets were donated as decorative wall and pew furnishings to Protestant churches. By their preservation in Christian churches, <b>the</b> <b>rugs</b> were protected from wear and the changes of history, and often remain in excellent condition today.|$|R
