40|$|Below {{replacement}} level {{fertility rates}} in Italy have received much attention, with varying explanations offered for the protracted decline in fertility rates since the early 1970 s. For a more complete understanding <b>of</b> Italian <b>fertility,</b> an analysis <b>of</b> historical <b>fertility</b> trends is useful. This paper employs Italian regional fertility data generated by the Princeton European Fertility Project to evaluate regional patterns <b>of</b> Italian <b>fertility</b> from 1864 to 1951. Regional fertility trends, both temporal and spatial, are described and basic regional convergence methods are applied. The {{results show that the}} regional fertility variation seen in Italy since World War II was well established in the 19 th century and that a lack of convergence <b>of</b> regional <b>fertility</b> rates during the years of the demographic transition in Italy (late 1800 s) helped emphasize regional differences. The impacts of experiences such as political unification, industrialization, the completion of the demographic transition, and mass emigration are cited as important clues to the change and persistence <b>of</b> regional <b>fertility</b> identities during this time period. This use of a rich historical data set placed in a geographic context not only helps illuminate the past, but also assists in the explanation of patterns <b>of</b> regional <b>fertility</b> seen in today?s Italy. ...|$|R

5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> and youth. An {{evolutionary}} biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E

A few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result of hybrid speciation, including important crop plants such as wheat, where the number of chromosomes has been doubled.|$|E
