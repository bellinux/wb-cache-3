5|$|After halftime, the Hokies {{threatened}} Miami for {{the first}} time all game. Virginia Tech mounted an 80-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown, cutting Miami's lead to 14–10. But the Hurricanes' defense clamped down on any further offensive attempts by Virginia Tech and denied the Hokies more points. Miami added twofield goals: one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter that finally put the game out <b>of</b> <b>reach</b> for Virginia Tech. Miami earned the win, 20–10. Miami's win was its first bowl victory since the 1966 Liberty Bowl, which also featured a Hurricanes victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out <b>of</b> <b>reach,</b> as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

5|$|Halo: First Strike {{opens with}} the arrival of the Covenant armada at the human stronghold planet <b>of</b> <b>Reach.</b> The book follows both the {{unsuccessful}} attempt to defend Reach by the SPARTAN-IIs who were on the planet's surface and the adventures of the rag-tag survivors of the battle at Alpha Halo. The book also reveals that humanity's worst fear is going to come true: the Covenant is on its way to Earth. The book was well received by critics and sold well, making The New York Times Best Seller list. Critics found it added depth to the Halo video games and that it was exciting throughout.|$|E
5|$|Halo: The Fall <b>of</b> <b>Reach</b> is a {{military}} science fiction novel by Eric Nylund, based on the Halo series of video games, and acts as a prequel to , the first game in the series.

5|$|Halo: The Flood {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2552. Humanity has colonized {{hundreds}} of worlds across the galaxy, using faster-than-light drives and cryonic sleep to travel between worlds. Without warning, a collective of alien races known as the Covenant began attacking the outlying colonies, brutally exterminating all life by vitrifying the surface of the planets. Humanity, outnumbered and outclassed by the alien's superior technology, wages a losing war against the enemy. After the human bastion <b>of</b> <b>Reach</b> falls to the Covenant, the human ship Pillar of Autumn jumps into Slipspace to lead the Covenant away from Earth.|$|E

5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall <b>of</b> <b>Reach</b> and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are out <b>of</b> <b>reach</b> {{of many of the}} world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.|$|E

5|$|The Cunard White Star Line's RMS Queen Elizabeth {{was named}} after her. She {{launched}} the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it slid out <b>of</b> <b>reach.</b> In 1954, Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.|$|E
5|$|The Fall <b>of</b> <b>Reach</b> {{takes place}} in the Halo {{universe}} and spans several decades, beginning in 2517 describing events up to 2552. In the Halo universe, traveling faster than the speed of light is possible through slipspace, another dimension where special relativity does not apply. This has allowed humans to colonize hundreds of other planets which are controlled by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). Feeling repressed by the UNSC's heavy-handed rule, some colonies revolt; fearing rebellion will tear the UNSC apart, military leaders approve the SPARTAN Project, a secret squad of super soldiers to quietly suppress rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{struggled}} back in {{the third}} quarter, scoring six unanswered points to close the score to 3516. In the fourth quarter, however, Tennessee answered Virginia Tech's effort with 10points, putting the game out <b>of</b> <b>reach</b> for the Hokies, who managed only a single touchdown in the fourth quarter. The Hokies fumbled the ball five times—losing it once—and threw twointerceptions, allowing Tennessee to cruise to an easy victory, 4523. Tennessee running back James Stewart was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Platine War did {{not bring}} a halt to {{conflict}} in the region. Peace remained out <b>of</b> <b>reach</b> in Uruguay, which remained unstable and {{in a state of}} constant crisis due to continuing internecine strife between the Blancos and Colorados.

5|$|The novel {{begins in}} orbit above planet Reach, as {{humanity}} fights the Covenant invasion forces. The {{last line of}} defense for the planet is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans to the surface <b>of</b> <b>Reach</b> to protect the MAC's planet-based power generators. Ultimately, the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr. Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners. Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces, but also traps them deep under the surface <b>of</b> <b>Reach.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} The Fall <b>of</b> <b>Reach</b> is the Spartan soldier Master Chief.
