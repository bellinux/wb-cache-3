40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the {{implementation}} of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) in the Czech Republic. Trading in CO 2 emission allowances {{is one of the most}} dynamic and progressive economic instruments of environmental policy. Since coming into force in January 2005, the system has incorporated into company decision making a truly new phenomenon – the price of carbon in the form of allowances tradable on the European market, where the price of the allowance represents the costs of a company when emitting one ton of CO 2. The incentive, given by the opportunity costs should motivate <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations</b> emitting CO 2 to analyze options for carbon emission reduction and to behave rationally. In total, the system should result in a quite significant reduction in the compliance costs of CO 2 reduction when compared to alternatives such as taxes or emission limits, as a result of flexibility given by the market. The most controversial and sensitive part of the system is the initial distribution of the allowances to emitters. The so-called National Allocation Plan has to provide answers to very difficult questions – to whom, how and how many allowances will be given. This paper focuses on a detailed description of the sectors and companies in the Czech Republic that are affected by the system and discusses various aspects of the scheme...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of causes for human errors reveals that deficiencies in organization and management often provide an environment making errors more likely. There is also a considerable difference between the operational performance of similar industrial plants. A closer {{analysis of}}ten reveals that the differences {{can be attributed to}} the managing practices. Accepting organization and management as one important precursor for operational safety, the aim is to identify good managerial structures and practices as well as characteristics of unsafe operational practices. Such information can provide guidance for the <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> the <b>installations</b> and also support regulatory agencies. The ultimate aim should be to detect and correct organizational deficiencies before an incident or accident brings them into the open. It is therefore not sufficient to blame individuals nor training, because management and organization establishes priorities, structures, and practices that enable tasks to be accomplished. A consultants' meeting organized jointly by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) was held in Laxenburg and Vienna, Austria on 18 - 22 March 1991. The objective of the meeting was to assess the extent to which research within the management sciences -can provide guidance for the practical problems of managing organizations, where safety is the major concern. The influence of organization and management on the safety <b>of</b> complex industrial <b>installations</b> was discussed during the meeting and the exchange of ideas and experience between different industrial sectors and the academia proved fruitful. In spite of the difference among national and company practices it is still expected that there are many possibilities for an exchange of good managerial knowledge, experience, and practices. The report collects both the contributions offered by members of the Expert Task Force and the findings of the discussions that took place during the meeting. Specific reference is in the following text made to the nuclear industry with the understanding that the issues have a wider application to chemical plants, off-shore installations or more generally to industries where safety is a major concern...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the integrated FlexMoT data management and visualization software system for marine sensor data. Unlike most existing solutions this software platform {{is designed to}} be neither data-centric nor visualization-centric, but seamlessly integrating both, management and visualization of measurement data. Within the project FlexMoT (Flexible Monitoring Tool) a modular, easy-to-use and fast deployable environmental monitoring solution with a high temporal and depth resolution for underwater environments has been developed. This monitoring system was designed for the use in the underwater surrounding <b>of</b> offshore <b>installations</b> like oil rigs or gas production platforms and other critical and sensitive marine environments. It enables the exact measurement of concentration of dissolved gases such as methane in water and other environmental parameters that may be indicators of leakages. The FlexMoT software stack offers situational awareness and advanced decision support in environmental monitoring by organizing, preparing and presenting the gathered sensor data in a way that (1) <b>operator</b> personnel <b>of</b> offshore <b>installations</b> and marine researchers can draw the right conclusions and (2) appropriate actions can be initiated swiftly and well-informed. Similar to the modular hardware approach, the software uses a plugin approach to foster the simple reconfiguration to different use-cases. The designed visualization system utilizes human perception to transform lots of data quickly and intuitively into helpful information, to draw attention to critical events or striking data and support explorative data analysis with interactive displays. The implemented visualization solution combines recent webtechnologies and linked interactive 2 D and 3 D data presentations utilizing a direct-touch interaction metaphor. In this paper, we present the complete software stack of FlexMoT for data management, operational near real-time monitoring, visual data analytics of marine environmental data and visual forecast of gas leakage situations. It is proposed as a universal approach to improve visualization-based work with heterogeneous sensor data in environmental monitoring and marine research...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} {{integrating}} a heat storage into a geothermal district heating {{system has been}} investigated. The behaviour of the system under a novel operational strategy has been simulated focusing on the energetic, economic and environmental effects of the new strategy of incorporation of the heat storage within the system. A typical geothermal district heating system consists of several production wells, a system of pipelines for the transportation of the hot water to end-users, one or more re-injection wells and peak-up devices (usually fossil-fuel boilers). Traditionally in these systems, the production wells change their production rate throughout the day according to heat demand, and if their maximum capacity is exceeded the peak-up devices are used to meet {{the balance of the}} heat demand. In this study, it is proposed to maintain a constant geothermal production and add heat storage into the network. Subsequently, hot water will be stored when heat demand is lower than the production and the stored hot water will be released into the system to cover the peak demands (or part of these). It is not intended to totally phase-out the peak-up devices, but to decrease their use, as these will often be installed anyway for back-up purposes. Both the integration of a heat storage in such a system as well as the novel operational strategy are the main novelties of this thesis. A robust algorithm for the sizing of these systems has been developed. The main inputs are the geothermal production data, the heat demand data throughout one year or more and the topology <b>of</b> the <b>installation.</b> The outputs are the sizing of the whole system, including the necessary number of production wells, the size of the heat storage and the dimensions of the pipelines amongst others. The results provide several useful insights into the initial design considerations for these systems, emphasizing particularly the importance of heat losses. Simulations are carried out for three different cases of sizing <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> (small, medium and large) to examine the influence of system scale. In the second phase of work, two algorithms are developed which study in detail the operation <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> throughout a random day and a whole year, respectively. The first algorithm can be a potentially powerful tool for the <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> the <b>installation,</b> who can know a priori how to operate the installation on a random day given the heat demand. The second algorithm is used to obtain the amount of electricity used by the pumps as well as the amount of fuel used by the peak-up boilers over a whole year. These comprise the main operational costs <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> and are among the main inputs of the third part of the study. In the third part of the study, an integrated energetic, economic and environmental analysis <b>of</b> the studied <b>installation</b> is carried out together with a comparison with the traditional case. The results show that by implementing heat storage under the novel operational strategy, heat is generated more cheaply as all the financial indices improve, more geothermal energy is utilised and less fuel is used in the peak-up boilers, with subsequent environmental benefits, when compared to the traditional case. Furthermore, it is shown that the most attractive case of sizing is the large one, although the addition of the heat storage most greatly impacts the medium case of sizing. In other words, the geothermal component <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> should be sized as large as possible. This analysis indicates that the proposed solution is beneficial from energetic, economic, and environmental perspectives. Therefore, it can be stated that the aim of this study is achieved in its full potential. Furthermore, the new models for the sizing, operation and economic/energetic/environmental analyses of these kind of systems can be used with few adaptations for real cases, making the practical applicability of this study evident. Having this study as a starting point, further work could include the integration of these systems with end-user demands, further analysis of component parts <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> (such as the heat exchangers) and the integration of a heat pump to maximise utilisation of geothermal energy...|$|R
