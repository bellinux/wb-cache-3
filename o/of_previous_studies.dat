500|$|During six flybys of Titan from 2006 to 2011, Cassini {{gathered}} radiometric {{tracking and}} optical navigation data from which investigators could roughly infer Titan's changing shape. The density of Titan {{is consistent with}} a body that is about 60% rock and 40% water. The team's analyses suggest that Titan's surface can rise and fall by up to 10 metres during each orbit. That degree of warping suggests that Titan's interior is relatively deformable, and that the most likely model of Titan is one in which an icy shell dozens of kilometres thick floats atop a global ocean. The team's findings, together with the results <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> hint that Titan's ocean may lie no more than [...] below its surface. On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be as salty as the Dead Sea. On September 3, 2014, NASA reported studies suggesting methane rainfall on Titan may interact with a layer of icy materials underground, called an [...] "alkanofer," [...] to produce ethane and propane that may eventually feed into rivers and lakes.|$|E

500|$|During the {{rediscovery of}} Mendelian {{inheritance}} {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, HD was used tentatively as an example of autosomal dominant inheritance. The English biologist William Bateson used the pedigrees of affected families to establish that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The strong inheritance pattern prompted several researchers, including Smith Ely Jelliffe, to attempt to trace and connect family members <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> Jelliffe collected information from across New York and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in New England. Jelliffe's research roused the interest of his college friend, Charles Davenport, who commissioned Elizabeth Muncey to produce the first field study on the East Coast of the United States of families with HD and to construct their pedigrees. Davenport used this information to document the variable age of onset and range of symptoms of HD; he claimed that most cases of HD in the USA could be traced back to a handful of individuals. This research was further embellished in 1932 by P. R. Vessie, who popularized the idea that three brothers who left England in 1630 bound for Boston were the progenitors of HD in the USA. The claim that the earliest progenitors had been established and eugenic bias of Muncey's, Davenport's, and Vessie's work contributed to misunderstandings and prejudice about HD. Muncey and Davenport also popularized the idea that in the past some HD sufferers may have been thought to be possessed by spirits or victims of witchcraft, and were sometimes shunned or exiled by society. This idea has not been proven. [...] Researchers have found contrary evidence; for instance, the community of the family studied by George Huntington openly accommodated those who exhibited symptoms of HD.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{published}} in 2012 that performed genomic sampling on 300 work horses from local areas {{as well as a}} review <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> of archaeology, mitochondrial DNA, and Y-DNA suggested that horses were originally domesticated {{in the western part of}} the Eurasian steppe. [...] Both domesticated stallions and mares spread out from this area, and then additional wild mares were added from local herds; wild mares were easier to handle than wild stallions. [...] Most other parts of the world were ruled out as sites for horse domestication, either due to climate unsuitable for an indigenous wild horse population or no evidence of domestication.|$|E

Note that these results were gathered using finger movements, and may not necessarily generalize to other actions such as thinking, or even other motor actions in different situations. Indeed, the human act of planning has implications for free will and so this ability must also be explained by any theories of unconscious decision making. Philosopher Alfred Mele also doubts the conclusions of these studies.

30|$|Graduate {{credit hours}} earned were {{predicted}} by all three Korean proficiency indicators: the TOPIK total score, self-perceived Korean proficiency, {{and the length}} <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> Korean <b>study.</b> The former two predictors had negative β coefficients. This is not unexpected as graduate students with poor Korean proficiency were required to take more credit hours to increase their Korean language skills. The positive β coefficient of the length <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> Korean <b>study</b> actually implied that the longer graduate students studied Korean, the more credit hours they registered for, and the poorer their Korean proficiency. The length <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> Korean <b>study</b> was not correlated with the TOPIK total score or self-perceived Korean proficiency, indicating that more years of Korean study did not guarantee higher levels of Korean proficiency with this group of Chinese students.

Duberman characterized the book as [...] "the most ambitious study" [...] of male homosexuality yet attempted, but was critical of Bell and Weinberg's [...] "sample techniques and simplistic typologies" [...] and saw their work as part of [...] "sexology's mainstream", believing that while most gays would welcome Bell and Weinberg's conclusion that gays differ little from [...] "mainstream Americans", gay radicals would be angered. Duberman suggested that Bell and Weinberg offered a [...] "sanitized" [...] version of gay experience. In 2002, The New York Times quoted Duberman as saying that Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women resulted from [...] "the most ambitious study of male homosexuality ever attempted", and that together with Sexual Preference (1981), the book [...] "refuted a large number <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> that gay men were social misfits".|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, {{two major}} genetic studies {{were carried out}} under the {{leadership}} of Harry Ostrer, from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The results were published in the Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences. The genes of 509 Jewish donors from 15 different backgrounds and 114 non-Jewish donors of North African origin were analyzed. Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi Jews were found to be closer genetically to each other than to their long-term host populations, and all of them were found to have Middle Eastern ancestry, together with varying amounts of admixture in their local populations. Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews were found to have diverged from each other approximately 2,500 years in the past, approximately the time of the Babylonian exile. The studies also reconfirmed the results <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> which found that North African Jews were more closely related {{to each other and to}} European and Middle Eastern Jews than to their non-Jewish host populations. The Moroccan/Algerian, Djerban/Tunisian and Libyan subgroups of North African Jewry were found to demonstrate varying levels of Middle Eastern (40-42%), European (37-39%) and North African ancestry (20-21%), with Moroccan and Algerian Jews tending to be genetically closer to Europeans than Djerban Jews. The study found that Yemenite, Ethiopian, and Georgian Jews formed their own distinctive, genetically linked clusters. In particular, Yemenite Jews, who had been previously been believed to have lived in isolation, were found to have genetic connections to their host population, suggesting some conversion of local Arabs to Judaism had taken place. The also study found that Syrian Jews share more genetic commonality with Ashkenazi Jews than with other Middle Eastern Jewish populations. According to the study:"distinctive North African Jewish population clusters with proximity to other Jewish populations and variable degrees of Middle Eastern, European, and North African admixture. Two major subgroups were identified by principal component, neighbor joining tree, and identity-by-descent analysis—Moroccan/Algerian and Djerban/Libyan—that varied in their degree of European admixture. These populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were part of a larger Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish group. By principal component analysis, these North African groups were orthogonal to contemporary populations from North and South Morocco, Western Sahara, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. Thus, this study is compatible with the history of North African Jews—founding during Classical Antiquity with proselytism of local populations, followed by genetic isolation with the rise of Christianity and then Islam, and admixture following the emigration of Sephardic Jews during the Inquisition." ...|$|E
