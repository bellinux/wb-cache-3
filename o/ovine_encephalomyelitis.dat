Louping-ill is a tick-transmitted disease whose occurrence is closely related to the distribution of the primary vector, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus. It also causes disease in red grouse, and can affect humans. The name 'louping-ill' is derived from an old Scottish word describing the effect of the disease in sheep whereby they 'loup' or spring into the air.|$|E

Severe {{encephalomyelitis}} with myelomalacia in {{two young}} sheep {{was associated with}} an unidentified sporozoan parasite that was passing through a schizogonic cycle in astrocytes. Mature merozoites were 5 - 7 urn in length, had a conoid, subpellicular micro-tubules, paired organelles and many micronemes. Their morphology is {{compared with that of}} Toxoplasma and other related sporozoans. The apparent absence of gametogony suggests that the schizogonic cycle in the central nervous system could be an aberrant dead-end cycle. There are many well-recognized bacterial and viral infections that cause encephalomyelitis in sheep [7]. A protozoan parasite suspected of being Tox-oplasma gondii has also been seen in isolated cases of <b>ovine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> [5, 12, 16]. COLE et al. [I] described toxoplasmosis in sheep characterized by respiratory and neurological signs, and KOESTNER and COLE [9] described the neural lesions. Isolated cysts, morphologically resem bling Sarcocystis are oc-casionally seen in ovine brain but are not associated with any host reaction [4, 17]. The present paper reports a severe encephalomyelitis and myelomalacia in two sheep, which was associated with an unidentified protozoan parasite. Field Observations Case I. A 6 -month-old Suffolk ram lamb from Tasmania had been artificially reared and had gradually become unthrifty with diarrhoea. It then developed posterior inco-ordination followed by general incoordination, apparent blindness, periodic head jerking, and leg biting. The only significant finding on autopsy was a heavy infestation with Cysticercus tenuicollis...|$|E
