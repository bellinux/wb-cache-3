5|$|British Army Captain Walker goes missing {{during an}} {{expedition}} and is believed dead ("Overture"). His widow, Mrs. Walker, {{gives birth to}} their son, Tommy ("It's a Boy"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an altercation as Tommy watches. Tommy's mother convinces him {{that he did not}} see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> the incident and must never tell anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, and blind to the outside world ("1921"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E
5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the same {{question}} individually. While the first contestant is asked the question, the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> the question. The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer (in seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer, and resumes when the second contestant first sees the question. If one team member answers the question correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E
5|$|Stealth is a {{significant}} element of the gameplay; frequent gunfire can alert distant guards, and activated alarms can trigger infinitely-respawning enemies. Therefore, to avoid gunfights with numerous opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> the player. Certain weapons incorporate suppressor or telescopic sight attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although armour vests can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar.|$|E

5|$|The {{ghost of}} Zero (Normand Fauteux) materializes {{at a local}} gay bathhouse. No one can see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> him, until Zero runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero's friend George. Zero realizes that Burton can see him, {{although}} Zero does not show up on Burton's video camera. The two strike a deal; Zero agrees to help Burton with his Patient Zero exhibit if Burton {{finds a way to}} make Zero appear.|$|E
5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see <b>or</b> <b>hear,</b> Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E

25|$|A 1983 {{episode of}} Benson {{mentions}} Jessica's disappearance, noting the Tate family {{is seeking to}} have her declared legally dead. In the episode, Jessica appears as an apparition that only Benson can see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> and reveals to him {{that she is not}} dead, but in a coma somewhere in South America. No other incidents from the final episode of Soap are mentioned.|$|E
25|$|Sound around mode {{allows for}} real time {{overlapping}} {{of music and}} the sounds surrounding the listener in her environment, which are captured by a microphone and mixed into the audio signal. As a result, the user may hear playing music and external sounds of the environment at the same time. This can increase user safety (especially in big cities and busy streets), as a user can hear a mugger following her <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> an oncoming car.|$|E
25|$|Delirium tremens (DTs) is a rapid {{onset of}} {{confusion}} usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol. When it occurs, {{it is often}} three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts {{for two to three}} days. Physical effects may include shaking, shivering, irregular heart rate, and sweating. People may also see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> things other people do not. Occasionally, a very high body temperature or seizures may result in death. Alcohol {{is one of the most}} dangerous drugs from which to withdraw.|$|E

25|$|Learning {{that the}} {{proceedings}} {{were conducted in}} secret, with defendants unable to confront their accusers <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> testimony against them, Governor Thomas Bennett, Jr. had concerns about {{the legality of the}} Court, as did his brother-in-law Justice Johnson. Bennett had served almost continuously in the state legislature since 1804, including four years as Speaker of the House. He did not take any action at first, because four of his household slaves were among those accused in the first group with Vesey, and three of these were executed with the leader on July 2.|$|E
25|$|To {{maintain}} {{public confidence}} in the judiciary, it is important to maximize judges' independence from personal interests, beliefs and prejudices, and ensure that they are not perceived to be affected by their personal beliefs and prejudices. The State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act ("SCJA") provide that judicial officers of the State Courts, and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court, are not permitted to investigate <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> and decide any proceedings to or in which they are parties or personally interested, unless the parties to the proceedings have consented and the Chief Justice has given approval.|$|E
25|$|These {{courts of}} appeal (as listed below by {{province}} and territory in alphabetical order) exist at the provincial and territorial levels and were separately constituted {{in the early}} decades of the 20th century, replacing the former Full Courts of the old Supreme Courts of the provinces, many of which were then renamed Courts of Queens Bench. Their function is to review decisions rendered by the superior-level courts and to deliver references when requested by a provincial or territorial government as the Supreme Court does for the federal government. These appellate courts do not normally conduct trials <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> witnesses.|$|E

40|$|Family {{involvement}} plays {{a critical}} factor in the language development of a deaf <b>or</b> <b>hearing</b> impaired child. Hearing parents often have major difficulties in communicating with their child when it is deaf <b>or</b> <b>hearing</b> impaired. These difficulties often lead to issues in the language development of the child. In this research we investigate the feasibility of a serious game for involving parents in the language development of their deaf <b>or</b> <b>hearing</b> impaired child by using sign language together in a fun and engaging way. From the feasibility analysis we find that such a serious game is feasible and could help deaf and hearing impaired children to improve their language development...|$|R

25|$|I enquired {{throughout}} Italy at what place {{boys were}} chiefly qualified for singing by castration, but could get no certain intelligence. I was told at Milan {{that it was}} at Venice; at Venice that it was at Bologna; but at Bologna the fact was denied, and I was referred to Florence; from Florence to Rome, and from Rome I was sent to Naples... {{it is said that}} there are shops in Naples with this inscription: 'QUI SI CASTRANO RAGAZZI' ("Here boys are castrated"); but I was utterly unable to see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> of any such shops during my residence in that city.|$|E
25|$|White Spanish and Cuban criollos saw cabildos as a {{necessary}} evil. By the 18th century, these spaces of cultural autonomy and support began to worry slaves' white masters. Articles of the 1792 Bando de Buen Gobierno y Policia address the necessity of controlling the cabildos and their members. Neighbors often complained about the unpleasant noises made by the slaves as they sang and played African instruments. By the 19th century, cabildos were re-located outside {{the walls of the}} city of Havana so that whites would not have to see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> their African celebrations. For the Afro-Cubans, this expulsion added a degree of privacy that they had previously lacked.|$|E
25|$|The {{method is}} a {{continuous}} process {{that begins with}} observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see <b>or</b> <b>hear,</b> and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.|$|E

25|$|In the Hittite Creation myth, Ishtar is {{born after}} the god Kumarbi overthrows his father Anu. Kumarbi bites off Anu's {{genitals}} and swallows them, {{causing him to}} become pregnant with Anu's offspring, including Ishtar and her brother, the Hittite storm god Teshub. This account later {{became the basis for}} the Greek story of Uranus's castration by his son Cronus, resulting in the birth of Aphrodite, described in Hesiod's Theogony. Later in the Hittite myth, Ishtar attempts to seduce the monster Ullikummi, but fails because the monster is both blind and deaf and is unable to see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> her. The Hurrians and Hittites appear to have syncretized Ishtar with their own goddess Išḫara.|$|E
25|$|Bart Ehrman, Robert Eisenman {{and others}} {{critical}} of traditional Christian views, {{in assessing the}} problems involved in conducting historical Jesus research, say the Gospels are full of discrepancies, were written decades after Jesus' death, by authors who had not witnessed any events in Jesus' life. They go on to say the Gospels were authored not by eyewitnesses who were contemporary with the events that they narrate but rather by {{people who did not}} know Jesus, see anything he did, <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> anything he taught, and that the authors did not even share a language with Jesus. The accounts they produced are not disinterested; they are narratives produced by Christians who actually believed in Jesus, and were not immune from slanting the stories in light of their biases. Ehrman points out that the texts are widely inconsistent, full of discrepancies and contradictions in both details and larger portraits of who Jesus was.|$|E
25|$|The couple's {{divorce is}} {{finalized}} in 1987 and Angie damages Den by demanding a large divorce settlement. Den runs The Queen Vic alone, initially assisted by Jan, but this relationship ends when Jan grows disillusioned with Den's treatment of her. Den has a fling with the Vic's caterer, Magda Czajkowski (Kathryn Apanowicz), but is scorned when she eventually opts to date Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) instead. When he discovers {{that they are}} seeing each other, he punches Simon, sacks him and throws {{him out of his}} home in the Vic. Whilst single again, Den begins to realise that The Vic's trade is floundering without Angie. With some meddling from Sharon, Den and Angie decide to reunite as business partners and she returns to live at The Vic. However, it is short-lived, because Angie falls in love with her friend, Sonny. Realising that Angie is planning to leave him, Den visits a solicitor and makes certain that Angie has no claim on The Queen Vic. Angie leaves Walford for Spain in May 1988 with nothing, and they never see <b>or</b> <b>hear</b> anything of each other again.|$|E
