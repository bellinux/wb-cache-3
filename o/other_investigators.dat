25|$|As all techniques, cricoid {{pressure}} has indications, contraindications and side effects. It {{is associated with}} nausea/vomiting and it may cause esophageal rupture and also may make tracheal intubation and mask ventilation difficult or impossible. Cricoid force greater than 40 N can compromise airway patency and make tracheal intubation difficult. Cricoid pressure may displace the esophagus, make ventilation with a facemask or with an laryngeal mask airway (LMA) more difficult, interfere with LMA placement and advancement of a tracheal tube and alter laryngeal visualization by a flexible bronchoscope. However, <b>other</b> <b>investigators</b> have found that cricoid pressure does not increase the rate of failed intubation.|$|E
25|$|After {{examining}} the case 48 {{years after the}} event, Joe Nickell of the paranormal investigation group Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), then known as CSICOP, concluded in 2000 that the bright light in the sky reported by the witnesses on September12 was most likely a meteor, that the pulsating red light was likely an aircraft navigation/hazard beacon, and that the creature described by witnesses closely resembled an owl. Nickell claimed that the latter two of which were distorted by the heightened state of anxiety felt by the witnesses after having observed the former. Nickell's conclusions are shared {{by a number of}} <b>other</b> <b>investigators,</b> including those of the Air Force. Skeptics have also proposed misidentified owl sightings as explanations for the Mothman and the Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter.|$|E
40|$|The {{physiologic}} {{basis for}} cochlear and brainstem implants is discussed.

30|$|Taken together, the {{possibility}} exists that the aforementioned tests are largely associated with left frontal lobe {{activity and the}} TMT, in particular, provides information concerning mental processing speed as well as cognitive flexibility and set-shifting.

25|$|Where {{the radical}} anion is {{initially}} protonated determines {{the structure of}} the product. With an electron donor such as methoxy (MeO) or with an alkyl group, protonation has been thought by some investigators as being ortho (i.e. adjacent or 1,2) to the substituent. <b>Other</b> <b>investigators</b> have thought the protonation is meta (1,3) to the substituent. Arthur Birch favored meta protonation. With electron withdrawing substituents, protonation has been thought to occur {{at the site of the}} substituent (ipso), or para (1,4). Again, there has been varied opinion. A. J. Birch's empirical rules say that for the donor substituents the final product has the maximum number of substituents on the final double bonds. For electron withdrawing groups the double bonds of the product avoid the substituents. The placement preference of groups in the mechanism and in the final product is termed regioselectivity.|$|E
25|$|Song Ci (sometimes {{referred}} to as Sung Tzu) was a judicial intendant who lived in China 1188-1251 AD. In 1247 AD Song Ci wrote a book entitled Washing Away of Wrongs as a handbook for coroners. In this book Song Ci depicts several cases in which he took notes on how a person died and elaborates on probable causes. He explains in detail on how to examine a corpse {{both before and after}} burial. He also explains the process of how to determine a probable cause of death. The main purpose of this book was {{to be used as a}} guide for <b>other</b> <b>investigators</b> so they could assess the scene of the crime effectively. His level of detail in explaining what he observed in all his cases laid down the fundamentals for modern forensic entomologists and is the first recorded account in history of someone using forensic entomology for judicial means.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, ecclesiastical historians and the writers of the {{numerous}} monographs concerning local churches, monasteries, ecclesiastical institutions, etc. were aided by the officials of the archives, themselves often scholarly investigators. In this respect the papal archivist Augustin Theiner (1804–74) accomplished far-reaching work when he published, in many folio volumes, a multitude of documents relative to the ecclesiastical and civil history of Northern, Eastern, and Southern Europe, also a documentary treatise in three folio volumes on the temporal dominion of the pope and its administration. In the same period, i.e. from about 1850 to 1875, several <b>other</b> <b>investigators,</b> chiefly German and Austrian, {{in one way or another}} secured admittance to the papal archives. These events and other influences increased the desire of all scholars for the opening of this valuable repository of important historical documents. Although under Pope Pius IX it became somewhat easier to obtain a permit for private research, the political conditions of his reign worked against a general opening of the Vatican Archives.|$|E

25|$|While {{working in}} London {{in the early}} 1970s with John R. Vane (Nobel prize in Medicine, 1983), he participated in the {{discovery}} of the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by aspirin-like drugs. At that time, he proposed that the mechanism of the analgesic action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was due to the prevention of pain receptor sensitization which results from an inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. This hypothesis was supported by further work from his laboratory and from many <b>other</b> <b>investigators.</b> His studies on the basic mechanisms involved in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia led to the discovery that a select class of analgesics like metamizole, in contrast to the classical NSAIDs, are able to counteract the ongoing sensitization of the primary sensory neuron via the stimulation of the arginine/nitric oxide pathway. He recently (December 2008) characterized a phenomenon described as retrograde sensitization of the primary sensory neuron, which emphasizes the importance of the peripheral component of the inflammatory pain. His group made a relevant contribution to the role of bradykinin and of cytokines in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. He found that among the cytokines, interleukin 1b mediates the endogenous release of prostaglandins and IL-8 is responsible {{for the development of the}} sympathetic hyperalgesia. In this area he described an antagonist of IL-1 that is now being developed as a model for a new class of analgesics.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{description is}} given of colour discrimination which rests on three assumptions: 1.

(2) Colour discrimination is essentially photon-noise limited; at higher luminances saturation processes come in, which keep colour discrimination below this theoretical limit. 3. (3) The recoding of the receptor output occurs {{in such a way}} that the L, R vs. G, and Y vs. B signals together form a set of conjugate parameters with respect to the discrimination-determined metrics of the colour space.

500|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{argued that the}} cyclol hypothesis {{should never have been}} advanced, because of its a priori flaws, e.g., its steric clashes, its inability to accommodate proline, and the high free energy disfavoring the cyclol reaction itself. [...] Although such flaws rendered the cyclol hypothesis implausible, they did not make it impossible. [...] The cyclol model was the first well-defined structure proposed for globular proteins, and too little was then known of intramolecular forces and protein structure to reject it immediately. It neatly explained several general properties of proteins and accounted for then-anomalous experimental observations. [...] Although generally incorrect, some elements of the cyclol theory were eventually [...] verified, such as the cyclol reactions and the role of hydrophobic interactions in protein folding. [...] A useful comparison is the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, which was considered implausible from its inception, even by its creator, yet led the way to the ultimately correct theory of quantum mechanics. [...] Similarly, Linus Pauling proposed a well-defined model of DNA that was likewise implausible yet thought-provoking to <b>other</b> <b>investigators.</b>|$|E
