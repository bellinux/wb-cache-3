5|$|Hokies {{tailback}} Darren Evans {{ran for a}} school-record of 253yards, and exceeded 100rushing {{yards in}} a game {{for the first time}} in his career. The Hokie defense shut down the Terrapins running game and held them to 12yards on 18carries. Maryland also proved unable <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> to blitz against Sean Glennon, the Tech quarterback hobbled by an ankle injury. Glennon threw for 127yards and a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|It transpired {{that the}} only {{manufacturer}} able to supply suitable tiles was Royal Doulton, although they were unable <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> to replicate DeMorgan's designs, and they were duly commissioned to manufacture the 24 tiles, delivered in May 1908. Mary Watts was unhappy with {{the design of the}} tiles, which were significantly different in colour and appearance from DeMorgan's original tiles, and they were installed without ceremony on 21 August 1908, immediately below DeMorgan's original row of tiles.|$|E

5|$|Agricola's successors {{were unable}} <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> to further subdue the far north. The {{fortress}} at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion, {{and the other}} fortifications of the Gask Ridge were abandoned within {{the space of a}} few years. By CE 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands, {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period, as may Castle Greg in West Lothian. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from coast to coast.|$|E
5|$|Davis is acquitted, but Freamon {{uses the}} threat of federal {{prosecution}} to blackmail him for information. Davis reveals Maurice Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which would jeopardize the entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield's release {{on the condition that}} he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co-Op and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> to stay off the corner.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF {{was intended to be}} a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.|$|E
5|$|In {{diplomatic}} {{talks with}} the Ho-Chunks {{at the close of}} the war, General Atkinson promised that the U.S. government would look into their grievances in the lead mining region. Thomas McKenney requested military aid to evict American miners who were trespassing on Ho-Chunk land, but after the war, settlers poured into the region in unprecedented numbers, and U.S. officials proved to be unable <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> to stem the tide. By January 1828, there were as many as 10,000 illegal settlers on Ho-Chunk land, including militia general Henry Dodge, who established a mining camp after the war and boasted that the U.S. Army could not make him leave. Having no other options, on August 25, 1828, the Ho-Chunks signed a provisional treaty with the United States, agreeing to sell the land occupied by the miners in a more formal treaty to be held later.|$|E
5|$|While on Washington's staff, Hamilton {{had become}} {{frustrated}} with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states. This lack of a stable source of funding had {{made it difficult for}} the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> to contribute), and from European loans.|$|E

5|$|In 1054 King Edward sent Ealdred to Germany {{to obtain}} Emperor Henry III's help in {{returning}} Edward the Exile, son of Edmund Ironside, to England. Edmund (reigned 1016) was an elder half-brother of King Edward the Confessor, and Edmund's son Edward was in Hungary with King Andrew I, having left England {{as an infant}} after his father's death and the accession of Cnut as King of England. In this mission Ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the German church during a stay of a year with Hermann II, the Archbishop of Cologne. He also {{was impressed with the}} buildings he saw, and later incorporated some of the German styles into his own constructions. The main objective of the mission, however, was to secure the return of Edward; but this failed, mainly because Henry III's relations with the Hungarians were strained, and the emperor was unable <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> to help Ealdred. Ealdred was able to discover that Edward was alive, and had a place at the Hungarian court. Although some sources state that Ealdred attended the coronation of Emperor Henry IV, this is not possible, as on the date that Henry was crowned, Ealdred was in England consecrating an abbot.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{announcement}} of victory, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian and his post passed to Sallustius Lucullus. Agricola's successors were seemingly unable <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> to further subdue the far north. Despite his apparent successes, Agricola himself {{fell out of}} favour {{and it is possible}} that Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of his claims to have won a significant victory. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge (erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius) were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is possible that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was deemed more profitable to leave the Caledonians to themselves. By 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the 1st century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period as may Castle Greg in West Lothian, which was most likely used as a monitoring base for an east-west road running along the foot of the nearby Pentlands, from the Forth to the Clyde Valley.|$|E
