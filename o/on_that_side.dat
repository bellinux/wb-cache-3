5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> of the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on {{one side or the}} other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|Group F is to {{the west}} of Group E. Mound F is the main {{structure}} within Group F. It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily defensible <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side,</b> however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A retaining wall supported the mound above the pass and a round earth platform upon the mound may have supported a perishable watchtower.|$|E

50|$|In trees, {{the roots}} {{normally}} grow outward to {{about three times}} the branch spread. Only half of a trees root system occurs between the trunk and the circumference of its canopy. Roots {{on one side of}} a tree normally supply the foliage <b>on</b> <b>that</b> same <b>side</b> of the tree. Thus when roots on one side of a tree are injured, the branches and leaves <b>on</b> <b>that</b> same <b>side</b> of the tree may die or wilt. For some trees however, such as the maple family, the effect of a root injury may show itself anywhere in the tree canopy.|$|R
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side),</b> as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E
5|$|Engine failure causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.|$|E
5|$|Halvdan Koht {{was born}} on 7 August 1873 in Tromsø, {{one of the larger}} cities in Northern Norway. He was the second of four {{children}} born to Paul Steenstrup Koht (1844–1892), an educator and politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a part-time teacher with a penchant for singing, languages and drawing. Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, yet on her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> was her great-grandfather, the civil servant Jens Holmboe from Tromsø. Through the offspring of his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian Ola Krogseng Giæver. In Paul Koht's lineage, Kjeld Stub was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1989 {{the club}} {{moved to the}} Portway Stadium, {{situated}} in the Portway Industrial Estate on the western outskirts of the town. Built {{at a cost of}} £850,000, the ground has a main stand of brick and concrete construction with bench seating for around 250 people. This stand is set on a bank running along the entire south side of the ground, giving spectators <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> an elevated view of the pitch. The managers' benches are set into this banking in front of the stand at pitch level. The banking slopes down behind each goal until it reaches the same level as the pitch along the north side. There is hard standing around the entire perimeter of pitch, along with a turnstile block and a gate opening out onto the stadium car park for ambulance access.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, most cricketers {{considered}} it unsportsmanlike to bowl {{the ball at}} the leg stump or for batsmen to hit on the leg side. But by {{the early years of}} the 20th century, some bowlers—usually slow or medium-paced—used leg theory as a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of leg stump and the fielders placed <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> of the field, the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke. Two English left-arm bowlers, George Hirst in 1903—04 and Frank Foster in 1911—12, bowled leg theory to packed leg side fields in Test matches in Australia; Warwick Armstrong used it regularly for Australia. In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used leg theory in county cricket.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the stands}} have more {{traditional}} names, but {{have since been}} renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> of the ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.|$|E

5|$|The Brooksville Tunnel is {{the most}} {{difficult}} work of the kind, I have seen any record of: at the Western entrance, the pressure of the big slides actually causes the bottom to surge up, as is sometime the case in coal mines; in view of the sliding tendency and immense pressure of this ground, it will be advisable to enter <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> with an invested arch to prevent a collapse...This work is vastly more difficult than the Greenwood Tunnel was, though it was not, by any means, an easy safe job.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} fought at the {{location}} of the modern city of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe which is next to the Paraná River, at the point of its widest flow. The west bank of the river was tall and steep, forming a natural obstacle, and ships could only land troops and materials <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> of the river using man-made paths cut into the side. The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The San Carlos Convent, the main nearby building, was a short distance away from the river.|$|E
5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along the Crank Road.|$|E

5|$|Serving as {{the convoy}} {{flagship}} for Convoy HX-50, Otranto departed New York on 25 September. Six days later, {{on the evening}} of 1 October, the ship accidentally rammed the French fishing schooner Croisine off Newfoundland while the latter was returning home to St. Malo with a full load of cod. The fishing boat passed down the liner's port side and its masts destroyed some of the liner's lifeboats <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side.</b> Captain Ernest Davidson, who was also commodore of the convoy, ordered the convoy to continue while Otranto stopped to rescue the 37 survivors. The derelict Croisine was now a menace to navigation and Davidson ordered his gun crews to sink her later that evening. The liner caught back up with the convoy by daybreak. The following day, the first death from the influenza pandemic occurred and the soldier was buried at sea. Only one other flu death aboard Otranto is recorded, but others may have occurred before she met her end.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5D-43 is {{an unusual}} radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a {{pre-existing}} twin pyramid complex. It {{is built into the}} end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side.</b> The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.|$|E

25|$|Differential {{braking systems}} are {{essentially}} an epicyclic transmission {{with a single}} fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler pinions. The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the idlers, and puts a conventional brake on that extension. With the brake applied, the idlers are locked and the system works like a conventional epicyclic. When the brake is released, the idlers spin, reducing the speed of rotation <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side.</b> This causes the output <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>side</b> to slow down by a fixed amount.|$|E
