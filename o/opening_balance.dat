The frontier study provides static cost efficiency estimates for each TSO, as well as dynamic results in terms of technological improvement rate and efficiency catch-up speed. In this paper, we provide the methodology for the benchmarking, using non-parametric DEA under weight restrictions, as well as an analysis of the static cost efficiency resutls for 2011. The overall cost efficiency is measured with a three-output model, explaining 91. 2 % of variance, using a DEA model under non-decreasing returns to scale assumptions.

50|$|The press note {{does not}} clarify whether the {{full set of}} {{financial}} statements for the year 2011-12 will be prepared by applying accounting standards convergent with IFRS. The deferment of the transition may make companies happy, but it will undermine India's position. Presumably, lack of preparedness of Indian companies {{has led to the}} decision to defer the adoption of IFRS for a year. This is unfortunate that India, which boasts for its IT and accounting skills, could not prepare itself for the transition to IFRS over last four years. But that might be the ground reality.Transition in phasesCompanies, whether listed or not, having net worth of more than INR 5 billion will convert their <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet as at 1 April 2013. Listed companies having net worth of INR 5 billion or less will convert their <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet as at 1 April 2014. Un-listed companies having net worth of Rs5 billion or less will continue to apply existing accounting standards, which might be modified from time to time. Transition to IFRS in phases is a smart move.The transition cost for smaller companies will be much lower because large companies will bear the initial cost of learning and smaller companies will not be required to reinvent the wheel. However, this will happen only if a significant number of large companies engage Indian accounting firms to provide them support in their transition to IFRS. If, most large companies, which will comply with Indian accounting standards convergent with IFRS in the first phase, choose one of the international firms, Indian accounting firms and smaller companies will not benefit from the learning in {{the first phase of the}} transition to IFRS.It is likely that international firms will protect their learning to retain their competitive advantage. Therefore, it is for the benefit of the country that each company makes judicious choice of the accounting firm as its partner without limiting its choice to international accounting firms. Public sector companies should take the lead and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) should develop a clear strategy to diffuse the learning.Size of companiesThe government has decided to measure the size of companies in terms of net worth. This is not the ideal unit to measure the size of a company. Net worth in the balance sheet is determined by accounting principles and methods. Therefore, it does not include the value of intangible assets. Moreover, as most assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost, the net worth does not reflect the current value of those assets and liabilities. Market capitalisation is a better measure of the size of a company.But it is difficult to estimate market capitalisation or fundamental value of unlisted companies. This might be the reason that the government has decided to use 'net worth' to measure size of companies. Some companies, which are large in terms of fundamental value or which intend to attract foreign capital, might prefer to use Indian accounting standards convergent with IFRS earlier than required under the road map presented by the government. The government should provide that choice.|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} 2007 / 2008 Financial Crisis, this {{dissertation}} identifies endogenous risk in the German insurance sector during the Interwar sector. In the context of principal agent theory, endogenous risk {{is the result of}} a company reacting to shocks that are generated and amplified within the financial system by shifting risk from shareholders to policyholders. This dissertation provides analytical support for this interdependence on the basis of established financial as well as actuarial models and assumptions. The empirical analysis considers the German insurance sector during the Interwar period due to the presence of a pronounced business cycle, the absence of exogenous low-probability high-cost events, a consistent regulatory framework as well as available quantitative data. The econometric analysis is based on four newly compiled datasets that collect the 1924 gold account <b>opening</b> <b>balances,</b> company- as well as line-specific financial information, and stock price quotations for all publicly traded German insurance companies during the Interwar period. The dissertation finds that during the Interwar period in the German insurance sector (Ch. 2), the risk of getting discontinued prior to default (3) led companies to cater dividend payout (Ch. 4) and reinsurance operations (Ch. 5) to an optimistic investor clientele (Ch. 6), yet in contrast to the underwriting cycle (Ch. 7) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{inventory}} management {{is an important}} part of supply chain management, which protects the schedule of production or maintenance towards any type of disturbance. This research emphasized on the development of the Spare Part Inventory Management System (SPIMS) for the Profound Heritage Sdn Bhd (PHSB), which is currently adopting the manual Kadex method. This automatic software used the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) in the periodic review environment to control the inventory and the software was written using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. Therefore, this research will not only helps the PHSB but also increased literature on the actual implementation of the EOQ technique in the periodic review environment. This newly developed SPIMS have the ability to keep the spare parts transaction records, calculate the EOQ for each part and remind the user to purchase more spare parts at its dedicated “When to Order ” date. The developed SPIMS performance was then evaluated by comparing it to the current Kadex or manual method. The method, which produced the lowest average inventories, is considered as the best method.

40|$|It can be {{concluded}} from an analysis and {{comparison of the}} legal and accounting concepts related to the amendment of the Transformation of Business Companies and Cooperatives Act and Regulation 500, that the amended regulations are characterized by an extensive right to choose in terms of business regulation. While the legal and accounting regulations {{until the end of}} 2011 addressed transformations generally as purchasings, the commercial and accounting regulations from 1 st January 2012 provide solutions mainly for transformations of the restructuring type. The amendment offers a high degree of choice and thus provides space for both factual concepts, however, this fact is not specified in any of the appropriate regulations. The availability of all these possible variants, from the decisive date {{at the very beginning of}} the preparation and implementation of the transformation to the recognition of an entry of a transformation in the Register of Companies, as the record date, i. e., a combination of the decisive date and the effective date, leads to a complicated accounting view that is time-consuming, often confusing and, unfortunately, does not define the conditions for recognising a transformation with the substance of a purchase and a transformation with the substance of a restructuring. Highlighting the reflection based on individual accounting transactions for the participating companies, and especially in the unusual method included in the so-called <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet method, leads to a suppression of the information links between summary financial information from the financial statements on the entry into the transformation and the summarized financial information in the form of an <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet of the successor company...|$|E
5000|$|Previously {{known as}} the Lasker-Pelikan {{variation}} of the Sicilian Defence, Sveshnikov's system was considered of dubious merit until he transformed it into an exciting and fully playable <b>opening.</b> The <b>balance</b> between winning and losing is often on a knife edge, making it an attractive proposition for black players seeking the full point. Mark Taimanov, in an interview, described it as chess opening theory's [...] "last great discovery". That it is now regularly played by the world's leading Grandmasters, supports this view. Vladimir Kramnik and Valery Salov are regarded as expert practitioners of the Sicilian Sveshnikov (categorised by the moves 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 - the Sveshnikov 'proper' continuing 6.Ndb5 d6), but Kasparov, Shirov, Leko and Khalifman have also enjoyed success. The opening is rich in its tactical possibilities and despite being subjected to deep analysis, continues to flourish with new ideas being regularly unearthed.
