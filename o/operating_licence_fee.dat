Drawing on an analysis of the rationale for public service broadcasting, the article considers whether the <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> can be adapted to reflect this new world or should be replaced by a different funding model. It concludes that while modernising the TV <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> to close the ‘iPlayer loophole’ would patch up the current system, it would be preferable to replace the <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> altogether, perhaps with a household levy. Subscription may be a useful top-up for non-essential services where a broad reach is less important. The ban on the carrying of advertising by the BBC should also be reconsidered...|$|R
