40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{establish}} whether, and, if so, how, ‘F ootball in the C ommunity ’ {{can be an}} important source for cultivating and tending s <b>ocial</b> c apital. Previous research has paid much attention to the role of sports and leisure pursuits in the development of s <b>ocial</b> c apital and the benefits which can be attained through participation in and in volvement with sport, sporting organisations and c ommunity s ports d evelopment (CSD). Using the ‘s <b>ocial</b> c apital c ycle ’ as a framework for analysing the case of Arsenal in the Community and drawing on previous analytical frameworks, the findings suggest that s <b>ocial</b> c apital is being cultivated and tend ed within Arsenal in the Community, particularly {{as a result of the}} environment created through their CSD programmes and the networks developed in partnerships with other organisations. In some cases, this develo pment of s <b>ocial</b> c apital has helped to achieve outstanding results. The Holy Grail of CSD research and practice is a credible mechanism for evaluating and measuring seemingly intangible value s. Whil e previous studies have emphasised the intangibility of CSD and s <b>ocial</b> c apital, the discussions raised in this research suggest two important conclusions. First, that the power of an elite football club brand, such as Arsenal, presents opportunities to add and receive value through recipro cal benefits with its community department. Second, that the positive impacts of this mutual benefit can be recognised within a social impact measurement that has both wider relevance and contemporary resonance for global business strateg...|$|E

40|$|Preface Corruption is {{an age-old}} {{phenomenon}} and a widespread, multifaceted prob-lem: {{there is hardly}} any country that has been spared from scandals {{in the past and}} corruption has appeared in almost any kind of interaction between the private and the public sector. In 1995, the Sunday Times of India published a index", i. e. a list of the customary bribes that had to be paid for a range of routine public services. For example, for the issuing of a driver's license, a bribe of between 1, 000 and 2, 000 rupies was asked; For the installation of an electric meter, government <b>ocials</b> usually pocketed between 25, 000 and 30, 000 rupies. After a large department store collapsed in Korea in 1995, it was discov-ered that the accident had been caused by the substandard concrete that had been used in construction.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature in nancial aid and authoritarian institutions. For a long time, scholars are debating whether nancial aid is able to facilitate development and governance. Though abundant evidence is provided, the answer is still inconclusive. On the other hand, scholars investigating China argue that the leadership uses various institutions to ensure local ocials' compliance. In this paper, we nd that the nancial aid does not bring a positive impact and the central government in China does not have enough monitoring capacity to force local o- cials to comply. We study a redevelopment program established by Chinese central government after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. By adopting a geographic regression discontinuity combining with a dierence-in-dierences design, we show that the redevelopment program does not signicantly develop the disaster area. On the contrary, the evidence implies that the economy in the disaster area is worse after receiving the aid. The results imply that local <b>ocials</b> do not follow the central government's regulations and misuse the aid money for other purposes. In the future, we expect to further investigate through which mechanism do local <b>ocials</b> undermine the existing institutions. iii Thesi...|$|R

Ascityresourcesaroundtheworldbegintostretchbeyondcapacityduetoever-increasing population, a major {{challenge}} for an emerging knowledge city is to maintain high-quality living conditions for its residents. It is therefore imperative that existing city resources are used in an optimal manner by minimizing cost and maximizing utility. Such resources include physical resources such as transportation networks, schools, clinics, electricity, water and natural gas lines, sewers, and waste sites and human resources such as physi- cians, teachers, and other qualied personnel. To that end, algorithm-embedded infor- mation technology tools {{have proven to be}} tremendously useful for city decision makers, and technologies using algorithm-embedded systems are being used more frequently than ever before. In particular, as one of the emerging knowledge cities in the world, Istanbul has been deploying such applications at various levels for better use of the city's re- sources. The {{purpose of this study is}} two-fold: classify algorithm-embedded information technology application areas related to management of resources in a city in a systematic way, and; provide an up-to-date review of each application area and investigate the level of algorithm-embedded information technology use in Istanbul. The study has implica- tions for the city <b>ocials</b> as well as <b>ocials</b> of other emerging world knowledge cities regarding the use of existing algorithm-embedded information technology tools in their cities.

40|$|We {{argue that}} trade opportunities, {{combined}} with the provision of law and order, may lead to local political liberties. In our model, a ruler chooses {{the size of an}} administration that (i) provides law and order for a merchant to use and (ii) collects taxes. Larger gains from trade increase the demand for law and order, which requires a larger administration. However, a larger administration is more difficult to monitor and allow local officials to expropriate merchants. When the resulting inefficiencies are significant, the ruler delegates control of the administration to the better-informed merchant, even though this makes tax evasion more tempting. We then analyze the emergence of local political liberties in post-Norman Conquest England (1066 - 1307) using data on taxation, commerce, and the behavior of local officials. This period marks the beginning of England's transition away from feudalism. We nd that trade expansion coincides with widespread misbehavior by <b>ocials</b> and, in line with the predictions of our model, an increasing willingness by the king to grant boroughs of high commercial value the right to elect local officials.

Participants were interviewed using structured questionnaires, which were analysed statistically. It was found that White gay participants showed higher rates of disclosure to friends, and showed a trend towards having disclosed to a higher number of people overall in comparison to Black African participants. The latter showed a trend towards having disclosed their HIV status to one partner in particular and to have accessed more voluntary organisations in contrast to the comparison group. No {{differences were found between the}} two groups in terms of disclosure to family members or proportion of significant others, and time elapsed since diagnosis and first time disclosure.

Since 1978 {{the state government}} (through-out dominated {{by a coalition of}} Leftist parties) devolved implementation of land reforms to elected local governments. It is dicult to explain the observed patterns on the basis of dierences in redistributive ideology alone. Land distributed to the poor had an inverse-U pattern with respect to the share of local government seats secured by the Left, with the downward sloping part prevailing over most of the sample. We oer an interpretation of this in terms of reduced incentive for elected <b>ocials</b> to implement land reforms when there was less competitive pressure for re-election, owing either to moral hazard or the in uence of local landed elites. We nd evidence consistent with the competitiveness hypothesis for the land distribution program. Added evidence for the role of competitive motives is provided by signicant pre-election year spikes in land reform activity, and substantial land reform preceding the advent of the Left Front government. 1 We thank the MacArthur Foundation Inequality Network for funding the data collection.
