25|$|Analysing the <b>oily</b> <b>water</b> to {{determine}} droplet size {{can be performed}} with a video particle analyser. Alternatively, there are commonalities in industries for oil droplet sizes. Larger droplets–greater than 60 microns–are often present in wastewater in workshops, re-fuel areas and depots. Twenty to 50 micron oil droplets often are present in vehicle wash bays, meat processing and dairy manufacturing effluent and aluminium billet cooling towers. Smaller droplets {{in the range of}} 10 to 20 microns tend to occur in workshops and condensates.|$|E

Yamato was not hit for four minutes, but at 12:41 two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25mm anti-aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck. A third bomb then destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127mm mount. At 12:46, another two bombs struck the battleship's port side, one slightly ahead of the aft 155mm centreline turret and the other right on top of the gun. These caused a great deal of damage to the turret and its magazines; only one man survived. At 12:45 a single torpedo struck Yamato far forward on her port side, sending shock waves throughout the ship. Because many of the ship's crew who didn't go down with the vessel were killed by strafing aircraft as they swam in the <b>oily</b> <b>water,</b> the details are uncertain, but authors Garzke and Dulin record that little damage was caused. Shortly afterward, up to three more torpedoes struck Yamato. Two impacts, on the port side near the engine room and on one of the boiler rooms, are confirmed; the third is disputed but is regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable because it would explain the reported flooding in Yamatos auxiliary steering room. The attack ended around 12:47, leaving the battleship listing ° to port; counterflooding—deliberately flooding compartments {{on the other side of}} the ship—reduced the list to °. One boiler room had been disabled, slightly reducing Yamatos top speed, and strafing had incapacitated many of the gun crews who manned Yamatos unprotected 25mm anti-aircraft weapons, sharply curtailing their effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this program}} was to develop an {{economical}} oily-water treatment system based on reverse-osmosis (RO) membrane technology. The RO system would be used to: (1) reduce oil-production costs by reducing the volume of waste water for which disposal is required; (2) {{form the basis of}} a generic waste-water treatment system that can easily be integrated into oil-field operations, especially at production facilities that are small or in remote locations: and (3) produce water clean enough to meet current and anticipated environmental regulations. The specific focus of this program was to develop a hollow-fiber membrane module capable of treating <b>oily</b> waste <b>waters.</b> Typically, the organics in <b>oily</b> waste <b>water</b> swell or dissolve the materials used in conventional polymeric membranes and modules. Our goal was to develop hollow-fiber membranes and modules that were more solvent-resistant than conventional membrane modules. We successfully achieved this goal. During the course of this program. we developed thin-film-composite (TFC) membranes, which consisted of a solvent-resistant selective coating placed on a solvent-resistant hollow-fiber support. These TFC membranes were used in low-cost, hollow-fiber modules, which were made using solvent-resistant components. The modules were tube-side-feed modules, in which the <b>oily</b> waste <b>water</b> travels down the inside (lumen) of the hollow fiber. The selective coating allows water to pass freely through the wall of the fiber, but restricts the transport of oil and grease and some of the dissolved organics and salts in the feed. Using these modules, more than 90 % of the <b>oily</b> waste <b>water</b> can be recovered as clean permeate (suitable for discharge), while the remaining 10 % is removed as oily-water concentrate (which can be recycled for recovery of the oil or disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner) ...|$|R

40|$|VI Abstract This Master’s thesis {{was done}} for Borealis Polymers Oy in {{co-operation}} with Chalmers University of Technology. The research concentrated on the load of petrochemical waste waters. Borealis’ Petrochemical plants consist of cracker, butadiene, benzene, cumene and phenol plants. There are two waste water systems in Borealis Polymers Petrochemical plants: phenolic <b>waters</b> (PW) and <b>oily</b> <b>waters</b> (OW) which were studied separately. The phenol plant discharges its waste water to both systems, while other plants discharge only to OW-system. The loads of waste waters were assessed with two methods. The first method was chemical oxygen demand and the second method {{was to assess the}} quality of waste water streams from plants. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was studied with theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) analysis. The quality of different waste water streams were assessed by taking samples from waste waters generated in the plants. In phenolic waters, the ThOD was mostly caused by methanol and phenol. In OW-system the contribution to COD-load was divided more equally between all the components found in the waste waters. Petrochemical waste waters contain a variety of different components, so ThOD analysis based only on known components did not give a full answer how different sorts of chemicals contribute to COD. On average the determined ThOD was one fifth of measured in COD in phenolic waters and one third of measured COD in <b>oily</b> <b>waters.</b> In the phenol plant the load originated from the effluent stripper and methylhydroperoxide (MHP) reactor to the phenolic waters. When the quality of waste waters was studied, the MHP-reactor was the main contributor to the load to biological treatment feed, biolsy. It is recommended that the known components should be analysed also from the outlet of the MHP-reactor continuously. The waste water from the MHP-reactor contained high concentrations of cumene and phenol. Also because of the high phenol and cumene content of the water, it should be treated either in effluent stripper or in the OW-stripper. The cracker was responsible for benzene, toluene, xylenes and phenol load to <b>oily</b> <b>waters</b> system. The phenol and aromatics were responsible for methanol, and total nitrogen load. The known components should be continuously analysed from all the main waste water sources; the diluting steam generator, the NaOH and FCC washing steps, the carbonyl wash, the OW-stripper and the ejector waters. The streams that contained high hydrocarbon concentrations should be treated in OW-stripper and streams that contained phenol should be treated in effluent stripper. The reduction of load is difficult even impossible if the reduction concentrates only on the total load, measured either from pit 27 in case of the OW-system or from the biolsy in case of phenolic waters. Firstly the variety of components in the final stream increases because waste waters from different plants are aggregated. The reduction of different kinds of components is difficult, because of different nature of components. In the final stream also the components are diluted, which also makes the reduction of components more difficult. The reduction of components can be more efficient if it is carried out at the origin of the load...|$|R
