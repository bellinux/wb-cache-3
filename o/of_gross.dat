5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges <b>of</b> <b>gross</b> indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence <b>of</b> <b>gross</b> indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|Mughal-e-Azam was {{released}} on 5 August 1960 in 150cinemas across the country, establishing a record for the widest release for a Bollywood film. It became a major commercial success, earning 4million (US$839,000) in the first week, eventually earning a net revenue of 55million (US$11,530,000), and generating a profit of 30million for the producers. Mughal-e-Azam also experienced a long theatrical run, screening to full capacity at the Maratha Mandir for three years. The film thus became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time by surpassing Mother India (1957), and retained this record until Sholay (1975) surpassed its net revenue. In terms <b>of</b> <b>gross</b> revenue, Mughal-e-Azam earned 110million.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} Shintani data, which axiomatizes algebraic aspects of Shintani zeta functions. We develop {{the general theory of}} Shintani data, and show that the order of vanishing part <b>of</b> <b>Gross's</b> conjecture follows from the existence of a Shintani datum. Recently, Dasgupta and Spiess proved the order of vanishing part <b>of</b> <b>Gross's</b> conjecture under certain conditions. We give an alternative proof of their result by constructing a certain Shintani datum. We also propose a refinement <b>of</b> <b>Gross's</b> leading term conjecture by using the theory of Shintani data. Out conjecture gives a conjectural construction of localized Rubin-Stark elements which can be regarded as a higher rank generalization of the conjectural construction of Gross-Stark units due to Dasgupta and Dasgupta-Spiess.

5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the Tallboy bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs that fell far from the target as gross errors, those that fell near the target were twice as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number <b>of</b> <b>gross</b> errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E
