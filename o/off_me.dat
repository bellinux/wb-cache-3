500|$|Continuing their travels, the two {{come across}} a {{universe}} where singer and performer Frank Sinatra was never born, resulting {{in the loss of}} the 1960 presidential election by President John F. Kennedy to then-Vice President Richard Nixon, which causes World War III. Brian questions whether Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy, and Stewie responds that he shot Mayor McCheese instead. A sequence similar to the Zapruder film, which shows the assassination of Kennedy, is shown, with Jacqueline Kennedy also appearing. Brian and Stewie next discover a universe completely depicted as a political cartoon. The next reference occurs in the dog universe when Stewie says, [...] "Take your stinking paws <b>off</b> <b>me</b> you damn, dirty dog!" [...] which is a reference to the famous quote [...] "Take your stinking paws <b>off</b> <b>me</b> you damn, dirty ape!" [...] from the first Planet of the Apes movie. The final reference of the episode also occurs in the dog universe when Stewie mentions, [...] "Gosh, Brian, I sure hope this next leap, will be the leap home," [...] a nod to the opening narration of the time travel series Quantum Leap.|$|E
500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The first day, I {{was in a}} cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather <b>off</b> <b>me</b> and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.|$|E

500|$|...The Take Over, the Breaks Over"" [...] was {{released}} in August 2007 in the US as the third single and failed to chart on the Hot 100, although it did reach number 48 on the UK Singles Chart, with its highest position at number seventeen in Australia, becoming the third consecutive top twenty hit from Infinity on High in that region. The fourth and last single, [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You <b>Off</b> (<b>Me</b> & You)" [...] managed to reach number 68 in the US and made the top 30 in Australia. [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] was not an official single but it {{was released}} online by the band before Infinitys release and was later given as an exclusive download to iTunes; it managed to reach number eighty-one on the Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have given}} [...] "Tennis the Menace" [...] {{generally}} positive reviews. Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel listed it at number nine on his 2004 {{list of the}} show's [...] "Top 10 Sporting Episodes". Nancy Basile of About.com wrote in her 2003 review that {{the plot of the}} episode [...] "allowed us to see more secondary characters than usual. It also gave Springfield a sense of community that we sometimes don't get in recent seasons. Though the blatant use of guest stars has sweeps written all over it, the tennis stars were funny and able to make fun of themselves. Homer had some wonderful lines, too, such as, 'Take your hands <b>off</b> <b>me.</b> [...] They feel like salad tongs.' [...] Overall, a very funny episode." [...] In July 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Agassi's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Fall Out Boy began searching for {{potential}} producers. The band sought out R singer/producer Babyface, as they admired {{his work on}} the soundtrack to the 2001 film version of Josie and the Pussycats. Babyface saw one of the interviews in which the band discussed its desire to work with him and contacted the group. Babyface produced two of the songs, [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You <b>Off</b> (<b>Me</b> & You)" [...] and [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs". Neal Avron, who also produced the band's previous album, handled production for eleven of Infinity on Highs fourteen tracks. Before recording, the band began with six weeks of pre-production, which was encouraged by Avron. This period included both rehearsals and writing, as well as working out all the sounds and arrangements. It began in Chicago before the group relocated to the Swing House studios in Los Angeles. Additionally, some rough recordings of songs were created {{to be used in the}} studio as a future reference.|$|E

500|$|Stump called [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] the [...] "funkiest thing we’ve ever done", and {{attributes}} {{the change in}} musical style to his love of soul music, which he acquired by listening to oldies stations as a child. Wentz describes the song [...] "a bit of '70s funk mixed with [...] Take This to Your Grave with tight verses and big, fat choruses". The song closing sing-along was influenced by Justin Timberlake's [...] "Señorita". Cory Apar of Allmusic compared the Babyface-produced track [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You <b>Off</b> (<b>Me</b> & You)" [...] to Maroon 5. Wentz characterized Stump’s vocal performance on the song as [...] "straight-up Motown", continuing to say [...] "If there wasn't a rock band playing, it'd be straight R, and he'd go on tour with just an upright bass and a drum and open up for R. Kelly." [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] {{has been referred to}} as [...] "a prime slab of what the boys have become famous for: highly caffeinated pop-punk mixed with a little white-boy soul and some hard-core yelping." [...] The song features Stump singing in a falsetto in the chorus over Trohman’s [...] "crunchy" [...] guitars, as well as a breakdown in which Wentz employs death growl-style vocals.|$|E
500|$|I'm Breathless is a jazz, {{swing and}} pop album where Madonna and Sondheim tried to {{recreate}} {{the music of the}} period portrayed in Dick Tracy. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, the harmonic and melodic styles were more [...] "complex" [...] than the songs which Madonna was accustomed to, hence she found it difficult and demanding. She spoke about the [...] "wilderness" [...] of the tunes, saying that she was not confident of doing justice to the songs, and neither was Sondheim. But he kept on encouraging the singer so that the recording sessions would not be affected. Madonna also recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set {{in the days of the}} Untouchables law enforcement. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , after Madonna's split from husband Sean Penn in 1989, the singer was comfortable in her new relationship with Beatty, which influenced the songs. The singer and Leonard enlisted a ten-piece live band and jazz musicians. The sessions took place at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, California, and concluded by three weeks. The songs on the album reflect Madonna's showgirl personality where her singing ranged from [...] "rootsy, rocking" [...] in nature to slow, [...] "laid-back and soulful" [...] vocals. A studied approach was evident in most of them, which O'Brien compared to [...] "an actress playing a part and performing a vocal exercise in technique". Some of the songs had Madonna pitching her vocals and belting the notes only when necessary. A dryness was prevalent in most of the singing, which was required for the songs and the setting. Guy Pratt, who also played bass, said that the singer [...] "was in character and started smoking. She actually ponced a cigarette <b>off</b> <b>me.</b> Her character smoked, so therefore she did." ...|$|E
500|$|Jason Hughes of AOL TV {{felt the}} {{creature}} {{to look like}} a [...] "sock puppet when it was loose and flailing about angrily" [...] and felt this to be [...] "almost like a nod to old Doctor Who, which had awesomely awful special effects at times". He also felt that Rhys becoming aware of Torchwood [...] "adds a new and interesting dynamic to the show." [...] Stephen Frank, writing for the gay and bisexual male entertainment site AfterElton indicated that he was [...] "all in favour" [...] of getting [...] "to know our favorite Cardiff cuckold [...] a little bit better". Though critical of Gwen's characterisation in previous episodes, he praised her defense of Rhys' memories {{at the end of the}} episode as her [...] "finest moment on this show" [...] and stated that it [...] "helps rehabilitate her". He stated overall that [...] "Meat" [...] had [...] "performed something of a minor miracle in the way it’s made me reassess my views of both Gwen and Rhys and their relationship." [...] Alasdair Stewart of Firefox News felt that Tregenna had written some of the strongest episodes of the series in the past and stated the episode [...] "should be one of the highlights of the series" [...] but [...] "instead, it's a mess". He criticised the plausibility of the villains, the poor special effects of the alien and the incompetency of the Torchwood team, describing the episode as containing a [...] "total lack of consistency" [...] and [...] "a total lack of basic understanding of what Torchwood are supposed to be capable of". He felt Kai Owen provided [...] "a bright spot in the episode" [...] describing him as [...] "clearly a powerhouse of an actor" [...] and opining that [...] "the scenes where he uncorks on first Eve Myles and then John Barrowman" [...] also brought out [...] "the best in both actors". Conversely, io9's Charlie Jane Anders felt the alien half of the episode to be [...] "one of the best examples of a humans-are-the-real-monsters story ever" [...] but felt that [...] "the other half of the episode was Torchwood at its rock-bottom worst". She criticised the argument scenes stating: [...] "I was having psychic chunks carved <b>off</b> <b>me</b> by a man in a yellow helmet, every time Gwen screamed at Rhys or Jack" [...] and felt overall that the episode contained [...] "too much screaming". She enjoyed the innuendos made by Jack, but criticised the scene where Gwen stared [...] "psycho-killerishly" [...] at him whilst kissing Rhys.|$|E

2500|$|Boney M.'s first album, Take the Heat <b>off</b> <b>Me,</b> was {{released}} in 1976. It contained tracks that Marcia Barrett had already recorded with Farian, including the title track and [...] "Lovin' or Leavin'", {{both of which were}} previously recorded in German by another Farian act, Gilla. As Maizie Williams' voice wasn't considered suitable for recording purposes by Farian, and a try-out with Bobby Farrell performing [...] "No Woman No Cry" [...] didn't work, Farian decided to use only Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett along with his own studio-enhanced voice to create the Boney M. sound.|$|E

[...] Thus Tom Leonard, writing for the London Daily Mail on March 26, 2012, alleged that both the porn industry and the anti-pornography movement had taken advantage of her.|$|E

2500|$|Early in the 2000 season, Maddux {{was asked}} by sportswriter Bob Nightengale {{what had been the}} most memorable at-bat of his {{pitching}} career. Maddux said it was striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was surprised Maddux hadn't picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. Maddux explained: [...] "I remember that one because he got a hit <b>off</b> <b>me</b> in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years earlier. I told myself if I ever got in the same situation again, I'll pitch him differently. It took me seven years, but I got him." ...|$|E

[...] "It is awesome {{to be back in}} victory lane. When the top opened up, the car just took <b>off.</b> <b>Me</b> and the No. 42 (Kyle Larson) were the only ones that seemed to be able to run up there.

When you took that guitar the ghost in the barn left'. He told me this not very long ago and I said to him, 'Sherman!

2500|$|Zira and her fiancé Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), an archaeologist, take an {{interest}} in Taylor, whom Zira calls [...] "Bright Eyes". Taylor attempts to communicate by writing in the dirt, but Nova, who has been following him around, attempts to destroy his writing with her hands, not understanding what the words mean. The letters she doesn't destroy are then obliterated by Zira's and Cornelius's superior, an orangutan named Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Back in his cage, Taylor steals Zira's pencil and notebook and uses them to write the message My name is Taylor. Zira and Cornelius become convinced that Taylor is intelligent, but upon learning of this, Dr. Zaius orders that Taylor be castrated. [...] Before the castration can occur, Taylor escapes. During his desperate flight through Ape City, he passes through a museum, where he finds Dodge's stuffed and eyeless corpse on display. When Taylor is recaptured by gorillas, he overcomes his throat injury and roars: [...] "Take your stinking paws <b>off</b> <b>me,</b> you damn dirty ape!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fourth day}} of the {{competition}} had started earlier with another withdrawal, as fifth seed and 2007 Masters Cup semifinalist Andy Roddick announced he was {{pulling out of the}} event, after injuring his ankle during a practice session on the previous day. [...] "Yesterday in the warm-up during practice I just went over on it. [...] We tried the best we could to get it better but I can't really stop and start on it very quickly." [...] commented Roddick. The American's withdrawal allowed 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek, who accepted the invitation to Shanghai as first alternate, after sixteen players ranked above him, and below last qualifier Gilles Simon, refused to come to the Masters Cup. Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, to tell him he might enter the competition : [...] "I called Štěpánek earlier today to let him know where my head was at, and then just told him when I came off the practice court. So he knew as early as anybody else." [...] Štěpánek's unexpected appearance (Murray had commented [...] "Štěpánek's turned up without his own racquets, he borrowed some socks <b>off</b> <b>me</b> earlier and he hasn't got his contact lenses either") marked the Czech's first career participation to the year-end championships.|$|E
2500|$|Leonard Woolf {{wrote about}} Sackville-West, who, as an aristocrat, {{came from a}} very {{different}} world than {{he and his wife}} : [...] "She [...] belonged indeed to a world which was completely different from ours, and the long line of Sackvilles, Dorsets, Da La Warrs and Knole with its 365 rooms had put into her mind and heart an ingredient which was alien to us and at first made intimacy difficult". While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (you see how egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), I agree with the lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how I was brought up! No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: I move about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had a brother or sister to knock the corners <b>off</b> <b>me.</b> And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for you have that interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. As I get older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary". Besides for having similar childhoods, both women had grown up with a profound sense of the weight of English history as Woolf's father Sir Leslie Stephen had been a leading contributor to The Dictionary of National Biography while Sackville-West had grown up at Knole House, one of the grand country houses of England. Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E
