I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble <b>our</b> <b>efforts</b> to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all <b>our</b> <b>efforts</b> to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E

We should, then, turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit.

25|$|The {{school had}} three badges during its history. The {{first was the}} Bath Technical College badge which was a simple design - BTC in thin red letters within a shield {{outlined}} with a thin red line- and this lasted until the Bath Technical School was renamed in 1949. The second badge lasted until early 1954 and is recorded on the school photograph of March 1950 and the school website. The third badge, which lasted until 1970, was designed in early 1954 by Mr Ken Box, Head of Art and included the motto, 'NISI DOMINUS FRUSTRA'. The literal translation is 'UNLESS THE LORD IN VAIN'. This is not much help. The motto is based on Psalm 127 and the more usual translation is 'EXCEPT THE LORD APPROVE WE LABOUR IN VAIN' while another translation might be 'UNLESS THE LORD IS WITH US <b>OUR</b> <b>EFFORTS</b> ARE IN VAIN'.The badge has the Book of Knowledge open to show the motto, over the City wall with the Avon beneath. The open pages are white with yellow ends, the City wall is yellow, the river Avon white and the background a shade of blue.|$|E

(McCarthy had been advised of the speech, but was absent at the time.) Apart from a brief note of encouragement after this speech, Flanders was grateful that President Eisenhower stayed out of the McCarthy controversy.

500|$|After the Liberal {{losses in}} the 1910 elections, ILP member and {{journalist}} Henry Brailsford helped organise a Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage, which gathered 54 MPs from various parties. The group's Conciliation Bill {{looked to be a}} narrowly defined but still significant possibility to achieve the vote for women. Thus the WSPU agreed to suspend its support for window-breaking and hunger strikes while it was being negotiated. When {{it became clear that the}} bill would not pass, Pankhurst declared: [...] "If the Bill, in spite of <b>our</b> <b>efforts,</b> is killed by the Government, then... I have to say there is an end to the truce." [...] When it was defeated, Pankhurst led a protest march of 300 women to Parliament Square on 18 November. They were met with aggressive police response, directed by Home Secretary Winston Churchill: officers punched the marchers, twisted arms, and pulled on women's breasts. Although Pankhurst was allowed to enter Parliament, Prime Minister Asquith refused to meet her. The incident became known as Black Friday.|$|E
500|$|American {{environmentalist}} {{and writer}} Bill McKibben lamented the {{film on the}} Climate Progress website, where he wrote [...] "The climate skeptics can crow.

McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over <b>our</b> <b>efforts</b> and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. When The Daily Caller asked about the film, environmental organisation Greenpeace spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that [...] "as an organisation committed to non-violence, I think you can imagine how Greenpeace views this material. At this time, the only people promoting the material are climate skeptics and think tanks funded by corporations known for lobbying against climate change legislation". Five other environmental groups contacted by The Daily Caller did not comment on the film.|$|E

Pankhurst was arrested {{for the first time in}} February 1908, when she tried to enter Parliament to deliver a protest resolution to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She was charged with obstruction and sentenced to six weeks in prison. She spoke out against the conditions of her confinement, including vermin, meagre food, and the [...] "civilised torture of solitary confinement and absolute silence" [...] to which she and others were ordered. Pankhurst saw imprisonment as a means to publicise the urgency of women's suffrage; in June 1909 she struck a police officer twice in the face to ensure she would be arrested. Pankhurst was arrested seven times before women's suffrage was approved.
