Spain received also another application from Syngenta Crop Protection AG to modify the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam and clothianidin in cauliflower, based on the intended use of thiamethoxam. In order to accommodate for the intended SEU use of thiamethoxam, the EMS Spain proposed to raise the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam in table olives and <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> production from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 5 mg/kg and to raise the existing MRLs for clothianidin in table olives, <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> production and cauliflower, resulting from the use of thiamethoxam from 0. 02 mg/kg to 0. 09 and 0. 05 mg/kg, respectively. For artichokes, the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam and clothianidin, and for cauliflower the existing MRL for thiamethoxam, {{do not need to be}} modified. Germany, herewith {{referred to as the}} evaluating Member State Germany (EMS Germany), compiled an application to raise the existing MRLs for clothianidin in herbs (except chervil) to 1. 5 mg/kg, based on the intended NEU use of clothianidin. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for thiamethoxam and clothianidin in the crops under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of thiamethoxam on table olives, <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> production, cauliflower and artichokes as well as the intended use of clothianidin on herbs, will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern.

40|$|Increasing {{consumption}} {{of olive oil}} and table olives has recently determined an expansion of olive tree cultivation in the world. This trend {{is supported by the}} documented nutritional value of the Mediterranean diet. The aim of this work was to test a portable visible/ near infrared (vis/NIR) system (400 - 1000 nm) for the analysis of physical-chemical parameters, such as olive soluble solid content (SSC) and texture before the olive oil extraction process. The final goal is to provide the sector with post-harvest methods and sorting systems for a quick evaluation of important properties of olive fruit. In the present study, a total of 109 <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> production were analysed. Olive spectra registered with the optical device and values obtained with destructive analysis in the laboratory were analysed. Specific statistical models were elaborated to study correlations between optical and laboratory analysis, and to evaluate predictions of reference parameters obtained through the analysis of the visible-near infrared range. Statistical models were processed using chemometric techniques to extract maximum data information. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on vis/NIR spectra to examine sample groupings and identify outliers, while partial least square (PLS) regression algorithm was used to correlate samples spectra and physical- chemical properties. Results are encouraging. PCA showed a significant sample grouping among different ranges of SSC and texture. PLS models gave fairly good predictive capabilities in validation for SSC (R 2 = 0. 67 and RMSECV%= 7. 5 %) and texture (R 2 = 0. 68 and RMSECV%= 8. 2 %) ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} analyze the {{transformation}} of Tunisian food production and food trade over the span of fifty years. At independence, the Tunisian agricultural economy had a two-part structure. One focus was the production of grapes for wine and <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> meant for export to European countries. The second focus was the production of wheat, a staple food for Tunisian people, though domestic production was insufficient to meet demand. As a result, {{one third of the}} wheat consumed nationally was imported from European countries. During these fifty years, the population of Tunisia increased to {{two and a half times}} its earlier size. Despite a threefold increase in the domestic production of wheat, the quantity of imported wheat increased six fold. The cost of imports also increased. On the other hand, the quantity of olive exports increased by three times. In these years, the total value of olive and date exports of compensated for wheat imports. Another characteristic of Tunisian agriculture is that its production is affected greatly by the weather, especially annual rainfall. Every few years, they suffer a serious loss of food production, especially for wheat, due to a shortage of rainfall. Tunisian agriculture remains dependent upon rainwater. Tunisia's food trading partners have also changed. Tunisia currently imports wheat not only from Mediterranean European countries, but also from North American countries and Eastern European countries. Meanwhile, Tunisia exports most of its olive oil to Mediterranean European countries. To date, Mediterranean Islamic countries have been important trading countries as well as Mediterranean European countries...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Portugal, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from the company Agriphar to lower the existing MRLs for dodine in pome fruits, apricots and cherries (for less critical European uses) and to raise the existing MRL in olives (for the new SEU use) and bananas (for the authorized use in Northern, Central and South America). The lowering of the MRLs for the crops mentioned is justified as for the existing MRLs for apples, pears, peaches and apricots acute consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded. According to EFSA, the submitted data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals or tentative MRL proposals for the crops under consideration, except in apricots. The applicant is recommended to perform a study investigating the freezer storage stability of dodine residues in high oil content matrices to confirm the validity of the residue trials submitted in support of the MRL request for olives. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the new intended use of dodine on table olives, <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> production, the proposed less critical use on pome fruit, cherries and peaches, and the authorized use on banana will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. A potential acute consumer health risk could not be excluded for the existing use (MRL) for dodine in apricots and therefore the MRL should be revised...|$|E
