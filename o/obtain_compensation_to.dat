Goldberg {{said the}} US did not view Jordan {{as a country}} that consisted only of the East Bank, and that the US was prepared to support a return of the West Bank to Jordan with minor boundary rectifications. The US would use its influence to <b>obtain</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> Jordan for any territory it {{would be required to}} give up. Finally, although {{as a matter of policy}} the US did not agree with Jordan's position on Jerusalem, nor with the Israeli position on Jerusalem, the US was prepared to use its influence to obtain for Jordan a role in Jerusalem. Secretary Rusk advised President Johnson that he confirmed Goldberg's pledge regarding territorial integrity to King Hussein.|$|E

[...] Calling the U.S. government's actions [...] "consistent with the general pattern of discrimination already established" [...] on a de facto basis before the war, Hohri became active in efforts to <b>obtain</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> {{those who had been}} interned and an official apology for the policy. As head of the National Council for Japanese American Redress, Hohri was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that sought $27 billion in damages for the class of individuals held in the internment camps, but the case was ultimately unsuccessful. In the wake of Hohri's efforts, the United States Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, under which an apology was offered and each surviving internee received $20,000 in compensation; Hohri used his check to buy a Japanese-made car. The American Book Awards recognized him in 1989 for his book Repairing America: An Account of the Movement for Japanese American Redress.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether a pain clinical sample and pain simulators could be distinguished by their {{responses on the}} Symptom Checklist 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R). Fifty patients with a pain condition completed the SCL- 90 -R under normal instructions while 20 students responded under instructions to feign a pain disorder <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>compensation</b> but <b>to</b> attempt to avoid detection. Pain patients obtained generalized elevations, with the highest scores on Depression, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Somatization. The simulators exceeded the pain group on all clinical scales of the SCL- 90 -R, tending to greatly overestimate the degree of psychological distress in pain patients. Simulators had extreme elevations {{and were more likely}} to obtain a T score greater than 70 on each of the clinical scales. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive power values, and optimal diagnostic cutoff scores for the clinical scales are reported. The recommended Positive Symptom Total (PST) cutoff score for "faking bad" in the SCL manual had poor specificity.

40|$|Aims: To {{follow up}} {{vibration}} induced white finger (VWF) in a selected group of 73 vibration exposed workers who claimed unsuccessfully for VWF compensation at a first examination. Methods: The VWF claimants {{were sent to}} our unit by the National Insurance Institute. The basic compensatory criteria included a positive history of VWF and abnormal cold response of the digital arteries. Following the first unsuccessful examination, over a mean time period of 4. 1 (range 1 – 11) years the National Insurance Institute requested a second examination for all 73 claimants and a third examination for 29. During the follow up period, all subjects continued to work with vibratory tools. Results: There were 14 new cases who reported white finger during the follow up period. In the new VWF cases, finger blanching attacks became visible after about 3. 5 years since the first examination. All incident cases of anamnestic VWF showed an abnormal cold response in the digital arteries and <b>obtained</b> <b>compensation</b> according <b>to</b> the basic compensatory criteria.

40|$|The {{treatment}} {{of foreign investment}} {{has become the most}} controversial issue in global governance. At the center of the controversy lies the mechanism of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which allows private firms legal recourse against governments if government interference has degraded their investment. Using newly released data covering 742 investment disputes, I assess some of the central claims about ISDS. I argue that the regime has indeed undergone an important shift: a majority of claims today deal not with direct takings by low-rule-of-law countries, but with regulation in democratic states. Such "indirect expropriation" claims have seen a precipitous decrease in their odds of legal success over the past twenty years. They are also far less likely to result in early settlement. These parallel trends may be a result of a rise in strategic litigation by investors whose aim is not only <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>compensation</b> but also <b>to</b> deter governments' regulatory ambitions...|$|R

This fact confronts both researchers and practitioners with the crucial problem of biases yielded by the usage of standard statistical models. The current paper presents three empirical applications to the issue of faking of a recent probabilistic perturbation procedure called Sample Generation by Replacement (SGR; Lombardi and Pastore, 2012). With the intent to study the behavior of some statistics under fake perturbation and data reconstruction processes, ad-hoc faking scenarios were implemented and tested. Overall, results proved that SGR could be successfully applied both in the case of research designs traditionally proposed {{in order to deal with}} faking (e. g., use of fake-detecting scales, experimentally induced faking, or contrasting applicants vs. incumbents), and in the case of ecological research settings, where no information as regards faking could be collected by the researcher or the practitioner.

50|$|Records {{suggest that}} by 1857, despite the school's {{enhanced}} academic reputation, {{the headmaster of}} the time had allowed general discipline in the school to relax, so deeply immersed was he {{in the study of}} oriental literature. The indiscipline was not confined to pupils. The second master was allowed to keep as boarders private pupils who did not belong to the school. The formidable Haig Brown joined the school in 1857 instilling a sense of discipline once again and he remained at Kensington till 1863. His departure for Charterhouse was perhaps one of the causes which led eventually to the collapse of Kensington School. It is possible that, had he remained there, his powerful influence might have induced the Directors to oppose the Bill presented in Parliament by the Metropolitan Railway Company for powers to appropriate the playground, and they might thus have <b>obtained</b> sufficient <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> enable them to remove the school elsewhere. The loss of the playground in 1865 was the chief cause of the final disbandment of the school. A much smaller playground was made in the back garden of No. 25, taken on lease in about 1864 and sub-let as a boarding house to one of the assistant masters.|$|R

Painters in the contado were encouraged to be conservative in style by their patrons, who prioritized craftsmanship and efficiency over artistic innovation. The differences in economics of the Florentine city and its contado account for {{a great deal of}} the differences between the Renaissance’s minor and major masters. Very few, if any major masters painted in the contado, leaving the region in the control of the minor masters. While the minor masters simply were never commissioned to paint the high altarpieces of Florentine churches, their craftsmanship was revered in the contado, where they were sought after.

Furthermore, the minor masters tended to practice a more conservative style, allowing the major masters to take bold artistic risks in major cities while they created more traditional works. As artists bridging the gap between the early and high Renaissance styles, the minor masters connected the Trecento and the Quattrocento and Renaissance, incorporating some of the major masters’ innovations while remaining firmly planted in more conservative style. Perhaps if dal Ponte had been considered a major master, he would have had the opportunity to take greater risks in his craft.|$|R

Predictable, but also notable experiences and considerations have been described by the victims with respect to these redress routes. Although the representativeness of the sample may raise some doubts, this data has raised some important questions and some recommendations can also be made: the question should be assessed whether insurance companies are able and willing to create a first-party insurance product for damage caused by crime, and communication towards victims should continue to (at least) be improved...|$|R
