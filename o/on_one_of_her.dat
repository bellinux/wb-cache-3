5|$|Arniston sailed from Great Britain to the Far East {{eight times}} before her last voyage.BL 1812, primary sources. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> homeward {{journeys}} from China, she struck an uncharted rock at , near {{the island of}} Pulo Goondy (modern day Pulau Legundi), located just south of Sumatra. She did not suffer any ill effects {{as a result of}} this incident however, which is mentioned in journals of the time only for its noteworthiness as a navigation hazard to other shipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> adventures, Riefenstahl met Luis Trenker, who was {{an actor}} from Der Berg des Schicksals. At a meeting {{arranged}} by her friend Gunther Rahn, she met Arnold Fanck, the director of Der Berg des Schicksals and a pioneer of the mountain film genre. Fanck {{was working on a}} film in Berlin. After Riefenstahl told him how much she admired his work, she also convinced him of her acting skill. She persuaded him to feature her in one of his movies. Riefenstahl later received a package from Fanck containing the script of the 1926 film Der Heilige Berg ("The Holy Mountain"). She made a series of films for Fanck, where she learned from him acting and film editing techniques. One of Fanck's films that brought Riefenstahl into the limelight was Die Weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü ("The White Hell of Piz Palü") of 1929, co-directed by G. W. Pabst. Her fame spread to countries outside Germany.|$|E
5|$|She {{was part}} of a {{flotilla}} which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Zhiyuans sole action was at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894 during the First Sino-Japanese War. During the battle, she came under heavy fire from the Japanese forces. Having been holed, Deng ordered for the ship to ram an opposing vessel. She was destroyed as she closed, either by a hit <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> torpedo tubes, or from a Japanese torpedo. This attack, and the subsequent story of her captain and his dog have become embedded in popular culture in the People's Republic of China. A replica of the Zhiyuan was constructed in 2014 at the Port of Dandong, while the wreck was discovered in 2013 after a 16-year search.|$|E
5|$|Slava {{was built}} by the Baltic Works at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down on 1 November 1902, {{launched}} on 29 August 1903, and completed in October 1905, too late {{to participate in the}} Russo-Japanese War. Together with the battleship , she helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion in 1906. Slava was assigned to a training squadron for new officers fresh from the Naval College that was formed after the Rebellion as part of the post-Tsushima naval reforms. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> training cruises to the Mediterranean, her crewmen rescued survivors during the 1908 Messina earthquake and the ship took casualties to Naples for medical care. She had a serious boiler accident in August 1910 and was towed by Tsesarevich to Gibraltar for temporary repairs before sailing to Toulon for repairs that required nearly a year to complete. Upon her return to Kronstadt she was relieved of her training assignment and transferred to the Baltic Fleet.|$|E

5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> forward gunports with two round shot {{and a bag of}} musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged {{down the side of the}} British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> first cruises, Indian {{encountered}} four French frigates {{that surrounded}} her. A providential sudden calm {{enabled her to}} use her sweeps to push between them and get far enough away to escape when the breeze returned.|$|E

25|$|Later, <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> early {{visits to}} New Mexico {{in the summer}} of 1929, the painter Georgia O'Keeffe spent some weeks there after being invited to Taos and to the Ranch by Mabel Dodge Luhan. This was the year in which she painted The Lawrence Tree, with its unusual {{viewpoint}} gained from lying on a long bench and looking up into the branches of the tree.|$|E
25|$|The royal {{residence}} {{was used}} occasionally by {{the royal family}} {{as late as the}} reign of Queen Elizabeth I, during which the buildings were leased to a succession of noblemen. In 1558, Elizabeth leased the palace to Henry Lord Cobham. During Lord Cobham’s possession, the Queen kept her court here while <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> royal progresses. Lord Cobham was a resident of Kent who had served her faithfully as a diplomat and parliamentarian.|$|E

When he time travels with Dana to the past <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> trips, he witnesses the brutality of slavery and eventually becomes an abolitionist, helping slaves escape to freedom. Still, he often has trouble internalizing the incredible racism that he witnesses.|$|E
25|$|She was {{comatose}} for 12 days. She suffered severe hypothermia, severe brain damage, Class 4 (the most severe) hemorrhagic shock, {{and loss}} of 75–80 percent of her blood from five deep stab wounds and a gash <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> thighs, and internal bleeding. Her skull had been fractured so badly that her left eye was dislodged from its socket, which in turn was fractured in 21 places, and she suffered as well from facial fractures.|$|E
25|$|Mary McAleese {{made her}} final {{overseas}} visit {{as head of}} state to Lebanon in October 2011, the location of her very first official overseas visit in 1997. While there she met with Lebanese president Michel Suleiman. Before her trip to Lebanon she visited Derry <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> last official engagements to Northern Ireland, becoming the inaugural speaker at the first Conversations Across Walls and Borders event in First Derry Presbyterian Church.

6000|$|As the {{question}} occurred to me, I saw her head move. She looked along the bridge, first <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> then <b>on</b> the other.

60|$|Captain Cephas {{waited a}} long time for his friend to return, and at last {{he thought it would be}} well to go and look for him.

25|$|On 27 October, TG 38.2 {{returned}} to operations over Luzon; these included {{a raid on}} Manila on 29 October. That day, a kamikaze hit Intrepid <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> port side gun positions; damage was minimal though ten men were killed and another six were wounded. A Japanese air raid on 25 November struck the fleet shortly after noon. Two kamikazes crashed into Intrepid, killing sixty-six men and causing a serious fire. The ship remained on station, however, and the fires were extinguished within two hours. She was detached for repairs the following day, and reached San Francisco on 20 December.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship and}} crew {{performed}} {{so well in}} Ocean Safari '87 that Forrestals commanding officer, CAPT John A. Pieno Jr., recommended that the ship be granted a special liberty call in the United States as a reward. Special liberty calls serve to reward Navy personnel with a trip {{to other parts of}} the U.S. and provides Americans who would normally never see warships and planes an up close look at life in the United States Navy. CAPT Pieno being a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, decided that New Orleans, during her Mardi Gras celebration, would be the perfect location to show off his pride and joy. During her trip to New Orleans Forrestal broke another record by becoming the largest ship to sail on the Mississippi River. Also during her four days in New Orleans she accommodated tours for over 40,000 visitors. The tour included viewings and descriptions of all her aircraft, damage control demonstrations, and the crowd's favorite, a ride <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> four aircraft elevators.|$|E
