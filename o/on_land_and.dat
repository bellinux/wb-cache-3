5|$|At {{this time}} the {{abundance}} of invertebrates crawling around <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> near water, in moist soil and wet litter, offered a food supply. Some were even big enough to eat small tetrapods, but the land was free from dangers common in the water.|$|E

5|$|Each {{year during}} the warmer months of September through December, male banded sea kraits gather <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> in the water around gently sloping areas at high tide. Males prefer to mate with larger females because they produce larger and more offspring.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Danielle did {{not have}} any impact <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> no damage or {{fatalities}} were reported. No ships were reported to have come into contact with Danielle. When Danielle became a tropical storm at 24.8°W, it was the farthest east that a storm had received a name since Hurricane Alberto in the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{the navy}} had also formed the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division from reservists, and this served {{extensively}} in the Mediterranean and on the Western Front. Almost half of the Royal Navy casualties during the War were sustained by this division, fighting <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> not at sea.|$|E

5|$|Its use {{in hunting}} was varied, and the breed was useful both <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> in the water. In particular, it became {{successful}} in America and towards {{the beginning of}} the 20th century were popular in the area around Boston. They were described by the Spaniel Club of America as being as good in the water as the Chesapeake Bay Retriever.|$|E

5|$|The {{coconut crab}} is {{terrestrial}} and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air. They cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they possess a rudimentary set of gills. They can breathe <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> hold their breath underwater. The branchiostegal lungs {{are seen as}} a developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E

5|$|Through this victory, Michael secured {{control of}} the sea, but Thomas's army {{remained}} superior <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> continued its blockade of Constantinople. Minor skirmishes ensued {{for the remainder of}} the year, with Michael's forces sallying forth from the city to attack Thomas's forces. Although both sides claimed minor successes in these clashes, neither was able to gain a decisive advantage.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture was the empire's {{main source}} of income through taxes <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> produce. The {{majority}} of the people lived in villages and worked farming the staple crops of rice, pulses, and cotton in the dry areas and sugarcane in areas having sufficient rainfall, with areca and betel being the chief cash crops. The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from their labor.|$|E
5|$|As well as Thunderhawks, Anderson {{developed}} {{other ideas}} for a remake. A 1976 concept, Inter-Galactic Rescue 4, {{was to have}} featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> sea, in air and in space; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC, who rejected it. This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, T-Force, which at first could not be pursued owing {{to a lack of}} funding. Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled GFI, using cel animation. But Anderson was disappointed with the results and the production was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Athens orchestrated the {{creation}} of an alliance with Euboea, Megara, Achaea, Corinth, Acarnania and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes's allegiance.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 284–285; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42. Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes's control of Boeotia was recognised, Thebes was to command solely <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E

5000|$|The North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association defines {{versatility}} as [...] "the {{dog that}} is bred and trained to dependably hunt and point game, to retrieve <b>on</b> both <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water, and to track wounded game <b>on</b> both <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water." ...|$|R

5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} {{a litter of}} four capybara young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter. Birth is <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} {{is working on a}} new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> <b>and</b> where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs <b>on</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with the}} Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
