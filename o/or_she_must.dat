Once the service project is completed the Squire can be invested as a fully fledged Rover.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the most}} common “correct and {{legitimate}} question, to this illogical proposition” that is being asked. TCP does NOT require the citizen to have an internet connection begin with. Whether the citizen has internet <b>or</b> not, (<b>s)he</b> <b>must</b> visit the Collector‟s office in person to submit his/her complaint or RTI application. And whether (<b>s)he</b> has internet <b>or</b> not, (<b>s)he</b> <b>must</b> visit Talati‟s (Lekhpal, Patwari, VO) office in person to register YES on a complaint or affidavit. So, internet is not at all required to use this law. The law can be used by all citizens of India above 18 years of age. If (s)he has internet connection, (s)he can read the affidavits with ease and so as someone without internet --- (s)he only needs to ask someone who has internet or ask for a print out.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{remedies}} {{that may}} be sought by an applicant for {{judicial review is a}} declaration, which is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. The Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case, but it is possible they may adopt the test laid down in constitutional law cases. In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2012), the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist for a person have standing to bring a constitutional challenge: (1) he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{encounters}} the antagonistic team, Team Galactic, {{early in}} the game, when he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> save Professor Rowan from some of their thugs; however, their motives are unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh's three lakes {{in an attempt to}} capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access Spear Pillar, an ancient ruin atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League's Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before, will be waiting for him or her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.|$|E

50|$|For {{a student}} to be {{eligible}} for registration as a pharmacist in India, the college from which he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> graduated <b>must</b> be approved by the PCI.

25|$|The British {{courts have}} held {{it is not}} enough for an {{affected}} person to merely be informed of a hearing. He <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> also be told what is at stake; in other words, the gist of the case.|$|E
