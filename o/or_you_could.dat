25|$|When {{making a}} quilt it is {{important}} to mark the fabric that you are cutting in order {{to have some kind of}} guidance when cutting the fabric, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> use a quilting ruler and rotary cutter. When marking the fabric it is advised that you use a fabric marker, which is a marker that washes out when the quilt is washed or will fade away after repeated washes.|$|E
25|$|Surely the cry to the stonewallers, {{who are now}} tiresomely {{occupying the}} Test crease, is {{to get on with}} it. 'Wake up and entertain, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be drawing {{unemployment}} benefits next week'...remind yourself that England's selectors dropped first Ken Barrington and later Geoff Boycott from England sides after they had refused to get a move on. Isolated punishments such as these clearly were not effective. Those drawbridges of defences were brought back {{as soon as it was}} thought to be politic.|$|E
500|$|Made-up stories did not {{exclusively}} comprise Animaniacs writing, as Hastings remarked: [...] "We weren't really there to tell compelling stories... {{you could do}} a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> parody a commercial... you could do all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up." [...] Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes [...] "Ups and Downs," [...] "Survey Ladies," [...] and [...] "I Got Yer Can" [...] were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively. Another episode, [...] "Bumbie's Mom," [...] both parodied the film Bambi and was a story based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.|$|E

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
2500|$|Hugh Jackman was {{the first}} actor Wessler cast. He met the star at a wedding and then called him some time later and pitched him the short. Jackman read the script and agreed {{to be a part}} of the film. [...] "He called me back I think 24 hours later and said, 'Yeah I wanna do this,' which I think is, quite frankly, {{incredibly}} ballsy. Because you could be made a fool of, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> look silly, and there will be people who say, 'That's crazy; he should never have done it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{product has}} a cult-like following. [...] Famous chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and David Chang have favored the product. [...] Food Republic {{reported}} that Chef John Currence said: [...] "There's Pappy Van Winkle, then there's everything else." [...] Bourbon aficionados {{have shown up}} in droves to get a small chance in a lottery to purchase some. It has been called [...] "the bourbon everyone wants {{but no one can}} get". A writer for The Wall Street Journal said [...] "You could call it bourbon, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call it a $5,000 bottle of liquified, barrel-aged unobtanium." [...] Jen Doll wrote in The Wire, [...] "It's an age-old dilemma (supply and demand) leading to an age-old marketing dream (a product that can't be kept on the shelves ... money in the pockets ... bourbon in the bourbon snifters)." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{requested}} George, [...] "have <b>you</b> a paddock <b>or</b> corral <b>you</b> <b>could</b> let me {{put this}} bunch of cattle into until the morning? I'm {{willing to pay for}} the accommodation." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If {{you really}} want me, you're {{going to have to}} expose yourself. If you get naked, I'll be all over you, but you should use {{protection}} <b>or</b> else <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get a nasty disease. What am I ?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, darling, darling, and I've {{always told}} you, so carefully, {{that you were}} {{absolutely}} free. I {{just wanted you to}} come around when you were tired and wanted to talk to me, <b>or</b> when <b>you</b> <b>could</b> enjoy our parties--" ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{tours of}} Australia it was usual for state teams to be {{reinforced}} with potential Australian players to provide stronger opposition, allow the selectors to judge their ability and {{to entertain the}} crowd. Paul Sheahan of Victorian was brought over after his failures {{in the first two}} Tests, but he did not get to bat as the second and third days of the three day game were rained off. On the first day Geoff Boycott (74) and Colin Cowdrey (64) added 98 for the first wicket and the tourists reached 184/4 from 47 overs. Manager David Clark told his team that if they continued to play as they did they would be out of a job in fives years and 'pointed the slow-scoring bone at both captains' Ray Illingworth and Bill Lawry. Frank Tyson agreed, writing [...] "Wake up and entertain, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be drawing unemployment benefits next week".|$|E
2500|$|Colin Meloy of the Decemberists, who {{recorded}} a 2005 EP of Morrissey covers titled Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey, acknowledged Morrissey's influence on his songwriting: [...] "You could either bask in that glow of fatalistic narcissism, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{think it was}} funny. I always thought that was an interesting dynamic in his songwriting, and I can only aspire {{to have that kind}} of dynamic in my songs". Brandon Flowers of the American rock band The Killers has revealed his admiration for Morrissey on several occasions and admits that his interest for writing songs about murder such as [...] "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine" [...] and [...] "Midnight Show" [...] traces back to Morrissey singing about loving [...] "the romance of crime" [...] in the song [...] "Sister I'm a Poet". Flowers was quoted as saying, [...] "I studied that line a lot. And it's kind of embedded in me". Noel Gallagher called Morrissey [...] "the best lyricist I've ever heard".|$|E
2500|$|Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "the show's super {{strengths}} are its well-developed filmmaking, smooth pacing and {{a perfect}} cast. It views like the first hour of a fun, thoughtful movie." [...] Barry Garron at The Hollywood Reporter also stated, [...] "Heroes is one of TV's most imaginative creations and might, with luck, become this year's Lost." [...] Less favorable reviews included the Philadelphia Inquirer, who commented that although the show had lots of [...] "cool effects," [...] it [...] "lands, splat, {{in a pile of}} nonsense and dim dialogue." [...] In response to the first pod of season one episodes, The Chicago Tribune went as far as saying, [...] "you could watch the first few episodes of Heroes, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> repeatedly hit yourself on the head with a brick. The effect is surprisingly similar." [...] At Metacritic, the Heroes pilot received a 67/100, with generally favorable reviews from critics. The show was declared the fourth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002–2012).|$|E
6000|$|Agatha {{wondered}} rather drearily whether Mrs. Farnam's reproaches {{were not}} justified; but the latter went on: [...] "Perhaps, however, your coldness is encouraging. I don't suppose you have met anybody <b>you</b> liked, <b>or</b> felt <b>you</b> <b>could</b> like, better than Jake." ...|$|R
5000|$|The album met {{critical}} acclaim, with Paste Magazine rating it 9.1/10, adding: “unless your surname is Dylan, Waits, Ritter <b>or</b> Prine, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> face-palm {{yourself to}} death trying to pen songs half as inspired as the 10 tracks on Joe Pug’s debut full-length.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care whether}} you're {{straight}} with me <b>or</b> not. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> {{do anything with}} me. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> throw me in the dirt an' walk on me. An' you're {{the only man in}} the world that can," [...] she added with a defiant flash. [...] "I ain't taken care of myself ever since I was a kid for nothin'." ...|$|R
2500|$|Chakraverti's {{greatest}} {{influence has}} been on her daughter Deepta, who was chosen as her successor to helm the task of promoting about Wicca. Chakraverti commented: [...] "There are certain aspects of Wicca that you can't teach; {{they have to be}} absorbed. Something that I am not consciously passing on, something that has to be taken from me. I felt Deepta had the potential and I would have never forced her had she not been so keen. This is not necessarily through a mother-daughter bonding, it can be guru-shishya (mentor-protégé), or any form of relationship where there is a guiding force." [...] Deepta, was trained by Chakraverti in meditation, physical exercises, studying old religions, and other Wiccan regimen. Chakraverti has also brought forth similarities between Old Wiccan findings and the discoveries of modern physics and parapsychology. According to Sudipto Shome of The Hindu, [...] "You could be called a dayan and burnt alive, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be called an enchantress and enlighten an audience on the art of Wicca. Ipsita is the latter, and she has used her social and economic padding to make others listen to her." ...|$|E

50|$|The game {{allowed one}} and two (competitive) players, playing matches of 5, 10 <b>or</b> 20 minutes. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> play {{friendly}} matches or the 1992 European Football Championship.|$|R
50|$|Here is an example: If {{you have}} a 3♣, 2♣, A♣, you can move all four cards <b>or</b> just A♣. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> NOT move 2♣, A♣ onto another 4♣.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, I {{should think}} so, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> never mistake {{me for a}} young girl of twenty. Will you have the {{goodness}} to explain this matter to me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's a pity. I {{believe it}} {{goes a long}} way with women. You might get some one to write some, and let her think it is yours. <b>Or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> learn a little off and repeat it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} deem it so if <b>you</b> loved, <b>or</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> love me, Sybil," [...] said Morley, mournfully. [...] "Why it's {{a moment of}} deep feeling, and suited for the {{expression}} of deep feeling. You would not have answered thus, if he who had been kneeling here had been named Egremont." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Would you mind, Stella," [...] she said, [...] "coming {{into the}} drawing-room with me? This room is {{supposed}} to be locked up. You knew the catch in the door, of course, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not have come in." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{could tell}} you who it is, {{if you think that}} would do any good--if you think it would help me to see it in the true light, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> help me more by knowing who it is than you can now." ...|$|E
5000|$|These {{drawings}} just represented what I was thinking.
