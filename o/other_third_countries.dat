50|$|The {{first major}} wave of {{immigration}} from Myanmar {{occurred in the}} 1960s, after Ne Win established military rule in 1962, to the late 1970s. Most who immigrated were primarily those with Chinese origins, who arrived in increasing numbers following the 1967 anti-Chinese riots. The Burmese Chinese were the first major group of Theravada Buddhists to immigrate to the United States and were largely educated professionals, business entrepreneurs and technically skilled workers. A minority were of Anglo-Burmese and Indian descent. Some of the Burmese immigrated to the United States after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished the previously existing quota on Asian immigrants. A second wave occurred during the 1980s to the early 1990s after the national uprising in 1988. This wave consisted of many different ethnic groups, including Bamars, Karens, and those from other ethnic minorities, particularly in search of better opportunities. Among this wave are political refugees numbering a few thousand, {{who were involved in}} the 8888 Uprising and are concentrated in Fort Wayne, Indiana. From 1977 to 2000, 25,229 Burmese immigrated to the United States, although the figure is inaccurate because it does not include Burmese who immigrated via other channels or through <b>other</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> A third wave of immigration, from 2006 to date, has been primarily of ethnic minorities in Myanmar, in particular Karen refugees from the Thai-Burmese border.

40|$|This piece {{examines}} how the EU exports and enforce its {{values in the}} countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy by using on the one hand, external financial instruments, in particular, the European Nieghbourhood Policy Instrument (ENPI) but also the Decisions on macro economic assistance based on Art. 212 (or 213) Treaty on Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and on the other, and restrictive measures, falling within the scope of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The author examines to what extent the way the EU promotes its values differs from the instrument of pre-accession assistance (IPA), used {{within the framework of the}} enlargement policy. The conclusion is that the ENPI of 2014 strengthens the importance of EU values compared to the previous one (dating 2006) but does expect that they comply with EU values as the IPA does from acceding countries. Decisions on macro economic assistance are scrutinised to examine to what extent they are based on political conditionality. Does respect of EU values matter to receive the EU’s financial assistance? A further question is whether the EU has specifically used this form of financial support to the benefit of ENP partners or has also extended its assistance to <b>other</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> (i. e. the “neighbours of neighbours”). The chapter highlights that after 2009 macro-economic assistance decisions have been adopted to support the transition of third countries to democracy. However, they are not reserved for ENP countries, and neither is respect for EU values in reality truly important in taking the decision to assist. Turning to restrictive measures, the analysis is aimed at examining whether there are distinctive features in the measures adopted against the governmental leadership and/or nationals and entities of ENP countries. The term of comparison is restrictive measures adopted against <b>other</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> and/or legal and natural persons in situation in which human rights or democratic rules were breached. The author concludes that there are categories of restrictive measures concerning the ENP countries with distinctive elements. The EU’s judicial assistance to democracies in transition, such as Tunisia and Egypt, in fighting the misappropriation of funds is specific to the ENP. Restrictive measures adopted against the secessionist Ukrainian Republics, in reaction to their breach of the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty, are also unique and worth highlighting. This denotes that the EU is more committed to supporting the establishment of its values in its relations with its neighbours than with <b>other</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the institutional aspects of transplantation of the EU competition model to emerging economies which {{has taken place}} {{during the last two}} decades within the enlargement and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENPI). The model which was designed to satisfy the needs of developed economies characterized by well functioning markets has been implemented by both the States under enlargement and the ENP conditions as well as <b>other</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> The paper relies on the experience of two emerging economies – Brazil and Argentina - which did not have any “carrot” of EU membership or closer economic relations with the EU, to adopt the EU competition model. The case studies showed that the non-orthodox institutional model established in Brazil, where an independent NCA enforces the competition law together with two bodies connected to the executive branch, proved to be more successful than the Argentinean model. The latter, which referred directly to the EU institutional model, opted for a fully independent Competition Tribunal. This institution, however, has never been established in this country. In particular, the Brazilian institutional model proved to be more successful in terms of competition advocacy of the NCA vis-à-vis other State bodies.

40|$|The recent {{growth of}} {{regional}} integration agreements (customs unions and free-trade areas) {{has been accompanied}} by a mounting concern for the health of the multilateral trading system. Much of this concern stems from the generally accepted view that the current WTO rules do not provide an adequate set of disciplines on regional arrangements. The EU {{has been one of the}} main driving forces behind the recent growth of regionalism, but its interests are increasingly affected by regional arrangements formed between other countries. This paper argues that the lack of clear WTO disciplines on regional arrangements may have already had adverse consequences for the EU. Given that the EU has declared its support for a clarification of the rules, the paper tries to identify where its priorities should lie. It is argued that there should be two such priorities. The first should be to define more precisely what is meant by an "applicable" tariff. It has never been clear whether this refers to applied tariff rates or to bound ceilings. Because of this ambiguity, Mexico was able to raise applied tariffs (within bound ceilings) on imports from the EU and <b>other</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> in response to the peso crisis, whilst lowering tariffs on her NAFTA partners. Secondly, the EU and other major WTO players need to address the problem of different rules of origin emerging from the proliferation of regional arrangements. world trade organisation...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{modification}} {{in plant}} {{cells in the}} early 80 ´s allowed Biotechnology to introduce characteristics in plants creating stronger crops (compared to the ones created by conventional breeding) {{to be used in}} different sectors: Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Production and Industry. A new technology was developed to face the upcoming global challenges: climate change, overpopulation, erosion, and a new socio-economic environment. This new technology is subject to international regulations to ensure environmental sustainability of crop production on the basis of which genetically modified organisms have to be assessed for safety before being released in to the environment or on the market. Although there is a wide range of biotechnology legislation applying to the use of GMO’s in order to implement the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, legislation is not uniform. In the European Union, the Precautionary Principle or Precautionary Approach {{is one of the major}} legal arguments originating law conflicts within third states. For example, the alleged general EC moratorium on approvals of biotech products (Dispute DS 291) brought by the United States and <b>other</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> to the WTO triggered strong disagreements between these two major trade partners. As a result, there was not only an adoption of an extensive review over all the EU legislation policies on gmo’s regardless the new EU rules to approve GM products agreed in 2004. The European Union has developed research programs and practices to evaluate risks and benefits to the environment of GMOs; on the basis of the Precautionary approach (Article 191 (2) of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) and under its secondary law, specifically on its Environmental Liability Directive (Directive 2004 / 35 EC); as an early conclusion, it is clear that, the interaction between law and policies on the Precautionary Principle will continue to be contentious; the purpose of this research is: 1) To demonstrate how this important legal principle, has been shaping the legal approaches in the WTO and the European Union on regards of biosafety disputes and policies. 2) Determine the status quo of the existing biosafety regulations in the European Union and identify the initiatives and proposals from the EU Institutions and other organisms towards effective and uniform regulations...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the extent}} to which {{progress}} is being made with the integration of the European Capital Market, harmonisation of the taxation of income is becoming increasingly important. Efficient allocation of capital must not be hindered by inter-governmental tax differentials. Following more than forty years of discussion, the approach that is now beginning to emerge is one by which the principle of country of residence is translated into reality via a system of information exchange and tax collected at source. The information model should guarantee that interest income earned abroad is declared in the taxpayer's country of residence. EU states that place great value on banking secrecy should be able to charge tax collected at source for interest income earned there during a transition phase ending in 2002. Their tax rates must be raised from 15 % to 35 % during this period in order to stimulate the transition to information exchange in these countries as well. In this context, Switzerland and <b>other</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries,</b> which are supposed to give up their status as tax havens and adopt this approach, represent a particular problem relating to tax policy. The model chosen for the EU is a pragmatic concession in so far as its intervention in national tax law is relatively limited. With its interest income tax rate of 25 %, which is to apply to interest income earned by resident taxpayers from 2004 onwards, German tax legislation has opted for an approach that would be compatible with the European solution if, while implementing the European approach, information about interest income earned in Germany by non-resident individuals could also be passed on. Both the standards negotiated for a European guideline on the taxation of interest income and the German approach are incomplete in as far as there remain considerable gaps in the recording of impersonal and personal tax liability. Further efforts need to be made as regards tax policy in order to eliminate the remaining deficiencies in the taxation of interest income and bring about coordination between the burden of interest income and the likewise necessary harmonisation of corporate management {{in a way that makes}} sense economically.

The government of Montenegro confirmed dedication to the European path by signing on 15 October 2007 a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA), thereby accepting responsibility for its European future. Montenegrin European path is advancing steadily and until now eighteen of thirty-five negotiating Chapters have been opened, out which two Chapters have been provisionally closed. EU Member states devoted themselves to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), {{as well as to the}} Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), with which they are strengthening the EU ’s external ability to act through the development of civilian and military capabilities in conflict prevention and crisis management. The acquis consists of political declarations, decisions and agreements, and member states must be able to support political dialogue in the framework of the policies, to align with EU statements, to take part in EU decisions and to apply agreed sanctions and restrictive measures. Montenegrin officials stated that, with respect to the EU policies vis-à-vis <b>other</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> and regions, the country would not have difficulties in implementing CFSP and CSDP positions, yet, they expressed their commitment to be ready to fully and actively participate in the EU ’s policies by the date of accession.

This paper will conduct an analysis with respect to how and to what extent the candidate countries, i. e. Montenegro is aligning its foreign policy with the EU ’s CFSP and CSDP. Theoretical framework will be built around two basic alternative conceptions – state-centric governance and multi-level governance, which will establish a base for our further analysis. Also, this paper will briefly present how the treaty of Lisbon impacted the CFSP and CSDP and created what we have today. Afterwards, I will present all alignments of the Montenegrin foreign policy with the EU ’s, with a special emphasis on the imposed sanctions in view of the situation in Ukraine, due to the multi-layered ties between Montenegro and Russia.
