50|$|Proportional Solenoid -Included in this {{category}} of solenoids are the uniquely designed magnetic circuits that effect analog positioning of the solenoid plunger or armature {{as a function of}} coil current. These solenoids, whether axial or rotary, employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high starting force (torque), and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically. The resulting force (torque) profile as the solenoid progresses through its <b>operational</b> <b>stroke</b> is nearly flat or descends from a high to a lower value. The solenoid can be useful for positioning, stopping mid-stroke, or for low velocity actuation; especially in a closed loop control system. A uni-directional solenoid would actuate against an opposing force or a dual solenoid system would be self cycling. The proportional concept is more fully described in SAE publication 860759 (1986).|$|E
40|$|A concept {{based upon}} Equal Channel Angular Extrusion (ECAE) is {{developed}} and {{introduced in the}} form of a Universal Re-usable Energy Absorption Device 'UREAD'. In impact situations the device utilises the energy required to extrude deformable materials through the shear planes of a set of intersecting channels and hence provides the means to protect engineering structures. The impact force is absorbed through the resistance of a deformable material and the energy is dissipated through an <b>operational</b> <b>stroke.</b> This paper examines the use of this new concept under dynamic loading. The device performance and usability during dynamic impacts are tested in a landing frame type experiment where the effectiveness of the technique in reducing impact loads and energy are also examined...|$|E
5000|$|The Shop Supervisor {{reported}} to the Location manager. The Shop Supervisor ensured the Virage vehicles were <b>operational,</b> 2 <b>stroke</b> pre-mix and 4 stroke fuel was order and offloaded to the underground tanks, the repair parts inventory was ordered and maintained, the Track and Signaling was safe and operational, and supervised shop personnel. Additionally, the Shop Supervisor supervised the rebuilding/restoration of the Virage cars that reached their targeted limit of operational hours. These cars were torn down and the frames sand blasted, powder coated and the cars reassembled.|$|R
