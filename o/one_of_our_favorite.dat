500|$|Patrick Duffy {{returned}} to Dallas in 1986 after being absent {{for an entire}} season. The whole year's worth of episodes was written off entirely as Pam's dream. The storyline garnered the show a lot of publicity, both good and bad. The Staff of UGO Networks.com said: [...] "Soap Operas are known (and at times hated) for their ridiculously implausible storylines, and while '80s primetime suddser Dallas is still <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>favorite</b> guilty pleasures, even the great Ewing empire is not immune to the absurd storytelling techniques the genre has become associated with. While your average primetime soap operas don't usually mingle with the stuff of sci-fi and horror, there's an incredibly high rate of characters returning from the dead in the genre. Case in point: Bobby Ewing. Presumed dead after being run over by his sister-in-law, Katherine Wentworth, who also happened to be obsessed with him, fans (and CBS) had to do without Patrick Duffy, and even worse, ratings, for one whole season. Thus, Larry Hagman, who played Duffy's onscreen brother and despised oil baron J.R. Ewing, along with network execs, persuaded Duffy to return, making it possible (we're talking in soap opera terms here), for Bobby Ewing's character to come back by writing off the ratings nightmare of a season as a dream... a very bad one." ...|$|E

Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of [...] "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" [...] respectively. The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. The Biography Channel said, [...] "Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before Dynasty, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R. Ewing's evil ways?" [...] The Boulevard Magazine said, It may be 2009 and seventeen years since the primetime drama Dallas went off the air, but memories of the Ewing family still linger. Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal – all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. At the center of it all was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>favorite</b> Ewings, the person we couldn't help but root for each week as she drank and slept her way through one ordeal after another. This, of course, was the tortured and (sometimes) villainous Sue Ellen Shepard Ewing, former Texas beauty queen and trophy wife of the womanizing rogue J.R. Ewing, played to perfection by actress Linda Gray.|$|E
5000|$|By design, the ISKCON World Review {{was limited}} to pro-ISKCON good news from GBC zones around the world.

Bhakti-tirtha {{had a way of}} striking up a spontaneous friendship with celebrieties such as Muhammad Ali. In one issue we reported Bhakti-tirtha's visit to the Zambian statehouse, where he had dinner with the country's president, Dr. Kenneth Kaunda. He met the president through a judge, Aiyadurai Sivanandan, who had become a devotee. We also printed a photo of Justice Sivanandan, dressed in his black judge's robes and powdered wig, with tilak on his forehead. The judge resigned his post in Zambia to serve ISKCON temple in India. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> ISKCON predecessors had predicted that in the dawning of Lord Chaitanya's golden age judges would wear tilak and become devotees.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{attracted}} interest {{around the world}} from the media (both TV and newspapers). In addition, we have received letters, emails and telephone calls. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>favorites</b> was a voicemail message asking us to return a call to Australia at which point we would learn who really killed JFK. We welcome the opportunity to respond to the letter to the editor from Mr. Fiorentino. Mr. Fiorentino claims that our "statement relating to the likelihood of a second assassin based on the premise of three or more separate bullets is demonstrably false. " In response we would like to simply quote from page 327 of Gerald Posner's book Case Closed, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most well known works supporting the single assassin theory: "If Connally was hit by another bullet, it had to be fired from a second shooter, since the Warren Commission's own reconstructions showed that Oswald could not have operated the bolt and refired in 1. 4 seconds. " Mr. Fiorentino also claims that the "second fatal flaw is the use of a rather uncomplicated formula based on Bayes Theorem. " Let E denote the evidence and T denote the theory that there were just two bullets (and hence a single shooter). We used Bayes Theorem to hypothetically calculate P(T|E) from P(E|T) and the prior probability P(T). In order to make P(T|E) ten times more likely than P(T̅|E), the ratio of the prior probabilities [i. e., P(T) / P(T̅) ] would have to be greater than 15. Thus, we again conclude that this casts serious doubt on Dr. Guinn's conclusion that the evidence supported just two bullets. Sadly, this is far from the first time that probability has been misunderstood and/or misapplied in a case of public interest. A notable British example is the Clark case. See Nobles and Schiff (2005) for details. Finally, we welcome and, in fact, encourage members of the scientific community to provide alternative analyses of the data.

6000|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> most <b>favorite</b> legendary resorts {{was the old}} barn. Sam Lawson {{preferred}} it on many accounts. It {{was quiet}} and retired, that is to say, at such distance from his own house, {{that he could not}} hear if Hepsy called ever so loudly, and farther off than it would be convenient for that industrious and painstaking woman to follow him. Then there was the soft fragrant cushion of hay, on which his length of limb could be easily bestowed. Our barn had an upper loft with a swinging outer door that commanded a view of the old mill, the waterfall, and the distant windings of the river, with its grassy green banks, its graceful elm draperies, and its white flocks of water-lilies; and then on this Saturday afternoon we had Sam all to ourselves. It was a drowsy, dreamy October day, when the hens were lazily [...] "craw, crawing," [...] in a soft, conversational undertone with each other, as they scratched and picked the hay-seed under the barn windows. Below in the barn black Cæsar sat quietly hatchelling flax, sometimes gurgling and giggling to himself with an overflow of that interior jollity with which he seemed to be always full. The African in New England was a curious contrast to everybody around him in the joy and satisfaction that he seemed to feel in the mere fact of being alive. Every white person was glad or sorry for some appreciable cause in the past, present, or future, which was capable of being definitely stated; but black Cæsar was in an eternal giggle and frizzle and simmer of enjoyment for which he could give no earthly reason: he was an [...] "embodied joy," [...] like Shelley's skylark.|$|R
