It was unveiled on April 4, 2013, {{as part of}} a press event held by Facebookserving as a successor to a pair of Facebook-oriented devices HTC released in 2011, it is the first Android device to be pre-loaded with Facebook's own user interface layer, Facebook Home in lieu of HTC's <b>own</b> <b>Sense.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene {{towards the end of}} the novel.|$|E
5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, the English {{began to}} {{consider}} themselves {{superior to the}} Welsh, Scots and Bretons. The English perceived themselves as civilised, economically prosperous and properly Christian, while the Celtic fringe was considered lazy, barbarous and backward. Following the invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, similar feelings were expressed about the Irish, with the distinctions clarified and reinforced in 14th-century English legislation. The English also felt strongly about the foreign traders {{who lived in the}} special enclaves in London in the Late Middle Ages; the position of the Jews is described below, but Italian and Baltic traders were also regarded as aliens and were frequently the targets of violence during economic downturns. Even within England, different identities abounded, each with their <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of status and importance. Regional identities could be important - men and women from Yorkshire, for example, had a clear identity within English society, and professional groups with a distinct identity, such as lawyers, engaged in open fighting with others in cities such as London.|$|E
5|$|Thermopylae {{is arguably}} the most famous battle in European ancient history, {{repeatedly}} referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, {{within the context of the}} Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians. The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, willing to do anything for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.|$|E
25|$|Manipulation and {{the quest}} for power are very {{prominent}} themes not only in the play but specifically in the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra. Both utilise language to undermine the power of the other and to heighten their <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of power.|$|E

6000|$|... "Afraid? Oh!" [...] cried Lady Lundie, distrusting the {{evidence}} of her <b>own</b> <b>senses.</b> [...] "You can't have said that? I have evidently misapprehended you. You didn't really say, afraid?" ...|$|R

25|$|Increasing organismic trust – {{they trust}} their own {{judgment}} {{and their ability}} to choose behavior that is appropriate for each moment. They do not rely on existing codes and social norms but trust that as they are open to experiences {{they will be able to}} trust their <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of right and wrong.|$|E
25|$|Legalization of {{the organ}} trade {{carries with it}} its <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of justice as well. Continuing black-market trade creates further {{disparity}} on the demand side: only the rich can afford such organs. Legalization of the international organ trade could lead to increased supply, lowering prices so that persons outside the wealthiest segments could afford such organs as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done to}} its reputation by devaluation, Wilson's Government suffered from the perception that its response to industrial relations problems was inadequate. A six-week strike of members of the National Union of Seamen, which began shortly after Wilson' re-election in 1966, did much to reinforce this perception, along with Wilson's <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of insecurity in office.|$|E
60|$|Both {{girls were}} fairly {{astonished}} at the sudden turn the affair had taken, and could scarcely credit their <b>own</b> <b>senses,</b> so illogically did this keen grim man seem to act. They {{did not know}} his motive.|$|R
60|$|We {{had carried}} the {{prostrate}} {{body to the}} sofa. Now our prisoner sat up, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed {{his hand over his}} forehead, like one who cannot believe his <b>own</b> <b>senses.</b>|$|R
30|$|Each CR {{within a}} {{coalition}} computes its local sensing decision and transmits {{it to the}} coalition head over the common control channel. The coalition head combines the local sensing decisions (including its <b>own</b> <b>sensing</b> decision) using an OR decision fusion rule.|$|R
25|$|His <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of {{injustice}} at family poverty, as {{three of his}} siblings died in infancy, was likewise fundamental to the strong identification with the working class that lay {{at the root of}} his political outlook. His formal education, at the local school, ended when he was thirteen. Pollitt was a boilermaker by trade and he frequently travelled around the country in this connection.|$|E
25|$|Alaric {{then moved}} south, {{intending}} to sail to Africa, but his ships were wrecked {{in a storm}} and he shortly died of fever. His successor Ataulf, still regarded as an usurper and given only occasional and short-term grants of supplies, moved north into the turmoil of Gaul, where there was some prospect of food. His supergroup of barbarians are called the Visigoths in modern works: they may now have been developing their <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{new king}} quickly imposed his <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of {{order on the}} Tuileries Gardens. His architects, Louis Le Vau and François d'Orbay, finally {{finished}} the Tuileries Palace, making a proper royal residence. In 1662, to celebrate {{the birth of his}} first child, Louis XIV held a vast pageant of mounted courtiers in the New Garden, which had been enlarged by filling in Charles V's moat and had been turned into a parade ground. Thereafter the square was known as the Place du Carrousel.|$|E
60|$|He was alert {{in every}} sense and fibre, and yet quite sure and steady, and lit up, as if transfused. He had a free {{sensation}} of walking in his own darkness, not in anybody else's world at all. He was purely a world to himself, {{he had nothing to}} do with any general consciousness. Just his <b>own</b> <b>senses</b> were supreme. All the rest was external, insignificant, leaving him alone with this girl whom he wanted to absorb, whose properties he wanted to absorb into his <b>own</b> <b>senses.</b> He did not care about her, except that he wanted to overcome her resistance, to have her in his power, fully and exhaustively to enjoy her.|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} it must be confessed that Ben was {{absolutely}} dumfounded, and Major Morris also. They had fully expected to see {{a woman in the}} hands of the regulars before them, and they could scarcely believe the evidence of their <b>own</b> <b>senses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Exploration of one's <b>own</b> <b>senses</b> {{and bodily}} {{perception}} is what Ho concern most. The visual presentation materializes and projects the innate personal experience as means of artistic expression {{which is expected}} to make up the communication between the [...] "Self" [...] and the [...] "Other".|$|R
25|$|Bullying: A bully may project his/her own {{feelings}} of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite {{the fact that}} a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability. Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.|$|E
25|$|Shaffer was {{inspired}} to write Equus when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses {{in a small town}} near Suffolk. He set out to construct a fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime. The play's action is something of a detective story, involving the attempts of the child psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart to understand the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of purpose.|$|E
25|$|Evans escorts Wade {{out of the}} hotel, and the two {{make their}} way across town, evading {{continuous}} gunfire from the combined gang and townsmen. Wade surprises Evans and nearly strangles him, but relents when Evans reveals that delivering Wade to the train {{is not only to}} provide for his family, but to restore his <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of honor, and give his sons something good to remember him for. Wade then admits he has already been to Yuma Prison and escaped twice, and agrees to board the train, allowing Evans' contract to be fulfilled.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} {{alone in the}} parlor and drew a long breath of relief. Captain Wragge's {{calculations}} had not deceived him. The evidence of her <b>own</b> <b>senses</b> had at last conquered the housekeeper's incredulity, and had literally forced her into the opposite extreme of belief.|$|R

30|$|When the {{clustering}} is completed, the steady-state operation (data transmission or top-k query) starts. When a relay cluster head {{receives the}} sensed data from its neighbor, the relay node will aggregate them with its <b>own</b> <b>sensed</b> data into one same-size packet and forward to sink along the data relay link.|$|R
25|$|Turkey {{does not}} appear to be the scene of {{large-scale}} or overt expressions of racism against individuals in the strictest sense of term. However, one of the main challenges facing Turkey in the field of ECRI's (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) concerns would appear to be the need to reconcile the strong sense of national identity and the wish to preserve the unity and integrity of the State with the right of different minority groups within Turkey to express their <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of ethnic identity, for example through the maintenance and development of linguistic and cultural aspects of that identity.|$|E
25|$|She {{should have}} been a man – a great navigator. Her {{powerful}} reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of right, was concerned.|$|E
25|$|During {{the twelfth}} and thirteenth centuries, the English began to {{consider}} themselves {{superior to the}} Welsh, Scots and Bretons. They perceived themselves as civilised, economically prosperous and properly Christian, while the Celtic fringe was considered lazy, barbarous and backward. Following the invasion of Ireland in the late twelfth century, similar feelings were expressed about the Irish, with the distinctions clarified and reinforced in fourteenth-century English legislation. The English also felt strongly about the foreign traders {{who lived in the}} special enclaves in London in the Late Middle Ages; there was considerable hostility to Jews, resulting in their expulsion, but Italian and Baltic traders were also regarded as aliens and were frequently the targets of violence during economic downturns. Even within England, different identities abounded, each with their <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> of status and importance. Regional identities could be significant – men and women from Yorkshire, for example, had a clear identity within English society, and professional groups with a distinct identity, such as lawyers, engaged in open fighting with others in cities such as London.|$|E

60|$|She liked Anthony, though. All her life, at intervals, she {{returned}} to the thought of him and of that which he offered. But she was a traveller, she was a traveller {{on the face of the}} earth, and he was an isolated creature living in the fulfilment of his <b>own</b> <b>senses.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I can't," [...] I {{answered}} with sullen resolution, though my eyes belied my words.

I KNOW it was you, and you only, who did it!" ...|$|R
