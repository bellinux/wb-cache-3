5000|$|The Swiss <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet</b> {{belongs to}} the <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet</b> group of its genus Erebia. These are found in taiga and alpine habitat across Eurasia, with one {{population}} in comparatively recent times colonizing North America. The <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet</b> group, like many Erebia, has a complicated taxonomy, with scores of [...] "variants" [...] having been named in the late 19th and early 20th century. Most of these in fact were simply aberrations, local or seasonal forms. As this was realized, the <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> of the Alps and Pyrenees were united in E. tyndarus, either as a superspecies or as a species.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> are {{a species}} group of ringlet {{butterflies}} in the genus Erebia. Though closely related, their monophyly {{is not completely}} resolved. Still, the <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> are taxa similar to E. tyndarus [...] - [...] the Swiss <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet</b> [...] - , {{and in many cases}} certainly close relatives. A notable trait of their genus is an ability to adapt well to cold and somewhat arid habitat, like taiga or regions with alpine climate. Optimal habitat in Eurasia, where most of the <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> are found, therefore occurs in two distinct belts [...] - [...] in the very north of the continent and in the Alpide belt [...] - [...] in interglacials, and in glacials in one periglacialic belt at lower altitude, in places interrupted by dry wasteland and deserts.|$|R

5000|$|While {{the details}} are still {{somewhat}} conjectural, a quite robust evolutionary scenario has been developed for the <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet</b> group: ...|$|R

5000|$|Erebia cassioides, or {{the common}} <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet,</b> which occurs on meadows {{somewhat}} further downhill {{than the other}} species and consequently is widely distributed {{in the rest of}} the Alps.|$|R
50|$|A {{peculiar}} {{case is the}} Colorado alpine, the nominate subspecies of Erebia callias. This isolated Rocky Mountains {{population has}} been lumped with the Siberian <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> as they are almost alike morphologically. Though one might suspect stronger differentiation and perhaps marked cryptic speciation across the wide range, the Rocky Mountains population is apparently a very recent isolate. Its ancestors apparently crossed over the Bering Strait {{at the end of}} the Wisconsinian glaciation, about 15,000 to 10,000 years ago. Thus, <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> are present on the North American continent quite exactly for the same length of time as a significant human population.|$|R
50|$|Erebia nivalis, or de Lesse's <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet,</b> is {{a member}} of the Satyrinae {{subfamily}} of the Nymphalidae family. It is found throughout the Alps of southern Austria with a remote population in central Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|Rather, {{it seems}} that quite a few proper species are involved. The Swiss <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet</b> in {{particular}} {{is part of a}} cryptic species complex from the Alps. These diverged {{at the end of the}} Riss/Saale glaciation roughly 130,000 years ago, when the available habitat shifted up the mountains. The ancestors of the Alpine <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> had lived in the lowlands when the Alps were entirely covered by ice, and as the ice retreated, their typical habitat moved upwards, and the butterflies with them. Thus, populations became isolated in different mountain ranges and with gene flow between them restricted started to evolve into distinct species.|$|R
50|$|Erebia rondoui, the Pyrenees <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet,</b> is {{a species}} of {{butterfly}} in the family Nymphalidae. It is found in France and Spain, where it is endemic to altitudes ranging from 1,650 to 2,300 meters above sea level in the Pyrenees.|$|R
50|$|Erebia calcaria, or Lorkovic's <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet,</b> is a {{butterfly}} {{of the family}} Nymphalidae. It {{is found in the}} Alps. The species inhabits southern exposed slopes with alpine grassland interspersed with rocks. Screes without vegetation or only a few grass tussocks cannot serve as habitat.|$|R
50|$|Erebia hispania, the Spanish <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet,</b> is {{a species}} of {{butterfly}} of the family Nymphalidae, endemic to the Sierra Nevada of southern Spain. The taxon rondoui (from the Pyrenees), previously considered as a subspecies of Erebia hispania, is considered now as a different species (Erebia rondoui) according to the results obtained in molecular studies.|$|R
50|$|Erebia callias {{has been}} lumped with the Siberian <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> {{as they are}} almost alike morphologically. Though one might suspect {{stronger}} differentiation and perhaps marked cryptic speciation across the wide range, the Rocky Mountains population is apparently a very recent isolate. Its ancestors apparently crossed over the Bering Strait {{at the end of}} the Wisconsinian glaciation, about 15,000 to 10,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|The adults fly {{only for}} a brief time during summer, mainly in July and August, feeding on nectar of the {{preferred}} yellow mountain flowers. The eggs are green, oval and show many longitudinal ribs. The caterpillars are grey-green to grey-brown, with dark longitudinal lines. The pupa is thick and brown coloured. The Swiss <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet</b> is univoltine and its caterpillars feed on Poaceae grasses, especially sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), matgrass (Nardus stricta), and various other fescues (Festuca) and meadow-grasses (Poa). They overwinter and pupate on the ground around May and June.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, as few {{as three}} species of <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> are accepted, or these are treated as superspecies. E. tyndarus is used for {{population}}s from the Pyrenees and Alps, and E. ottomana for those of the Balkans and the Caucasus. However, {{in this case the}} Caucasus population would also seem to warrant recognition at the same taxonomic rank as the others, as E. iranica. In addition, the related butterflies around Beringia have been united in the E. callias superspecies. Therefore, though E. callias might be split up on grounds of biogeography and ecology, the molecular and morphological data are still more in favor of retaining a single species.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, {{it became}} common to arrange {{supposed}} species and subspecies to [...] "species groups" [...] (not superspecies, but an informal phenetic arrangement) as pioneered by B.C.S. Warren, {{and attempt to}} resolve their true nature by and by. As molecular phylogenetic studies add to the available data, it is becoming clear that most [...] "varieties" [...] that have at least been commonly considered subspecies in the latter 20th century are indeed lineages distinct enough to warrant some formal degree of recognition. Another result of recent research is confirmation of the theory that this genus contains many glacial relict taxa, e.g., in the <b>brassy</b> <b>ringlet</b> group (E. tyndarus and similar species).|$|R
50|$|<b>Brassy</b> <b>ringlets</b> are mid-sized {{members of}} their genus, with a length of 17-22 mm (roughly two-thirds to one inch). Like their relatives, they have black eyespots on their forewings. The largest eyespots are placed, two on each side, near the wingtip, and have a white dot in the center; they are {{surrounded}} by a copper-colored patch that is lighter than the blackish-brown upperwings. In some, a third black spot, much smaller and without the white dot, is present {{at the opposite end}} of the reddish patch. The hindwings have no black spots in many, but in some taxa there are a few (2-4 or so) black dots, usually without white in the center, paralleling the outer margin. If hindwing spots are present, they are sometimes surrounded by a lighter brown field like the forewing spots, sometimes not. The wing undersides are cryptically colored, usually in grayish-brown and often with a noticeable band arching through the central hindwing, the rest of which has a silvery sheen which makes these species quite recognizable in flight. The eyespots and the forewing patch surrounding them are found on the forewing undersides also; if a hindwing pattern is present, it may or may not show up on the under hindwings either whole or in parts. The common name derives from the brassy luster of the dark wing uppersides. The valvae have a series of external spines pointing distally, with the first spine pair usually being largest.|$|R
