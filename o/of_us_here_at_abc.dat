5000|$|Every so often, Koppel {{ended the}} program with a [...] "Closing Thought", in which Koppel usually {{expressed}} his opinion {{on the subject of}} the night's broadcast. On his final night, urging viewers to continue watching the program, Koppel concluded his final Nightline broadcast with the following [...] "Closing Thought": There's this quiz I give to some of our young interns when they first arrive at Nightline. I didn't do it with the last batch; it's a little too close to home. [...] "How many of you", I'll ask, [...] "can you tell me anything about Eric Sevareid?" [...] Blank stares. [...] "How about Howard K. Smith or Frank Reynolds?" [...] Not a twitch of recognition. [...] "Chet Huntley? John Chancellor?" [...] Still nothing. [...] "David Brinkley" [...] sometimes causes a hand or two to be raised, and Walter Cronkite may be glad to learn that a lot of young people still have a vague recollection that he once worked in television news.What none of these young men and women in their late teens and early twenties appreciates, until I point it out to them, is that they have just heard the names of seven anchormen or commentators who were once so famous that everyone in the country knew their names. Everybody. Trust me, the transition from one anchor to another is not that big a deal. Cronkite begat Rather, Chancellor begat Brokaw, Reynolds begat Jennings. And each of them did a pretty fair job in his own right. You've always been very nice to me, so give this new anchor team for Nightline a fair break. If you don't, I promise you the network will just put another comedy show in this time slot. Then you'll be sorry. And that's our report for tonight, I'm Ted Koppel in Washington and from all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> <b>ABC</b> News, good night.|$|E

It doesn't seem possible that our four years as the caretaker of the [...] "National Pastime" [...] are over, but here we are...saying goodbye. And in that short time, not only did we have probably one of the greatest World Series ever between Atlanta and Minnesota, the seven gamer, we had also had arguably, one of the greatest World Seriesgames the other night. And folks, how about this one tonight!? In all, and you're looking at them now, a lot of memories...a lot of good memories! And we hoped that you cherish these pictures and these sounds as much as we enjoyed bringing them right into your homes. Time to say goodbye, but knowing full well...that the grand ol' game will never say goodbye! It's just keeps rolling up...the memories!

These are the sources we’ve been reading; if you have other recommendations for solid reporting and commentary on this developing situation, please post them in the comments section. 1. James Miles (Beijing bureau chief for the Economist and the author of The Legacy of Tiananmen: China in Disarray, on China in the aftermath of 1989) is apparently the only Western journalist who is or was in Lhasa. He’s published good reports like this one on the Economist‘s website and in theTimes (London). 2. An NPR report in which they interview Miles and also Luisa Lim, NPR’s Shanghai correspondent. 3. Here’s a good news round-up (to which China Beat’s Jeremiah Jenne has contributed). 4. For those curious about the cyberchatter the situation is generating, check out China Digital Times’ coverage. For translations into English of Chinese web chatter about Tibet, go to the Global Voices Online coverage here. 5. For those who would like to learn a little more about Tibet, here’s a list of seven things Westerners often get wrong about Tibet by Donald S. Lopez, Jr., author of Prisoners of Shangrila...|$|R

Eventually acquiring the name Ellicott Street, NY 63 crosses sparsely populated {{parts of the}} towns of Bethany and Batavia {{on its way to}} the city of Batavia. The route passes under the Depew, Lancaster and Western Railroad and the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision rail line on its way into downtown, where it intersects the two major east - west trunk routes in this corridor, NY 5 and NY 33. It overlaps with both roads for several blocks along Main Street, with NY 33 splitting off at Oak Street. This junction is also where NY 63 meets the north-south NY 98, which connects to the Thruway just north of the city.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{research}} projects some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the CCI are currently involved in, in cooperation with researchers from California State University, Uppsala University, and the Universities of Oslo and Bergen, aims to apply a cross-media and cross-national approach to exploring The Impact of Social Media on Agenda-Setting in Election Campaigns. As part of this project we recently trialled a method for analysing how social media are portrayed in traditional media outlets in relation to Australian politics. It is important to build a more nuanced understanding {{of the way in}} which new media’s role in public debate and political discussion is perceived and portrayed by and through more established publishing forums like newspapers, in order to identify the relation between the two, and how it may be shaped in the future. In connecting the discussion to the political, we aim to develop a deep understanding of how new media tools are perceived and implicated in the way in which politicians, journalists and the public actively do politics, and engage with one another in the process. Our aim is not to establish a pro or anti new or old media discourse, but to explore some of the intricate practices involved in political campaigning, reporting, and engagement. The upcoming federal election in Australia offers an excellent access point for doing this type of analysis. Our involvement with other research centres and universities around the world provides opportunities for cross-national comparison. Our initial qualitative study of how new media are portrayed as political tools in traditional media outlets is a starting point for some of this research. In this post I will provide a brief overview of the study and an insight into one of the themes that emerged from our content-analysis, namely how social media and traditional media are compared and contrasted in the publications we explored. Future posts will explore further themes, such as how different user groups are portrayed and how, why and for what purposes they employ new media tools in connection to politics...|$|R

6000|$|There is {{life and}} death going on in everything: truth and lies always at battle. Pleasure is always warring against self-restraint. Doubt is always crying Psha, and sneering.

Didn’t I tell you that dancing was a serious business to Harlequin? I have read two or three of Congreve’s plays over before speaking of him; and my feelings were rather like those, which I daresay most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> have had, <b>at</b> Pompeii, looking at Sallust’s house and the relics of an orgy, a dried wine-jar or two, a charred supper-table, the breast of a dancing girl pressed against the ashes, the laughing skull of a jester, a perfect stillness round about, as the cicerone twangs his moral, and the blue sky shines calmly over the ruin. The Congreve muse is dead, and her song choked in Time’s ashes. We gaze at the skeleton, and wonder at the life which once revelled in its mad veins. We take the skull up, and muse over the frolic and daring, the wit, scorn, passion, hope, desire, with which that empty bowl once fermented. We think of the glances that allured, the tears that melted, of the bright eyes that shone in those vacant sockets; and of lips whispering love, and cheeks dimpling with smiles, that once covered yon ghastly yellow framework. They used to call those teeth pearls once. See! there’s the cup she drank from, the gold chain she wore on her neck, the vase which held the rouge for her cheeks, her looking-glass, and the harp she used to dance to. Instead of a feast we find a gravestone, and in place of a mistress, a few bones! ...|$|R
40|$|A recent memo {{out of our}} {{regional}} office says that we shall refer to this subject as seasonal predator management. You know it covers {{a lot of other}} terms; we used to call it predator control and so on. But going back to the origins of predator management in this country, we generally think of protecting domestic crops, be it trees or grains or sheep or cattle. If you turn in another direction and look towards Europe, you can see many centuries of involvement in use of the land. There game {{is a product of the}} land and is owned by the landowner. They refer to game as their property and handle it as such. In some places it is managed out of existence, and in others it is highest on their agenda for production. Predators of game, if landowners want to raise game, are considered vermin. They are not given the time of day or words of praise. It gets down to standard approach and is not even talked about; landowners decided centuries ago that the vermin would be removed so that they could raise the pheasant or cottontail or whatever they want to raise. I think back to the philosophy of the balance of nature, a popularized conundrum during the youth <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> and maybe <b>at</b> Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center, where I worked from 1968 through 1984. In the early years (196 O 2 ̆ 7 s) most of the people there had grown up with that philosophy and teachings, and it was rather a shock to see what was occurring with duck nesting out there in the real world. It was a significant shock to see the overall effects on nesting. By 1973 there was a consensus at that station that it was something that had to be reckoned with in one way or another if we were going to preserve or enhance waterfowl production. We have not come to the point of European game management, although that may be arriving on the East Coast and other areas east of here...|$|R
