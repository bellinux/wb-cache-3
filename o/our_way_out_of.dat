25|$|In 1976, Robert Lucas of the Chicago {{school of}} {{economics}} introduced the Lucas critique, which called into question the logic behind Keynesian macroeconomic policy making. The new classical economics became the dominant school in macroeconomics. By the mid-1970s, policy makers were beginning to lose their confidence in the effectiveness of government intervention in the economy. In 1976 British Prime Minister James Callaghan said that the option of “spending <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> recession” no longer exists.|$|E
2500|$|When Nava and his {{production}} crew were, more or less, {{kicked out of}} Mexico during the film shoot, he had to re-create a Mexican village in California. [...] Nava said: [...] "We were filming in Mexico during {{the end of the}} López Portillo presidency, one of the last of the old-fashioned caciques to rule Mexico. One day, men with machine guns took over the set. I had guns pointed at my head. We were forced to shut down production, bribe <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country, fight to get our costumes back, and start shooting again in California. Ironically, in the United States our extras were real Mayan refugees. They were the people the movie was about." ...|$|E
40|$|Debates {{over the}} H- 1 B visa program and high-skilled {{immigration}} more generally in the United States {{need to be}} viewed {{in the context of}} America's position in the world as global hegemon or imperialist power. While those supporting and those opposing the expansion of the H- 1 B program may seem to be ideological opposites, both sides often share a common and comfortable assumption of the righteousness of US global domination, privilege and advantage. Challenging such assumptions and working <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the frequent dead-ends of the H- 1 B debates is essential for developing a globally progressive, equitable and anti-imperialist labor and education politics in America today...|$|R
40|$|The global {{crisis has}} gravely {{affected}} {{and continues to}} affect {{the lives of people}} around the planet. Some authors see it as an opportunity to change the paradigm for interpreting the problems of contemporary societies as well as the ensuing governance. In this article, I attempt to answer the question whether or to what extent public policy as a scientific discipline has helped us to explain the nature of this crisis and find <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. I conclude by proposing some desirable directions for this discipline’s further development {{in order to make it}} better capable of responding to the global challenges humanity is facing. ...|$|R

2500|$|Grayson {{voted for}} the House's 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). The bill would provide for a $50 million [...] "Hurricane Research Center" [...] in Central Florida, and Grayson claimed it would {{immediately}} generate new jobs. Grayson noted {{after the passage of}} the ACES Act his concern about our dependence on foreign oil, the need to promote green technologies, renewable energy sources, and the job creation from the bill (an estimated 95,000 jobs in Florida). [...] "This bill unleashes American ingenuity to solve the energy crisis. It lets us solve our problems by being Americans and thinking <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. We will become an international energy power," [...] he said in a news release.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964 {{a letter}} to Turner's {{directors}} from solicitors James Chapman & Co admitted: [...] "We have over the years {{been able to talk}} <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> claims or compromise for comparatively small amounts, but we have always recognised that at some stage solicitors of experience would, with the advance in medical knowledge and the development of the law, recognise there is no real defence to these claims and take us to trial." [...] By the mid-1970s however the number of asbestos-related deaths began to increase steadily and from 1980 onwards the asbestos market began to decline dramatically. In 1982 the company posted losses of £30million, including compensation payouts of £6million. In 1998, with 263,000 claims for industrial injury pending, Turner's was bought by Federal-Mogul. In 2001, Federal-Mogul filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related claims amounting to $351million. In the United Kingdom the business went into administration in October 2001 leaving a pension fund deficit estimated at £400 million. UK victims of the company's asbestos pollution were offered {{only a fraction of the}} compensation to which they were entitled. The weaving and asbestos producing areas of the Spodden Valley site were subsequently demolished in 2001.|$|E

6000|$|There {{is an old}} saying, {{probably}} as old as Genoa's first loot of her step-sister republic, [...] "If {{you want to see}} Pisa, you must go to Genoa," [...] which may have obscurely governed us in our purpose of stopping there on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Italy. We could not have too much of Pisa, as apparently the Genoese could not; but before our journey ended I decided that they would have thought twice before plundering Pisa if they had been forced to make their forays by means of the present railroad connection between the two cities. At least there would have been but one of the many wars of murder and rapine between the republics, {{and that would have been}} the first. After a single experience of the eighty tunnels on that line, with the perpetually recurring necessity of putting down and putting up the car-window, no army would have repeated the invasion; and, though we might now be without that satirical old saying, mankind would, on the whole, have been the gainer. As it was, the enemies could luxuriously go and come in their galleys and enjoy the fresh sea-breezes both ways, instead of stifling in the dark and gasping for breath as they came into the light, while their train ran in and out under the serried peaks that form the Mediterranean shore. I myself wished to take a galley from Leghorn, or even a small steamer, but I was overruled by less hardy but more obdurate spirits, and so we took the Florentine express at Pisa, where we changed cars.|$|R
40|$|It {{is assumed}} that any free energy funcuon {{exhibits}} strict periodic benav 10 r tor histories that have been periodic for all past times. This {{is not the case}} for the work function, which, however, has the usual defining properties of a free energy. Fonns given m fairly recent years for the minimum and related free energies of linear materials with memory have this property. Materials for which the minimal states are all singletons are those for which {{at least some of the}} singularities of the Fourier transfonn of the relaxation function are not isolated. For such materials, the maximum free energy is the work function, and free energies intermediate between the minimum free energy and the work function should be given by a linear relation involving these two quantities. All such functionals, except the minimum free energy, therefore do not have strict periodic behavior for periodic histories, which contradicts <b>our</b> assumption. A <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the difficulty is explored which involves approximating the relaxation function by a form for which the minimal states arc no longer singletons. A representation can then be given of an arbitrary free energy as a linear combination of the minimum, maximum and intennediate free energies derived in earlier work. This representation obeys our periodicity assumption. Numerical data are presented, supporting the consistency of this approach...|$|R
60|$|Winding <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{across and}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this valley, {{we came to}} a turn in the rocks, and beheld two more stone cabins, low and covered, so as to {{resemble}} what in America are called root-houses. They stood a little from the path, on the naked rock. Crossing to them, we dismounted and looked into the first. It was empty, had a little straw, and was intended for a refuge, in the event of storms. Thrusting my head into the other, after the eye had got a little accustomed to the light, I saw a grinning corpse seated against the remotest side. The body looked like a mummy, but the clothes were still on it, and various shreds of garments lay about the place. The remains of other bodies, that had gradually shrunk into shapeless masses, were also dimly visible. Human bones, too, were scattered around. It is scarcely necessary to add that {{this was one of the}} dead-houses, or places in which the bodies of those who perish on the mountain are deposited, to waste away, or to be claimed, as others may or may not feel an interest in their remains. Interment could only be effected by penetrating the rock, for there was no longer any soil, and such is the purity of the atmosphere that putrescence never occurs.|$|R
