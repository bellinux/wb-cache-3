50|$|After {{only a dozen}} public {{performances}} and barely four years old, the Philharmonic organized a concert to raise funds {{to build a new}} music hall. The centerpiece was the American premiere of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, to take place at Castle Garden on the southern tip of Manhattan. About 400 instrumental and vocal performers gathered for this premiere, which was conducted by George Loder. The chorals were translated into what would be the first English performance anywhere in the world. However, with the expensive US$2.00 ticket price and a war rally uptown, the hoped-for audience was kept away and the new hall would have to wait.

50|$|Other <b>odd</b> <b>work</b> in {{the early}} years of the new company {{included}} in 1924 a 36-seat petrol-fuelled rail vehicle for the Derwent Valley Light Railway. It was based on two Ford Model T chassis fitted with flanged steel tyres and coupled back-to-back, this rail minibus or petrol multiple unit seated 18 in each carriage and was driven from one end only, the rearward-facing car running in neutral gear with the engine switched off. When worked coupled fuel consumption was stated to be 14.33 mpg and if one unit was run the even more efficient figure of 17.55 mpg was obtained. It wasn't enough to save passenger operations on the line from oblivion however and the units were exported in 1926 to the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDR) in the north-west of Ireland who converted them from standard gauge to 3 ft gauge, lowering the bodies in the process. The CDR thus became the first railway in Ireland to use internal combustion engines and by the time of closure ran all passenger services and a number of freights using Gardner-powered diesel units.|$|E
5000|$|Lively and exciting, the {{technique}} can appear [...] "ostensibly slapdash" [...] - people often think that Hals 'threw' his works 'in one toss' (aus einem Guss) onto the canvas. This impression is not correct. True, the <b>odd</b> <b>work</b> was largely put down without underdrawings or underpainting ('alla prima'), {{but most of}} the works were created in successive layers, as was customary at that time. Sometimes a drawing was made with chalk or paint on top of a grey or pink undercoat, and was then more or less filled in, in stages. It does seem that Hals usually applied his underpainting very loosely: he was a virtuoso from the beginning. This applies, of course, particularly to his genre works and his somewhat later, mature works. Hals displayed tremendous daring, great courage and virtuosity, and had a great capacity to pull back his hands from the canvas, or panel, at the moment of the most telling statement. He didn't 'paint them to death', as many of his contemporaries did, in their great accuracy and diligence whether requested by their clients or not.|$|E

The work, first published in 1635, went through four editions to 1670 (in some of which revisions Swan changed his mind on 'certain not insignificant matters') and was reprinted in 1698, but lost favour in the more exacting scientific critical climate of the eighteenth century...|$|E

40|$|Background: Call center {{sector in}} India is a {{relatively}} new and fast growing industry driving employment and growth in modern India today. Most international call centers in National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi operate at <b>odd</b> <b>work</b> hours corresponding to a time suitable for their international customers. The sleep quality of call handlers employed in these call centers is in jeopardy owing to their altered sleep schedule. Objective: To assess the sleep quality and determine its independent predictors among call handlers employed in international call centers in NCR of Delhi. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted on 375 call handlers aged 18 – 39 years employed in international call centers in NCR of Delhi. Sleep quality was assessed using Athens Insomnia scale along with a pre-tested, structured questionnaire. Results: The mean age of respondents was 24. 6 (SD 2. 4) years. 78 % of participants were male. 83. 5 % of respondents were unmarried. 44. 3 % of call handlers were cigarette smokers.  Physical ailments were reported by 37 % call handlers. 77. 6 % of call handlers had some suspicion of insomnia or suspected insomnia; the rest had no sleep problem. Smoking, poor social support, heavy workload, lack of relaxation facility at office, and prolonged travel time to office were independent predictors of sleep quality (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Call handlers have to compromise upon their sleep owing to the contemporary work settings in call centers. Safeguarding their health becomes an occupational health challenge to public health specialists...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged work hours, {{shortened}} {{and irregular}} sleep patterns {{often leads to}} inadequate recovery in shift workers resulting in increased sleepiness or fatigue during the day. Heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) have been often used in occupational health studies to examine sleep quality and recovery. The aim {{of the current study}} was to determine the factors affecting the recovery process in shift working long-haul truck drivers and to as-sess the impact different shifts have on the drivers’ sleep health. Of the recruited volunteers, data collected from 38 volunteers (Age: 38. 46 ± 10. 89 years) satisfied the inclusion criteria for this study. Driver demographics and background questionnaires were obtained prior to measurements. R-R intervals and actigraphy data were collected for three intensive measurement days (non-night shift, night shift and lei-sure day) and subjective measures of sleep quality, recorded on the sleep-diary, were used for the analyses. Several time- and frequency-domain HRV indices were calculated in 10 -minute segments and averaged on an hourly basis and for the entire duration of sleep. All tests for statistical significance was conducted on a within-subject basis. Comparison of HRV indices over the entire sleep duration recorded on different in-tensive measurement days revealed no significant differences except for LF/HF ratio (Lei-sure day vs. Night shift, p < 0. 05). Sleep duration and efficiency were significantly lower on duty days. Regression analyses indicated VLF power was strong predictor of recovery and 31 % of the outcome was influenced by explanatory factors. SDNN (r = 0. 555, ad-justed r 2 = 0. 248, F(9, 92) = 5. 166, p < 0. 001), RMSSD (r = 0. 414, adjusted r 2 = 0. 131, F(9. 92) = 4. 229, p < 0. 05) and HF power (r = 0. 460, adjusted r 2 = 0. 165, F(9. 92) = 4. 526, p < 0. 001) were significantly associated with age and sleep duration. Short-term variabil-ity indices, RMSSD and HF power, were moderately influenced by diurnal variations. The results suggest that despite the fact that shift type does not have any direct con-sequences on sleep recovery, the <b>odd</b> <b>work</b> hours and irregular sleep schedules pose an indirect effect. The truncated sleep length, especially seen after night shift work, have been significantly associated with the impaired recovery and is contributed to by other short-term (diurnal variations) and long-term (ageing) factors. These results provide a basis for planning shift schedules such that direct or indirect manifestations of shift type-related influence on recovery are mitigated...|$|E
