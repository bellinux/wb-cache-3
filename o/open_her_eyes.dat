500|$|Many {{instances}} in the episode were character-driven. The {{action of the}} Angel to torture Amy [...] "for fun" [...] was met with anger from the Doctor but also gave him courage to defeat the Angels and save Amy. Moffat stated that in the scene in which the Doctor must {{figure out how to}} save Amy {{in a matter of seconds}} he was [...] "very basic...very pure, simple Doctor" [...] and did not have time to comfort Amy because his compassion would get in the way of his thinking process. River was also meant to understand this and explain to Amy that he needed to think. Moffat believed that Amy was [...] "passionate and a fighter and...also really smart" [...] which he showcased in the scene where Amy could not <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> for more than a second but was determined to do it for less than one. Moffat also believed that Amy's decision to attempt to seduce the Doctor was consistent with the character he had built up from her first episode. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment", although Moffat later admitted he regretted the way he wrote the scene, saying [...] "I played it for laughs, and it was so wrong". The Doctor's reaction was intended to be a reflection of how he often acted embarrassed and flustered when women behaved that way.|$|E
