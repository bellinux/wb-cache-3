500|$|The {{album was}} {{supposed}} to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: [...] "You can't really put records out in December if you want the whole world {{to have a chance to}} actually hear it, [...] my fans all over the world are very important to me", adding that she also wants to put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In astronomy, axial {{precession}} is a gravity-induced, slow, {{and continuous}} {{change in the}} orientation of an astronomical body's rotational axis. In particular, it can refer to the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth's axis of rotation, which, similar to a wobbling top, traces <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> cones joined at their apices in a cycle of approximately 26,000 years. The term [...] "precession" [...] typically refers only to this largest part of the motion; other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis—nutation and polar motion—are much smaller in magnitude.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{match was}} between Edge and William Regal for Edge's WWF Intercontinental Championship. In the {{beginning}} of the match, Edge had the advantage, showing his speed and agility. However, Regal threw Edge out of the ring, and knocked him against the barricade. In the ring, Regal hit Edge with a series of European uppercuts and reversed a sunset flip into a knee drop. Edge fought back and got several near-falls before Regal knocked Edge with a forearm smash but Edge kicked Regal to the outside. On the ring apron, Edge tried to hit Regal, a diving spear on the floor but Regal sidestepped and Edge crashed the ring steel steps. As the referee was distracted, Regal took <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> brass knuckles from under the ring and stuffed them into his tights. [...] In the ring, Regal hit Edge with a powerbomb and two double underhook suplexes. Regal then hit Edge with a series of brutal kicks and, when the referee turned around, he took out his brass knuckles. Edge immediately speared Regal to win and retain his title.|$|E
2500|$|... "First {{a pretty}} little girl dressed in white, with a felt bonnet to match, from which looked <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> dark eyes, and brown ringlets strayed upon the shoulders, a very {{picture of a}} charming maid of Kent, stepped forward, tripped her way onto the {{platform}} and presented Mrs Dence with a beautiful bouquet, which was received with a smile by the lady, and the gift repaid with a kiss; while those present loudly applauded. This was Miss Ida Iggulden, daughter of Councillor P.E. Iggulden, vice–chairman of the Council, who must be proud of her." [...] Anon, Herne Bay Press, 9 Apr 1904 Councillor Farley gave a speech glorifying the Pavilion, the town, and Mr Dence the donor. He said, to applause, that he [...] "hoped all would do their duty in maintaining and preserving it for the purpose for which it had been granted to the town". Mr Ingleton the builder presented a silver-gilt key to Mr Dence. On the front it bore an enamelled plate showing the heron, the clock tower and Reculver. The reverse of the key bore the inscription: [...] "Presented to T. Dence Esq., donor of the East Cliff Pavilion, Herne Bay, by A.S. Ingleton, April 4, 1904." [...] Palmer the architect explained the building's construction (detailed above), then Thomas Dence the donor gave a long and much applauded speech (also detailed above). An unnamed person unveiled the plaque commemorating Dence's gift, and the Clerk to the Council read and presented an address of thanks, engrossed and illuminated on vellum, to Dence. Various councillors followed that with speeches of mutual thanks and compliments, and the band on the roof ended the ceremony with God Save the King. Refreshments were provided in the gentlemen's reading room for the invited 300, who then joined the crowd on the roof to hear a concert by the Royal Engineers Band.|$|E
2500|$|Swervedriver {{appeared}} to rebound when they signed a three-album deal with DGC Records (a subsidiary of Geffen Records) in early 1996. Originally, the first album {{in the deal}} was to be an American release of Ejector Seat Reservation; the band had attempted to talk A into relinquishing them the rights, but after news of their talks with Geffen was publicized on the Internet, A had come back with an exorbitant price for its sale (to avoid the same missed opportunity after previously dropped Soul Asylum hit it big with 1992's Grave Dancers Union). With their advance, they finished building their own recording studio, Bad Earth in Farringdon, and instead began work on a new record for the label. Over the next year, the group would record 99th Dream with Moulder at the helm, this time taking a more simple, laid-back approach than with previous productions. They scaled back from 48-track to 24-track recording, condensing the layering of guitar in the process, and employed more full-ensemble straight live track, partly with the mindset of {{making it easier to}} play the guitar lines live. During that time, the band also put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> self-produced boutique label seven-inch singles, including the double split [...] "Why Say Yeah" [...] with indie collaboration act Sophia. DGC distributed promotional copies of the album and scheduled a release date of 7 May 1997. Meanwhile, in December 1996 Swervedriver went back into the studio and re-recorded the album track [...] "These Times," [...] citing their growing dislike for the original's faster-paced, Oasis-like sound and a bad experience with one of the label's reps during mixing. Three and a half weeks before 99th Dream was due to be released, DGC dismissed the band's A representative, Jody Kurilla, in a corporate downsizing and three hours later terminated their contract (though they would not impede the record's future release). Considering the recent break with their third label in two years, Hindmarsh stated, [...] "Someone from A once told us that it takes four or five listens to a Swervedriver album to see {{whether you like it or}} not, and in this marketplace, unless you can hit immediately it's not going to register with people." ...|$|E
