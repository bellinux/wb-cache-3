40|$|In {{a series}} of <b>ozone-sonde</b> {{soundings}} at the Hohenpeißenberg observatory, starting in 1967, the most striking features are increases of sim 2. 2 % per year in all tropospheric heights up to 8 km during the past 24 years. These facts have recently been published and discussed by several authors. In this paper, we present some evidence for the increase of tropospheric ozone concentrations during the past 50 years 1940 - 1990 in {{the territory of the}} northern edge of the Bavarian Alps, including the Hohenpeißenberg data. In December 1940 and August 1942, probably the first exact wet-chemical vertical soundings of ozone up to 9 km height were made by an aircraft in the region mentioned. These results were published in the earlier literature. We have converted the results of the flights on 4 days in December 1940 and on 6 days in August 1942 to modern units and have compared them with the Hohenpeißenberg <b>ozone-sonde</b> data of the December and August months. We also compared the data at the ground with the August results of Paris-Montsouris 1886 - 1898. Our results show an increase of ozone concentration at all tropospheric heights in Upper Bavaria during the past 50 years, compared with the Montsouris data in August during the past 105 years. In the recently published papers, the increases since 1967 were approximated linearly. Our results, extended to the past, show non-linear trends, with steeper increases since 1975 - 1979. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed. Quite recently (in case of the December months since 1986 / 87, the August months since 1990), the ozone mixing ratios at and above Hohenpeißenberg seem to have decreased...|$|E
40|$|In the {{austral spring}} of 1986, {{a program of}} {{measurements}} of the ozone altitude profile (for the z values between 25 and 55 km), relevant {{to an understanding of}} the ozone hole, was conducted at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The measurements were performed using ground-based millimeter-wave spectrometry. It was found that the ozone mixing ratio peaked at altitudes ranging from 28 to 34 km, with peak values between 5 and 9 ppm by volume. During the period between September 12 and October 29, the ozone mixing ratio decreased, with great variability, by about 15 percent at 25 km, with no significant decrease at higher altitudes. The observation of the depletion occurring only below 25 km is consistent with <b>ozone-sonde</b> observations during previous years...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{concentration}} cell (ECC) <b>ozone-sonde</b> observations, made {{in recent years}} at ten stations whose locations range from the Arctic to Antarctica, have yielded a self-consistent ozone data base from which mean seasonal and annual latitudinal ozone vertical distributions to 35 km have been derived. Ozone measurement uncertainties are estimated, and results are presented in the Bass-Paur (1985) ozone absorption coefficient scale adopted for use with Dobson ozone spectrophotometers January 1, 1992. The data should be useful for comparison with model calculations of the global distribution of atmospheric ozone, for serving as apriori statistical information in deriving ozone vertical distributions from satellite and Umkehr observations, and for improving the satellite and Umkehr ozone inversion algorithms. Attention is drawn to similar results based on a less comprehensive data set published in Ozone in the Atmosphere, Proceedings of the 1988 Quadrennial Ozone Symposium where errors in data tabulations occurred for three of the stations due to inadvertent transposition of ozone partial pressure and air temperature values...|$|E

Using correlative data from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MODIS) instrument and the Lagrangian model FLEXPART 8. 1, we show the influ- ence of the southern hemisphere biomass burning season on this seasonal variability, especially {{the impact of the}} biomass burning activity in South America and Southern Africa. A case of stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange is identified on February 2009, with an enriched ozone layer anticorrelated with water vapor.

40|$|Quite often {{mid-latitude}} ozone profiles show large secondary ozone maxima {{below the}} main ozone concentration maximum at around 22 km altitude. The author reports some examples for such secondary maxima and then proceeds to climatological features and long-term variability aspects of secondary maxima. His investigation {{is based on}} <b>ozone-sondes</b> flown regularly since 1969 at Uccle, Belgium, and on global SAGE II satellite data. Some information on mechanisms leading {{to the formation of}} secondary maxima is presented. The paper cites older work, but does not provide very detailed examples or major new insights. To me the regression of total ozone variations by parameters describing secondary ozone maxima in last part of the paper is highly questionable. However, the reported trend in secondary maxima is very interesting by itself. S 550 My problems with the regression relating total ozone and aspects of secondary maxima are the following: Total ozone variability is almost entirely driven by lower stratospheric variability. Secondary maxima occur in the lower stratosphere and are an intrinsi...|$|R
40|$|Between November 1999 and April 2000, {{two major}} field experiments, the SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE) and the Third European Stratospheric Experiment on Ozone (THESEO 2000), collaborated {{to form the}} largest field {{campaign}} yet mounted to study Arctic ozone loss. This international campaign involved more than 500 scientists from over 20 countries spread across the high and mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere. The main scientific aims of SOLVE-THESEO 2000 were to study (a) the processes leading to ozone loss in the Arctic vortex and (b) the effect on ozone amounts over northern mid-latitudes. The campaign included satellites, heavy lift balloon launches, 6 different aircraft, ground stations, and scores of <b>ozone-sonde.</b> Campaign activities were principally conducted in 3 intensive measurement phases centered on early December 1999, late January 2000, and early March 2000. Observations made during the campaign showed that temperatures were unusually cold in the polar lower stratosphere {{over the course of}} the 1999 - 2000 winter. These cold temperatures resulted in the formation of extensive polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) across the Arctic. Heterogeneous chemical reactions on the surfaces of the PSC particles produced high levels of reactive chlorine within the polar vortex by early January. This reactive chlorine catalytically destroyed about 60 % of the ozone in a layer near 20 km between late January and mid-March 2000...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Match method quantifies {{chemical}} {{ozone loss}} in the polar stratosphere. The basic idea consists in calculating the forward trajectory of an air parcel that has been probed by an ozone measurement (e. g., by an ozone sonde or satellite) and finding a second ozone measurement close to this trajectory. Such an event is called a ''match''. A rate of chemical ozone destruction {{can be obtained by}} a statistical analysis of several tens of such match events. Information on the uncertainty of the calculated rate can be inferred from the scatter of the ozone mixing ratio difference (second measurement minus first measurement) associated with individual matches. A standard analysis would assume that the errors of these differences are statistically independent. However, this assumption may be violated because different matches can share a common ozone measurement, so that the errors associated with these match events become statistically dependent. Taking this effect into account, we present an analysis of the uncertainty of the final Match result. It has been applied to Match data from the Arctic winters 1995, 1996, 2000, and 2003. For these <b>ozone-sonde</b> Match studies the effect of the error correlation on the uncertainty estimates is rather small: compared to a standard error analysis, the uncertainty estimates increase by 15 % on average. However, the effect is more pronounced for typical satellite Match analyses: for an Antarctic satellite Match study (2003), the uncertainty estimates increase by 60 % on average...|$|E
40|$|Ozone (O 3) is a {{greenhouse}} gas and toxic pollutant which {{plays a major}} role in air quality. Typically, monitoring of surface air quality and O 3 mixing ratios is primarily conducted using in situ measurement networks. This is partially due to high-quality information related to air quality being limited from space-borne platforms due to coarse spatial resolution, limited temporal frequency, and minimal sensitivity to lower tropospheric and surface-level O 3. The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) satellite is designed to address these limitations of current space-based platforms and to improve our ability to monitor North American air quality. TEMPO will provide hourly data of total column and vertical profiles of O 3 with high spatial resolution to be used as a near-real-time air quality product. TEMPO O 3 retrievals will apply the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory profile algorithm developed based on work from GOME, GOME- 2, and OMI. This algorithm uses a priori O 3 profile information from a climatological data-base developed from long-term <b>ozone-sonde</b> measurements (tropopause-based (TB) O 3 climatology). It has been shown that satellite O 3 retrievals are sensitive to a priori O 3 profiles and covariance matrices. During this work we investigate the climatological data to be used in TEMPO algorithms (TB O 3) and simulated data from the NASA GMAO Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS- 5) Forward Processing (FP) near-real-time (NRT) model products. These two data products will be evaluated with ground-based lidar data from the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) at various locations of the US. This study evaluates the TB climatology, GEOS- 5 climatology, and 3 -hourly GEOS- 5 data compared to lower tropospheric observations to demonstrate the accuracy of a priori information to potentially be used in TEMPO O 3 algorithms. Here we present our initial analysis and the theoretical impact on TEMPO retrievals in the lower troposphere...|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{profiles}} in polar latitudes during summer reveal {{a strong and}} persistent inversion layer as-sociated with the polar summer tropopause. This inversion layer {{is characterized by a}} temperature increase of; 8 K in the first 2 – 3 km above the tropopause and is observed throughout summer polar latitudes in both hemispheres. Radiosonde and GPS radio occultation temperature observations are used to document char-acteristics of the inversion layer, including its seasonal variability and modulation by synoptic meteorological systems (cyclones and anticyclones). Previous analyses have suggested a radiative mechanism for formation and maintenance of tropopause inversions, related to water vapor and ozone near the tropopause. Fixed dynamical heating (FDH) calculations are used herein to investigate this behavior in polar regions, based on observed seasonally varying profiles of water vapor (from satellite measurements) and ozone (from <b>ozone-sondes).</b> Water vapor exhibits a strong seasonal cycle throughout the troposphere and lowest stratosphere, with a pronounced summer maximum, which is primarily a result of the seasonally varying tropospheric temperatures. The FDH calculations suggest that enhanced summer water vapor leads to strong radiative cooling in a narrow layer near the tropopause, so that the radiative influence of water vapor provides a pri-mary mechanism for the summer inversion layer. 1...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{about ten}} Differential Absorption Lidars {{are used for}} {{long-term}} monitoring of stratospheric ozone. These systems are {{an important component of}} the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change. Although DIALs are self-calibrating in principle, regular intercomparisons with other ozone-lidars, microwave radiometers or <b>ozone-sondes</b> are highly desirable to ensure high data quality at a well known level. The Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC) validation policy suggests that such intercomparisons be "blind", meaning all participants submit their data to an impartial referee, without seeing results from the other participants. Here we report on the "blind" intercomparison taking place from January 20 th to February 10 th 1998 at Ny-Alesund, Spitsbergen (78. 92 deg N, 11. 95 deg E). Participating groups were from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Potsdam, operating the NDSC DIAL system at Ny-Alesund, from the University of Bremen operating the NDSC microwave radiometer for ozone profiling at Ny-Alesund, and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center group with the "NDSC travelling standard" STROZ-LITE. The first author acted as the impartial referee. Also used for the intercomparison were data from ECC- 6 A/Vaisala RS 80 ozone sondes routinely launched at Ny-Alesund by the AWI group. A 1 % KI solution (3 ml) and the 1986 ECC pump correction (1. 092 at 5 hPa) are used. The ECC-data were available to all participants during the campaign and thus were not "blind".

40|$|Accurate and {{temporally}} resolved {{fields of}} free-troposphere ozone are of major importance {{to quantify the}} intercontinental transport of pollution and the ozone radiative forcing. In this study we {{examine the impact of}} assimilating ozone observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) in a global chemical transport model (MOdèle de Chimie Atmosphérique à Grande Échelle, MOCAGE). The assimilation of the two instruments is performed by means of a variational algorithm (4 -D-VAR) and allows to constrain stratospheric and tropospheric ozone simultaneously. The analysis is first computed for the months of August and November 2008 and validated against <b>ozone-sondes</b> measurements to verify the presence of observations and model biases. It is found that the IASI Tropospheric Ozone Column (TOC, 1000 – 225 hPa) should be bias-corrected prior to assimilation and MLS lowermost level (215 hPa) excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, a longer analysis of 6 months (July–August 2008) showed that the combined assimilation of MLS and IASI is able to globally reduce the uncertainty (Root Mean Square Error, RMSE) of the modeled ozone columns from 30 % to 15 % in the Upper-Troposphere/Lower-Stratosphere (UTLS, 70 – 225 hPa) and from 25 % to 20 % in the free troposphere. The positive effect of assimilating IASI tropospheric observations is very significant at low latitudes (30 ° S– 30 ° N), whereas it is not demonstrated at higher latitudes. Results are confirmed by a comparison with additional ozone datasets like the Measurements of OZone and wAter vapour by aIrbus in-service airCraft (MOZAIC) data, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) total ozone columns and several high-altitude surface measurements. Finally, the analysis is found to be little sensitive to the assimilation parameters and the model chemical scheme, due to the high frequency of satellite observations compared to the average life-time of free-troposphere/low-stratosphere ozone...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a near-real-time {{approach}} to data assimilation for {{the estimation of}} the three-dimensional global ozone distribution based on the transport model TM 3 is presented. TM 3 uses the meteorological data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts to transport the ozone field. The ozone profiles used in the assimilation are retrieved from measurements of the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment instrument (GOME) on the European Space Agency's European Remote Sensing- 2 satellite. A simplified Kalman filter technique is chosen as a data assimilation technique since it not only estimates the ozone distribution globally but also quantifies the uncertainty in its estimate. The NRT data assimilation technique is demonstrated {{for the period of}} March-June 2000. The results presented in this paper show that the estimated profiles deviate from the measurements by, on a global average, 15 % of the ozone values in pressure layer 163 - 119 hPa and ranging from 6 % to 2 % of the ozone values between 119 hPa and 40 hPa. The deviation of the estimate from the measurements decreases with altitude and reaches 0. 05 % of the ozone value in the layer 2 - 0 hPa. Comparison with <b>ozone-sonde</b> observations shows that the model driven by observed meteorological fields is capable of describing the main spatial and temporal variations. Comparison with data from the Halogen Occultation Experiment instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite shows that assimilating the retrieved profiles from GOME improves the vertical description of ozone profiles mainly in the stratosphere and the upper troposphere. Moreover, the integrated ozone-profile estimate is compared with the total-column ozone measurements made by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer. This shows that assimilating the ozone profiles results in a better description of the total column than the ten-day forecast...|$|E
40|$|The {{chlorine}} chemistry under highly activated polar stratospheric spring conditions {{is critical to}} understanding the dramatic ozone losses {{that lead to the}} formation of the stratospheric ozone hole'. A particular flight pattern of the Geophysica high altitude aircraft during VINTERSOL-EUPLEX/SOLVE II on the 30 th January 2003 in the Arctic was designed to test our theoretical understanding of the ClO/ClOOCl system. The outbound and inbound flight legs followed a calculated pattern such that the same air masses were sampled before and after sunset. During the inbound flight three encounters of the contrail from the outbound flight confirmed the success of the flight planning. In-situ ClO measurements were examined to study the conversion of ClO into its nighttime reservoir during sunset. Applying a trajectory Match technique, traditionally used to examine <b>ozone-sonde</b> concentrations, we examined this 3 hour period of ClO observations. 72 ClO Match pairs were identified with temperatures ranging between 200 - 206 K and SZAs between 84 o and 95 o. For a given Match pair the total active chlorine ClOx is assumed to be constant, but allowed to vary between Matches. This allowed the kinetic parameters controlling the ClO concentration - Keq, kf and J with differing SZA and temperatures to be closely examined. Due to the particular design of the flight pattern we are able to retrieve robust values for Keq based on ClO measurements alone. Hence our results for Keq are independent of the more uncertain dimer measurements (ClOOCl). We find values for Keq that are about a factor of 3 - 4 smaller than current JPL recommendations relatively independent of kf and J, as long as kf is larger than 70 % of its recommended value. Derived values for J and ClOx are strongly anticorrelated. Hence, without dimer observations the retrieved J is very sensitive to assumptions about ClOx. However, using total available chlorine as an upper limit for ClOx, we find that the upper limits of the current JPL 2006 recommended range of uncertainty for J are required to explain the data of the self-Match fight. If measured values of ClOOCl are used to better constrain ClOx, even larger values of J are inferred. These results contrast with a recent laboratory measurement of the ClO dimer cross sections (Pope et al. 2007, J. Phys. Chem., in press), which leads to large differences between modeled and measured ClO. We shall explore additional chemical mechanisms that could account for observed ClO and ClOOCl during the self-Match flight, in light of the new laboratory cross section...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{is to develop a}} portable, eye-safe, ground-based ozone lidar instrument specialized for ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) measurements in the troposphere. This research project directly supports the goal of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise to understand the distribution and budget of tropospheric ozone (objective 1. 5 of the Earth Science Strategic Enterprise Plan, 1998 - 2002). It can participate in ground validation experiments for TES, a tropospheric ozone satellite mission due to be launched in 2002. It can also be utilized for correlative ground measurements in future GTE (Global Tropospheric Experiment) and space-based ozone lidar missions, such as ORACLE. Multiple ground-based ozone lidar systems would improve the data obtained through current <b>ozone-sonde</b> networks. This prototype instrument could to serve as the basic unit for these and other future monitoring projects requiring multi-instrument networks, such as that proposed for the Global Tropospheric Ozone Project (GTOP). GTOP is currently being formulated by a scientific panel of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project to meet its goal to better understand the processes that control the global distribution of tropospheric ozone. In order for the lidar to be widely deployed in networks, it must be fairly easy to use and maintain as well as being cost-competitive with a ground station launching ozonesondes several times a day. A second 2 -year grant to continue this effort with students participating in ground tests and system improvements has been awarded by the Office of Equal Employment Opportunities (OEOP). This project also supports existing NASA lidar missions through its development of advanced, compact lidar technology. Innovations in both transmitters and receivers have been made in this project. Finally, this system could be modified in the future to probe more deeply into the stratosphere. This could be accomplished by increasing the emitted energy or optimizing the wavelengths for this purpose. In addition to NASA, this system has applications to the EPA, NOAA, and the DOD. An AFOSR grant has been awarded {{based on the results of}} this effort to fund advanced transmitter development at medium (20 - 40 mJ) energies. A second proposal to the DOD with a letter of support from Air Force Research Laboratory, has been submitted to extend this uv laser technology to 100 mJ levels. Thus, this project has enabled students and faculty at Hampton University to begin to develop research efforts in support of the mission of the DOD. This instrument will be based at Hampton University (HU) to meet our educational goal to train students in lidar technology as well as atmospheric ozone data analysis and interpretation. It will be also available for off-site measurement campaigns and will serve as a test bed for further instrument development. Later development beyond this grant to extend the scientific usefulness of the instrument may include incorporation of an aerosol channel and upgrading the laser to make stratospheric ozone measurements. Seven undergraduates, three graduate students, and one postdoctoral. researcher (formerly an HU student) have been active participants in this research effort...|$|E
40|$|Tropospheric water-vapour {{and ozone}} measurements, using {{calibrated}} balloon-borne sensors, are reported from the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX). The sensors were launched from the Research Vessel Vickers along 2 degrees S latitude between 156 degrees E (west {{of the international}} date line) and 155 degrees W (east of the date line). These measurements are combined with those from water-vapour sondes launched over the western Pacific warm pool, during the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE). Taking the two experiments CEPEX and TOGA-COARE together, the sensors included frost-point hygrometers, Humicap-A Vaisala sondes, Humicap-H Vaisala sondes and electrochemical <b>ozone-sondes.</b> Taken together, the CEPEX and TOGA-COARE data provide over 150 vertical profiles of water vapour within the troposphere in varied conditions of convective activity ranging from disturbed to suppressed. The primary motivation behind the present analyses is to understand the role of tropical deep convection in the vertical distribution of water-vapour. With this in mind, the profiles have been analysed in relation to occasions of recent deep convection and occasions when convection was suppressed. We employ three different criteria to identify the profiles influenced by deep convection brightness temperature in the infrared-window channel of the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS); ozone as a quasi-conservative tracer for deep convection; and using water vapour itself, that is the wettest versus the driest soundings. Irrespective of the criteria used, we report here that the atmosphere, while {{under the influence of}} active deep convection, was found to have relative humidities in excess of 75 % over most of the troposphere between the surface and about 14 km. The sondes were launched routinely over a period of 45 days (between CEPEX and TOGA-COARE), without biasing the sample towards convectively disturbed conditions. A feature of the convectively disturbed profile is a distinct minimum in relative humidity at about 700 hPa, where it was as low as 65 %. The low relative humidity was accompanied by relatively high ozone mixing ratios, which raises the possibility of long-range transport of dry sub-tropical air into the warm, convectively disturbed, regions of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Inspection of the analysed fields, and the wind fields from the sondes, supports this assertion. It then follows that the omnipresent minimum of moist static energy and minimum relative humidity at 700 hPa in the inner tropics {{may be the result of}} long-range, inclined, transport of dry air from non-convective regions. This detection suggests a linkage between the large-scale circulation, deep convection and the thermodynamic structure within the equatorial troposphere. The results presented here demonstrate the applicability of ozone as a quasi-conservative tracer of transport in the context of deep convection. The ozone-based criterion is used to diagnose recent deep convection, independent of the GMS satellite observations, and allows one to follow the evolution of relative humidity and of water-vapour mixing ratio after the dissipation of the cloud anvil to optically thin conditions. We show that the troposphere dries to low humidity soon after anvil dissipation. This observation leads to the hypothesis that moistening of the atmosphere, away from the core of Cb convection, occurs by evaporation of precipitation falling out of the anvils. After anvil dissipation, the ensuing subsidence in clear air causes the relative humidity and the water mixing ratio to decrease...|$|R
