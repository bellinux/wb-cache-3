5|$|Shortly {{after these}} events, Russia {{experienced}} the February Revolution, which brought to power a liberal Russian Provisional Government. As {{a consequence of}} these, the whole transfer project was delayed, but the Russian acceptance <b>of</b> <b>self-determination</b> facilitated renewed political action.

5|$|From 1828 {{with the}} Treaty of Turkmenchay to the October Revolution in 1917, Eastern Armenia {{was part of}} the Russian Empire and partly {{confined}} to the borders of the Erivan Governorate. After the October Revolution, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin's government announced that minorities in the empire could pursue a course <b>of</b> <b>self-determination.</b> Following the collapse of the empire, in May 1918 Armenia, and its neighbors Azerbaijan and Georgia, declared their independence from Russian rule and each established their respective republics.

5|$|Less {{concrete}} changes {{include the}} growing assertiveness of the Dominions within the British Empire. Battles such as Gallipoli for Australia and New Zealand, and Vimy Ridge for Canada led to increased national pride {{and a greater}} reluctance to remain subordinate to London. These battles were often portrayed favourably in these nations' propaganda as symbolic of their power during the war. The war released pent-up indigenous nationalism, as populations tried {{to take advantage of}} the precedent set by the introduction <b>of</b> <b>self-determination</b> in eastern Europe. Britain was to face unrest in Ireland (1919–21), India (1919), Egypt (1919–23), Palestine (1920–21) and Iraq (1920) at a time when they were supposed to be demilitarising. Nevertheless, Britain's only territorial loss came in Ireland, where the delay in finding a resolution to the home rule issue, along with the 1916 Easter Rising and a failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland, increased support for separatist radicals, and led indirectly to the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, {{established}} a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This {{was due to}} differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, {{at the same time}} claiming increased state independence. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right <b>of</b> <b>self-determination.</b>|$|E
5|$|This tactic did {{not prove}} successful: pro-Nazi {{propaganda}} and protests were rampant, {{even among the}} Lithuanian population, and the local government was powerless to prevent them. The Nazis physically harassed Lithuanian organizations. On 1 November 1938 Lithuania was pressured into lifting martial law and press censorship. During the December elections to the Klaipėda Parliament, pro-German parties received 87% of votes (25 seats out of 29) in the Klaipėda territory. Dr. Ernst Neumann, the chief defendant in the 1934 trials, {{was released from prison}} in February 1938 and became the leader of Klaipėda's pro-German movement. In December he was received by Adolf Hitler, who assured him that the Klaipėda issue would be resolved by March or April 1939. Neumann and other Nazi activists claimed the right <b>of</b> <b>self-determination</b> for the region and demanded that Lithuania open negotiations over the political status of Klaipėda. The parliament was expected to vote for a return to Germany when it convened on 25 March 1939. Germany's official channels maintained silence on the issue. Germany hoped that Lithuania would voluntarily give up the troubled region, and a public stance could have disturbed the sensitive discussions it was then engaged in with Poland over an anti-Communist alliance against the Soviet Union.|$|E

40|$|Background. Today, {{young people}} are more focused on getting {{education}} as such, without {{taking into account the}} profession. The relevance of this study is the identification of the level <b>of</b> professional <b>self-determination</b> <b>of</b> senior pupils, the mechanisms of formation of professional preferences. The article contains the concept and content <b>of</b> professional <b>self-determination</b> in adolescence; {{the results of the study}} on the formation <b>of</b> professional <b>self-determination</b> in senior pupils are presented. The study conducted among 9 th grade pupils of secondary schools has revealed that the further gradual <b>self-determination</b> <b>of</b> the future specialty depends not only on psychological readiness for conscious choice. Materials and methods. The study involved 982 pupils of secondary schools in Ukraine. To study the level of formation of professional readiness, there was conducted a survey on the developed questionnaire. Statistical analysis was carried out using MS Excel and SPSS 17. Results. The results showed that professional intents of 9 -graders are a key feature for solving the problem of high school selection and future careers. But for most students, these intentions are contradictory due to objective reasons. Radio, television, books don’t have a significant impact on the choice <b>of</b> professional <b>self-determination.</b> Conclusions. The conducted survey is self-sufficient for the analysis of professional orientation. But the choice of profession by the students is influenced by many factors. Therefore, carrying out the studies on vocational guidance requires an integrated approach...|$|R

2500|$|The {{inherent}} {{weaknesses in}} using pre-determined ethnic identities to form power sharing systems has led Ljiphart {{to argue that}} adopting a constructivist approach to consociationalism can increase its likelihood <b>of</b> success. The <b>self-determination</b> <b>of</b> ethnic identities {{is more likely to}} be [...] "non-discriminatory, neutral, flexible and self-adjusting." [...] For example, in South Africa, the toxic legacy of apartheid meant that successful consociation could only be built on the basis <b>of</b> the <b>self-determination</b> <b>of</b> groups. Ljiphart claims that because ethnic identities are often [...] "unclear, fluid and flexible," [...] self-determination is likely to be more successful than pre-determination of ethnic groups. [...] A constructivist approach to consociational theory can therefore strengthen its value as a method to resolve ethnic conflict.|$|R
