5|$|A limited fauna {{is known}} from the upper section of the Oldman Formation, and Corythosaurus casuarius as well as C. intermedius are among the taxa. Also from the section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> are the theropods Daspletosaurus, and Saurornitholestes, the hadrosaurids Brachylophosaurus, Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, and the ankylosaurid Scolosaurus, and the ceratopsians Coronosaurus and Chasmosaurus. Other genera are known, but do not persist from the upper section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation,</b> and {{therefore}} are not contemporaries of Corythosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Corythosaurus casuarius is {{widespread}} throughout the lower {{unit of the}} Dinosaur Park Formation. In it, Corythosaurus {{was found to be}} closely associated with the ceratopsid Centrosaurus apertus. Their associating was found in the Dinosaur Park, Judith River, and Mesaverde formations, and also in the Wind River Basin and the Wheatland County area. Corythosaurus lived alongside numerous other giant herbivores, such as the hadrosaurids Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, the ceratopsids Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus, and ankylosaurids Scolosaurus, Edmontonia and Dyoplosaurus in the earliest stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation,</b> Dyoplosaurus, Panoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus in the middle age, and Euoplocephalus alone in later stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation.</b> Studies of the jaw anatomy and mechanics of these dinosaurs suggests they probably all occupied slightly different ecological niches in order to avoid direct competition for food in such a crowded eco-space. The only large predators known from the same levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> as Corythosaurus are the tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus libratus and an unnamed species of Daspletosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Like other bird-hipped dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gryposaurus {{appears to}} have only existed {{for part of the}} {{duration}} of time that the rocks were being formed. As the formation was being laid down, it recorded a change to more marine-influenced conditions. Gryposaurus is absent from the upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation,</b> with Prosaurolophus present instead. Other dinosaurs known from only the lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> include the horned Centrosaurus and the hollow-crested duckbill Corythosaurus. Gryposaurus may have preferred river-related settings.|$|E

5|$|Achelousaurus {{is known}} from the Two Medicine Formation, which {{preserves}} coastal sediments dating from the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 83and74million years ago.

5000|$|<b>The</b> upper contact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nankoweap <b>Formation</b> with <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galeros <b>Formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chuar Group {{appears to}} be quite sharp. <b>The</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nankoweap <b>Formation</b> {{consists}} <b>of</b> cliff-forming sandstones that grade irregularly upward [...] - [...] from red to white. This change in color has been interpreted to reflect bleaching beneath an unconformity that separates red beds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nankoweap <b>Formation</b> from dark-gray dolomites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galeros <b>Formation.</b> Because this contact lies in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> sheer cliffs formed by <b>the</b> combined sandstones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nankoweap <b>Formation</b> and <b>the</b> overlying dolomites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galeros <b>Formation,</b> it is not easily accessible and {{little is known about}} it. <b>The</b> inaccessibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper contact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nankoweap <b>Formation</b> has prevented a close examination of it. Except for wide shallow channels cut in <b>the</b> Nankoweap <b>Formation</b> and filled with dolomite, the upper contact lacks any stratigraphic evidence that indicates a large erosional or temporal hiatus. The contact between the overlying Tapeats Sandstone and the folded and faulted Nankoweap Formation is a prominent angular unconformity that is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Unconformity.|$|R
5|$|An angular {{unconformity}} truncates progressively older (lower) {{parts of the}} underlying Pahrump Group starting {{in the southern part}} of the area and moving north. At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) than the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 {{years ago}} {{explosive}} volcanic activity occurred at Ciomadul. Both the exact dates {{of the various}} eruptions and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of the St. Ana and Mohos craters are unclear, partly because dates obtained by potassium-argon dating and other dating techniques deviate from each other. Some eruptions may have reached sub-Plinian strength, ejecting volcanic ash {{as far as the}} Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaur that {{is known}} from fossils {{uncovered}} in modern-day Portugal. It may represent a species of Supersaurus. The only species is Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis, first described by José Bonaparte and Octávio Mateus in 1999 for vertebrae and some other material from the Lourinhã Formation. Although the precise age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> is not known, it can be dated around the early Tithonian of the Late Jurassic.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{announcement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of a partner school in Qatar, the school {{came under fire}} from current and former pupils, as well as concerned members of the public, due to the country's poor human rights record.
