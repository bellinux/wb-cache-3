5|$|The Greek text of {{the codex}} is a {{representative}} of the Caesarean text-type. It belongs to the textual family f13, known also as Ferrar Family. Also the handwriting and the menology show that is a close member of the group. According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it agrees with the Byzantine standard text 151 times, and 72 times with the Byzantine when it has the same reading as the <b>original</b> <b>text.</b> It agrees 31 times with the <b>original</b> <b>text</b> against the Byzantine. It has 57 independent or distinctive readings. Alands placed it in Category III.|$|E
5|$|The edition {{published}} by Faulkner includes over 500 corrections to the <b>original</b> <b>text,</b> surpassing any other editions. Faulkner's version also contains over 50 passages that either {{not present in}} the original or expanded on from the <b>original</b> <b>text.</b> This has suggested to some critics that the Faulkner edition was a later rework of Gulliver's Travels {{and not just a}} correction to printing related mistakes. The inclusion of these many additions was later seen by critics as part of Swift's disapproval of Motte's versions, but others see Motte's version as being more true to the anti-government spirit of Swift's work, which confuses Swift's motivation in allowing Faulkner to reprint the work.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the English borrowings in a {{corpus of}} Dutch original and translated cookbooks. The main {{purpose is to}} determine whether translators’ tendency to explain and clarify causes them to produce translations that contain fewer anglicisms than similar <b>original</b> Dutch <b>texts.</b> The {{results show that the}} anglicisms found in the translations and <b>original</b> <b>texts</b> are similar in terms of type, function, and degree of conventionality, but the total number of anglicisms is larger for the corpus of <b>original</b> <b>texts...</b>|$|R

5|$|In Aland's Profile, Kurt and Barbara Aland {{placed the}} codex's Gospels in Category III, meaning it has {{historical}} importance, with {{the profile of}} 1191, 802, 601/2, 69s. This means {{the text of the}} codex agrees with the Byzantine standard text 119 times, with the <b>original</b> <b>text</b> against the Byzantine 80 times, and with both the Byzantine and <b>original</b> <b>text</b> 60 times. There are 69 independent or distinctive readings in the Gospels. While the Gospels are a representative of the Caesarean text-type, the remainder of the books of the New Testament in this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type and falls into Category V, the lowest and least important in Aland's Profile.|$|E

5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the finished product quite often was different from the <b>original</b> <b>text.</b> Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E
5|$|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, an Indologist, dates the Pune {{version of}} a {{manuscript}} of the text to about the 13th or 14th century CE, and notes that {{this version of the}} Yoga Yajnavalkya quotes verses from Hatha Yoga texts. He also points out that Gargi is mentioned as the wife of Yajnavalkya in the manuscript. However, no other text affirms that Gargi was the wife of Yajnavalkya; rather, Maitreyi and Katyayani are listed as his two wives, leading to the theory that the Pune manuscript is a corrupted and more modern edition of the <b>original</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Roman Rite is {{the most}} common rite of worship used by the Catholic Church. Its use is found worldwide, {{originating}} in Rome and spreading throughout Europe, influencing and eventually supplanting local rites. The present ordinary form of Mass in the Roman Rite, found in the post-1969 editions of the Roman Missal, is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, using an officially approved translation from the <b>original</b> <b>text</b> in Latin.
