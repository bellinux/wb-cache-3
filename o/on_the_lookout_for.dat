5|$|Hartebeest {{are remarkably}} alert and {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual stays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> danger, often {{standing on a}} termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E

5|$|On April 6, 2007 at {{approximately}} 10 AM, Howard and Maureen Cotterman drove from Mexico to the Lukeville Port of Entry (POE). Upon arrival, the inspector checked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection electronic database {{and found a}} computer-generated alert, based upon Howard Cotterman's prior conviction for child sex crimes in 1992. The alert advised the inspector to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> child pornography and due to the warning, the Cottermans were sent to a secondary inspection area.|$|E

60|$|The {{squad of}} men to which Dorn belonged had to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> {{continually}} <b>for</b> an attack that was inevitable.

60|$|The {{next day}} was an anxious one for Dave, who was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{constant}} <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> land. Toward nightfall a speck {{was seen in the}} distance, and in the morning, when he came <b>on</b> deck, <b>the</b> country youth saw before him Sobago in all of its tropical beauty, with its cozy harbor, its long stretch of white sand, and its waving palms. In the harbor were ships of several nationalities, and also numerous native canoes, and the scene was an animated one.|$|R
5|$|Stone {{had fallen}} ill with {{appendicitis}} {{during the previous}} leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyd's agent, who had been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, who was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At {{the meeting of the}} railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case}} of stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E
50|$|In {{the distant}} future, the {{discovery}} of the new mineral Orichalt (Oriharuto) has allowed humanity to expand beyond <b>the</b> Sol System. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> constant <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> Orichalt, humanity has developed I-Machines (I mashin), robots that operate in extreme environments. I-Machines function by transferring a human pilot's consciousness into the robot's operating system; in that sense, the human becomes the machine. While Alliance Academy student Maya Mikuri {{is in the middle of}} operating an I-Machine, she gets involved in an incident with pirates, and ends up serving as a crew member on an excavation company's spaceship.|$|R
50|$|In 1934 {{in order}} to ensure the {{survival}} of the museum and allow the museum to grow, responsibility of museum was given to Skipton Urban District Council. The museum continued to gather more objects for its collection and increase in size and this was the status quo for over 30 years. On 21 April 1969 the Friends of the Craven Museum was established with Dr. Arthur Raistrick as its chair. Within a matter of months its membership had reached a hundred members. <b>The</b> friends were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> constant <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> anything that could be added to the museum’s collection.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} day, February 10, a BOLO (Be <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>LookOut)</b> report <b>for</b> Murray {{was issued}} at 12:36 pm. She was reported as wearing a dark coat, jeans, {{and a black}} backpack. A voice mail was left on Fred Murray's home answering machine at 3:20 pm stating that her car had been found abandoned. He was working out of state and did not receive this call. At 5:00 pm, Murray's older sister contacted her father to tell him of the situation. He then contacted the Haverhill Police Department and was told that, if Murray was not reported safe by the following morning, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department would start a search. At 5:17 pm, Murray was first referred to as [...] "missing" [...] by the Haverhill police.|$|R

60|$|Del Bishop, who {{had refused}} to play any hand but his own, had gone to work for Corliss because by so doing he was enabled to play his own hand better. He was {{practically}} unfettered, while the opportunities to further himself were greatly increased. Equipped {{with the best of}} outfits and a magnificent dog-team, his task was mainly to run the various creeks and keep his eyes and ears open. A pocket-miner, first, last, and always, he was privately <b>on</b> <b>the</b> constant <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> pockets, which occupation did not interfere in the least with the duty he owed his employer. And as the days went by he stored his mind with miscellaneous data concerning the nature of the various placer deposits and the lay of the land, against the summer when the thawed surface and the running water would permit him to follow a trace from creek-bed to side-slope and source.|$|R
6000|$|Drunken {{men are the}} especial prey of the road-kids. Robbing {{a drunken}} man they call [...] "rolling a stiff"; and {{wherever}} they are, they are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> constant <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> drunks. <b>The</b> drunk is their particular meat, as the fly is the particular meat of the spider. The rolling of a stiff is ofttimes an amusing sight, especially when the stiff is helpless and when interference is unlikely. At the first swoop the stiff's money and jewellery go. Then the kids sit around their victim {{in a sort of}} pow-wow. A kid generates a fancy for the stiff's necktie. Off it comes. Another kid is after underclothes. Off they come, and a knife quickly abbreviates arms and legs. Friendly hoboes may be called in to take the coat and trousers, which are too large for the kids. And in the end they depart, leaving beside the stiff the heap of their discarded rags.|$|R

30|$|The {{parallel}} economy {{refers to}} the pastoral economy of the hinterland {{that has yet to}} be, or may not be, integrated into the emerging non-traditional economic sector. Paradoxically, rural Soqotrans who were not nomadic seem to have become nomadic, or at least compulsively peripatetic, in their manic attempts to make ends meet in the current economic context. This is partly an imposition of the seasonal rhythm that economic activities <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island must inexorably mimic, {{but it is also a}} need created by dependence on non-pastoral food items and the ripple effects of the increasing monetization of the rural economy. Accordingly, rural Soqotrans whatever their ecological niches or primary means of livelihood are, by necessity, multiple livelihood pursuers animated by a chronic economic opportunism in quest of cash. This opportunistic pursuit takes the form of a kind of economic vagrancy compelled by the intrinsic insufficiencies of their subsistence livelihoods, caused by environmental conditions as well as an economic situation describable in the nomenclature of scarcity: a chronic precariousness of environmental resources (e.g., water and pasture), and seasonally variable exchange rate between pastoral by-products and the food basket made up almost entirely of imported items. The only available recourse is to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> constant <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> remunerative activities (e.g., odd jobs especially in the construction boom in Hadiboh town) that depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seasonal cycle.|$|R
40|$|Background : The {{cord blood}} banks and cord blood {{transplantation}} community are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> constant <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> a single objective dependable test that will indicate the functional {{capabilities of the}} cord blood units. This should ideally reflect engraftment, proliferation and differentiation capabilities. Presently in vitro Colony forming unit (CFU) assay is being performed by most cord blood centers to determine the functional efficacy of cord blood units. However, technical challenges associated with this assay have {{made it difficult to}} standardize the methodology among testing laboratories. A subjective test is associated with variability and non-uniform reporting. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the usefulness of the newly introduced HALO® assay by Hemogenix® by comparing it with the information provided by the traditional colony forming assay (CFU). Repeatability and objectivity were also studied. Methods : Sixteen Cord Blood units processed in the repository were tested by both, the traditional CFU assay and the HALO® assay. Results : Our study shows that the CFU assay provides information relating to proliferation and differentiation potential of CBUs while the HALO® assay gives quantitative output with reference to proliferative capability of CBUs. Conclusion : While both the assays provide valuable information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> functional efficacy of cord blood units from different stand points, one test perhaps cannot be substituted for the other. It is good to have both the tests available to bring in some additional information on its capabilities, which is much better than providing only one value with high subjectivity component...|$|R

My mail is so screwed up yet that I cannot determine which method is more rapid, air mail or V-Mail. One of these days I should find out, however. I got a “kick” from your dislike of mustaches. Sweetheart, out here personal vanity doesn’t mean a thing. Should I retain the mustache by the time I come home, I shall allow you to march me {{to the bathroom and}} watch me “whack” it off. It shall be a pleasure on my part. It’s so good that you are being kept constantly occupied. Darling, you can fiddle away time just like me—an old family trait. There are times when I put aside time to do a particular thing but I’ll be doggone if the time doesn’t pass without my doing what I wanted to do. Your article concerning Jap-American relations reflects in a small part some of the racial problems which will manifest themselves greatly after the war. I pity those people—it is not their fault. Thus far, darling, I have not received the camera but remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> constant <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> it. Tell me, too, if you received the money order and the box containing film and sundry items. Darling, I don’t ever want you to feel morbid. Promise me that you’ll always try and be as cheerful as possible—O. K. ? Before I forget, send me a box of stationery, will you, dear? It’s a critical item around here and very difficult to procure. V-Mail stationery is issued and we can get as much as we want. You say you sent me a cablegram <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 2 nd of November. To date I have not received your cablegram. They are pretty useless when you send them to me, but are quite good when I send them to you. I’m glad to hear that you enjoy Lt. Embry’s company as her husband is a “purty” regular guy and very much in love with his wife. A quality that we both have in common. “Winkie” Luddecke sent Doc a picture of their baby and herself. Gee, but I’m jealous, but don’t you worry, my precious, we’ll have our day, too. And what a day that will be!!! We’re getting along O. K. in the battery and having our good times as they present themselves. It’s a funny situation hearing all these broadcasts of the latest news with towns mentioned that are within [a] stone’s throw of you. Imagine it, darling, I’m in an outfit that’s making history. As soon as censorship lifts you’ll be hearing all about us in detail. I love you, my baby, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R
