25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, <b>ornate</b> <b>wrasse),</b> damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|E
50|$|The area {{is dotted}} with a rich {{biodiversity}} of varying aquatic species; the bank is populated sea floor and mid-oceanic schools of Azores chromis (Chromis limbata), Blacktail comber (Serranus atricauda), Guinean puffer (Sphoeroides marmoratus), Mediterranean rainbow wrasse (Coris julis), <b>Ornate</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Thalassoma pavo), Salema porgy (Sarpa salpa) and Mediterranean parrotfish (Sparisoma cretense). At 20 m depths are frequently visible Needlefish (Belonidae), o lírios, the large Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara), schools of Giant oceanic manta ray (Manta birostris), Dolphins and White-Tip Sharks, known in the Azores as Marracho.|$|E

50|$|In the Azores fish made {{up all of}} {{the diet}} and the most {{important}} species in the diet of Sphyraena viridensis was the bluejack mackerel Trachurus picturatus being found as having been preyed upon by 72.4% of the fish sampled and making up nearly two thirds of the weight of prey taken. Other species taken in this study included single examples of bogue Boops boops, <b>ornate</b> <b>wrasse</b> Thalassoma pavo and axillary sea bream Pagellus acarnae, as well as an unidentified species of the Exocoetidae. Unidentofied fish remains were found in nearly 20% of the specimens sampled. In the same study the predatory behaviour of S.viridensis was observed and they are active pursuit predators of fish with one or many barracudas pursuing fish, either singling out lone prey or attacking shoals of prey fish. The pursuit was rapid and was usually over in 8-40 seconds and the more fish were involved the higher the rate of success was. In these observations other fish species than those sampled from specimens were observed as prey e.g. longspine snipefish Macrorhamphosus scolopax and boar fish Capros aper. It is also known to feed on cephalopods and crustaceans.In summer they form schools of up to 180 fish, although most schools number 30-40 fish, in areas where there are strong currents. These schools are predominantly made up of sub-adult fish with the smaller fish nearer to the surface and the larger, usually female, fish {{at the bottom of the}} school at depths of up to 30m. In winter the only aggregations are small groups of juveniles in shallow bays. No territorial behaviour was observed. Schooling is thought to be an anti predator defence and to facilitate mating with the smaller males being attracted to the larger females, in addition groups of barracudas were more successful in hunting prey fish than single fish. This species does not appear to mix with other barracuda species in mixed schools but there are reports of these fish associating with whale sharks in the Azores and an instance of them actively swimming towards a manta ray Mobula tarapacana.|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{the shore}} {{topography}} (e. g. slope) occur at {{a scale of}} hundreds of meters in several locations in the Lusitanian and the Mediterranean Sea provinces. We tested whether differences in the bottom inclination might affect the vertical distribution patterns of two sympatric coastal labrid fishes, the rainbow wrasse Coris julis and the <b>ornate</b> <b>wrasse</b> Thalassoma pavo. Visual censuses {{were used to determine}} the distribution and abundance of these labrid species in high (‡ 30) and low (£ 3) slope rocky substrates covered by brown macroalgae and at two different depths (shallow, 4 – 7 m, and deep 14 – 20 m). Pectoral fin aspect ratio was used as an estimate of swimming performance to potentially explain the patterns observed. Despite the intrinsic biogeographical differences in the overall density of T. pavo and C. julis, on steep coasts the <b>ornate</b> <b>wrasse</b> dominated in shallow waters, whereas the two species coexisted both in shallow and deeper depths on gentle slope coasts. These distribution patterns were consistent across locations, and fin aspect ratio was not a good predictor of between-habitat use for wrasses. We show that, under specific topographical conditions, the depth segregation pattern seems to be an interactive segregation (likely related to resource competition) rather than a result of selective segregation due to morphological differences in the pectoral fin. Significant ecological changes might occur in locations where the density of T. pavo has recently increased as a result of water warming...|$|E
40|$|Climate warming should favor ‘warm water’ species over ‘cold water’ {{species at}} the same site. Regional warming in the Western Mediterranean has allowed the {{documented}} northward expansion of southern marine species. Conversely, very little is known on the response of cold loving species to temperature variations. We propose to work with two common coastal fishes: the rainbow wrasse Coris julis and the <b>ornate</b> <b>wrasse</b> Thalassoma pavo, with the general objective to exploring patterns of distribution and their potential to interact under warming conditions. Large scale quantitative observations revealed: (1) opposing trends in abundance along latitudinal (35 o − 45 oN) and depth gradients (0 - 36 m), with T. pavo densities significantly higher in southern and shallow waters than those of C. julis; (2) differential distributions across shallow habitats, with C. julis occupying seagrass beds when the density of T. pavo was high; and (3) a marked depth segregation of the species only on steep coasts. These patterns are discussed {{with regard to the}} role of water warming. Significant ecological changes might occur in locations where the density of T. pavo is recently increasing...|$|E
40|$|Fish assemblages inhabiting shallow rocky reefs at six Italian marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) were investigated to assess broad-scale patterns in assemblage structure, species richness and composition, and {{to evaluate the}} presence of a latitudinal gradient in the distribution pattern of a thermophilic fish, the <b>ornate</b> <b>wrasse</b> Thalassoma pavo. Fish abundance was estimated by visual censuses carried out within the integral reserve zones, within the 1 [...] 7 m depth range and during four sampling periods. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in the assemblage structure among MPAs, although patterns of variation changed considerably {{from time to time and}} they were not consistent with latitudinal or longitudinal gradient. Fish assemblages of Miramare (northern Adriatic) and those of the other MPAs clearly separated into two groups. Multivariate differences among MPAs mainly relied upon some relatively common species (e. g. Diplodus puntazzo and Muraena helena). Substantial contribution to these differences was also accounted for by T. pavo. Significant differences among MPAs were detected also in species richness and total density of fish, although the effect of MPA on species richness varied significantly from time to time. Both species richness and total density of fish at Miramare were always higher compared to the other MPAs, likely in relation to peculiar habitat characteristics. Density of T. pavo declined significantly from south to north, thus confirming the thermophily of this species. Present data point out the importance of monitoring marine fish diversity through long-term surveys across a wide spatial scale, in order to detect the early effects of water warming and to develop future plans of management and conservation...|$|E
40|$|Common {{environmental}} contaminants such {{as heavy}} metals and pesticides pose serious risks to behavioral and neuroendocrine functions of many aquatic organisms. In the present study, {{we show that}} the heavy metal cadmium and the pesticide endosulfan produce such effects through an interaction of specific cerebral histamine receptor subtypes in the teleost <b>ornate</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Thalassoma pavo). Treatment of this teleost with toxic cadmium levels for 1 week was sufficient to induce abnormal swimming movements, whereas reduced feeding behaviors were provoked predominantly by elevated endosulfan concentrations. In the brain, these environmental contaminants caused neuronal degeneration in cerebral targets such as the mesencephalon and hypothalamus, damage that appeared to correlate with altered binding levels {{of the three major}} histamine receptors (subtypes 1, 2, and 3). Although cadmium accounted for reduced binding activity of all three subtypes in most brain regions, it was subtype 2 that seemed to be its main target, as shown by a very great (p < 0. 001) down-regulation in mesencephalic areas such as the stratum griseum central layer. Conversely, endosulfan provided very great and great (p < 0. 01) up-regulating effects of subtype 3 and 1 levels, respectively, in preoptic-hypothalamic areas such as the medial part of the lateral tuberal nucleus, and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results suggest that the neurotoxicant-dependent abnormal motor and feeding behaviors may well be tightly linked to binding activities of distinct histamine subtypes in localized brain regions of the Thalassoma pavo.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the sacoglossan Elysia timida and the <b>ornate</b> <b>wrasse</b> Thalassoma pavo was studied in two laboratory experiments using artificial models. A feeding-preference experiment was conducted to determine whether mollusc extract deterred feeding by T. pavo, by using a ‘‘realistic’’ mollusc model(imitating the colour pattern of E. timida) coated with mollusc extract, and a reference model (without imitation or extract), and fishes collected from two locations. It was observed that fish approached, attacked and ate more reference models than mollusc models. A second feeding-preference experiment was designed with four different coloured models: ‘‘realistic’’ (W), green (G), red (R) and chequered (S) pattern. Both fish populations clearly rejected the S model, and differed in their colour preferences. Although both populations seemed to prefer the R and G models equally, the W model was clearly rejected by the fish that coexist with the mollusc at one site (Mazarrón), but was not rejected by the other population of fish which does not coexist with it (Cabo de Palos). Mazarrón fishes would identify the W model {{with the presence of}} a toxic compound during their coexistence, and therefore avoid attacking conspicuously coloured E. timida models as a response to their visual signals. Therefore, it was concluded that extract of E. timida is a deterrent for T. pavo, and its effect is sufficiently noxious that the fish tend to avoid it, so that the ability of the fishes to learn to recognise colours and identify certain colour patterns associated with obnoxious prey provides the molluscs the opportunity to survive by exhibiting a conspicuous coloration.

40|$|The neuropeptides hypocretins/orexins (ORX) {{are known}} to control {{state-dependent}} activities such as sleep-wakefulness, energy homeostasis and reward/addiction processes. To date, interests regarding ORXergic neuronal functions have mostly dealt with mammals, while only recently attention is beginning to be directed towards aquatic vertebrates. On this basis, {{the intention of the}} present study was to evaluate ORX-A effects on behavioral and neuronal activities in marine (the <b>ornate</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Thalassoma pavo) and freshwater (the goldfish, Carassius auratus) teleost fishes. To achieve such aims behavioral, molecular and neurodegenerative analysis were performed following intraperitoneal injections of not only the most effective doses of ORX-A, but also of GABAAR β subunit agonist muscimol (MUS) and antagonist bicuculline (BIC) as well as a classical benzodiazepine, diazepam (DZP), and a non benzodiazepine, zolpidem (ZOL), that are instead agonists of the GABAAR α subunits. Behavioral studies on explorative behaviors (swimming towards food sources; STF), free swimming (FS) and on resting states (R) displayed that ORX-A was responsible for very great (p< 0. 001) enhancements of STF in both teleosts while similarly very great and great (p< 0. 01) reduction of R was detected in wrasse and goldfish, respectively. Interestingly, ORX-A effects showed to be strongly influenced by environmental photoperiodic conditions as pointed out by behavioral and ORXR expression relationships in wrasses during constant light/dark conditions. In this case, ORX-A/photoperiodic-dependent motor behaviors might be related to a structural-functional dichotomy of some motor-controlling brain regions. Indeed during the day, ORX-A might be very likely promoting the awakening state via low-affinity ORXR sites at hypothalamic (HTH) and mesencephalic (MES) levels so inducing the promotion of STF and FS. On the other hand, during the night ORX-A might result in a promotion of R via activation of mostly telencephalic (TEL) high-affinity sites. As far as GABAAR influence is concerned, MUS was capable of inducing a moderate (p< 0. 05) increase in STF and this tends to not only underlie a highly conserved GABA stimulus on feeding but also that such an activity relies on the involvement of ORXR in most brain regions of both fish models. Moreover, it was also possible to observe that such a GABAAR agonist elicits a neuroprotection via ORXR as suggested by both the reduction of BIC-dependent mRNA down-regulations and the very low argyrophilic reactions in brain regions of MUS+BIC-treated fish. When the increase of STF was next checked to see whether it was linked to an enhancement of food consumption, I observed that ORX-A and GABAAR  drugs (MUS and BIC) did not modify this activity. On the other hand, GABAAR  subunits appeared to not only influence STF maneuvers but also food consumption as demonstrated by ZOL and DZP evoking very great increases in STF coupled with great and very great amounts of food consumption, respectively. Interestingly, also in 8 this case ZOL- and DZP-dependent hyperphagia seemed to be correlated to ORXR expression variations in mostly HTH and MES, brain areas that are involved in energy homeostasis and motor activities. At this point it was interesting to investigate if ORX- and GABAAR-induced STF effects were mediated through rewarding pathways like that reported for mammals. With such an aim, T-maze and Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) paradigms were performed. For this part, ORX-A accounted for a moderate improvement of T-maze performances that became great when associated to color visual stimuli, suggesting that ORX-A might be operating on memory processes also in fish. Moreover from CPP analysis in which ORX-A acted as a main agent responsible for great increase of color-dependent change in CPP, it seems that this neuropeptide and not GABAAR drugs, might be potentiating reward pathways in goldfish. Also in this case, behavioral performances are consistent with ORXR up-regulations in some TEL regions and in the nucleus of the posterior tuberculum, homologous of the amygdala plus hippocampus and ventral tegmental area that in mammals control learning and reward processes. It is worthy to note that DZP only accounted for a moderate increase in CPP change while BIC completely blocked ORX-A-induced change in CPP and this tends to point to a dual neurosignaling mechanism between ORX circuit and GABAAR / subunits on motivational-reward behaviors. Overall these results highlight, for the first time, not only an ORX neuronal driving force operating on feeding behaviors in goldfish, but above all its participation in the control of goal-oriented behaviors like in mammals.
