5000|$|Like other German Warmbloods, the {{breeding}} of Zweibrücken {{is characterized by}} stringent inspection criteria. Foals do not receive their papers until they are presented at a local foal show, at which judges may exclude any foal if it is markedly <b>off-type.</b> Along with their papers, the foals receive a brand on the left hind leg, just behind the stifle. Foal inspections also give an early indication {{of the quality of}} the sire, as well as which mares match best with him. At the age of 3, fillies may be upgraded from the foal register to the herd book through a process called Stutbuchaufnahmen or [...] "Marebook Recording". There are several levels of mare book based on the quality of the mare and the completeness of her pedigree, which allows mares of unorthodox breeding to eventually become part of {{the breeding}} program. To be written into the herd book and thereby have registered foals, the mare is evaluated on her conformation and gaits. Mares which fail to meet the criteria may be placed in a lower mare book, or be denied altogether. Only mares in the highest mare books can produce breeding stallion sons.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, an {{estimated}} 71,500 tonnes of synthetic methyl bromide were used annually worldwide. 97% of this estimate {{is used for}} fumigation purposes, whilst 3% {{is used for the}} manufacture of other products. Moreover, 75% of the consumption takes place in developed nations, led by the U.S. (43%) and Europe (24%). Asia and the Middle East combine to use 24% whereas Latin America and Africa have the lowest consumption rates at 9%.Until its production and use was curtailed by the Montreal Protocol, bromomethane was widely applied as a soil sterilant, mainly for production of seed but also for some crops such as strawberries and almonds. In commercial large-scale monoculture seed production, unlike crop production, it is of vital importance to avoid contaminating the crop with <b>off-type</b> seed of the same species. Therefore, selective herbicides cannot be used. Whereas bromomethane is dangerous, it is considerably safer and more effective than some other soil sterilants. Its loss to the seed industry has resulted in changes to cultural practices, with increased reliance on soil steam sterilization, mechanical rogueing, and fallow seasons. Bromomethane was also used as a general-purpose fumigant to kill a variety of pests including rats and insects. Bromomethane has poor fungicidal properties. Bromomethane is the only fumigant allowed (heat treatment is only other option) under ISPM 15 regulations when exporting solid wood packaging (forklift pallets, crates, bracing) to ISPM 15 compliant countries. Bromomethane is used to prepare golf courses, particularly to control Bermuda grass. The Montreal Protocol stipulates that bromomethane use be phased out.|$|E

Results showed that the <b>off-type</b> plants were more (p< 0. 05) tolerant to black sigatoka disease with the infection index of 17. 5 % compared to 30. 1 and 22. 8 % of the micropropagation (MP) derived phenotypically normal plants and Conventional Propagation (CP) derived plants with no tissue culture history in their ancestry, respectively. On the contrary, the <b>off-type</b> plants were more (p< 0. 05) vulnerable to water stress with leaf senescence of 87. 7 % at soil water deficit of 630 millibars. The leaf senescence of the MP and CP derived plants at the same soil moisture deficit was 79. 5 and 66. 7 %, respectively. During this stress period each <b>off-type</b> plant produced one sucker, while the true-to-type plants were unable to do so. Leaf structural analysis revealed that the <b>off-type</b> plants had higher (p< 0. 05) stomatal density of 16. 0 mm - 2 of the upper leaf surface. Conversely, the MP and CP derived plants had each 12. 3 and 11. 0 stomata mm - 2 of the leaf upper surface. Similarly, the <b>off-type</b> plant leaves were more hydrophobic with higher (p< 0. 05) epicuticular waxiness of 684. 6 μg cm - 2.

Three separate analyses (multisite, single site with and without <b>off-types)</b> were performed to estimate genetic parameters from statistical models fitted on nine important agronomic traits (yield, seed index, pod index, % healthy pods, % pods infected with witches broom, % of pods other loss, vegetative brooms, diameter, and tree height). Genetic parameters were estimated along with variance components and heritabilities from the multisite analysis, and a trial was fingerprinted with low-density SNP markers to determine the impact of <b>off-types</b> on estimations. Heritabilities ranged from 0. 37 to 0. 64 for yield and its components and from 0. 03 to 0. 16 for disease resistance traits. A weighted index was used to make selections for clonal evaluation, and breeding values estimated for the parental selection and estimation of genetic gain. The impact of <b>off-types</b> to breeding progress in cacao was assessed for the first time. Even when present at < 5 % of the total population, <b>off-types</b> altered selections by 48 %, and impacted heritability estimations for all nine of the traits analyzed, including a 41 % difference in estimated heritability for yield.

To study the function of single amacrine cells in the intact salamander retina, we recorded extracellularly from a population of ganglion cells with a multielectrode array, while simultaneously recording from or injecting current into single <b>Off-type</b> amacrine cells that had linear responses. We measured how visual responses of the amacrine cell interacted both with other visual input to the ganglion cell and with transmission between the two cells. We found that on average, visual responses from <b>Off-type</b> amacrine cells inhibited nearby <b>Off-type</b> ganglion cells. By recording and playing back the light-driven membrane potential fluctuations of amacrine cells during white noise visual stimuli, we found that paradoxically, increasing the light-driven modulations of inhibitory amacrine cells increased the firing rate of nearby <b>Off-type</b> ganglion cells. By measuring the correlations and transmission between amacrine and ganglion cells, we found that, on average, the amacrine cell hyperpolarizes before the ganglion cell fires, generating timed disinhibition just before the ganglion cell spikes. In addition, we found that amacrine to ganglion cell transmission is nonlinear in that increases in ganglion cell activity produced by amacrine hyperpolarization were greater than decreases in activity produced by amacrine depolarization. We conclude that the primary mode of action of this class of amacrine cell is to actively gate the ganglion cell response by a timed release from inhibition...|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} basis of somaclonal variation is not precisely known, but both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed. The available evidence points toward {{the existence of}} labile portions of the genome that can be modulated when the cells undergo the stress of tissue culture. Therefore, the hypothesis that there are identifiable and predictable DNA markers for the early diagnosis of somaclonal variation has been tested. Representational difference {{analysis was used to}} isolate unique fragments of DNA (difference products) between visible culture-induced <b>off-type</b> and normal banana plants. Markers generated from six difference products differentiated between some of the <b>off-type</b> and normal pairs.

40|$|Rice {{is largely}} self-fertilized and {{accordingly}} a field population of rice is completely composed of near homozygotes. Due {{to the emergence}} of <b>off-types,</b> homozygosity will be affected. With the time, this will cause the reduction of genetic purity in some rice varieties.

Studies were conducted at the Rice Research and Development Institute, Batalagoda, Sri Lanka to estimate the out-crossing rate of Bg 379 - 2, a variety having the problem of maintaining genetic purity. Bg 379 - 2 was allowed to out-cross with Bg 450 and the number of out-crossed plants were counted using dominant morphological markers such as short-round grain and purple culm of pollen donor.

Here, we measured blue-off responses in the subcortical visual pathway of marmoset monkeys. We found that the cells exhibiting blue-off responses are largely segregated to the koniocellular pathway. The blue-off cells show relatively large receptive fields, sluggish responses to maintained contrast, little sign of an inhibitory receptive-field surround mechanism, and negligible functional input from an intrinsic (melanopsin-based) phototransductive mechanism.

40|$|In many {{tropical}} countries we {{can distinguish}} two seed systems: a formal seed system (comprising breeding companies and national institutes) and an informal seed system, often called farmer seed system (comprising of all farmer {{activities related to}} the transfer of seeds). These two systems are intertwined in various degrees for different crops and different regions. Related to these two seed systems are formal and informal crop development systems. In recent years, it is suggested to link these two systems in a more structural way, for example, through Participatory Variety Selection and Participatory Plant Breeding. Various research projects {{have shown that the}} integration of these two systems is feasible and provide various advantages compared to formal crop development, such as varieties that better fit farmer' preferences and are better adapted to their conditions, a higher adoption rate of varieties, enhancement of biodiversity and germplasm conservation. It is often suggested that farmer varieties are well adapted to local conditions and that farmers maintain high levels of diversity in their fields, enabling conditions for the creation of new genetic diversity and new varieties. However, how exactly farmers manage such processes, or whether they actually manage these processes at all is not much studied. With better information {{it will be possible to}} identify opportunities to maintain and enhance farmer selection practices, and to prevent elimination of local processes of value in maintaining genetic diversity. Hence, the objective of this study was to get a better understanding of local gene flow and its effects on crop genetic diversity (i. e. availability, genetic make-up and diversity of varieties) and as such on the farming system as a whole, and whether these effects are related to or influenced by breeding system, gender, farmer selection, or possibly other agricultural practices, socio-economic factors or cultural understandings, consciously or tacitly. The three main research questions that follow from this objective were: 1.       How is gene flow managed by farmers and which factors play a crucial role? 2.       What is the impact of gene flow on the adaptability and resilience of the farming system? 3.       Based on the answers to questions 1 and 2, what suggestions can be made to integrate formal and informal crop improvement? To answer these questions, the following model of gene flow is used:   Gene flow = (seed flow             +           pollen flow)       *           selection pressure   To achieve a better understanding how the various factors related to seed flow, pollen flow and selection pressure interact an interdisciplinary approach is used combining natural and social science. A comparative approach is chosen focusing on two key-variables: crop breeding system and gender. In The Gambia millet (an outbreeding crop) is grown by men and rice (an inbreeding crop) grown by women. During the fieldwork, farmer cultivation practices, seed selection and use and management of varieties are compared between millet and rice and between men and women. In the analyses, quantitative and qualitative plant data and socio-economic data are integrated. Chapters 2 to 9 described the various aspects of the model above. In chapter 12, the concluding chapter, these aspects are brought together and the short formula on gene flow (presented in Chapter 1) further elaborated. With this information, and information from Chapters 10 and 11, the second research question is answered. Finally, this information is used to illuminate the third question through some suggestions on how formal and informal crop improvement might be better integrated. Below, a few of the major findings are highlighted. It seems logical that the higher the rate of cross-pollination, the higher the chances are for new varieties to develop in farmers' fields. In Chapter 7, however, it is shown that for pollen flow to result in the development of new genotypes, the level of pollen flow should not be too high. Distinct, stable genotypes develop more easily in crops with a low cross-pollination rate, like rice. Hence, it is also easier for farmers to select <b>off-types</b> in strong inbreeding crops, and develop them into new varieties, than in strongly outbreeding crops. Other factors determining the chances of the development of new stable genotypes are the distances between fields, the time of flowering, the number of varieties in different fields and the number of mixed-in varieties within fields. Farmers do not mind mixed-in varieties in their seed as they consider it insurance. Because of all these factors, chances of cross-pollination between rice varieties are much higher within fields than between fields. Since within a village almost all farmers grow the same variety of millet chances of pollen flow between millet varieties are very low. Although many people (both farmers and scientists) believe that women are better in distinguishing varieties and plant types, Chapter 9 shows there is no difference in capability between men and women. Additionally, both male and female farmers think <b>off-types</b> are caused by God and they do not have a clear understanding of what exactly causes change in rice and millet. Although men and women have a similar understanding on the development of strange <b>off-types</b> in millet and rice, men have never tried to test strange millet <b>off-types,</b> while women sometimes test and develop strange rice <b>off-types</b> into new varieties. As mentioned above, new stable, distinct <b>off-types</b> develop more easily in rice than in millet. Distinctness of <b>off-types</b> is a requirement for farmers to notice them. The harvesting process enables observations of strange <b>off-types</b> in rice more readily than in millet. Additionally, this study found evidence that it is an aspect of male identity not to test any strange <b>off-types.</b> Men often know how to differentiate varieties, but seemingly this is not knowledge that is important to their self image and to their image within the community. The second main research question was whether gene flow plays a role in keeping farming systems adaptable and resilient. In Chapter 10 it was concluded that processes in relation to genetic diversity differ between rice and millet. In the case of rice, pollen flow between varieties and farmer off-type-selection have important roles in the development of new varieties. Moreover, for rice, seed exchange between communities is crucial to maintain genetic diversity at village level and regional level, whereas it is less important for millet. In millet it is primarily pollen flow within varieties and seed selection through which genetic diversity is maintained. It is likely that genetic diversity for rice fluctuates more over time and space than for millet. For rice, the effect of pollen flow and seed flow on genetic diversity shows in the development of new varieties, whereas for millet, seed and pollen flow lead to the maintenance, or in some cases an increase, of genetic diversity at population level. In Chapter 11 it was elaborated that adaptability (and resilience) can be achieved through genetic diversity and plasticity. Chapter 11 elaborated further on the impact of selection on local adaptation. It shows that millet varieties are not narrowly adapted and that variety choice seems more related to cultural preferences than to local adaptation. Although no data are available, it seems that rice varieties are also quite widely adaptable. For rice, another factor that seems to influence variety choice is the time of introduction of varieties in a village and the range of suitable varieties in that village. At farming system level pollen flow likely plays a limited role in keeping populations adaptable to rapid environmental changes. This does not mean that the process of adaptation through genetic evolution at field level should be ignored, but that it is too slow a process, compared to the decision making process of farmers who can decide in a few years (sometimes in only one year) to change varieties. In Chapter 12 the implications of these findings for the importance of gene flow are discussed. Under slowly changing conditions, a high cross-pollination rate contributes to adaptation at field level, which then in turn contributes to adaptation at farming system level. Under fast changing conditions (whether ecological or socio-economic), seed flows (exchange of varieties) are essential to maintain adaptation at farming system level. A low cross-pollination rate also contributes to the adaptability of farming systems through the development of new varieties. Hence, it can be argued that for late millet the process of adaptation is more gradual, while for rice it is more of a stop-and-go process. Whereas late millet populations slowly adapt to the changing climatic conditions in The Gambia, rice varieties tend toward replacement when the 'older' ones do not fit the conditions anymore. Hence, the millet seed system can be considered low-cost and more robust, whereas the rice seed system is more a higher maintenance and less robust system, needing constant exchange and testing of <b>off-types</b> to keep it adaptable. Finally, in Chapter 12 some suggestions are given how to integrate farmer and formal breeding in the context of The Gambia. There is scope to improve the formal breeding system in itself, particularly by improving funding conditions and the capacity of NARI. Important is also to stimulate two-way traffic of information and seed materials between researchers and farmers, and local testing of materials. As farmer breeding is very much a random process, which is also one of its strengths, it is difficult to improve it. There is more scope in improving farmer breeding by linking it to the formal system. One way to link farmer and formal breeding is through PVS methodologies which can be easily integrated into the 'conventional system of crop improvement'. If formal breeding is improved following the above suggestions, PPB methodologies do not have any apparent advantages in the context of The Gambia, but may be used to reflect how conventional breeding methods can be improved. In the last section it is emphasised that as long as formal crop development excludes particular crop types, farmer crop development remains to play an important role, particularly in risk-prone environments. A last remark is that crop development can only improve agriculture as part of a farming systems approach understanding the complex processes through which crops are formed, maintained and improved...|$|R

Through practical application of the technology, an F 1 plant 2 ̆ 7 s identity was confirmed, the correct pedigrees 2 ̆ 7 of 2 incorrectly labelled F 2 populations were determined, confusion in the identity of seed lots of an advanced breeding line was resolved and <b>off-type</b> barley plants were identified in a seed increase block. This illustrated the value of PCR-based genotype analysis in plant breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|In the {{mammalian}} retina, extensive {{processing of}} spatiotemporal and chromatic information occurs. One key principle in signal transfer through the retina is parallel processing. Two of these parallel pathways are the ON- and OFF-channels transmitting {{light and dark}} signals. This dual system is created in the outer plexiform layer, the first relay station in retinal signal transfer. Photoreceptors release glutamate onto ON- and <b>OFF-type</b> bipolar cells, which are functionally distinguished by their postsynaptic expression {{of different types of}} glutamate receptors, namely ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. In the current concept, rod photoreceptors connect only to rod bipolar cells (ON-type) and cone photoreceptors connect only to cone bipolar cells (ON- and <b>OFF-type).</b> We have studied the distribution of (RS) -α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor subunits at the synapses in the outer plexiform layer of the rodent retina by immunoelectron microscopy and serial section reconstruction. We report a non-classical synaptic contact and an alternative pathway for rod signals in the retina. Rod photoreceptors made synaptic contact with putative OFF-cone bipolar cells that expressed the AMPA glutamate receptor subunits GluR 1 and GluR 2 on their dendrites. Thus, in the retina of mouse and rat, an alternative pathway for rod signals exists, where rod photoreceptors bypass the rod bipolar cell and directly excite OFF-cone bipolar cells through an ionotropic sign-conserving AMPA glutamate receptor...|$|E

One- and two-seeded pods from remnant M 1 plants were harvested, the M 2 plants grown in the field, and the M 3 progenies of M 2 plants with more than 20 % aborted pollen grains were checked for chromosome number and aberrations, using root tip squashes...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{research project}} {{was set up}} to characterize by different approaches some Italian populations of Lolium spp. susceptible and resistant to diclofop-methyl. The present study was aimed at the taxonomic identification of these Lolium populations {{on the basis of the}} electrophoretic analysis of seed reserve proteins. Electrophoresis confirmed the great range of variation detected by preliminary morphological analysis. Approximately half the individuals in each population could be classified as belonging to Lolium multiflorum or Lolium rigidum, the most common Lolium species present in the area. However, electrophoretic patterns revealed a significant number (40 – 60 %) of hybrid individuals in all populations. The origin of these <b>off-types</b> was postulated as resulting from both intrageneric hybridization among different Lolium species and intergeneric hybridization between Lolium and Festuca genera. No significant differences were detected in the taxonomy of herbicide-susceptible and -resistant populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The present {{investigation}} was undertaken to identify specific marker {{associated with the}} maize hybrid DMH- 117 and its parental lines, hybrid purity testing as well as identify the <b>off-types</b> from the seed lot. The hybrid DHM- 117 could be clearly identified by using the SSR loci Umc 1600 based on the banding pattern resolved on agarose gel (3 %). The complementary banding pattern of {{the male and female}} parents made a way to identify the hybrid. The SSR loci Umc 1600 amplified a specific allele size of 180 bp in seed parent (BML- 6) and 195 bp was specific to pollen parent BML- 7. These two bands of allele size 180 bp and 195 bp were found in hybrid DHM- 117, there by confirming that this hybrid was produced from the cross combination of BML- 6 and BML- 7...|$|R
40|$|In banana tissue cultures, the {{occurrence}} of dwarf off types is a common phenomenon and their detection become relevant. In this study, tissue culture derived (somaclonal) and radiation-induced off types in banana cultivars. Robusta and Giant Cavendish were analyzed using a SCAR-based molecular diagnostic technique. The dwarfs were initially characterized at maturity, by height, leaf shape, pseudostem height and other agronomic characters. At the molecular level, amplification with the SCAR primer resulted in an expected amplified fragment of 1500 bp in normal {{but not in the}} dwarf types. Further in a multiplex PCR, an internal positive control was included using primers for 18 S rRNA which gave amplification in both the normal and dwarf types. This study shows that the dwarf <b>off-types</b> isolated through tissue culture and radiation-mutagenesis were true dwarfs, validated by using the dwarf-specific RAPD marker for banana...|$|R

40|$|Glutamate, the {{neurotransmitter}} {{released by}} photoreceptors, excites horizontal cells and <b>OFF-type</b> bipolar cells by activating ionotropic receptors. This study investigated an additional action of glutamate {{in which it}} modulates a voltage-gated ion channel in horizontal cells. We find that glutamate and APB (2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyrate) produce a delayed and moderately prolonged suppression of an inward rectifier current (IRK). This effect is proposed to occur via an APB-sensitive metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) because common agonists for the ionotropic or APB-insensitive mGluRs are ineffective and the APB-insensitive receptor antagonist �-methyl- 4 -carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) does not block the actions of glutamate or APB. 8 -Br-cGMP, 1 -methyl- 3 -isobutylxanthine (IBMX), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) but not 8 -Br-cAMP mimic the suppression of IRK. The effects of glutamate an...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize, under greenhouse conditions, a population of 2 000 plants of Anthurium andraeanum variety ‘Lambada’ regenerated from somatic embryos and suckers. Temperatures of 29 ± 2 ºC, a relative humidity of 80 % and a brightness of 60 - 70 % were maintained during the period of culture in greenhouses. Bigger values of the variables evaluated in leaves, flower and plants were shown in plants regenerated from somatic embryos. Longitude of spate in plants coming from suckers was bigger but differences were not significant among the two populations under greenhouse conditions. Plants <b>off-type</b> were not observed in plants obtained from somatic embryos and growth was similar to plants obtainet from suckers.

40|$|Plants {{produced}} vegetatively in {{tissue culture}} {{may differ from}} the plants from {{which they have been}} derived. Two major classes of <b>off-types</b> occur: genetic ones and epigenetic ones. This review is about epigenetic aberrations. We discuss recent studies that have uncovered epigenetic modifications at the molecular level, viz., changes in DNA methylation and alterations of histone methylation or acetylation. Various studies have been carried out with animals, and with plant cells or tissues that have grown in tissue culture but only little work has been done with shoots generated by axillary branching. We present various molecular methods that are being used to measure epigenetic variation. In micropropagated plants mostly differences in DNA methylation have been examined. Epigenetic changes are thought to underlie various well-known tissue-culture phenomena including rejuvenation, habituation, and morphological changes such as flower abnormalities, bushiness, and tumorous outgrowths in, among others, oil palm, gerbera, Zantedeschia and rhododendron...|$|R
40|$|Both {{morphological}} {{characteristics and}} amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers {{were used to}} validate the genetic fidelity of 1 080 field-grown Echinacea purpurea plants regenerated from leaf explants of donor T 5 - 9. Morphological diagnosis revealed that 1 067 out of 1 080 regenerants were normal, while 13 regenerants were aberrant. AFLP analysis was further performed to assess DNA variations among donor, 43 sampled normal regenerants and all 13 aberrant regenerants. Seven primer combinations generated 471 fragments among donor and normal regenerants, of which 9 fragments were polymorphic. The same primer pairs generated 484 fragments for aberrant regenerants, of which 417 fragments were polymorphic. UPGMA clustering indicated that 42 normal regenerants and donor fell into same cluster at similarity scale of > 0. 99, while all 13 aberrant regenerants and one morphologically normal regenerant comprised the other clusters. AFLP analysis indicated that these 14 regenerants are <b>off-types...</b>|$|R
40|$|Coconut palms are {{classified}} into two major types, viz., ‘talls’ and ‘dwarfs’, which mainly {{differ in their}} pollination behavior of cross- and self-pollination, respectively. Due to this difference, getting true-to-type progenies of desirable tall and dwarf cultivars {{has always been a}} challenge. The conventional practice of selection of seedlings based solely on morphological traits often results in selection of out-crossed seedlings and undesirable <b>off-types.</b> In the present investigation, RAPD markers for the tall/dwarf trait were identified in coconut using a bulked DNA approach. Screening of tall and dwarf palm bulk DNA with 200 primers revealed a RAPD primer OPBA 3 which was able to clearly differentiate both the tall and dwarf bulks. For validation, the primer was used to screen individual tall and dwarf coconut palms representing different geographic regions. The primer was also used to screen the parents and validate hybrids of Dwarf x Tall crosses. ...|$|R
