The revelation led to further allegations about the teacher from other former pupils and subsequent calls for the teacher's prosecution. The teacher, then 79 years old, was charged, but the case was dropped {{on the grounds of}} his ill health. The teacher subsequently died. In 2017, it was announced that the school would be investigated as part of Lady Smith's inquiry into child sexual abuse.|$|R
50|$|Until 1984 {{the camp}} {{training}} programme consisted of approximately twenty lessons, each concerned with distinct and unrelated subjects. From 1985 onwards, the training syllabus was reorganised {{as a series}} of five or six concentrated mini-courses concerned with specific subjects which observers would study throughout the entire week, thus permitting individual subjects to be taught in greater detail. Subjects included Techniques of Instruction (TOI), First Aid, Triangulation, Transition to War (TTW) and Communications Management.

5000|$|Laws {{relating}} to the imperial house {{must be approved by}} the Diet. Under the old system, the Imperial Household Law was separate from and equal with the constitution. After the war, the imperial family's extensive estates were confiscated and its finances placed under control of the Imperial Household Agency, part of the Office of the Prime Minister and theoretically subject to the Diet. In practice it remains a bastion of conservatism, its officials shrouding the activities of the emperor and his family behind a [...] "chrysanthemum curtain" [...] (the chrysanthemum being the crest of the imperial house) to maintain an aura of sanctity.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{relationship}} between organizational culture, organizational change, and substance abuse treatment. I applied the theoretical frameworks of organizational identity (Diamond, 1993) and organizational modes of experience (Diamond & Allcorn, 2009) to interpret the unconscious dimensions of organizational culture. I developed a three-part model of organizational culture as a framework for interpreting organizational identity as well as modes of experience and their implications for organizational change. Understanding and interpreting organizational identity and modes of experience requires an experience-near method of study that interprets transference dynamics between organizational members, and between organizational members and the researcher in role. I spent one year immersed in a substance abuse treatment organization as a participating <b>observer.</b> <b>Detailed</b> fieldnotes captured my observations and experiences in the field and explicitly recorded the data needed to analyze transference dynamics. The framework of organizational identity provided a lens through which to view the psychodynamics of each field site and the associated implications for change on a micro-level. Organizational modes of experience were a lens through which to view the thematic elements of the organizational culture as a whole at the macro-level. At each level of analysis, organizational leaders? and clinical supervisors? capacity for containment and holding were critical for fostering constructive responses to change in substance abuse treatment...|$|R

40|$|Generally speaking, one of {{the most}} {{important}} sources of optical information about environmental structure is known to be the deforming optical patterns produced by the movements of the observer (pilot) or environmental objects. As an observer moves through a rigid environment, the projected optical patterns of environmental objects are systematically transformed according to their orientations and positions in 3 D space relative to those of the <b>observer.</b> The <b>detailed</b> characteristics of these deforming optical patterns carry information about the 3 D structure of the objects and about their locations and orientations relative to those of the observer. The specific geometrical properties of moving images that may constitute visually detected information about the shapes and locations of environmental objects is examined...|$|R

40|$|The {{first data}} from the NASA/University of Texas Crew Performance project on the {{behavior}} of flightcrews with and without formal training in Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) is reported. Expert <b>observers</b> made <b>detailed</b> ratings of 15 components of crew behavior in both line operations and in full mission simulations. The results indicate that such training in crew coordination concepts increases the percentage of crews rated as above average in performance and decreases the percentage rated as below average.

It was also found that the specific behaviors that triggered observer ratings of above or below average performance differed markedly between organizations. Characteristics of experts' ratings and future research needs are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|The committee's {{directive}} was to standardise {{the definition}} of terms used in reporting patients who had coronary artery disease and {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery. The purpose of defining a scale for the severity of exertional angina was to evaluate the efficacy of medical and surgical therapy by comparing the patient’s status before and after therapeutic interventions. It was expected that a four-grade instead of a three-grade system would result in a greater discriminative power that would ensure better reproducibility. The grading scale was derived and modelled using some criteria from the New York Heart Association Functional Classification and the American Medical Association classes of organic heart diseases.The severity of angina on exertion was categorised by independent <b>observers</b> who <b>detailed</b> threshold activities for each level and noted the changes over time (different stages of angina pectoris are based on the level of difficulties patients have with carrying out ordinary activities; ordinary activities includes walking and climbing the stairs).|$|R

Even a small, well-made telescope will show the <b>observer</b> much greater <b>detail</b> than is visible with the naked eye or small binoculars. As the aperture of the telescope mirror (in the case of a reflecting telescope) or lens (in the case of a refracting telescope) increases, smaller and smaller features will begin to appear. With large amateur telescopes, features as small as 0.6 miles (1 km) in diameter can be observed depending on atmospheric conditions.|$|R
40|$|Vierordt and Rubner {{were the}} first to {{investigate}} the metabolism of the infant. Camerer, in 1889, collected a large amount of material and endeavored to determine in heat units the nutritive needs of infants at various ages. He calculated the caloric contents of breast milk based on Pfeiffer's analyses. A considerable number of observation have been made by different men since that time. Each one has, as a rule, made but one or two. Most of them have been made on breast-fed infants; a few on artificially fed. Some of them have extended over the first year, but most of them only over short periods of time. Czerny and Keller, in their hand-book published in 1902, have reviewed the work of previous <b>observers</b> in <b>detail</b> and added a considerable amount of material of their own. Since then, Beuthner has studied three cases, one of which was fed entirely on breast milk, the others partly on breast milk and partly on artificial food. In 1902 he summed up the cases fed on breast milk hitherto studied in private practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This study {{represents}} the first qualitative census of the reef fish assemblage of coral reefs {{in the vicinity}} of Andavadoaka, south-west Madagascar. Observational data of fish species sightings were collected {{over the course of a}} year, while visual census data, with low <b>observer</b> bias, <b>detailing</b> fish assemblage from the four major reef zones of the area were collected in a shorter 5 -week period. A total of three hundred and thirty four (334) species from 58 families were recorded throughout the year, while one hundred and eighty seven (187) species were observed during the shorter assemblage study. The trophic habits of the fish population are comparable with other sites in the Western Indian Ocean, and suggest a healthy fish community, despite evidence of broad-scale damage from coral bleaching and associated mortality. The authors suggest that this can be explained by current relatively low levels of anthropogenic impacts from fishing. However, given the extent of regional reef degradation, fish species diversity may now be particularly vulnerable to future anthropogenic or climatic disturbances, such as increased fishing effort or renewed coral bleaching episodes...|$|R

Malcolm Bell's historical account The Turkey Shoot: Tracking the Attica Cover-up had already been written and Bell was involved with the original New York (State) Special Commission on Attica.|$|R
50|$|Kitto {{had been}} a careful <b>observer</b> of {{physical}} <b>detail</b> - the topography, the animals, architecture, agricultural methods, the manner of interaction between people. His retelling of Bible stories {{in the light of}} what he had seen brought the narratives to life and confirmed the accuracy of the ancient texts. He showed how the activities described by the prophets and apostles accorded with the realities of Eastern culture. He supplemented his own observations with details from the journals of other travellers, and helped the Bible reader to understand many things previously obscure or contradictory to the Western mind. His careful research into the geography, biology and archaeology of Bible lands served to support and encourage confidence in the accuracy of the Bible.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contemporary}} social science, strong {{accounts of}} positivism {{have long since}} fallen out of favour. Practitioners of positivism today acknowledge in far greater <b>detail</b> <b>observer</b> bias and structural limitations. Modern positivists generally eschew metaphysical concerns in favour of methodological debates concerning clarity, replicability, reliability and validity. This positivism is generally equated with [...] "quantitative research" [...] and thus carries no explicit theoretical or philosophical commitments. The institutionalization {{of this kind of}} sociology is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.|$|R
