40|$|Road traffic has {{significant}} impacts on air quality particularly in densely urbanized and populated areas where vehicle emissions {{are a major}} local source of ambient particulate matter. Engine type (i. e., fuel use) significantly impacts the chemical characteristics of tailpipe emission, and thus the distribution of engine types in traffic impacts measured ambient concentrations. This study provides an estimation of the contribution of vehicles powered by different fuels (gasoline, diesel, LPG) to carbonaceous submicron aerosol mass (PM 1) based on ambient aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and elemental carbon (EC) measurements and vehicle count data in an urban inner city environment in Hong Kong with the aim to gauge the importance of different engine types to particulate matter burdens in a typical urban street canyon. On an average per-vehicle basis, gasoline vehicles emitted 75  and 93  % more organics than diesel and LPG vehicles, respectively, while EC emissions from diesel vehicles were 45  % higher than those from gasoline vehicles. LPG vehicles showed no appreciable contributions to EC and thus overall represented a small contributor to traffic-related primary ambient PM 1 despite their high abundance (∼  30  %) in the traffic mix. Total carbonaceous particle mass contributions to ambient PM 1 from diesel engines were only marginally higher (∼  4  %) than those from gasoline engines, which is likely an effect of recently introduced control strategies targeted at commercial vehicles and buses.

40|$|In this work, {{a highly}} {{scalable}} technique is proposed {{as an alternative}} to the lab-scale impregnation method. LSCM-CGO powders were pre-coated with 5 wt% of Ni from nitrates. After appropriate mixing and adequate heat treatment, coated powders were then dispersed into <b>organic</b> based <b>vehicles</b> to form a screen-printable ink which was deposited and fired to form SOFC anode layers. Electrochemical tests show a considerable enhancement of the pre-coated anode performances under 50 ml/min wet H 2 flow with polarization resistance decreased from about 0. 60 cm 2 to 0. 38 cm 2 at 900 C and from 6. 70 cm 2 to 1. 37 cm 2 at 700 C. This is most likely due to the pre-coating process resulting in nano-scaled Ni particles with two typical sizes; from 50 to 200 nm and from 10 to 40 nm. Converging indications suggest that the latter type of particle comes from solid state solution of Ni in LSCM phase under oxidizing conditions and exsolution as nanoparticles under reducing atmospheres.
