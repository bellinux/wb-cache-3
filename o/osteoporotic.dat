5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with <b>osteoporotic</b> fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{medications}} like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and strontium ranelate can {{be helpful}} for the preventing of <b>osteoporotic</b> fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|There are 8.9 million {{fractures}} worldwide {{per year}} due to osteoporosis. Globally, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men {{over the age}} of 50 will have an <b>osteoporotic</b> fracture. Data from the United States shows a decrease in osteoporosis within the general population and in white women, from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006. White and Asian people are at greater risk. People of African descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, although they have the highest risk of death following an <b>osteoporotic</b> fracture.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulants – {{long-term}} use of heparin {{is associated with}} a decrease in bone density, and warfarin (and related coumarins) have been linked with an increased risk in <b>osteoporotic</b> fracture in {{long-term use}}.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} <b>osteoporotic</b> {{fracture}} can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, {{the use of}} medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable.|$|E
25|$|Osteoporosis {{itself has}} no symptoms; its main {{consequence}} is the {{increased risk of}} bone fractures. <b>Osteoporotic</b> fractures occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone; they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures. Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip and wrist.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 250,000 wrist {{fractures}} annually are {{attributable to}} osteoporosis. Wrist fractures are the third {{most common type of}} <b>osteoporotic</b> fractures. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles' fracture is about 16% for white women. By the time women reach age 70, about 20% have had at least one wrist fracture.|$|E

25|$|Estrogen {{prevents}} {{the activity of}} osteoclasts, and improves bone mineral density. Hip fracture is {{a leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality in older females, and usually does not occur in the setting of osteoporosis. Estrogen is the only medical therapy that has been shown to prevent hip fractures in women that are not <b>osteoporotic,</b> with efficacy superior to bisphosphonates or calcium and vitamin D supplementation.|$|E
25|$|SERMs are a {{category}} of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptors throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are raloxifene and tamoxifen. Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium. Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, <b>osteoporotic</b> women and {{reduces the risk of}} invasive breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin K {{deficiency}} {{is also a}} {{risk factor}} for <b>osteoporotic</b> fractures. The gene gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) is dependent on vitamin K. Functional polymorphisms in the gene could attribute to variation in bone metabolism and BMD. Vitamin K2 is also used as a means of treatment for osteoporosis and the polymorphisms of GGCX could explain the individual variation in the response to treatment of vitamin K. Vitamin K supplementation may reduce the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women; however, there is no evidence for men.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{latitude}} affects risk of <b>osteoporotic</b> fracture. Areas of higher latitude such as Northern Europe receive less Vitamin D through sunlight compared to regions closer to the equator, and consequently have higher fracture rates in comparison to lower latitudes. For example, Swedish men and women have a 13.% and 28.5% risk of hip fracture by age 50, respectively, whereas this risk is only 1.9% and 2.4% in Chinese men and women. Diet may also be a factor that is responsible for this difference, as vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and folate are all linked to bone mineral density.|$|E
25|$|Trabecular bone (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in {{the ends}} of long bones and vertebrae. Cortical bone is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active and is more subject to bone {{turnover}} and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common <b>osteoporotic</b> fracture sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.|$|E
25|$|Since ONJ {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} in many patients {{who did not}} take bisphosphonates, it is thus logical to assume that bisphosphonates {{are not the only}} factor in ONJ. While the oversuppression of bone turnover seems {{to play a major role}} in aggravating the disease process, other factors can and do initiate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for ONJ. In non-bisphosphonate cases of ONJ, it is mainly the cancellous portion of the bone and its marrow content that are involved in the disease process. The first stage is an oedema of the bone marrow initiated by a bone infarct, which is itself modulated by numerous causes, leading to myelofibrosis as a result of hypoxia and gradual loss of mineral bone density characteristic of ischaemic osteoporosis. Further deterioration can be triggered by additional bone infarcts leading to anoxia and a localized areas of osteonecrosis within the <b>osteoporotic</b> cancellous bone. Secondary events such as dental infection, injection of local anaesthetics with vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, and trauma can add further complications to the disease process and chronic non-pus forming bone infection osteomyelitis can also be associated with ONJ.|$|E

2500|$|Fractures are {{the most}} {{dangerous}} aspect of osteoporosis. Debilitating acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from [...] osteoporosis {{and can lead to}} further disability and early mortality. These fractures may also be asymptomatic. The most common <b>osteoporotic</b> fractures are of the wrist, spine, shoulder and hip. The symptoms of a vertebral collapse ("compression fracture") are sudden back pain, often with radicular pain (shooting pain due to nerve root compression) and rarely with spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture, loss of height, and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility.|$|E
2500|$|Teriparatide ( [...] a {{recombinant}} {{parathyroid hormone}} [...] ) {{has been shown}} to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy, while effective for osteoporosis, is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. Raloxifene, while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures, does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. Denosumab is also effective for preventing <b>osteoporotic</b> fractures but not in males. In hypogonadal men, testosterone {{has been shown to}} improve bone quantity and quality, but, as of 2008, no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with a normal testosterone levels. Calcitonin while once recommended is no longer due to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk.|$|E

5000|$|Evidence for the {{semi-aquatic}} life of dyrosaurids {{comes from}} careful analysis of bone structure. There {{are two types}} of structural bone organization that can occur in aquatic tetrapods: <b>osteoporotic</b> or pachyostotic. <b>Osteoporotic</b> bone is spongy and porous whereas pachyostotic involves an increase in skeletal mass. Spongy/porous bone such as <b>osteoporotic</b> is associated with faster swimming and better maneuverability in water because of the reduction in bone tissue, many extant cetaceans and marine turtles have <b>osteoporotic</b> bone which enables them to be good swimmers. Pachyostotic bone is a general/local increase in skeletal mass which can be caused by osteosclerosis (inner compaction of bone), pachyostosis (hyperplasy of compact cortices) or pachyeosclerosis (combination of the two). Research on dyrosaur bone performed by Rafael César Lima Pedroso de Andrade, Juliana Manso Sayao revealed that this family had <b>osteoporotic</b> bone tissue indicative of a fast-swimming ecology as well as some osteosclerosis which is a component of pachyostotic bone tissue. Osteoporosis is associated with a fully aquatic lifestyle whereas pachyostotic is not fully aquatic but is associated with fast swimming ecology. Therefore dyrosaurs are semi-aquatic fast swimmers as indicated by their bone structure. Other evidence for near shore, semi-aquatic lifestyle is where the fossils are found, often in transitional marine sediments. -using axial frequency swimming (that used primarily by extant crocodylians) with a greater undulatory motion and frequency of the tail due to highly developed musculature allowing a more powerful forward thrust.|$|E
