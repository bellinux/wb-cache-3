50|$|There {{are some}} fairly large {{assumptions}} embedded here. One of the basics {{is that there}} is a sufficient supply of buildable land that construction is a viable alternative to purchase of an existing property. In some parts of the world today, including in the USA, there are areas which are either so fully developed, or so restrictive in their planning approvals, that new construction is not an option because of the scarcity of land. A related question is whether the building in question is anything that would actually be built again in that market. If the trend of development favors, say, high volume warehousing, would anyone consider building a multi-story manufacturing facility? If the trend is to high density condominium buildings, would anyone consider building a detached house? The cost of constructing an <b>obsolete</b> <b>building</b> isn't considered relevant to market value.|$|E

40|$|The current {{paradigm}} {{in the field}} of architecture today is one of degeneration and <b>obsolete</b> <b>building</b> technologies. Regenerative architecture is the practice of engaging the natural world as the medium for, and generator of the architecture. It responds to and utilizes the living and natural systems that exist on a site that become the “building blocks” of the architecture. Regenerative architecture has two focuses; it is an architecture that focuses on conservation and performance through a focused reduction on the environmental impacts of a building. This paper introduces regenerative architecture as a means for architectural design. I present the Nine Principles of Regenerative Architecture and Place Analysis Criteria, which I developed in order to provide a logical and succinct means for creating regenerative architecture. These are employed and embedded {{in the creation of the}} R_Urban Intervention Dwelling model and tested on the Coop House design project. The result was an architectural design in which the Nine Principles of Regenerative Architecture are embodied through the application of the Place Analysis Criteria process. Though the process underwent many mutations through its infancy, the final product has proven to work in producing successful and potentially regenerative architecture as described in part 1 of this paper...|$|E
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about Magna Carta, {{particularly}} given its recent 800 th birthday. Yet few are prepared to speak against this ancient document for fear that the rule of law, liberty, and even democracy might crumble if Magna Carta no longer stands. This paper argues that Magna Carta should be repealed. First, by studying both Magna Carta’s history and the relevant New Zealand case law, this paper establishes that Magna Carta no longer has any discernible practical use. Though it once represented rights against the monarch, it is now out of date, predominantly misused and is therefore <b>obsolete.</b> <b>Building</b> upon this conclusion the paper argues that little of what Magna Carta supposedly stands for can in fact be justified by legitimate statutory interpretation approaches. Even a generous, purposive approach is not enough to transform Magna Carta from a feudal document signed to end a civil war into a sure guarantee of rights and principles in modern New Zealand. Furthermore, Magna Carta does not live up {{to the rule of law}} it supposedly epitomises. It is an unnecessary, overly detailed and inaccessible piece of legislation. Finally, it is argued that New Zealand’s constitutional framework would be better off without Magna Carta. New Zealand’s ability to provide effective rights protection and adhere to the rule of law does not depend on the charter signed at Runnymede. Excessive reverence for the past robs New Zealanders of a constitutional framework that suits our unique nation. On this basis, the paper concludes that Magna Carta should be repealed...|$|E
40|$|Exploring the 'palimpsest' as {{a device}} for {{interrogating}} the designed environment as a multi-layered entity, {{this paper will}} consider its pedagogic value for design, design history and design cultures. Engaging the student as detective, we propose forensic methods as a ‘way in’ to design and designing that includes survey and surveillance, the employment of intuition and narrative reconstruction. Approaching the designed environment as palimpsest reveals the capacity of time to fold back on itself, retrieving elements of the past rather than effacing it and also re-engaging the obsolescent – where ‘an <b>obsolete</b> <b>building</b> is in place but out of time’ (Cairns and Jacobs). A forensic, interrogative mode draws on methods designers and design historians are often already engaged in but, by speculating on the spaces of design as a pseudo-crime scene we can reveal hidden relationships between people, things and environments – through the collection of clues and the interpretation of traces as signs of more complex processes. At the crime-scene everything is of potential significance, bringing into focus a flat ontology of things and the ‘vibrancy of matter’ (from Jane Bennett). And yet, for detectives as for design students, the time-line of the procedure is key – gathering information, establishing priorities and registering effects – as the investigation moves from the 'scene' to the ‘forum’. Employing the designed environment as classroom – for designers, a space to design in and for design historians, an active site for learning about design – we aim to challenge the traditional schism between disciplinary territories...|$|E

40|$|Current global {{efforts for}} energy {{conservation}} and optimization {{are focused on}} improvements in energy supply and production systems, and on encouraging the adoption of energy-efficient devices and equipment. However, systematic assessments of economic and technical implications when adopting energy-efficient alternative systems in buildings {{have not yet been}} explored thoroughly. The uncertainty about the consequences of investing in alternative energy-efficient systems has led to a prolonged utilization of <b>obsolete</b> <b>building</b> systems (underperforming HVAC systems, inefficient lighting systems, badly maintained and equipment, and so forth). This has led to overall poor energy efficiency, creating considerable burden on the building operation budget. This research discusses the procedure for formulating an investment strategy to improve existing building energy performance. The approach is suitable for large building portfolios where a plethora of potential refurbishment interventions can be considered. This makes our approach especially suited for use on university campuses and most of this report will focus on that particular application utilization protocols especially for use on campuses. This investment model only looks at the energy related savings versus investments; it is well understood that the ultimate selection of the optimal set of improvement options of a portfolio will be determined by additional considerations, such as overall value, occupant satisfaction, productivity improvements, aesthetics, etc. Nevertheless, many campus managers are confronted with the question how much energy they can save with a given investment amount. This is exactly what our approach helps to answer. The investment optimization strategy is implemented in software "InvEnergy," which systematically calculates {{the costs and benefits of}} all possible building-technology pairings, taking uncertainties in the saving/investment calculations and estimates into account. This tool empowers decision makers in facility management to make complex investment decisions during continuous building commissioning. M. S.

40|$|The {{research}} {{works on}} the issue of the Italian mass housing, because it’s believed that housing is playing a key role in the current social and economic situation that involves the entire Country. The Italian mass housing sector is now experiencing a deep crisis in social and economic terms. It’s also living a strong contradiction. There is in fact a great demand for housing, which doesn’t receive an adequate response in terms of functionality and affordability, and at the same time a large, unused and <b>obsolete</b> <b>building</b> heritage, both as regards the new that the existing. This has inevitably bring to a paralysis of the construction sector and consequently of the construction industry. What we can see today in Italy, despite the goodness of the original intentions of the Big Plans of Sixties and Seventies, is in the most of cases a large building stock become prematurely obsolescent, with a life potential further reduced in the light of the recent regulations in terms of sustainability and energy efficiency, creating situations of precarious housing conditions, fertile ground for social and urban degradation. For this reason the research mainly focus itself on the rehabilitation of the existing building stock. The aims of the research is to investigate, on one hand potentiality and limitations of the Open Building approach applied to the prefabricated systems of the Italian housing of the Seventies, on the other hand a system and a hierarchy of components that can be industrialized and customized, and their interdependencies. This as a strategy for rehabilitation interventions. This can become a big ground of experimentation, able to give new rules and a new direction for the future, more efficient and sustainable, building construction.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the renovation of}} Grenoble University's library. It is the main inter-university documentary cooperation service (SICD 2) network in Grenoble, which serves two Universities: Stendhal and Pierre Mendès France. Administratively it {{is attached to the}} latter. After the 1989 Micquel Report, which was a severe appraisal of France's university libraries, the state showed its intention to upgrade them by preparing the U 2000 programme. The objectives were to create more working places, unrestricted access to documentation, improve user comfort, and change the image of the libraries. In June 1994, replying to representations by the President of Grenoble's Université Pierre Mendès-France (UPMF) on safety problems at the Law and Humanities Library, the Construction and Maintenance Department at the Ministry of Education requested an "all-encompassing approach to upgrading work, covering safety and refurbishment to as-new standard", and stipulated that "this policy review should be conducted as part of the preparation of the new establishment contract". This context gave rise to the rehabilitation and restructuring of the library. In 1995, the universities and the SICD set themselves an ambition: to turn the 1960 s library into a documentary resource for the 21 st century, making it the lynchpin of the SICD library network and providing suitable premises. The project symbolically called "Doc 2000 " was created. After a long gestation period, during which funding was gradually secured, the project entered the execution phase. The relevance of the project was tested by numerous twists and turns: a fruitless invitation to tender and shifting project ownership; three university presidents; two SICD directors and one interim-director, who also directed the university library; and the involvement of two project leaders. I intend to show how hard it is for the library, {{at the end of the}} process chain, to reconcile and align the scheduling of the works, the scheduling of the service changes and structural organisation, and the works themselves. I'll outline the basic economics of the project, which combines an <b>obsolete</b> <b>building</b> with thoughts on the necessary evolution of its services. Then, I'll attempt to show how we tried to develop the existing building to cater for evolving services. Lastly, I'll explain why execution of the works was like sailing down a long tempestuous river...|$|E

40|$|With rapid {{economic}} development and restructuring, there are {{an increasing number of}} aged or <b>obsolete</b> <b>buildings</b> in large cities, such as Hong Kong. Adaptive reuse of these buildings provides an alternative for property stakeholders towards more sustainable practices instead of redevelopment or destruction. Adaptive reuse can also make great contributions to sustainable development by reducing construction waste and saving natural resources. As a result of industrial restructuring, manufacturing plants were migrated from Hong Kong to Mainland China during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Many industrial buildings then became vacant or under-utilised. Adaptive reuse of these industrial buildings is considered a viable way forward for all parties, including government, property stakeholders and the community. However, the problem is how to deal with multiple criteria to assess how these buildings can be reused for residential living, retail, training centres, or other purposes.

40|$|In {{the complex}} interplay of {{segmented}} office markets and short- and long-term developments, a drama {{is taking place}} at an intermediate time scale: office <b>buildings</b> are becoming <b>obsolete</b> before their time. Since the mid- 1980 s, the problems arising from premature obsolescence, diminishing returns, higher costs, and increasing vacancies have drawn attention in the Netherlands. Premature obsolescence {{is the result of}} developments on the demand and supply side of the office market but also of the changing structure of cities. This study revolves around the owners experiences with the obsolescence of their office buildings in Amsterdam and Rotterdam and the strategies they use to cope with the problems associated with obsolescence. The owners of <b>obsolete</b> office <b>buildings</b> have a whole range of strategies to choose from, which may be grouped under two headings: property development (refurbishment and redevelopment, intended for either re-use as offices or as accommodation for other functions); and other forms of management (entailing little or no upgrading, intended for either maintenance or sale). The conditions for investment in renewal were not favourable during {{a large part of the}} research period. Yet for the majority of owners, the alternative strategies extension of lease without refurbishment, sale, change of function were even less attractive. The financial constraints played a key role in the decision-making. The limited financial scope for investment in renewal was not only the result of the realistic market rents for office space and for other uses; it was also a result of the financial obstacles introduced by the long-term owners themselves. This behaviour may be traced back to the use of old-fashioned methods of bookkeeping and valuation. Over the past few years, real growth in rents has created more financial leeway for that kind of investment. In the same period the owners who are active on the real estate investment market have become more professional. External benchmarks have forced them to act with greater transparency, show more market-responsiveness, and be more realistic in their bookkeeping. Thus, one may expect to see fewer constraints on investment in or sale of <b>obsolete</b> office <b>buildings.</b> A more 'normal' market of <b>obsolete</b> <b>buildings</b> will come into play, whereby possibilities and challenges will arise for different kinds of actors. The economic obsolescence of office premises will be a manageable problem for owners only if the locational obsolescence of the sites can be prevented. These locational problems cannot be solved by the owners of the premises alone. A regionally co-ordinated policy of local governments will be needed to upgrade the quality and capacity of existing office locations before releasing an ample supply of greenfields for office development. As long as existing office locations retain their appeal to office firms, the rent level can be kept up through a 'locational premium' effect. This creates additional financial possibilities for investment in renewal of the building...|$|R

Among these {{functional}} obsolesences, taking place as an outcome of ever changing modes of production and consumption, are of crucial importance so far as their fate of existing urban fabric is concerned. Defunct buildings become derelict and often subject to demolition which amounts to the eradication of the collective memory. In this connection the process of adaptive reuse can be defined as the task of adjusting functionally <b>obsolete</b> <b>buildings</b> for new program requirements through building conversion. Adaptive reuse projects entail not only alterations within the boundaries of an existing building envelope but also radical changes/transformations in the space configuration so as to accommodate the new set of functional requirements. Therefore, the development of an architectural design scheme in the light of potentials offered and the constraints imposed by an existing architectural entity is essential. Although adaptive reuse projects require case specific approaches depending on the peculiarities of the original structure three main areas of concern can be discerned during the elaboration of the design scheme. These areas of concerns are the space configuration, tectonic aspects of the context within which the project will be realized. The paper addresses itself to the elucidation of these concern areas and the interrelations with the final scheme...|$|R
40|$|In {{terms of}} {{construction}} and energy efficiency, Spain {{has one of}} the highest indexes of <b>obsolete</b> <b>buildings</b> among the developed countries. In the case of high-rise hotel buildings, this problem is further added to by the low levels of safety in the case of fire. The development of tourism in the 1950 s and 60 s led to the construction of a large number of high-rise hotels with 30 + floors. Initially, they conformed to lax, undemanding regulations regarding fire resistance in their structural components, fire escape routes, protected staircases, and so on. The requirements of today’s regulations in this field, contained in the Basic SI Technical Building Code Document, often make the renovation of these buildings an impossible task. Installing specially protected staircases can entail traumatic modifications that are sometimes unviable due to structural conditions or economic considerations. Furthermore, the building’s energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions do not correspond to environmentally-friendly practices. This paper examines the above questions with regard to the Hotel Tryp Gran Sol in Alicante, Spain. The hotel is 97 m high and has 31 floors. The integrated renovation of the hotel requires serious reflection upon the building’s global response to personal safety, its envelope components and its air conditioning.

This procedure matches the building typologies selected to the optimal solution for each case. The analysis focuses on buildings constructed between the 1960 s and the 1980 s in Castellón, Spain. The buildings selected are representative of the period, of compact cities, and of the Mediterranean climate region. Three types of intervention on the envelope have been considered. The analysis for the most appropriate intervention in each case was based on economic, environmental, technical, and social factors. It shows that the best solution for Terraced Houses (TH) and Multi-family Houses (MH) is exterior refurbishment with additional insulation on the façade. This solution is achieved at reasonable cost by reducing one-third of the primary energy consumed. The best solution for Apartment Blocks (AB) is exterior retrofitting with ventilated façades, which offers the best performance from a technical, environmental, and economic perspective.
