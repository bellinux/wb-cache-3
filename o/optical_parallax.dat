5000|$|Point cloud mapping is {{a process}} being {{developed}} by Michael Taylor [...] using <b>optical</b> <b>parallax</b> scanning technology whereby thousands of measurements are made around {{the trunk of a}} tree. These can be used to recreate a three-dimensional model of the trunk and volume data is among the values that can be calculated. There are a handful of widely available technologies including ground LIDAR) and <b>optical</b> <b>parallax</b> scanners that can quickly and accurately map a trunk. LIDAR has the best range. The problem is in a cluttered forest environment {{you get a lot of}} ‘noise’ and unwanted cloud points, hundreds of thousands potentially, but these can be filtered out. The surface of tree trunks can be mapped using an optical scanner which measures pixel off-set ratio between a digital camera focal center and line laser projection and blends with photo pixel data. Taylor reports [...] this optical data can be supplemented using a system such as an Impulse200LR laser and Mapsmart software [...] to target tight areas where cloud density is low and/or not reachable by optical scanning technology, provided a properly scaled skeleton framework is established with the MapSmart/Impulse200 combination first. The data can be saved as a [...]ply file which can be viewed and manipulated with a variety of software packages including the free open source 3D graphics viewer Meshlab. [...] There are several software programs available that can be used to calculate the volume of the space defined by the point cloud including some tree specific currently under development.|$|E
5000|$|A {{depression}} {{position finder}} (DPF) measured the range {{to a distant}} target (such as a ship) by solving a right triangle in which the short side was the height the instrument above mean low water; one angle was the constant right angle between the short side and {{the plane of the}} ocean, and the second angle was the depression angle from the horizontal of the instrument as it sighted down from a fire control tower or a base end station at the target. These calculations were [...] "built into" [...] the scales and gearing of the instrument, which also corrected for the curvature of the earth and for <b>optical</b> <b>parallax,</b> so the horizontal range to the target could be read off of a dial on the DPF.|$|E
50|$|Many trees flare outward {{significantly}} at {{the base}} and this basal wedge has a complex surface of bumps and hollows. This becomes an even more complex volume in trees growing on a slope. Approximations {{of the volume of}} this basal segment using best estimates of the effective diameters exhibited may be used in many cases. In other cases footprint mapping is an option. In footprint mapping a level, rectangular reference frame is placed {{around the base of the}} tree to create a horizontal plane. The position of the multiple points on the trunk surface is measured with respect to the frame and plotted. This process is repeated at different heights creating a series of virtual slices at different heights. The volume of each individual slice is then calculated and all are added together to determine the volume of the basal wedge. Taylor has been developing a cloud mapping process using <b>optical</b> <b>parallax</b> scanning technology whereby thousands of measurements are made around the trunk of a tree. These can be used to recreate a three-dimensional model of the trunk and volume data is among the values that can be calculated.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from a high-sensitivity (60 μJy), {{large-scale}} (2. 26 deg^ 2) survey obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array {{as part of the}} Gould's Belt Survey program. We detected 374 and 354 sources at 4. 5 and 7. 5 GHz, respectively. Of these, 148 are associated with previously known young stellar objects (YSOs). Another 86 sources previously unclassified at either optical or infrared wavelengths exhibit radio properties that are consistent with those of young stars. The overall properties of our sources at radio wavelengths such as their variability and radio to X-ray luminosity relation are consistent with previous results from the Gould's Belt Survey. Our detections provide target lists for follow-up Very Long Baseline Array radio observations to determine their distances as YSOs are located in regions of high nebulosity and extinction, making it difficult to measure <b>optical</b> <b>parallaxes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Distances to AGB {{stars with}} {{optically}} thick circumstellar shells cannot be determined using <b>optical</b> <b>parallaxes.</b> However, for stars with OH 1612 MHz maser emission emanating from their circumstellar shells, distances {{can be determined}} by the phase-lag method. This method combines a linear diameter obtained from a phase-lag measurement with an angular diameter obtained from interferometry. The phase-lag of the variable emission from the back and front sides of the shells has been determined for 20 OH/IR stars in the galactic disk. These measurements are based on a monitoring program with the Nancay radio telescope ongoing for more than 6 years. The interferometric observations are continuing. We estimate that the uncertainties of the distance determination will be ~ 20 %. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures. Proceedings of the Conference "Why Galaxies Care About AGB Stars III", Vienna 2014, Eds.

50|$|Not all {{trees have}} a single trunk, and other single trunk trees pose {{additional}} measurement problems because of their size or configuration. The odd forms include those forms that grew because of unusual circumstances that affected the tree, or those trees that simply have an unusual growth form not seen in most other tree species. Frank proposed a classification system for various tree forms: 1) Single Trunk Trees; 2) Multi-trunk Trees; 3) Clonal Coppices; 4) Clonal Colonies; 5) Conjoined and Hugging Trees; 6) Fallen Trees; 7) Tree complexes, and 8) Banyan-like trees; 9) Trees with Large Aerial Root Systems; and 10) Epiphytic Trees. This initial framework has continued to evolve in discussions within the NTS, but provides an initial beginning and {{suggestions on how to}} approach measuring these various tree growth forms.Since most of these trees are unique or unusual in their form and not amenable to easy measurement, the recommended approach is to write a detailed narrative description of the tree with what measurements that can be taken to amplify and better illuminate the descriptions. These trees should be documented even if the results are {{in the form of a}} written narrative rather than a collection of numerical measurements.There are some parameters that should be consistently measured whenever possible, height is one example. The cross-sectional areas occupied by the trunks and the crown are also parameters that are generally measurable. Other measurements could be taken where they seem to add to the narrative description of that particular tree. GPS locations should be taken whenever possible. Absent a GPS instrument, the locations should be pulled from Google Maps, or topographic maps. Beyond these basics, values like number of trunks larger than a prescribed value, the maximum girth of the largest trunk, and whatever seems appropriate for that particular tree grouping should be recorded. Photographs of these unusual trees are important as they can immensely improve the understanding of what is being described, and help others to visualize the tree. A process or system is needed whereby the photos of a particular tree can be associated with the description of the tree in the researcher’s notes. The goal of the narrative and measurements is to document the tree or tree grouping.An approach needs to be developed that is appropriate for each of these unusual forms. For example, clonal colonies, such as the Pando aspen, may occupy many acres. The area occupied by the colony should be measured as well as the size of the largest individual trunk present. Banyan-like trees similarly consist of multiple trunks spread across a large area. In many of these specimens the interior trunks are not easily accessible, if accessible at all. An approach to their measurement would be to measure the area occupied by the many trunks, the area occupied by the crown of the tree, the height of the tree, and any other measurements the investigator deems appropriate. These measurements would then be supplemented by a narrative description and photographs. The goal in all of these cases of trees with unusual forms is to document their characteristics.Girth can also be thought of as essentially a snapshot of the cross-section of a tree at one particular elevation. In some cases the base of the tree may be so complex that simply wrapping a tape around the base would misrepresent the true wood girth or character of the tree. An example of this would be Big Tree of Tule in Santa María del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico described above. The Tule tree has a diameter of 38 ft as measured by tape wrap, but because of its irregularity a cross-sectional wood area expressed as a circle gave an effective diameter of only 30 ft. The base of the tree was mapped in three dimensions using a frame mapping technique. A rectangular frame was strung around the perimeter of the tree. A series of measurements from the reference lines to the edge of the trunk mapping the irregularities of the tree surface and converted to Cartesian x-y coordinates. The process was repeated at different heights to create a three-dimensional model of the tree.This mapping process can be automated. Taylor has been developing a cloud mapping process using <b>optical</b> <b>parallax</b> scanning technology whereby thousands of measurements are made around the trunk of a tree. These can be used to recreate a three-dimensional model of the trunk and girth and diameter data are among the values that can be calculated.|$|E
40|$|Many {{scientific}} studies investigate and technical applications use the acoustical localization {{in the field}} of vision. Therefore it is suitable to display the perceived auditory direction by a light point. In formerly known methods subjects use a hand-held light pointer or a pointer mounted on a revolvable axle in front of them. However, the subject’s motor system or the <b>optical</b> <b>parallax</b> may influence the results of those techniques. The calibration of the system and data logging also turn out to be difficult. The proposed new method utilizes a laser pointer with a deflection unit instead, which is controlled by a computer. Subjects enter the perceived sound direction with a trackball. The laser spot moves according to the rotation of the ball smoothly on a defined track. A complicated mechanical calibration can be avoided by calibrating the deflection unit by a computer. The intuitive experimental operation and the high resolution of the system make this method particularly suitable for localization research in audiology, psychoacoustics, and virtual acoustics. The symmetric, bimodal outlay of the experimental task reduces interaction effects between different modalities. Localization results for variable and fixed initial laser position obtained by this method are presented and compared to results acquired by other methods. PACS no. 43. 66. Yw, 43. 66. Qp, 43. 66.

40|$|The pulsar wind nebula (PWN) {{associated}} with the Vela pulsar is a bright source in the radio, X-ray and gamma-ray bands, {{but not in the}} optical. This source is very near, lying at a distance of 290 pc, as inferred from the radio and <b>optical</b> <b>parallax</b> measurements of the pulsar. Knowledge of the brightness and structure of the Vela PWN in optical is important in order to constrain the underlying particle spectrum (and possibly the B-field properties and particle losses) {{associated with}} this extended source. We use results from the Digital Sky Survey, as well as results obtained using the SAAO 1. 0 m telescope equipped with an imaging CCD (STE 4) and BV filters, in an attempt to measure optical radiation from Vela X. To enlarge our field of view, we constructed a mosaic consisting of 3 × 3 frames around the pulsar position. We present spectral measurements from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H. E. S. S.), Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), ASCA, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Very Large Telescope (VLT), New Technology Telescope (NTT), andWilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), in addition to our optical results. Using these data, we investigate whether or not the radio synchrotron component can be smoothly extrapolated to the optical band. This would constrain the electron population to consist of either a single or multiple components, representing a significant advancement in our understanding of this complex multiwavelength source.

The deduced kinematic age of the inner bright core of the nebula is 1039 ± 259 years; however, the kinematic age of the polar caps that surround the core is larger - perhaps the result of deceleration or earlier mass ejection.
