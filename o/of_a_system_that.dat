5|$|On 23 February, KSCB {{received}} its worst bombardment {{of the entire}} battle. During one eight-hour period the base was rocked by 1,307 North Vietnamese rounds, most of which came from 130mm (used {{for the first time}} on the battlefield) and 152mm artillery pieces located in Laos. Casualties from the bombardment were ten killed and 51 wounded. Two days later US troops detected NVA trenches running due north to within 25 meters of the base perimeter. The majority of these were around the southern and southeastern corners of the perimeter, and formed part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> would be developed throughout the end of February and into March until they were ready to be used to launch an attack, providing cover for troops to advance to jumping off points close to the perimeter. These tactics were reminiscent of those employed against the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, particularly in relation to entrenching tactics and artillery placement, and the realization assisted US planners in their targeting decisions.|$|E

25|$|It {{follows from}} the second law of {{thermodynamics}} that the entropy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> is not isolated may decrease. An air conditioner, for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, {{in agreement with the}} second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{operating}} systems that were significant in their day but are no longer so, such as AmigaOS; OS/2 from IBM and Microsoft; classic Mac OS, the non-Unix precursor to Apple's macOS; BeOS; XTS-300; RISC OS; MorphOS; Haiku; BareMetal and FreeMint. Some are still used in niche markets {{and continue to be}} developed as minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist applications. OpenVMS, formerly from DEC, is still under active development by Hewlett-Packard. Yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively in academia, for operating systems education or to do research on operating system concepts. A typical example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> fulfills both roles is MINIX, while for example Singularity is used purely for research.|$|E
25|$|HR 8799 {{is a young}} (~30 million-year-old) {{main-sequence star}} located 129 light years (39 parsecs) away from Earth in the {{constellation}} of Pegasus, with roughly 1.5 times the Sun's mass and 4.9 times its luminosity. It is part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> also contains a debris disk and at least four massive planets. Those planets, along with Fomalhaut b, were the first extrasolar planets whose orbital motion was confirmed via direct imaging. The designation HR 8799 is the star's identifier in the Bright Star Catalogue. The star is a Gamma Doradus variable: its luminosity changes because of non-radial pulsations of its surface. The star is also classified as a Lambda Boötis star, which means its surface layers are depleted in iron peak elements. This {{may be due to}} the accretion of metal-poor circumstellar gas. It is the only known star which is simultaneously a Gamma Doradus variable, a Lambda Boötis type, and a Vega-like star (a star with excess infrared emission caused by a circumstellar disk).|$|E

25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the People's Republic, industrial development has been given considerable attention; as of 2011 46% of China's national output continued to be devoted to investment; a percentage far higher than any other nation. Among the various industrial branches the machine-building and metallurgical industries have received the highest priority. These two areas alone now account for about 20–30 percent of the total gross value of industrial output. In these, as in most other areas of industry, however, innovation has generally suffered at the hands <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> has rewarded increases in gross output rather than improvements in variety, sophistication and quality. China, therefore, still imports significant quantities of specialized steels. Overall industrial output has grown at an average rate of more than 10 percent per year, having surpassed all other sectors in economic growth and degree of modernization. Some heavy industries and products deemed to be of national strategic importance remain state-owned, but an increasing proportion of lighter and consumer-oriented manufacturing firms are privately held or are private-state joint ventures.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two related}} {{definitions}} of entropy: the thermodynamic definition and the statistical mechanics definition. Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the classical thermodynamics viewpoint, {{the system is}} composed of very large numbers of constituents (atoms, molecules) {{and the state of}} the system is described by the average thermodynamic properties of those constituents; the details of the system's constituents are not directly considered, but their behavior is described by macroscopically averaged properties, e.g. temperature, pressure, entropy, heat capacity. The early classical definition of the properties of the system assumed equilibrium. The classical thermodynamic definition of entropy has more recently been extended into the area of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Later, the thermodynamic properties, including entropy, were given an alternative definition in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system — modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, phonons, spins, etc.). The statistical mechanics description of the behavior of a system is necessary as the definition of the properties of a system using classical thermodynamics become an increasingly unreliable method of predicting the final state <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> is subject to some process.|$|E
500|$|The energy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> emits a photon is {{decreased}} {{by the energy}} [...] of the photon as measured in the rest frame of the emitting system, which {{may result in a}} reduction in mass in the amount [...] Similarly, the mass <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> absorbs a photon is increased by a corresponding amount. As an application, the energy balance of nuclear reactions involving photons is commonly written in terms of the masses of the nuclei involved, and terms of the form [...] for the gamma photons (and for other relevant energies, such as the recoil energy of nuclei).|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} since Behe {{proposed}} irreducible complexity, new developments and advances in biology, such as an improved understanding {{of the evolution of}} flagella, have already undermined these arguments. The idea that seemingly irreducibly complex systems cannot evolve has been refuted through evolutionary mechanisms, such as exaptation (the adaptation of organs for entirely new functions) and the use of [...] "scaffolding," [...] which are initially necessary features <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> later degenerate when they are no longer required. Potential evolutionary pathways have been provided for all of the systems Behe used as examples of irreducible complexity.|$|E
500|$|Others took a {{more nuanced}} view. Copland and MacMaster deemed Mason's views similar to other Virginians of his class: [...] "Mason's {{experience}} with slave labor made him hate slavery but his heavy investment in slave property {{made it difficult for}} him to divest himself <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> he despised". According to Wallenstein, [...] "whatever his occasional rhetoric, George Mason was—if one must choose—proslavery, not antislavery. He acted in behalf of Virginia slaveholders, not Virginia slaves". Broadwater noted, [...] "Mason consistently voiced his disapproval of slavery. His 1787 attack on slavery echoes a similar speech to the Virginia Convention of 1776. [...] His conduct was another matter." ...|$|E

The United States Air Force issued General Operational Requirement-170 on 19 June 1958 ordering the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> was capable of destroying a satellite. Then the United States Air Force and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) commissioned studies by the Space Technology Laboratories and the Radio Corporation of America.
