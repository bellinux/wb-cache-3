5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{probably}} {{took place}} at Amorion, {{the capital of the}} Anatolic Theme. From there, the rebel army, comprising almost half of the Empire's available military forces, marched north and west, following the military road to Nicomedia and then to Chrysopolis, the town that lay across the Bosporus from the imperial capital, Constantinople. There, Bardanes encamped for eight days, awaiting a possible uprising against Nikephoros inside the capital in response to his own rebellion. Since this did not materialize, and the populace proved not overtly enthusiastic, he withdrew to the great army base at Malagina. There, two of his associates, Michael the Amorian and Leo the Armenian, abandoned him, and were richly rewarded by Nikephoros for their defection: Michael became Count <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tent</b> to the Emperor, and Leo was appointed commander of the Foederati regiment.|$|E
25|$|There were no animal {{tracks and}} the group would not have {{abandoned}} the relative security <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} rows of {{temporary}} dwellings in <b>the</b> Venice <b>Tent</b> City, 1900 - 1909. <b>The</b> <b>tent</b> city is at center and {{is made up of}} hundreds of large tents and buildings with cloth walls and roofs. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> are long and rectangular, but five at center are square in shape. A narrow dirt street bordered by concrete sidewalks cuts through the city at center and intersects with another street that runs around <b>the</b> perimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents.</b> A tower made from wooden scaffolding can be seen at left, and in the distance, <b>the</b> profile <b>of</b> a long bluff can be seen...|$|R
50|$|Hundreds of stalls are {{scattered}} around the venue offering food and drinks with the stall holders coming {{from all over the}} world to be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event. Political debates are also held in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both concerts sold out, {{with over}} 10,000 {{attendees}} for each, but Astbury lost around $50,000 on <b>the</b> festival. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> for <b>the</b> advocacy groups drew long lineups from attendees, who {{signed up to}} support the causes.|$|R
25|$|Because {{at least}} two of the exits were blocked by the chutes used to bring the show's big cats in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> people trying to escape could not bypass them. Some died from {{injuries}} sustained after leaping from the tops of the bleachers in hopes they could escape under the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> though that method of escape ended up killing more than it saved. Others died after being trampled by other spectators, with some asphyxiating underneath the piles of people who fell over each other.|$|E
25|$|The main {{rectangular}} {{space of}} the church is crowned with a tent and complicated with an altar apse and two deep niches, which gave the interior an incomplete cross-cupola shape. Two pairs of intersecting pointed arches, forming the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> rest on the half-columns of the walls. Just as in the vestry, the inner surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> is hewn in the graceful shape of stalactites which also decorate the capitals of the half-columns and the conch of the altar apse. The decoration of the southern wall is most interesting compositionally. Carved on it are small triple arches with conchs of various shapes, connected at the top and at the bottom by a complicated and finely carved floral ornament.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{paraffin}} wax waterproofing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> the flames spread rapidly. Many people were badly burned by the melting paraffin, which rained {{down from the}} roof. The fiery tent collapsed in about eight minutes according to eyewitness survivors, trapping hundreds of spectators beneath it.|$|E
50|$|According {{to ancient}} book descriptions, {{colorful}} tents {{set up on}} <b>the</b> shore <b>of</b> Murat are seen, <b>the</b> golden <b>tent</b> would always be the king's, <b>the</b> most beautiful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> usually belonged to <b>the</b> elite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation.

25|$|The Gershonites, {{numbered}} 7,500, camped {{behind the}} Tabernacle, to the west, and had {{charge of the}} Tabernacle, the tent, its covering, the screen for the entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> the hangings of the enclosure, the screen for {{the entrance of the}} enclosure that surrounded the Tabernacle, and the altar.|$|E
25|$|The coarse outer fibers {{have been}} {{traditionally}} used by nomads to make ropes and tents. In earlier times, the coarse hair was mixed with down hair {{to make the}} weaving denser. However, the current increasing demand for the down fiber from the international market means that the fine fiber is mostly sold. The rarity of the white hair implicates that ropes made out of white and black Yarn is admired for its appearance and uniqueness. In west Sichuan, China, 34% of the animal fiber comes from yak hair alone. In Bhutan, the long hair is used for weaving tents, bags, rugs and slings, whereas in Mongolia it is used for clothing tents and bags. To obtain the optimal length, nomads comb the hair and then spin it into yarn. During this process, the loom determines the width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> squares and the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b> The tent squares are then sewn tightly together by men.|$|E
25|$|It {{is entirely}} dug {{out of the}} rock and has an equal-armed {{cruciform}} plan. The interior is lined by two crossed arches with a central stalactite dome. An inscription records {{that it was the}} work of the architect Galdzak, who also constructed the other rock-cut church and the jhamatuns within a period of some forty years. His name is inscribed at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> decorated with reliefs showing pomegranates.|$|E

Two people covered in blankets can be seen in or near a wagon at left. Barren desert land {{can be seen in the}} background. Photoprint reads: "Chief Fast Thunders Camp"...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of San Diego's Hotel Del Coronado {{surrounded}} by a massive tent city, ca. 1888. The hotel is in the distance at center. It is a large building with a huge conical tower at left and several smaller towers at center. The foreground is occupied by a large group <b>of</b> <b>tents.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> are striped and all have rectangular bases with tapered roofs. Several low wooden buildings form a row at center. Railroad tracks can be seen cutting through <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> city at left. <b>The</b> <b>tent</b> city was a popular vacation destination around <b>the</b> turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century...|$|R

25|$|The flap {{is thrown}} back and Candaules emerges. His Queen, Nisia, {{with the aid}} of her women, put on armour. She is {{attended}} by Amazons and, under her direction, warlike games are played; meanwhile, Candaules's warriors practise the testudo. The games end and silence reigns. Suddenly, a messenger gives a warning of a night attack. Candaules orders everyone to be on the alert and a warrior, Gyges, is placed at the entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Performances are 90 {{minutes long}} and {{take place in}} a 600 {{capacity}} Spiegeltent, with performances taking place on a stage that is only nine feet in diameter. Audience members sit in a circle around the stage, on folding chairs. Guests can drink alcohol during the show, and freely order beverages from areas in the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> during the show. After the show ends, the exit opens to the beer garden at Caesar's Palace.|$|E
25|$|Schottenhamel â Reckoned to be {{the most}} {{important}} tent at the Oktoberfest, mainly because it is located at the beginning. On the first Saturday of the event, no beer is allowed to be served until the Mayor of Munich (currently Dieter Reiter) taps the first keg, at exactly high noon. Only then can the other tents begin to serve beer. The tent is very popular among younger people. A substantial part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> is guaranteed to traditional Studentenverbindungen (a particular form of student fraternities) and outfitted with their distinctive colors and coats of arms.|$|E
50|$|Between {{the late}} 1920s {{and the early}} 1960s, some South Australian railway {{maintenance}} gangs working in country areas where {{they were required to}} live on-site, were accommodated in caravans built by <b>the</b> department instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> they had previously used. These caravans were built like short railway carriages, about 6.1 m long; but had wooden wheels with solid rubber tyres and ball bearings.|$|R
50|$|A version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bell <b>tent,</b> <b>the</b> sibley <b>tent</b> {{was invented}} by Henry Hopkins Sibley, who had studied the Native American tipi during the expeditions he {{carried out in the}} American Old West. He {{patented}} his tent design in 1858.|$|R

25|$|The middle tent was {{destroyed}} completely by fire in 1953. The front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> was rebuilt during 1962 to 1964 {{under the leadership}} of palace architect Ragnar Hjorth. The buildings behind the tent faÃ§ades were rebuilt in 1977-1978, following plans by palace architect TorbjÃ¶rn Olsson. He turned the stableyard, formerly open, into a tent room with a ceiling. Today the middle copper tent is home to the Haga Park Museum. The tent to the east houses a restaurant and the one on the western side is accommodation. The copper tents are a national monument and protected under law.|$|E
25|$|The couple {{are buried}} in a {{remarkable}} tomb {{in the shape of}} a Bedouin tent, designed by Isabel, in the cemetery of St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church Mortlake in southwest London. The coffins of Sir Richard and Lady Burton can be seen through a window at the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> which can be accessed via a short fixed ladder. Next to the lady chapel in the church there is a memorial stained-glass window to Burton, also erected by Isabel; it depicts Burton as a mediaeval knight. Burton's personal effects and a collection of paintings, photographs and objects relating to him are in the Burton Collection at Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people believe}} it was a {{military}} accident which was then covered up; there are records of parachute mines being tested by the Russian military in the area around the time the hikers were there. Parachute mines detonate a meter or two before they hit the ground and produce similar damage to those experienced by the hikers, heavy internal damage with very little external trauma. There were also glowing orbs reported in the sky in that general vicinity, possibly caused by such ordnance. This theory uses animals to account for the missing parts of Dubinina. People believe the bodies were moved; photos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> show that it was apparently erected incorrectly, something that these experienced hikers are unlikely to have done.|$|E

2500|$|In this tent live Mrs B's five {{children}} (three quite grown up) {{and a little}} Kaffir servant girl. Many tents have more occupants. Mrs M. ...has six children in camp, all ill, two in the tin hospital with typhoid, and four sick in <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b> A terrible evil just now is the dew. It is so heavy, and comes through <b>the</b> single canvas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents,</b> wetting everythingâ¦ All the morning the gangways are filled with the blankets and odds and ends, regularly turned out to dry in the sun. The doctor told me today he highly disapproved of tents for young children, and expected a high mortality before June.|$|R
25|$|He later {{accompanied}} Moses when he ascended biblical Mount Sinai to commune with God, visualize God's {{plan for}} the Israelite tabernacle and receive the Ten Commandments. Joshua was with Moses when he descended from the mountain, heard the Israelites' celebrations around the Golden Calf, and broke the tablets bearing {{the words of the}} commandments. Similarly, in the narrative which refers to Moses being able to speak with God in his tent of meeting outside the camp, Joshua is seen as custodian <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> ('tabernacle of meeting') when Moses returned to the Israelite encampment. However, when Moses returned to the mountain to re-create the tablets recording the Ten Commandments, Joshua was not present, as the biblical text states 'no man shall come up with you'.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} near the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b> And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And {{there was a man}} taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down â I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E
25|$|Kent State {{was again}} in the {{national}} spotlight in 1977 when construction was set to begin on the Memorial Gym Annex, adjacent to {{the area where the}} Kent State shootings had occurred in 1970. Protesters organized a tent city in May, which lasted into July. Several attempts were made to block construction even after the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> city, including an appeal to the United States Congress and the Department of the Interior to have the area declared a National Historic Landmark, which ended up being unsuccessful. Additional rallies were held that year, including one attended by Joan Baez on August 20. After several additional unsuccessful legal challenges, construction finally began on September 19 and was finished in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Reclamation {{originally}} planned {{to set up}} the construction headquarters in Redding, but ultimately decided to move it closer to the dam site. The new company town, Toyon, was laid out on a farm purchased from Porter Seaman in 1938. Toyon served purely to provide housing for Reclamation personnel, government offices, and storage; no stores or restaurants were permitted within its boundaries. Instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> and shacks typical of construction workers' camps, the town was characterized by comfortable multi-room wooden houses.|$|R
25|$|Beersheba grows {{from day}} to day; This year, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents,</b> we found stately houses along a {{beautiful}} road from the Sarayah to <b>the</b> bed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wadi. In the government building a garden has been laid out, {{and all sorts of}} trees have been planted which are sure to prosper, for the few shrubs planted two years ago by the steam mill at <b>the</b> south-east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road have grown considerably. The lively construction activity is also causing a lively exploitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruins.|$|R
