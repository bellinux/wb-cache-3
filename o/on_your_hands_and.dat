6000|$|... "St. Peter {{would not}} blame you, Dinah. He would know {{why there was}} blood <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> he would say, 'Come in, you have {{rendered}} to your mistresses the last and greatest services possible.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll let {{you have}} half of him, Nunkie. Down <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees, sir, and be a horse. That's it--Now, Bobby, {{straddle}} Uncle John and drive him by his necktie--here it is. S-t-e-a-d-y, Uncle; and neigh--neigh like a horse!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{old woman}} only repeated, with a ghastly look, [...] "There is blood <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> it is English blood. The {{blood of the}} Gael is richer and redder. Let us see--let us--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, in Heaven's name, {{what is the}} matter?" [...] said Nigel Olifaunt.-- [...] "Where {{have you}} been, {{or what have you}} been about? You look as pale as death. There is blood <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> clothes are torn. What barns-breaking have you been at? You have been drunk, Richard, and fighting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The cares of matrimony age a man rapidly," [...] Pollio said laughing, [...] "though doubtless {{they sit}} lightly <b>on</b> <b>your</b> huge shoulders. Why, you could let my little cousin sit <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> hold her out at arm's length. I always {{told her that}} she would need a masterful husband to keep her in order, and truly she is well suited. And now for my news, Beric. Nero is dead. The news arrived last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, dryly, [...] "I {{guess you}} could. In this country they call any trail easy {{that you can}} crawl up <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees. Still, that little grading's {{going to cost you}} about two {{thousand}} dollars a mile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the better," [...] whispered Dominick, as {{they turned}} the point of rock that hid the wreck from view. [...] "We'll go down by the thicket. Keep close to my heels, boy, and drop <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees when you see me do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{expect any}} gratitude, for you won't get it; nor much comfort {{with a lot}} of forlornities <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> be sure that when it is too late you will tire of it all and wish you had done as other people do." ...|$|E
60|$|Constable. Well, if {{you will}} pass over the fields <b>on</b> <b>your</b> left <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> behind {{that part of the}} town, I will {{endeavour}} to have gates opened for you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{would never}} do!' cried Bertha. 'You have quite enough <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> with Northmoor, <b>and</b> the luggage and the languages.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 53. Take a {{sheet of}} note-paper, and holding it edgewise, as you hold <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> wave {{it up and down}} past the side of <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> which is turned from the light, the paper being of course farther from the window. You will see, as it passes, a strong gleam of light strike <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> light it {{considerably}} on its dark side. This light is reflected light. It is thrown back from the paper (on which it strikes first in coming from the window) to the surface of <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> just as a ball would be if somebody threw it through the window at the wall and you caught it at the rebound.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{has gone}} over the hill of poison,' said she, 'and there you cannot follow him without horse-shoes <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet. But I will help you. Put on this suit of men's clothes, and go down this road till {{you come to the}} smithy, and there you can learn to make horse-shoes for yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I did!" [...] said Burke. [...] "But, of course, I wouldn't {{think of}} such a thing as going off and leaving you here with that yacht <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> no knowing what you would do with the people on board, and {{everything}} else! So I saw Shirley off about seven o'clock this morning, and then I came to report to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Smith," [...] said he, with a grave smile, [...] "if you {{cannot be}} happy {{unless you are}} laboring in the forest with your ax you must proceed with your wood-cutting; but I confess it surprises me as much to see you {{going to work on}} a day like this, as it would to see you walking {{inverted}} <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> dangling your heels in the air." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To be your husband, {{instead of}} your wife! No, Louis; {{you must learn}} to take {{yourself}} <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> lean neither <b>on</b> <b>your</b> father, nor <b>on</b> any one else on earth, before you can be fit for Mary, or--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you're {{trying to}} figure out what they are, and what they are not," [...] {{returned}} the man, [...] "you've got a hard job <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> Jane, <b>and</b> like as not you'll make a mistake in the end. Where's the other niece? Aren't there three of them?" ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} of only three concerts {{performed}} in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University's A Ball with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. He was onstage {{for nearly an hour}} but failed to complete half of the songs. He claimed that his poor performance was due to his left hand having fallen asleep and told the audience it felt [...] "like having stuff <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> you can't get it off". Smith's performance was reviewed as [...] "undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician" [...] and an [...] "excruciating [...] nightmare". A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise wrote, [...] "It would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{answered}} with an embrace, {{a look of}} rapture and of doubt, and then a negative. 'Oh, no, we cannot be a burthen on you. You have quite enough <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>And,</b> oh! you have grown so spare and thin. I mean to maintain my uncle, if--' and her spirited bearing softened into thoughtfulness, as if the little word conveyed that she meant not to be self-confident.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was never}} your friend," [...] came the retort, [...] "because I have known you always as a selfish brute; {{because you were}} married to the sweetest woman on God's earth, gave up none of your bad habits, frightened her into {{insanity}} by reeling home with another man's blood <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> then stayed away for over ten years instead of {{making an effort to}} repair the mischief you had done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'An' then yo' {{came to a}} level, {{where you}} crept <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees through a mile o' windin' drift, an' you come out into a cave-place as big as Leeds Townhall, with a engine pumpin' water from workin's 'at went deeper still. It's a queer country, let alone minin', for the hill is full of those natural caves, an' the rivers an' the becks drops into what they call pot-holes, an' come out again miles away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Turn your back, {{and hold}} your course past the isle of Albion, {{with the white}} cliffs, and so keep with the land <b>on</b> <b>your</b> left <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> the unsailed sea <b>on</b> <b>your</b> right <b>hand,</b> till you mark the pillars of Heracles <b>on</b> <b>your</b> left, then take your course west by south, and a curse on you! Give us our eye!' ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{course they}} do. We {{are now in}} the great valley which runs right across England from {{south-west}} to north-east, from Axminster in Devonshire to Hunstanton in Norfolk, with the chalk always <b>on</b> <b>your</b> right <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> the oolite hills <b>on</b> <b>your</b> left, till it ends by sinking into the sea, among the fens of Lincolnshire and Norfolk.|$|R
6000|$|Const. Well, if {{you will}} pass over the fields <b>on</b> <b>your</b> left <b>hand,</b> [...] <b>and</b> behind {{that part of the}} town, I will {{endeavor}} to have gates [...] opened for you.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, ma'am," [...] the {{sergeant}} said. [...] "Truly kind indeed; and I humbly accept your offer, except that {{so long as}} I live she shall be no expense to you. I earn more than enough for my wants, and can, at any rate, do something towards preventing her from being altogether a burden <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>And</b> now, ma'am, how would you recommend {{me to go to}} work with the vindictive old man up at the Hall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rise, my son," [...] {{said the}} old priest without looking up from his paper. [...] "Early as it is you must be {{stirring}} {{if you would be}} clear of Dunwich by daybreak and keep a whole skin. I have set a taper in my sleeping-closet yonder, and there you'll find water to wash with and a stool to kneel on for your prayers, neither of which neglect, since you have blood <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> great need for Heaven's help." ...|$|E
6000|$|To which Redwood {{answered}} that {{he proposed to}} discontinue supplying the food for the child, if he or Bensington were bothered any further about the matter. [...] "I give it for nothing as it is," [...] he said, [...] "and the child will yell your village to ruins before it dies if you don't let it have the stuff. The child's <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> {{you have to keep}} it. Lady Wondershoot can't always be Lady Bountiful and Earthly Providence of her parish without sometimes meeting a responsibility, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis farther back," [...] Mr. Caryll {{informed}} him {{in answer to}} that mute question; and as the fellow moistened his thumb {{to turn back the}} pages, Mr. Caryll saved him the trouble. [...] "It says, I think, that the man should be <b>on</b> <b>your</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the woman <b>on</b> <b>your</b> left. Ye seem to have reversed matters, Mr. Jenkins. But perhaps ye're left-handed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} wished {{that the meeting}} had been spared, that I might not have kept you from friends whom you are {{naturally}} anxious to see,--that my boy's indisposition had not detained you. Home and his good nurse Mountain, and his mother and our good Doctor Dempster, will soon restore him. 'Twas scarce necessary, Colonel, that you, who have so many affairs <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> military <b>and</b> domestic, should turn doctor too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "White maiden," [...] {{he said in}} a soft, low voice, [...] "for you, at least, I {{have good}} tidings. Though Death come near to you, though you see him <b>on</b> <b>your</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> left, and {{in front of you and}} behind you, I say, fear not. Here you, who have known deep sorrow, shall find {{happiness}} and rest, O maiden, with whom goes the spirit of one pure and fair as you, who died so long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear boy, I {{know all}} that, and more. I've {{represented}} it, {{and have been}} told that I am exhibiting [...] "culpable and puerile prejudice." [...] By Jove, if the Khusru Kheyl don't exhibit something worse than that I don't know the Border! The chances are that you will have the district alight <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I shall have to leave my work and help you pull through. I needn't ask you to stand by the Bengali man in every possible way. You'll do that for your own sake.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} to die as befits your kind," [...] said Tarzan, [...] "with blood <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> a lie on your lips." [...] He started across the room toward the burly Hauptmann. Schneider was a large and {{powerful}} man--about the height of the ape-man but much heavier. He saw that neither threats nor pleas would avail him and so he prepared to fight as a cornered rat fights for its life with all the maniacal rage, cunning, and ferocity that the first law of nature imparts to many beasts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees," [...] Hector whispered, [...] "and {{feel the}} ground as you go {{to make sure that}} there are no broken {{branches}} that would crack if you placed your knee upon them. We may come upon the Spaniards at any moment. Keep close to me. Touch me if you hear the slightest sound, and I will do the same to you. The touch will mean stop. Move your sword along the belt till the handle is round at your back; in that way there will be no risk of it striking a tree or catching in a projecting root." ...|$|E
6000|$|This evening I {{read to you}} {{the poem}} which you {{had asked me to}} [...] read. You sat before me with your brown head leaning <b>on</b> <b>your</b> [...] <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> eyes cast down. I stole dear glances at you [...] between the lines. When I {{finished}} I put a red, red rose from [...] your garden between the pages and crushed the book close on [...] it. That poem will always be dear to me, stained with the [...] life-blood of a rose-like hour.|$|R
5000|$|Jewish {{education}} has been valued since the birth of Judaism. Abraham is lauded for instructing his offspring in God's ways. One of the basic duties of Jewish parents is {{to provide for the}} instruction of their children as set forth in the first paragraph of the Shema Yisrael prayer: “Take to heart these instructions with which I charge you this day. Impress them upon your children. Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up. Bind them as sign <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> let them serve as a symbol <b>on</b> <b>your</b> forehead; inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and your gates” (Deut. 6:6-9). Additionally, children are advised to seek the instruction of their parents: [...] "Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations; ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee, thine elders, and they will tell thee" [...] (Deut. 32:7). The Book of Proverbs also contains many verses related to education: “My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your mind retain my commandments; For they will bestow on you length of days, years of life and well-being“ (Prov. 3:1-2).|$|R
6000|$|... "And if you wish, sir, {{to follow}} in his blessed steps, which I heartily hope you will do, you have only to go over that big cow-backed hill there <b>on</b> <b>your</b> right <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> down again {{the other side to}} Crawmere pool, and there you'll find as pretty a bog to die in as ever Jesuit needed; and your ghost may sit there on a grass tummock, and tell your beads without any one asking for you till the day of judgment; and much good may it do you!" ...|$|R
