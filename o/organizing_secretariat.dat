He was relying on logistical support from US Ambassador Arthur Watson, but quickly discovered in Watson’s absence that most European (especially French) business leaders are rarely {{in their offices}} in August.Other, more demanding complications began to set in on issues surrounding venue selection, agenda, <b>organizing</b> <b>secretariat</b> for the European side, finances, and the selection process for European participation. By September 15, Davis {{had been forced to}} broaden the agenda (to include trade and European Union enlargement) following the August 15 devaluation of the Dollar by the Nixon Administration. Tensions ran high at the next Steering Committee meeting at General Motors offices above Manhattan (September 15). There was even suggestion that the entire effort be scuttled.|$|E

In November 2011, she ran again in the first post-revolution parliamentary elections, running for an individual seat in the downtown Qasr el Nil district, independent of any party or political current, and won almost 30,000 votes, coming in just 100 votes less than the Freedom and Justice Party and Egyptian Bloc candidates. She claims she received nearly 30,000 votes, coming in less than 100 votes behind the candidates for the Freedom and Justice Party, and those of Egyptian Bloc. In the Spring of 2012, she participated in the founding of the Constitution Party(AlDostour Party), founded and led by Dr. Mohamed ElBaradai. [...] She has been a member of the committee of one hundred, leading member in the steering committee, and head of the party’s <b>organizing</b> <b>secretariat</b> in April 2013. In March 2013, she directed a message to John Kerry during a meeting with him in Cairo, and which was picked up by the media, requesting him to stop supporting former president Mohamed Morsi, saying, “You want democracy for us in a shape and size defined by the American administration, but we Egyptian people are building democracy on the imagination and dreams of the January 25Revolution, and we will show you that we are capable of revolution again.” In May 2013, she participated in the call for June 30, and led party marches to the Presidential Palace. In December 2013, she called for participation in a non-partisan campaign called “Hakkem A'aqlak”(Use your judgment) for citizen awareness-raising on the articles in the constitution, a campaign which was carried out in various Egyptian governorates. In January 2014, she was nominated for the position of Dostour Party president, to succeed Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, heading the list [...] "Elbaquaa' le mann yabny" [...] (Those who build persevere) After a mission building the party, she held an active leadership role from April to December 2013. From 2011 - 2014, she has played a prominent role in the struggle to complete the revolution in Egypt, defending its aims and goals through her political action, support and contribution in a number of revolutionary protest movements, a role which continues to date.|$|E

500|$|The Arcadia Conference, {{which was}} held in Washington, D.C., December 1941 and January 1942, {{mandated}} {{the creation of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff as a counterpart to the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, and Smith was named as its secretary on 23 January 1942. The same conference also brought about the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, which consisted of the (American) Joint Chiefs of Staff and the (British) Chiefs of Staff Committee meeting as a single body. Brigadier Vivian Dykes of the British Joint Staff Mission provided the secretarial arrangements for the new organization at first, but General Marshall thought that an American secretariat was required. He appointed Smith as the secretary of the Combined Chiefs of Staff {{as well as of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff. Since Dykes was senior in service time to Smith, and Marshall wanted Smith to be in charge, Smith was promoted to brigadier general on 2 February 1942. He assumed the new post a week later, with Dykes as his deputy. The two men worked in partnership to create and <b>organize</b> the <b>secretariat,</b> and to build the organization of the [...] Combined Chiefs-of-Staff into one that could coordinate the war efforts of the two allies, along with the Canadians, Australians, French and others. Smith's duties involved taking part in discussions of strategy at the highest level, and he often briefed President Roosevelt on strategic matters. However Smith became frustrated as he watched other officers receive operational commands that he desired. He later remarked: [...] "That year I spent working as secretary of the general staff for George Marshall was one of the most rewarding of my entire career, and the unhappiest year of my life." ...|$|R
40|$|Global {{governance}} {{is neither}} democratic nor entirely undemocratic. For example, within the World Trade Organization (WTO) formally all member-states have equal power over decision making. The WTO’s dispute settlement body (DSB) acts {{to enforce the}} rule of law over so-called power politics. The WTO’s <b>secretariat</b> <b>organizes</b> regular meetings with civil society groups, and resources are spent on facilitating transparency, including putting a vast amount of official documentation online. However, there is large power asymmetry between WTO member-states. This article sidesteps the classic response to such dilemmas, in which debate hinges on how much or how little the institution is able to ameliorate realpolitik, and considers the role the vestiges of “democracy” play in the WTO. Drawing on the work of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, among others, the author argues that the discourse of democracy embodied in the WTO expresses the wider process through which the institution is legitimated as the body of global trade politics. This has implications for understanding not only how global governance is discursively formed but also whether civil society groups critiquing the WTO threaten the WTO or, by accepting the premise of its predominance in global trade politics, effectively strengthen it...|$|R
40|$|The International Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was {{launched}} in 2012. Its objective is to strengthen the science-policy interface for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being, and sustainable development. Nonstate Actors (NSAs) participated in {{the inception of the}} platform and are also assumed to {{play a key role in}} its coming assessments and reports. In order to encourage NSAs to participate and self-organize, an institutional process has been led by the Secretariat in collaboration with two main organizations: Diversitas-International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We look at the construction of this stakeholder participation process and its effectiveness. To what degree is the stakeholder engagement effective and what are the different forms of involvement? What methods are used by the IPBES's Secretariat and its mandated organizations to encourage stakeholder participation in the Platform? A social network analysis survey revealed four categories of actors in the group of stakeholders: organizers, connected, closely-knit, and peripheral. The ethnographic approach analyzed the way in which the IPBES <b>secretariat</b> <b>organized</b> the stakeholders' days, managed them, and controlled them. Thanks to these two methods, we analyzed the relational structure of the group of stakeholders and their contours of involvement and showed that these two dimensions can combine in a different way. The idea of a group of stakeholders, promoted by IPBES, is accompanied by a leadership/participation model that tends to enroll the stakeholders involved but may conversely marginalize some dissenting voices.

50|$|The {{agency is}} {{organized}} into seven police regions, {{based on the}} geographical boundaries of several counties, where each region has an overall responsibility for the police work in their geographical area. The work is organized under a regional secretariat, operations unit, an investigations unit and intelligence unit—all led by a Regional Police Chief. Police regions generally investigate crime without a strong local connection and less common crimes, requiring specialized knowledge {{or the use of}} special surveillance methods or technologies not typically available at lower levels in the agency. Police regions encompass approximately 1,900 employees in the Bergslagen Region, with around 830,000 inhabitants, up to 7,400 employees in the Stockholm Region, with a population of 2.18 million. There are also 27 police districts—organized under the regions—tasked with leading, coordinating, monitoring and analysing the operational activities in their geographical area, which is typically based on the boundaries of a county. The work is <b>organized</b> under a <b>secretariat,</b> an investigations unit and intelligence unit, plus a unit for the local police areas—all led by a District Police Chief, who in turn answer to a Regional Police Chief. The districts are responsible for, inter alia, serious crime or more complex criminal investigations (e.g. murder) and other cases where it may be inappropriate for the local police to handle investigations, for example sex crimes or cases involving domestic violence. At the bottom of the organizational ladder there are 85-90 local police areas, forming the bulk of the police. Local police areas are based on the boundaries of one or more municipalities, {{or in the case of}} larger metropolitan areas, several boroughs. The local police is responsible for the majority of all police interventions, general crime prevention, the traffic police, as well as basic criminal investigation duties. There are between 50-180 employees in a typical local police area, or at least one local police officer per 5,000 inhabitants in disadvantaged areas. In 2014, a government report expected that the local police would account for about 50 per cent of all police interventions, post-reorganization.|$|R

40|$|This {{report on}} the state of the world 2 ̆ 7 s {{indigenous}} peoples reveals alarming statistics on poverty, health, education, employment, human rights, the environment and more. Indigenous peoples contribute extensively to humanity 2 ̆ 7 s cultural diversity, enriching it with more than two thirds of its languages and an extrordinary amount of its traditional knowledge. There are over 370 million indigenous people in some 90 countries, living in all regions of the world. The situation of indigenous peoples in many parts of the world is critical today. Poverty rates are significantly higher among indigenous peoples compared to other groups. While they constitute 5 per cent of the world 2 ̆ 7 s population, they are 15 per cent of the world 2 ̆ 7 s poor. Most indicators of well-being show that indigenous peoples suffer disproportinately compared to non-indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples face systemic discrimination and exclusion from political and economic power; they continue to be over-represented among the poorest, the illiterate, the destitute; they are displaced by wars and environmental disasters; indigenous peoples are dispossessed of their ancestral lands and deprived of their resources for survival, both physical and cultural; they are even robbed of their very right to life. In more modern versions of market exploitation, indigenous peoples see their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions marketed and patented without their consent or participation. Of the some 7, 000 languages today, it is estimated that more than 4, 000 are spoken by indigenous peoples. Language specialists predict that up to 90 per cent of the world’s languages are likely to become extinct or threatened with extinction by the end of the century. Although the state of the world 2 ̆ 7 s indigenous peoples is alarming, there is some cause for optimism. The international community increasingly recognizes indigenous peoples 2 ̆ 7 human rights, most prominently evidenced by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous peoples themselves continue to organize for the promotion of their rights. They are the stewards of some of the world 2 ̆ 7 s most biologically diverse areas and their traditional knowledge about the biodibversity of these areas is invaluable. As the effects of climate change are becoming clearer, it is increaslingly evident that indigenous peoples must play a central role in developing adaptation and mitigation efforts to this global challenge. The State of the World 2 ̆ 7 s Indigenous Peoples is the result of a collaborative effort, <b>organized</b> by the <b>Secretariat</b> of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.
