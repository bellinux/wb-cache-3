5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of jerseys.

In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E
