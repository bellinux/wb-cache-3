Paulus keeps a small statue of a lion <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> in her downtown Portland home {{that was given to}} her in October 1981 by the northeast Portland Lions Club when she was inducted as their first female member. The next day, Paulus was visited in her office at the Oregon Capitol {{by the president of the}} statewide Oregon Lions Club. He had come to ask Paulus to return the Portland club's gift. He did not think the statue – or membership into the club – should have been given to a woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E

25|$|Test {{anxiety is}} the uneasiness, apprehension, or {{nervousness}} felt by {{students who have}} a fear of failing an exam. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of grades with personal worth; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of alienation from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation, debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder {{or whether it is}} a specific type of social phobia. The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Dance for You" [...] was co-directed by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson. It was filmed in a vintage New York City-styled office before Beyoncé's baby bump started showing. Two previews {{of the video}} were posted online on November 21, 2011. In the first preview, Beyoncé wears pants, garters and a wrap dress as she performs a sexy dance routine <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> while a man watches her dance. In the second preview, she wears the same outfit and dances seductively {{in front of a}} chair in an office as the camera cuts to the man, who is watching her. Beyoncé pays homage to German-American actress and singer Marlene Dietrich in the video as she [...] channels a 1920s-inspired look and stars as a screen siren.

500|$|By design, it is {{difficult}} to insert a USB plug into its receptacle incorrectly. The USB specification states that the required USB icon must be embossed on the [...] "topside" [...] of the USB plug, which [...] "...provides easy user recognition and facilitates alignment during the mating process." [...] The specification also shows that the [...] "recommended" [...] "Manufacturer's logo" [...] ("engraved" [...] on the diagram but not specified in the text) is {{on the opposite side of}} the USB icon. The specification further states, [...] "The USB Icon is also located adjacent to each receptacle. Receptacles should be oriented to allow the icon on the plug to be visible during the mating process." [...] However, the specification does not consider the height of the device compared to the eye level height of the user, so the side of the cable that is [...] "visible" [...] when mated to a computer <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> can depend on whether the user is standing or kneeling.|$|E

2500|$|A nearly un-translatable term, Heidegger's {{equipment}} can {{be thought}} of as a collective noun, so that it is never appropriate to call something 'an equipment'. Instead, its use often reflects it to mean a tool, or as an [...] "in-order-to" [...] for Dasein. Tools, in this collective sense, and in being ready-to-hand, always exist in a network of other tools and organizations, e.g., the paper is <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> in a room at a university. It is inappropriate usually to see such equipment on its own or as something present-at-hand.|$|E

2500|$|The {{anonymous}} {{warning was}} taken seriously by the US government, and the State Department cabled the bulletin {{to dozens of}} embassies.

2500|$|Sheila {{returns to}} L.A. {{four years later}} to find her now-teenage {{daughter}} Mary (whom she had renamed Erica Lovejoy) (Courtnee Draper). Erica, who is completely unaware of her mother's past or her own real name, has traveled to L.A. to meet her idol - Amber Forrester. She soon develops a crush on Amber's husband, Rick Forrester, although she never intends to act on her feelings. Sheila convinces Erica to seduce Rick, saying that a Forrester man would never abandon the woman carrying his child. She then pays off a man named Lance to drug Amber and take her to bed. [...] Amber tracks Lance down and begins to question him. When a nervous Lance threatens to tell Amber everything, Sheila kills him by releasing a tank of bees into his apartment. [...] Amber becomes increasingly suspicious and confronts Erica in Rick's office. During a struggle, Erica falls and hits her head <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk,</b> making Amber look guilty of pushing her. [...] At the hospital, a disguised Sheila confronts Amber, warning her {{to stay away from}} her daughter. [...] Amber decides to look for clues at Erica's apartment, but is impeded when Sheila throws a pot at the window and the police arrive, arresting Amber and causing the Forresters to distrust her further. [...] Meanwhile, while browsing through a photo album of Eric's, Erica is startled to find a picture of her mother. [...] She learns that Sheila was formerly married to Eric, and that her mother wants her to live the life she had always dreamed of with Rick. [...] Sheila pushes Erica to have sex with Rick, so that she can live vicariously as a Forrester through her daughter.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{shots of the}} library and a book called [...] "The Story of Us". Swift narrates the story while {{standing}} between two bookshelves, sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> and lying across a table (and occasionally lying on top of [...] "The Story of Us") {{with a stack of}} books next to her, as we see scenes flashing back and forth between her and her ex-boyfriend, students in the library, some library staff, and her band playing the song. The scenes between her and her ex start with a private meeting between the two in the library, scenes where she is finding a place by herself without him in the library, to the awkward scene of finding him across the room from her. Swift hides behind a book she's holding when she notices her ex, then looks away pulling on her clothes and plays with her hair, in the attempt of not making him notice her. She doesn't notice that he noticed her too, later in the video, and was trying to avoid her too. They both eventually catch each other looking and they awkwardly try to give each other a silent and distant [...] "Hi" [...] as the video cuts to a scene where we see a girl who first pulls Swift's ex into a make out, then pulls away as the librarian passes by. When the librarian passes, Swift's ex pulls the girl back and kisses her again. This cheating caused the fall out between Swift and the guy. Swift eventually gives the first [...] "Hi" [...] which he returns and both get up to confront the other. The video ends with a break out of the other classmates and staff joining in, the classmates throwing away their papers and they and the staff begin dancing to the song while both Swift and her ex are face to face with each other in a very awkward moment, both trying to say how the other feels, but eventually they both shrug at each other and walk away. The last shot is of Swift closing the book of [...] "The Story of Us".|$|E
