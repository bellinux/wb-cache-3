2500|$|The Court {{also found}} that the death penalty [...] "comports with the basic concept of human dignity {{at the core of the}} [...] Amendment". The death penalty serves two {{principal}} social purposes—retribution and deterrence. [...] "In part, capital punishment is an expression of society's moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct". But this outrage must be expressed in an <b>ordered</b> <b>fashion,</b> for America is a society of laws. Retribution is consistent with human dignity, because society believes that [...] "certain crimes are themselves so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death". And although it is difficult to determine statistically how much crime the death penalty actually deters, the Court found that in 1976 there was [...] "no convincing empirical evidence" [...] supporting either the view that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to crime or the opposite view. Still, the Court could not completely discount the possibility that for certain [...] "carefully contemplated murderers", [...] "the possible penalty of death may well enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act".|$|E

40|$|We use nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR), high-resolution x-ray and neutron scattering to study structural and magnetic phase transitions in phosphorus-doped BaFe_ 2 (As_ 1 -xP_x) _ 2.

However, we show that the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural (T_s) and paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic (AF, T_N) transitions in BaFe_ 2 (As_ 1 -xP_x) _ 2 are always coupled and approach to T_N≈ T_s > T_c (≈ 29 K) for x= 0. 29 before vanishing abruptly for x> 0. 3.

40|$|A {{conservative}} discretization of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations {{is developed}} based on discrete exterior calculus (DEC). A distinguishing feature of our method {{is the use}} of an algebraic discretization of the interior product operator and a combinatorial discretization of the wedge product. The governing equations are first rewritten using the exterior calculus notation, replacing vector calculus differential operators by the exterior derivative, Hodge star and wedge product operators. The discretization is then carried out by substituting with the corresponding discrete operators based on the DEC framework. Numerical experiments for flows over surfaces reveal a second order accuracy for the developed scheme when using structured-triangular meshes, and first order accuracy for otherwise unstructured meshes. By construction, the method is conservative in that both mass and vorticity are conserved up to machine precision. The relative error in kinetic energy for inviscid flow test cases converges in a second <b>order</b> <b>fashion</b> with both the mesh size and the time step. Comment: 35 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{apparatus}} comprises {{an optical}} microscope, a light source and some fluorescent probe. Fluorescent emission is contingent upon absorption {{of a specific}} optical wavelength or color which restricts the choice of lamps. Most commonly, a broad spectrum mercury or xenon source is {{used in conjunction with}} a color filter. The technique begins by saving a background image of the sample before photobleaching. Next, the light source is focused onto a small patch of the viewable area either by switching to a higher magnification microscope objective or with laser light of the appropriate wavelength. The fluorophores in this region receive high intensity illumination which causes their fluorescence lifetime to quickly elapse (limited to roughly 105 photons before extinction). Now the image in the microscope is that of a uniformly fluorescent field with a noticeable dark spot. As Brownian motion proceeds, the still-fluorescing probes will diffuse throughout the sample and replace the non-fluorescent probes in the bleached region. This diffusion proceeds in an <b>ordered</b> <b>fashion,</b> analytically determinable from the diffusion equation.

The mug has two folding metal handles which give the user a cool place to hold it while drinking a warm beverage. The third utility pouch contains a minor first aid kit, for minor cuts and scrapes, but not the first field dressing. This pouch may also contain various other items such as a pair of binoculars, a red light torch, a utility knife, or a compass. Other pouches can be attached which allow for more storage capabilities. For example the Bowman radio pouch for the PRC 349 or the PRR pouch for the personal role radio.

He doesn't even really play billiards; [...] "for some time now he had given up playing according to the rules, trying for runs, racking up points," [...] (p. 31).

[...] "Energy of the blow imparted to the ball by cue, plus a little friction, question of degree…and behold, impulse was converted into momentary figures," [...] (p. 31) as the balls bounce off of each other.
