5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} <b>Oslo</b> <b>agreement,</b> Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|The Hebron Jewish {{community}} has been subject to attacks by Palestinian militants since the <b>Oslo</b> <b>agreement,</b> especially during the periods of the Intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in {{between the first and}} second Intifada (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shooting (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada. and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighbourhoods. According to Human Rights Watch in 2001, Palestinian areas of Hebron were frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to civilian casualties.|$|E
25|$|The {{demands of}} these populations were {{somewhat}} differing {{from those of}} the Palestinian diaspora, which had constituted the main base of the PLO until then, in that they were primarily interested in independence, rather than refugee return. The resulting 1993 <b>Oslo</b> <b>Agreement</b> cemented the belief in a two-state solution in the mainstream Palestinian movement, as opposed to the PLO's original goal, a one-state solution which entailed the destruction of Israel and its replacement with a secular, democratic Palestinian state. The idea had first been seriously discussed in the 1970s, and gradually become the unofficial negotiating stance of the PLO leadership under Arafat, but it had still remained a taboo subject for most, until Arafat officially recognized Israel in 1988, under strong pressure from the United States. However, the belief in the ultimate necessity of Israel's destruction and/or its Zionist foundation (i.e. its existence as specifically Jewish state) is still advocated by many, such as the religiously motivated Hamas movement, although no longer by the PLO leadership.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Oslo</b> II <b>agreement</b> {{was signed}} in 1995 and {{detailed}} {{the division of the}} West Bank into Areas A, B, and C. Area A was land under full Palestinian civilian control.

25|$|Hebron was the {{one city}} {{excluded}} from the interim agreement of September 1995 to restore rule over all Palestinian West Bank cities to the Palestinian Authority. Since The <b>Oslo</b> <b>Agreement,</b> violent episodes have been recurrent in the city. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre took place on February 25, 1994 when Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli physician and resident of Kiryat Arba, opened fire on Muslims at prayer in the Ibrahimi Mosque, killing 29, and wounding 125 before the survivors overcame and killed him. Standing orders for Israeli soldiers on duty in Hebron disallowed them from firing on fellow Jews, {{even if they were}} shooting Arabs. This event was condemned by the Israeli Government, and the extreme right-wing Kach party was banned as a result. The Israeli government also tightened restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in H2, closed their vegetable and meat markets, and banned Palestinian cars on Al-Shuhada Street. The park near the Cave of the Patriarchs for recreation and barbecues is off-limits for Arab Hebronites.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{security}} sector assistance began publicly at {{the conclusion}} of the Oslo Accords, through aid to the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) for the Palestinian Police under the authority of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. While Arafat requested international donor assistance for his police force in early 1993, substantial coordination did not occur before the deployment of the Palestinian Police to Gaza and Jericho in 1994. According to Norwegian scholar Brynjar Lia, in his book Building Arafat's Police: The Politics of International Police Assistance in the Palestinian Territories after the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Agreement,</b> the international community, especially the European Union (EU) and the United States, was at odds regarding the appropriate means by which to facilitate donor aid to the newly established Palestinian Authority. Additionally, though concerns about inadequate police equipment, training, and resources were paramount to the PLO and Arafat, international actors did not emphasize this component of their overall efforts to support the Oslo agreements. Lia argues that this was predominantly because many donor countries already had covert bilateral security sector assistance programs unrelated to the new international donation structures, and also because the PLO did not successfully convey their requests to Western donors who lacked confidence that the PLO would coordinate security aid to donor satisfaction.|$|E

The convention was based on the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Agreements</b> of 1930 and aimed in addition at the reduction of trade tariffs.|$|R
2500|$|After the {{announcement}} of the Oslo Accords there were many protest demonstrations in Israel objecting to the Accords. As these protests dragged on, Rabin insisted that as long as he had a majority in the Knesset he would ignore the protests and the protesters. In this context he said, [...] "they (the protesters) can spin around and around like propellers" [...] but he would continue on the path of the Oslo Accords. Rabin's parliamentary majority rested on non-coalition member Arab support. Rabin also denied the right of American Jews to object to his plan for peace, calling any such dissent [...] "chutzpah." [...] The <b>Oslo</b> <b>agreement</b> was also opposed by Hamas and other Palestinian factions, which launched suicide bombings at Israel.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1995 <b>Oslo</b> <b>Agreement</b> and {{subsequent}} 1997 Hebron Agreement, Palestinian cities were {{placed under the}} exclusive jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, {{with the exception of}} Hebron, which was split into two sectors: H1 is controlled by the Palestinian Authority and H2 controlled by Israel. [...] Around 120,000 Palestinians live in H1, while around 30,000 Palestinians along with around 700 Israelis remain under Israeli military control in H2. , a total of 86 Jewish families lived in Hebron. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) may not enter H1 unless under Palestinian escort. Palestinians cannot approach areas where settlers live without special permits from the IDF. The Jewish settlement is widely considered to be illegal by the international community, [...] although the Israeli government disputes this.|$|E
2500|$|Peled did {{approach}} his old comrade in arms Yitzhak Rabin, then on {{his first}} term as Prime Minister of Israel (1974–77). He offered to brief Rabin on his talks with the Palestinians, and Rabin consented. On several occasions, indeed, Sartawi and other Palestinian interlocutors used this channel to pass on specific messages intended for Rabin's ears. The PM patiently heard him out, but never consented {{to send a message}} in return. [...] "That would be negotiating with the PLO, and I will never never do that" [...] he told Peled—ironic words in retrospect, as Rabin was later to conduct intensive talks with the PLO and sign the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Agreement</b> with Arafat. Peled always believed that Oslo was at least in part a late flowering of the seeds he and his friends had sown in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Oslo</b> <b>agreements</b> {{resulted}} in {{the dismantling of the}} Israeli office responsible for censorship of textbooks.

The sculptures were donated by Israeli Arab and Jewish artists, and Palestinian artists.|$|R
2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} have made many different responses ranging from positive, to neutral, to negative. When the plan {{came out in}} 2002, the Israeli government rejected the initiative, {{on the grounds that}} it would result in the return of a large number of Palestinians into Israel. Israel expressed reservations on [...] "red line" [...] issues on which it stated that it would not compromise. The 1948 Palestinian exodus, Israel's homeland security against terror attacks, and the nature of Jerusalem are the three most prominent such issues. Israel has stated that the return of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants would turn Israel into an Arab state. Israel has also had concerns about compromise on Jerusalem due to the city's historical and religious significance to Jews, especially since East Jerusalem contains the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism, and that a unified Jerusalem has been Israel's proclaimed capital since the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980. It is also concerned about the possible danger of making a complete withdrawal to the borders of 1967, which would possibly render Israel more vulnerable to attacks. The allegedly non-negotiable nature of the initiative's provisions, which must be accepted first before any further dialogue can take place, forms a stumbling block for the Israeli government, Israel had asked for amendments after the 2002 summit. The Passover Massacre overshadowed the initial 2002 initiative, and it initially derailed further progress on it. <b>Oslo</b> <b>Agreement</b> negotiator Joel Singer commented shortly after the Beirut Summit that [...] "the major problem with it is that it only called upon Israel to do a series of things and there was no call upon the Palestinians to stop terrorism." ...|$|E
