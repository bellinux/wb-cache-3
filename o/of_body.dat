5|$|Body piercing, a form <b>of</b> <b>body</b> modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice <b>of</b> <b>body</b> piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. Although the history <b>of</b> <b>body</b> piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E

40|$|My {{paper is}} about the theorizing <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> in archaeology. Bodies are an {{important}} archaeological resource—from mortuary remains to figurative art, they reveal {{a great deal to}} us about people in past societies. In gender archaeology the visibility <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> as archaeological evidence has lead to questions being asked of the very formulation of gender as a concept, of how gender is understood to operate through bodies and in society. The point I will argue {{in the course of this}} paper is that the sex/gender split naturalizes a binary division <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> and hence naturalizes the exclusive division <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> into male and female. Such a binary division may be a pertinent description of current ideals of the structure <b>of</b> <b>bodies.</b> Its establishment as a natural fact, however, is impeding the investigation <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> in prehistory, preventing the questioning <b>of</b> how <b>bodies</b> gain significance, how bodies become sexed...|$|R

40|$|Since John Locke {{repeatedly}} {{insists that}} his theory <b>of</b> <b>bodies,</b> endorsed in the Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690), is a genuinely philosophical assessment <b>of</b> <b>bodies,</b> the topic <b>of</b> his account {{adds up to}} a philosophical reflection on the so-called scientific revolution in the seventeenth century. In this work, I will develop a line of interpretation that undertakes to settle the issue what the genuinely philosophical issue of Locke’s analysis <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> consists in. This leads to a thorough re-examination of Locke’s account, since the differences to other interpretations concern most prominent issues on bodies and, correspondingly, many of their crucial concepts: the substratum <b>of</b> <b>bodies,</b> primary and secondary qualities, resemblance, the role of corpuscularian theory, archetypes, real and nominal essences, the argument on species and classification, the significance of the analysis of language, the concept of knowledge, the ideal of scientific understanding, and the account of the scope of contemporary knowledge. As will be argued, Locke consciously assesses contemporary knowledge in the perspective of an ideal scientific grasp <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> and thus unfolds a philosophical framework for natural science which: (1) specifies what a science <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> ideally consists in, (2) assesses contemporary knowledge in this perspective, (3) advances an own conception of a contemporary science <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> that proposes means to enhance contemporary knowledge, and (4) refutes alternative ideas of a science <b>of</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Chronophotograpic {{studies of}} animals in motion, created by {{scientist}} Étienne-Jules Marey beginning in the 1880s, led to the introduction in painting of techniques to show motion, such as blurring, multiplication, and superimposition <b>of</b> <b>body</b> parts—perhaps {{in an effort to}} imitate these mechanical images. Such multiplication can be see in Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, painted the same year as Balla's painting.|$|E
