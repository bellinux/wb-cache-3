5|$|Acetic acid {{is often}} used as a solvent for {{reactions}} involving carbocations, such as Friedel-Crafts alkylation. For example, <b>one</b> <b>stage</b> in the commercial manufacture of synthetic camphor involves a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of camphene to isobornyl acetate; here acetic acid acts both as a solvent and as a nucleophile to trap the rearranged carbocation.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in <b>one</b> <b>stage,</b> following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, the globes were sent to Beaconsfield and stored with part of the Wallace Collection at Hall Barn {{in the care of}} Lady Burnham. They were brought back to London in 1945 and were at <b>one</b> <b>stage</b> kept in the King's Library on loan to the British Museum. The globes were {{installed}} in their present position in the Middle Temple Library when the current library building opened in 1958. In 2003, they were loaned to the National Maritime Museum for an exhibition commemorating the life of Elizabeth I.|$|E

5|$|First {{described}} in 1927 by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner, the species was at <b>one</b> <b>stage</b> considered {{a variety of}} B.sphaerocarpa. Although there are no recognised subspecies or varieties, both lignotuberous and nonlignotuberous forms exist for Banksia violacea. Wasps, ants and flies have been recorded visiting flower spikes. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Regarded as of little value to floriculture, it is rarely cultivated.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the programme became a joint development between Russia and Ukraine. The former compounded the issue of a reduced market with its intermittent commitment to the project. Repeated attempts to start production have been unsuccessful. Western European countries, including Germany, at <b>one</b> <b>stage</b> assessed the aircraft for procurement but later decided against it.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At <b>one</b> <b>stage,</b> Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E

Against Parramatta, who had finished eighth in the home-and-away season but had won ten of its last eleven matches, the Storm led at <b>one</b> <b>stage</b> by 16 points, before finishing 23–16 winners. Slater won the Clive Churchill Medal, and they were named as the NRL Team of the Decade for the 2000s.|$|E

One notable species is Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense var. sandwicense), a highly endangered endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea's high elevation cinder deserts. At <b>one</b> <b>stage</b> {{reduced to a}} population of just 50 plants, Mauna Kea silversword {{was thought to be}} restricted to the alpine zone, but in fact has been driven there by pressure from livestock, and can grow at lower elevations as well.|$|E

5|$|The initial Tour de France of 1903 {{had been}} a large success, and it was quickly decided to {{organize}} it again in 1904. The route was identical, with the same six stages. The rules {{were the same as}} in 1903, with one exception: cyclists could not enter in just <b>one</b> <b>stage,</b> but had to join for the entire race. The favourites for the victory were Garin, Pothier and Aucouturier, who had performed well in the 1903 Tour de France. Among the competitors was Henri Paret who, at 50 years old, still holds the record of oldest Tour de France cyclist.|$|E

5|$|Ticks satisfy all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements as ectoparasites, feeding on a diet of blood. They are obligate hematophages, needing blood to survive and move from <b>one</b> <b>stage</b> of life to another. Ticks can fast for long periods but eventually die if {{unable to find a}} host. This behavior evolved approximately 120 million years ago through adaptation to blood-feeding. The behavior evolved independently in the separate tick families, with differing host-tick interactions driving the evolutionary change.|$|E
5|$|True {{to their}} {{longtime}} {{identity as a}} stage racing team, all of Astana's 2011 victories came in stage races.

They also took stage wins at seven other races.|$|E
5|$|Arsène Wenger was {{the first}} non–British manager to receive the Manager of the Season award, having led Arsenal {{to the top of}} the Premier League in 1997–98, his first full season at the club. This {{achievement}} was significant given that Arsenal were, at <b>one</b> <b>stage,</b> 12 points behind leaders Manchester United. After a climactic finish to the 1998–99 season, Ferguson was presented with his fifth managerial award for winning the Premier League with Manchester United. The club beat Tottenham Hotspur on the last matchday to secure their fifth championship in seven years, and in the following week completed a treble of trophies consisting of the domestic league, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. Ferguson received the accolade again in 1999–2000, as Manchester United finished 18 points above second-placed Arsenal.|$|E
25|$|From 2015 the J.League system {{changed to}} a three-stage system. The year is split into first and second league stages, {{followed}} by a third and final championship stage.

These additional four teams consist of the following: <b>Stage</b> <b>one</b> and <b>stage</b> two's top point accumulator, and <b>stage</b> <b>one</b> and two's second placed points accumulator.
