5|$|The {{possible}} {{reasons for the}} clipping <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> are controversial. Possible explanations include fraud, a deliberate attempt to maintain a stable ratio between gold and silver coins, or an official attempt to provide {{a new source of}} silver bullion while maintaining the same number <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> in circulation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{archaeology}} {{shows that}} the myth reflects an actual custom, the placement <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> with the dead was neither pervasive nor confined to a single coin in the deceased's mouth. In many burials, inscribed metal-leaf tablets or Exonumia {{take the place of}} the coin, or gold-foil crosses during the early Christian period. The presence <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> or a coin-hoard in Germanic ship-burials suggests an analogous concept.|$|E
5|$|The kings also issued {{many types}} <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> for circulation. Several types <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> {{categorized}} as Sethu Bull coins issued from 1284 to 1410 {{are found in}} large quantities {{in the northern part}} of Sri Lanka.

5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the coins (e.g. {{providing}} kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 percent of the city of Aksum remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> produced and the style <b>of</b> <b>coins,</b> archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|There is an {{explicit}} formula for the Frobenius number {{when there are}} only two different coin denominations, x and y: xy [...] x [...] y. If the number <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> denominations is three or more, no explicit formula is known; but, for any fixed number <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> denominations, there is an algorithm computing the Frobenius number in polynomial time (in the logarithms <b>of</b> the <b>coin</b> denominations forming an input). No known algorithm is polynomial time in the number <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> denominations, and the general problem, where the number <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> denominations may be as large as desired, is NP-hard.|$|R

5|$|A {{persistent}} {{shortage of}} coinage {{in all of}} the colonies prompted Massachusetts to establish a mint on May 27, 1652, and begin production <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> from its silver reserves. This act solved a practical problem, but the colony had no authority to do so from the crown. Although this did not become an issue while Endecott was governor, it eventually became a source of controversy with the crown, and the mint had apparently ceased operations around 1682.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category <b>of</b> <b>coins,</b> however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E

Additionally, players can converse with up to four phrases that are preset by the player, which appear as speech bubbles when activated.

5|$|Examples of {{clothing}} in Parthian inspired sculptures {{have been found}} in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt (qamis), combined with trousers and made with fine, ornamented materials. The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court. The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images <b>of</b> <b>coins.</b> The Parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in Palmyra, Syria, along with the use of Parthian frontality in art.|$|E

5|$|In 1847, King Kamehameha III {{issued a}} one-cent coin, most likely {{struck by a}} firm in New England. It was unpopular with merchants, who {{preferred}} not {{to deal with such}} small amounts. Some were issued in change in government transactions, but only about 12,000 ever circulated.

5|$|In {{their book}} The Fantastic 1804 Dollar, numismatic historians Eric P. Newman and Kenneth E. Bressett assert {{that a problem}} arose at the Mint {{as to how to}} {{interpret}} Forsyth's order. As his initial correspondence indicated that the sets were to include coins of every type then in use, Mint officials included both the silver dollar and gold eagle. The moratorium on silver dollar coinage had been lifted in 1831, but none had been coined since those issued in March 1804. Two sets <b>of</b> <b>coins,</b> minted in proof finish, were completed and delivered along with their boxes to Roberts shortly prior to his departure on the USS Peacock on April 27, 1835. The dollars included the sets bore the Draped Bust design, depicting an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse and a heraldic eagle on the reverse. A list of diplomatic gifts was also proposed for missions to Japan and Cochin-China (today part of Vietnam), which included two additional sets <b>of</b> <b>coins.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nerva was succeeded without {{incident}} by his adopted son Trajan, who {{was greeted by}} the Roman populace with much enthusiasm.

According to Cassius Dio, however, the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against Nerva, Casperius Aelianus, was 'dismissed' upon Trajan's accession.|$|E
