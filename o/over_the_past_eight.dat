500|$|The Stanley {{plan had}} two main aspects, the {{governor}} stated. [...] The {{first was the}} funds withholding provision.

(For example, if an elementary school in a district integrated, the legislation would require funds to be cut off to all elementary schools in that district—but not to secondary schools.) He also noted that this portion of his legislative program would expire on June 30, 1958. Stanley said the second major provision of his program was the tuition grant plan, offered to parents in districts where schools closed. (Unpublicized by the governor was a provision in his tuition grant plan that would require school districts which lost state funds to provide tuition grants.)

In June 2008, Obama {{voted in favor}} of a budget that would raise the taxes on unmarried individuals with a taxable income of over $32,000 by pushing their tax bracket from 25% to 28%. Obama has proposed a tax plan which includes tax credits to lower the amount of taxes paid. It is argued that the typical middle-class family would receive over $1,000 in tax relief, with tax payments that are 20% lower than they faced under President Ronald Reagan. According to the Tax Policy Center, the Obama plan provides three times as much tax relief for {{middle-class families}} as the McCain plan. Obama's plan includes a temporary [...] "Making Work Pay" [...] program, which gives a tax credit at 6.2% of earned income up to $400 for single workers (making less than $75,000/yr), and an $800 for married couples (making less than $150,000/yr), expiring at the end of 2010; this is claimed on Schedule M of Form 1040. Families making more than $250,000 would pay either the same or lower income tax rates than they paid in the 1990s, leaving no family to pay higher income tax rates than they would have paid in the 1990s.

It turns out that to maintain food security in the near and medium-term future a substantially larger increase in production will be required than continuation of the present trend.

40|$|Glucose {{molecules}} {{are joined}} to protein molecules to form stable ketoamines, or fructosamines, through glycation, a nonenzymatic mechanism involving a labile Schiff base inter-mediate and the Amadori rearrangement. The amount of fructosamine in serum is increased in diabetes mellitus {{owing to the}} abnormally high concentration of sugar in blood. The concentration of fructosamine in serum thus reflects the degree of glycemic control attained by the diabetic patient and is useful in monitoring the effectiveness of therapy in diabetes {{over a period of}} several weeks, in a manner analogous to the determination of glycated hemoglobin. 01 the analytical approaches used to measure fructosamine, affinity chromatography with m-aminophenylboronic acid and the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction method appear to be the most practical means for clinical chemists to assay fructosa-mine quickly, economically, and accurately. Fructosamine values can readily distinguish normal individuals and diabetic patients in good glycemic control from diabetics in poor control. Unlike glycated hemoglobin, which reflects the aver-age blood sugar concentration <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> six to <b>eight</b> weeks, fructosamine reflects the average blood sugar con-centration <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two to three weeks. Thus a clinical advantage is that fructosamine responds more quickly to changes in therapy, thereby allowing for improved glycemic control.

A study was initiated last summer to determine if substantial coding gain was feasible for Galileo and, is so, to recommend a suitable experimental code for use as a switchable alternative to the current NASA-standard code. The Galileo experimental code study resulted in the selection of a code with constant length 15 and rate 1 / 4. The code parameters were chosen to optimize performance within cost and risk constraints consistent with retrofitting the new code into the existing Galileo system design and launch schedule. The particular code was recommended after a very limited search among good codes with the chosen parameters. It will theoretically yield about 1. 5 dB enhancement under idealizing assumptions relative to the current NASA-standard code at Galileo's desired bit error rates.

As the number of diabetic patients is predicted to increase, a corresponding {{increase in the number of}} patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) is also to be expected. This review is an update of the published literature pertaining to the epidemiology of DR. RESULTS: <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 20 years, <b>eight</b> population-based studies have been conducted in Western countries using photographic evidence of DR. Their results have consistently suggested that the prevalence of DR is close to 28. 7 %, whereas proliferative DR and macular oedema account for 9 % and 17 %, respectively, of all diagnosed cases. Various longitudinal studies indicate an annual incidence of DR of 2 - 6 %. However, in France, the epidemiology of DR has mostly been investigated by observational studies. The recorded prevalence of DR, based on physicians' reports, is estimated to be 10 %, suggesting that DR is underdiagnosed in the French diabetic population. The discrepancy between the expected and reported prevalences of DR could be explained by the number of patients whose retinal status is unknown. DR screening with non-mydriatic fundus photography is effective for identifying early and advanced DR. Screening programmes carried out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 5 years in different regions of France indicate that 10 - 20 % of diabetic patients with previously unknown retinal status have retinopathy.

The survey revealed that manuscript editors were necessary (mean score of 4. 38 on a five-point Likert scale, with a score of 5 indicating strong agreement), and that their main contributions were efficiently managing the editorial board, improving the accuracy of references, and accelerating the editing process.
