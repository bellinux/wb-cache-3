5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route14, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} extended from Corning to Rochester via South Bristol and Pittsford. The majority of Route14 south of Pittsford was routed <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now NY64; however, {{in the vicinity}} of Bloomfield, Route14 broke from modern NY64 and used what later became NY20C to access Holcomb. At the same time, the portion of current NY64 that overlaps with US20 and NY5 was included in Route6, a cross-state highway connecting Albany to Buffalo. On March1, 1921, Route14 was altered to bypass Holcomb to the south <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now NY64.|$|E
5|$|The first NY5A was a {{short-lived}} designation for {{the portion of}} modern NY5 east of Buffalo. When it existed from 1924 to the mid-1920s, NY5 was routed <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now US20.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} culinary and medical {{advances}} {{have been developed}} in Oldham. There are claims that Oldham was {{the birthplace of the}} first chip shop. The sometimes disputed claim of trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes {{is said to have been}} started around 1858–60 from an outlet owned by a John Lees, <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the present site of Oldham's Tommyfield Market. In 1900 Oldham had the highest concentration of chip shops in the country, one for every 400 people. Rag Pudding is a savoury dish said to be native to Oldham. Yates Wine Lodge was founded in Oldham by Peter and Simon Yates in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-684, NY22 continued northeast along Sodom Road north of Brewster <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now CR50, a dead-end road maintained by Putnam County. Modern NY22 joins the I-684 roadway at exit10 (the northern terminus of I-684) and connects to the surface road {{on the opposite side}} of the Croton River via the NY981B connector. South of Copake Falls, the state also still maintains an old alignment designated as NY980F. North of Copake Falls, the northern half of the original alignment was designated as an extension of NY344.|$|E
5|$|Building <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Mayfair {{began in}} the 1660s, {{initially}} {{on the corner of}} Piccadilly, and progressed along the north side of that street. Burlington House was constructed between 1664–5 by John Denham, but was sold two years later to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington who asked Hugh May to complete it. The house was extensively modified through the 18th century, and {{is the only one of}} this era to survive into the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Classes were {{initially}} held in July 1754 and were {{presided over by}} the college's first president, Dr. Samuel Johnson. Dr. Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now lower Broadway in Manhattan. The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of King George II, making it the oldest institution of higher learning {{in the state of}} New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Events {{included}} horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, {{fighting with}} swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Booths and tents were erected in which games such as chess and cards were played for small stakes, and abundant food was supplied {{for everyone who}} attended. A temporary wooden structure called Dover Castle was erected in a natural amphitheatre <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now known as Dover's Hill, complete with small cannons that were fired to begin the events.|$|E
5|$|Hibs {{played on}} The Meadows {{for the first}} two years of their history, before moving to grounds in Newington (Mayfield Park) and Bonnington Road, Leith (Powderhall), in {{different}} spells between 1877 and 1879. After the lease on Mayfield Park expired, Hibs moved to a ground known as Hibernian Park, <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Bothwell Street in Leith. Hibs failed to secure the ground lease and a builder started constructing houses on the site in 1890. Hibs obtained a lease on a site that is now known as Easter Road in 1892 and have played their home matches there since February 1893.|$|E

5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} with being {{the first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of Pythagoras of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed {{there is not a single}} mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route32, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena. It entered Massena <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now NY420 and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of Waddington, where Route32 continued west on modern NY37 to Waddington. When state highways in New York were first posted in 1924, {{the portion of}} Route32 between Waddington and Massena became part of NY3, a highway extending across {{the width of the}} state.|$|E

5|$|Mitcham Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1685, the club playing <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> today known as Mitcham Cricket Green. The site has hosted cricket matches ever since. Mitcham is {{believed}} to be the world's oldest cricket club as there is no evidence of any club being founded before 1685. Croydon, Dartford and London had all been founded by the 1720s but their dates of origin have been lost, although there was an actual reference to a London Club in 1722.|$|E
5|$|Motorsports – Coquitlam was {{formerly}} home to Westwood Motorsport Park, Canada's first purpose-built permanent road course, located <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Westwood Plateau. The first race {{was held in}} 1959, {{and over the years}} hosted many different professional series including Formula Atlantic and Trans-Am. Notable drivers to have raced at Westwood include Formula One World Champion Keke Rosberg, Indianapolis 500 winners Bobby Rahal and Danny Sullivan, Gilles Villeneuve and Michael Andretti. The track finally closed in 1990 due to encroaching development, and racing moved to Mission Raceway Park.|$|E
5|$|NY3 {{remained}} <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now NY31 between Middleport and Medina {{until the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York {{when it was}} realigned between the two villages to use what is now NY31E. U.S. Route104 was assigned to all of Ridge Road , replacing then-NY31 west of Rochester. As a result, NY31 was shifted southward onto most of NY3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester, including between Middleport and Medina. NY31 was realigned on January1, 1949, to follow its current alignment between the two villages. The former routing of NY31 was redesignated as NY31E, a northerly alternate route of NY31.|$|E

5|$|St Andrew's Castle {{was built}} to defend Southampton Water, {{a body of water}} which linked the Solent to the {{important}} port of Southampton. It was positioned by the shore, <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Hamble Common, to the south of the village of Hamble-le-Rice. It was located at one end of an old Iron Age ditch—the area had previously been occupied during this period, when a promontory hillfort, Hamble Common Camp, was built just along the coast. Construction took place between 1542 and 1543, but the fortification may not have been fully completed until after Henry's death in 1547.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Street Shuttle was {{constructed}} {{and operated by}} the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), but is currently part of the A Division of New York City Transit, and the tracks that it uses opened in 1904 {{as part of the}} first subway in the city. The original line ran north from City Hall <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the IRT Lexington Avenue Line to 42nd Street, from where it turned west to run across 42nd Street. Then, at Broadway, the line turned north to 145th Street <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. This operation continued until 1918, when construction on the Lexington Avenue Line north of 42nd Street, and on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line south of 42nd Street was completed. One trunk would run via the new Lexington Avenue Line down Park Avenue, and the other trunk would run via the new Seventh Avenue Line up Broadway. The section in the middle, via 42nd Street, was converted into shuttle operation.|$|E
