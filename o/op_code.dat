25|$|The {{instruction}} format used 3 bits for opcode, and 12 bits for address. Block I had 11 instructions: TC, CCS, INDEX, XCH, CS, TS, AD, and MASK (basic), and SU, MP, and DV (extra). The first eight, called basic instructions, were directly accessed by the 3-bit <b>op.</b> <b>code.</b> The final three were denoted as extracode instructions {{because they were}} accessed by performing a special type of TC instruction (called EXTEND) immediately before the instruction.|$|E
25|$|INDEX: Add {{the data}} {{retrieved}} at the address {{specified by the}} instruction to the next instruction. INDEX {{can be used to}} add or subtract an index value to the base address specified by the operand of the instruction that follows INDEX. This method is used to implement arrays and table look-ups; since the addition was done on both whole words, it was also used to modify the <b>op.</b> <b>code</b> in a following (extracode) instruction, and on rare occasions both functions at once.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to expand the}} memory and instruction set for Block II, but to retain the Block I's restrictive three-bit <b>op.</b> <b>code</b> and 12-bit address had interesting design consequences. Various tricks were employed to squeeze in additional instructions, such as having special memory addresses which, when referenced, would implement a certain function. For instance, an INDEX to address 25 triggered the RESUME instruction to return from an interrupt. Likewise, INDEX 17 performed an INHINT instruction (inhibit interrupts), while INDEX 16 reenabled them (RELINT). Other instructions were implemented by preceding them with a special version of TC called EXTEND. The address spaces were extended by employing the Bank (fixed) and Ebank (erasable) registers, so the only memory of either type that could be addressed {{at any given time}} was the current bank, plus the small amount of fixed-fixed memory and the erasable memory. In addition, the bank register could address a maximum of 32 kilowords, so an Sbank (super-bank) register was required to access the last 4 kilowords. All across-bank subroutine calls had to be initiated from fixed-fixed memory through special functions to restore the original bank during the return: essentially a system of far pointers.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} four {{locations}} in core memory, at addresses 20-23, dubbed editing locations because whatever was stored there would emerge shifted or rotated by one bit position, {{except for one}} that shifted right seven bit positions, to extract one of the seven-bit interpretive <b>op.</b> <b>codes</b> that were packed two to a word.

50|$|The BeOS uses ELF format {{executable}} files, much as {{many other}} operating systems. BeIA uses an extended version of ELF, the name of which is unknown but which {{has come to be}} known as CELF, from the CEL magic word within the executable header and the fact that it is derived from ELF format executables through a compression process. The CELF (Compressed ELF) files use a patented technique to compress the <b>op</b> <b>codes</b> within the executable and reduce the overall footprint of each executable file. The file was compressed by creating a set of dictionaries that contain the <b>op</b> <b>codes</b> and are read by the kernel at start up and mapped into the executable in memory at run time. This makes the file fast loading, but has an extreme disadvantage, in that the dictionary is not extendible by the user and adding extra executable was not possible when using CELF compression techniques unless the executable symbols existed within the dictionary already present. The creation of CELF executables is generally done in batch. The entire system will be compressed and a file system image created from the crushed files. Crushing was the term coined for the compression of the system using CELF format. BeIA can run either as CELF or ELF based. However, it can only use one or the other file formats.|$|R

50|$|Another {{example was}} the IBM 650 (1953), a decimal machine, {{which had a}} group of ten 10-position {{switches}} on its operator panel which were addressable as a memory word (address 8000) and could be executed as an instruction. Thus setting the switches to 7004000400 and pressing the appropriate button would read the first card in the card reader into memory (<b>op</b> <b>code</b> 70), starting at address 400 and then jump to 400 to begin executing the program on that card.|$|E
5000|$|Instructions {{were either}} 15 or 30 bits long, so {{there could be}} up to four {{instructions}} per 60-bit word. A 60-bit word could contain any combination of 15-bit and 30-bit instructions that fit within the word, but a 30-bit instruction could not wrap to the next word. The <b>op</b> <b>codes</b> were six bits long. The remainder of the instruction was either three three-bit register fields (two operands and one result), or two registers with an 18-bit immediate constant.

There is still the possibility that if x is a complicated entity the compiler will be encouraged to avoid duplication in accessing x, and of course, if x is a lengthy name, there will be less typing required. This last was the basis of the similar feature in the ALGOL compilers offered via the Burroughs B6700 systems, using the tilde symbol to stand for the variable being assigned to, so that LongName:=x + sqrt(LongName)*7;would become LongName:=x + sqrt(~)*7;and so forth. This is more general than just x:=~ + 1; Producing optimum code would remain the province of the compiler.|$|R
5000|$|The Argus {{circuitry}} {{was based}} on germanium transistors with 0 and -6 volts representing binary 1 and 0, respectively. The computer {{was based on}} a 12-bit word length with 24-bit instructions. The arithmetic was handled in two parallel 6-bit ALUs operating at 500 kHz. Additions in the ALU took 12 µs, but adding in the memory access time meant simple instructions took about 20 µs. Double-length (24-bit) arithmetic operations were also provided. Data memory was supplied in a 12-bit, 4096 word, core memory store, while up to 64 instruction words were stored in a separate plugboard array, using ferrite pegs dropped into holes to create a [...] "1". <b>Op</b> <b>codes</b> were 6 bits, registers 3 bits, index register (modifier) 2 bits and data address 13 bits.|$|R

5000|$|Note: EXEC 8 Idle Loop - the [...] "Idle Loop" [...] {{was entered}} when a CPU had no {{available}} task to execute (typically when {{waiting for an}} I/O operation to complete).

Some instructions, such as the B (branch) instruction, only used the P Address, and later smart assemblers included a [...] "B7" [...] instruction that generated a 7-digit branch instruction (<b>op</b> <b>code,</b> P address, and one extra digit because the next instruction had to start on an even-numbered digit).|$|E
3000|$|We analyse the {{asymptotic}} behaviour {{of the network}} at high average SNR {{to gain a better}} insight on outage performance. As both average uplink and average internode SNR increase, we examine the relation of γ̅_i and γ̅_u and present OP approximations for two distinct cases, the former being high average internode (γ̅_i≫γ̅_u) and the latter being the high average uplink (γ̅_u≫γ̅_ij) regime. In both cases, all the average internode SNRs are assumed to be equal, i.e. γ̅_ij = γ̅_i. In addition, as the average uplink SNR goes to infinity, we observe the diversity and coding gains, as the OP can be written as P̃_O (γ _ 0) = [...] (G_cγ̅_u)^- G_d, with G_c denoting the coding gain and G_d the diversity gain. We first solve <b>OP,</b> <b>coding</b> and diversity gains for the non-blocked case, and then extend to the blocked case by averaging over the number of blocked links.|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this thesis {{is to show}} the {{usefulness}} simulating of an instruction set in software and to demonstrate the feasibility of doing so by providing {{the framework of a}} simulation program. The design of new computer architectures and computer based control systems is a trial and error process. Normal design practice is to design and build a prototype of the new system and then evaluate the performance of the prototype. Designing complex systems in this manner is very time consuming and expensive; using a software program to simulate the operation of the new system can help solve certain design problems and shorten the development time and effort. The instruction set simulator executes a subset of the 8086 instruction set and contains routines that are useful in debugging the target software. The feasibility of implementing an instruction set simulator to solve certain design problems has been demonstrated by implementing the most commonly used <b>op</b> <b>codes</b> from the 8086 instruction set.

50|$|PDP-11 {{processor}} speed varied by model, memory configuration, <b>op</b> <b>code,</b> and addressing modes. Instruction timing had {{up to three}} components, execute/fetch of the instruction itself and access time for the source and the destination. The last two components depended on the addressing mode. For example, on the PDP-11/70 (circa 1975), an instruction of the form ADD x(Rm),y(Rn) had a fetch/execute time of 1.35 microseconds plus source and destination times of 0.6 microseconds each, for a total instruction time of 2.55 microseconds. Any case where addressed memory {{was not in the}} cache added 1.02 microseconds. The register-to-register ADD Rm,Rn could execute from the cache in 0.3 microseconds. Floating point was even more complex, since there was some overlap between the CPU and the floating-point processor, but in general, floating point was significantly slower. A single-precision floating add instruction could range from 2.4 to 5.5 microseconds plus time to fetch the operands.|$|E
