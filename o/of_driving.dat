50|$|By {{controlling}} the size <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> region, the pilot can adjust autorotative rotational speed. For example, if the collective pitch is raised, the pitch angle increases in all regions. This causes {{the point of}} equilibrium to move inboard along the blade’s span, thereby increasing {{the size of the}} driven region. The stall region also becomes larger while the driving region becomes smaller. Reducing the size <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> region causes the acceleration force <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> region and rotational speed to decrease.|$|R
40|$|In a mini-review [Physica A 392 (2013) 5261 [...] 5282] it {{has been}} shown that {{classical}} traffic flow theories and models failed to explain empirical traffic breakdown [...] a phase transition from metastable free flow to synchronized flow at highway bottlenecks. The main objective of this mini-review is to study the consequence of this failure of classical traffic-flow theories for an analysis of empirical stochastic highway capacity as well as for the effect <b>of</b> automatic <b>driving</b> vehicles and cooperative driving on traffic flow. To reach this goal, we show a deep connection between the understanding of empirical stochastic highway capacity and a reliable analysis <b>of</b> automatic <b>driving</b> vehicles in traffic flow. With the use of simulations in the framework of three-phase traffic theory, a probabilistic analysis of the effect <b>of</b> automatic <b>driving</b> vehicles on a mixture traffic flow consisting of a random distribution <b>of</b> automatic <b>driving</b> and manual driving vehicles has been made. We have found that the parameters <b>of</b> automatic <b>driving</b> vehicles can either decrease or increase the probability of traffic breakdown. The increase in the probability of traffic breakdown, i. e., the deterioration of the performance of the traffic system can occur already at a small percentage (about 5 %) <b>of</b> automatic <b>driving</b> vehicles. The increase in the probability of traffic breakdown through automatic driving vehicles can be realized, even if any platoon <b>of</b> automatic <b>driving</b> vehicles satisfies condition for string stability.

These rules allowed 11hours <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E
