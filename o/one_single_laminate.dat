40|$|Cochleae from fetal guinea-pigs (37 to 64 {{gestation}} days, gd) {{were used}} to correlate the appearance of motile properties of isolated outer hair cells (OHCs) {{with the development of}} specific morphological features. Both the `fast' electrically-driven and the `slow' calcium-induced motilities appeared first in OHCs from basal turn of 52 gd fetuses. At 56 gd, most of basal and some apical OHCs responded positively to both types of stimulation. All tested cells were positive at 64 gd. It is noteworthy that this period closely corresponds to the onset and maturation of the gross cochlear potentials. Some structural changes in the organ of Corti may be correlated with the development of OHC motile properties: the acquisition of an adult-like cylindrical shape by the OHC, its lateral detachment from neighboring Deiters cells, and its surrounding by fluid spaces. At the ultrastructural level, the formation of a first layer of laminated cisternae regularly aligned along the OHC plasma membrane from the cuticular plate down to the nuclear level, temporally coincided with the onset of in vitro motility (52 gd). The following days, pillars and a sub-membrane lattice were clearly noticed between the outermost cisternal membrane and the plasma membrane. The results support the ideas that: motile properties observed in vitro reflect the in vivo active mechanisms, and that <b>one</b> <b>single</b> layer of <b>laminated</b> cisternae and its associated sub-plasma membrane material may be needed for OHC motility...|$|R
50|$|In West Germany an {{improved}} identity card {{was developed in}} the 1980s and issued from April 1987 on. The card consisted of a <b>single</b> <b>laminated</b> sheet of paper with a machine-readable zone. To prevent counterfeiting, it contained watermarks, guillochés, microprinting, fluorescent dyes, and multi-colour fluorescent fibres. In addition, the holder's name was laser engraved into the plastic film and the holder's picture was printed on the document, so it could not be removed and replaced by a different one (unlike the older ID cards, where the picture was just glued to the document).|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the subjects of}} the joining of and lashing in a composite car deck structure. Systems engineering methods were used to develop concepts for the joining of and lashing in a predetermined composite car deck section. Conceptual designs were evaluated by means of finite element analyses with respect to stakeholder-defined criteria, such as strength and the maximum allowed deflection during loading. The evaluation and analyses resulted in a composite car deck design composed of a glass fibre-reinforced plastic sandwich with balsa core material. The core has chamfered edges for easy assembly and disassembly by screws through <b>single</b> <b>laminate</b> edges. For the lashing of cars, metal inserts in prefabricated holes were proposed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} accurate upper-bound {{solutions for}} free in-plane vibrations of single-layer and symmetrically laminated rectangular composite plates with an arbitrary combination of clamped and free boundary conditions. In-plane natural frequencies and modes shapes are calculated by the Ritz method with a simple, stable and computationally efficient set of trigonometric functions. Reliability {{of the method}} is assessed by comparison with known accurate solutions for isotropic plates and specially orthotropic <b>single</b> <b>laminates.</b> The extensive results presented {{here for the first}} time can be considered benchmark data against which other methods may be compared and validated in the future. Influence of fiber orientation, stacking sequence, degree of orthotropy, aspect ratio and boundary conditions upon the in-plane vibration behavior are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|A silicon {{integrated}} LNA for WCDMA cellular infrastructure applications, e. g., {{base stations}} will be demonstrated. The LNA {{is designed for}} WCDMA band II, i. e., 1. 92 - 1. 98 GHz, and reaches a 0. 9 dB NF at 27 °C and 1. 2 dB at 65 °C. A 0. 1 dB NF improvement is obtained when the first gain stage is implemented using a cascode topology rather than a two-stage topology. The output IP 3 is + 40 dBm (+ 38 dBm) at 27 °C and + 37 dBm (+ 36 dBm) at 65 °C for the two-stage (cascode) topology. Both options have an input return loss better than 20 dB and output return loss better than 20 dB. A bypass mode and variable attenuation are provided to cope with large input signals. Implemented in a SiGe:C BiCMOS technology, the two-die MMIC is packaged on a <b>single</b> <b>laminate.</b> The total solution consumes just below 200 mA from a 5 V supply...|$|R
40|$|WOSInternational audienceThe {{strain rate}} {{sensitivity}} of glass fiber-reinforced polymer is studied by testing a <b>single</b> <b>laminate</b> coniguration at strain rates of 200 ― 2000 s― 1. The compressive material properties {{are determined by}} testing the laminate systems with different orientations from low to high strain rates. Samples of cubic geometry are tested in in-plane direction for seven fiber orientations, 0 °, ± 20 °, ± 30 °, ± 45 °, ± 60 °, ± 70 °, and 90 °. Preliminary compressive stress―strain vs. strain rates data obtained show that the dynamic material strength increases with increasing strain rates. The tests show a strong material sensitivity to dynamic loading and fiber direction. For in-plane tests, there is a transitional strain rate and a transitional fiber orientation in the trends, reflecting the dependencies on strain rate and fiber orientation observed in experiments. Damage investigations have revealed that the failure events differ and depend on composite sequence lay-ups...|$|R
40|$|Lattice {{parameters}} measured {{near the}} high temperature (~ 1000 °C) bcc α to hcp β transformation in an intermetallic Mo-containing γ-TiAl based alloy indicate a middle valued eigenvalue of the corresponding deformation gradient near 1. Habit-planes calculated {{under the assumption}} of a simple slip as lattice invariant shear, agree with experimentally determined orientations of the lens like plates recorded via electron backscattering. By contrast, twinning as invariant lattice shear has been investigated in nanocrystalline NiTi. Here the grain size causes the formation mechanism of the martensite to change from a “herring-bone” morphology faciliting a habit-plane between two twinned laminates and the austenite to a <b>single</b> <b>laminate,</b> which in the nonlinear theory formally cannot form a habit-plane with the austenite. Since this might cause high accommodation strains, the effectiveness of stress accommodation of martensite formed in neighboring grains of a polycrystal is investigated. Subsequent numerical microstructural modeling is outlined. The resulting energetically most favorable transformation sequence yields the transformation kinetics...|$|R
