25|$|Although Hummel died famous, with {{a lasting}} posthumous {{reputation}} apparently secure, his music was quickly forgotten at the onrush of the Romantic period, perhaps because his classical ideas {{were seen as}} old-fashioned. Later, during the classical revival of the early 20th century, Hummel was passed <b>over.</b> <b>Like</b> Haydn (for whom a revival {{had to wait until}} {{the second half of the}} 20th century), Hummel was overshadowed by Mozart. Due to a rising number of available recordings and an increasing number of live concerts across the world, his music is now becoming reestablished in the classical repertoire.|$|E

25|$|During {{certain parts}} of the Amidah said on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, Ashkenazi Jews {{traditionally}} go down to the floor upon their knees and make their upper body bowed <b>over</b> <b>like</b> an arch, similar to Muslims, though not exactly in the same manner. There are some variations in Ashkenazi customs as to how long one remains in this position. Some Jews among the Dor Daim and Talmidhe haRambam understand both the Mishneh Torah and the Talmudic source texts concerning bowing in the Shemoneh Esreh to be teaching that one must always prostrate, lying flat on the ground, not only during the High Holy Days, but throughout the year during the four bows of the Amidah. It is hard to know the percentage of those who hold by the latter view, the likelihood being that most who accept such a view usually only do so in private or when praying among like-minded people.|$|E

The soldiers at one double slipway, he discovered, had plotted with bandits to wreck heavy imperial barges {{so that they}} could steal the spilled grain. In 984 Qiao installed a pair of sluice-gates two hundred and fifty feet apart, the entire structure roofed <b>over</b> <b>like</b> a building. By siting two staunch gates so close by one another, Qiao had created a short stretch of canal, effectively a pound-lock, filled from the canal above by raising individual wooden baulks in the top gate and emptied into the canal below by lowering baulks in the top gate and raising ones in the lower.|$|E

25|$|Further reason {{cited by}} Both Fay and Lebra and other authors {{indicate}} monetary and situational scopes, {{as well as}} the resentment at the abandonment of the Indian troops at Singapore by their White comrades and the officers. Controversy exists as to what was actually said by Col J.C. Hunt in the first of the three speeches during the surrender ceremony for the Indian troops at Farrer Park on 17 February 1942. Fay writes in 1993 that a number of the troops gathered at the park remembers Hunt as having told the troops that they now belonged to the Japanese army and should obey their orders while Hunt only remembers having said that they were all Prisoners of War of the Japanese Nevertheless, Fay also points out that {{the fact that they were}} all POWs was already self-evident, and the fact that they were addressed separately implies some significance. A number of INA veterans present at the ceremony have said that, for the Indian troops, this also fed a feeling of devaluation (handed <b>over</b> <b>like</b> cattle, as Shah Nawaz Khan later put it), abandonment and of dishonour on part of the British high command that they perceived to have served loyalty.|$|E

[...] Lombardo guested with Finnish cellist group Apocalyptica on a live medley of the two tracks at 1998's Headbanger's Heaven festival in the Netherlands.

Between Joseph E. Widener's mansion in Palm Beach and the Lake Worth casino, several washouts were reported. Along State Road 704 (Royal Palm Way), many royal palm trees were toppled. At the Society of the Four Arts, several trees were uprooted and the library garden was ruined. The radio antenna at the town hall collapsed, damaging the roof, police and firefighters barracks, {{the door to the}} fire station, and a car. Palm Beach suffered approximately $2.6million in damage. In Lake Worth, a total of about 400people stayed at six shelters in the area during the storm. Between 300 and 400homes were impacted by the storm, with most of the effects limited to broken roofs, shattered windows, and water damage. One home was completely demolished.

500|$|According to Q magazine, Like a Virgin was {{the album}} that [...] "propelled [...] into the {{stratosphere}} – and rightly so. The songs are smart, funny, sexy and irresistible." [...] Taraborrelli said, [...] "It was Like a Virgin which reflected Madonna as a more versatile and artistic performer and vocals on this album being reflectively sharper in contrast to her early works in the music industry." [...] Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the songs on the album sustain a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented, [...] "Overall, the album adds up to less {{than the sum of}} its parts—partially because the singles are so good, but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of Madonna's essence—even something that makes her fun—it throws the record's balance off a little too much for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone preferred Madonna's debut album <b>over</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau was also lukewarm towards the record, writing [...] " [...] so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical, she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy." ...|$|E
