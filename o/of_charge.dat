40|$|Aerosol OT (AOT) is a {{commonly}} used surfactant and charging agent in nonpolar liquids. Properties {{such as the}} conductivity of AOT suspensions in nonpolar liquids and the behavior <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> AOT inverse micelles at interfaces have been studied recently, but still {{little is known about}} the generation dynamics <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> AOT inverse micelles. In this article, the generation dynamics <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> AOT inverse micelles in dodecane are investigated with transient current measurements. At low applied voltages, the generation rate is sufficiently fast to maintain the equilibrium concentration <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> inverse micelles, such that the current scales proportionally with the applied voltage. However, above a threshold voltage the current becomes limited by the generation <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> inverse micelles. Al 2 O 3 ‑coated electrodes are used to achieve these high-voltage current measurements while reducing surface generation currents. The dependency of the resulting generation-limited currents with the micelle concentration and the liquid volume is compatible with a bulk disproportionation mechanism. The measured currents are analyzed using a model based on drift, generation, and recombination <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> inverse micelles and the corresponding generation and recombination rates <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> AOT inverse micelles have been determined...|$|R

5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Multi-jet {{ejection}} is the {{key factor}} to promote the industrial application of electrospinning technology. Simulation model based on Maxwell theory was built up to investigate the ejection and motion behaviors <b>of</b> multi <b>charged</b> jets. The charge Coulomb repulsive force among adjacent jet was introduced into the simulation model, which enhanced the instability motion and promoted the stretching process <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> jets. The stretching ratio <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> jet increased with the increasing of injection distance, applied voltage, distance between spinneret and collector. But stretching ratio <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> jet decreased with the increasing <b>of</b> distance between <b>charged</b> jets. Stretching ratio in multi-jet electrospinning was larger than that in single-jet electrospinning. The maximal stretching ratio <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> jet was larger than 9000 in the nine jets electrospinning mode. This work provided a good method to investigate the controlling technology of multi-jet electrospinning. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{charge on}} {{electrons}} and protons is opposite in sign, hence an amount <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> may be expressed as being either negative or positive.

The amount <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10−19coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.|$|E
