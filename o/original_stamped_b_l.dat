50|$|During {{direct contact}} {{one must be}} careful because the stamp can easily be {{physically}} deformed causing printed features that {{are different from the}} <b>original</b> <b>stamp</b> features. Horizontally stretching or compressing the stamp will cause deformations in the raised and recessed features. Also, applying too much vertical pressure on the stamp during printing can cause the raised relief features to flatten against the substrate. These deformations can yield submicron features even though the <b>original</b> <b>stamp</b> has a lower resolution.|$|R
