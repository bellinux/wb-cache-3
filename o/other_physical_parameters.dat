30|$|To address this, we have {{recently}} proposed exploitation of a stimuli-responsive polymer gel as a signal-transducing material bridging between {{the target and}} the gate insulator [5, 6]. Stimuli-responsive polymer gels or 'smart gels' are a unique class of material capable of undergoing marked changes in their physicochemical properties {{in response to a}} series of specific stimuli. In particular, those sensitive to chemical stimuli, i.e., concentration fluctuations of specific molecules, are of significant interest due to their potential impact on clinical applications including bio-materials, drug delivery systems and actuators. In the gate-introduced configuration, smart gels, upon applied stimuli, can evoke an abrupt volume change termed as 'volume phase transition' causing <b>other</b> <b>physical</b> <b>parameter</b> changes such as thickness, charge density and permittivity. As a key feature, these physicochemical changes commencing at the gel/outer aqueous media interface can geometrically propagate across a macroscopic thickness of the gel layer and are, thus, able to transport the signal beyond the 'barrier' of the Debye length.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the {{formation}} of morphologically distinctive perched lava ponds produced in effusive basaltic eruptions focusses attention on the ways in which cooling and fluid dynamics interact to limit the distance a lava flow can travel. If a previously channelised flow spreads laterally on encountering a sudden decrease in the slope of the substrate or some other abrupt change in topography, its speed and thickness decrease progressively, in a way dictated by the requirements of mass and energy conservation. There is a consequent dramatic increase in heat loss from the lava as it thins. Where a flow spreads approximately radially in this way, it may form a perched lava pond. The high heat loss limits the size of any such pond to be at most a few hundred meters under almost all circumstances. Pond size depends much more strongly on lava volume flux than on any <b>other</b> <b>physical</b> <b>parameter</b> involved in the system, and {{the formation}} of these features provides a means of estimating eruption rates in paleo-eruptive episodes...|$|R

40|$|Light {{elements}} such as H, C and N can become structurally incorporated into high melting oxides and silicates {{as a result of}} contact with H 2 O, CO/CO 2 and N 2 gas during crystal growth and/or sintering. Even though the concentrations of the low-z element impurities may be small in absolute terms, their presence can profoundly affect some technically important bulk and surface or grain boundary properties. H is an ubiquitous impurity in the form of OH- ions, but transforms in part into molecular hydrogen and peroxy ions. C has been reported to be present in alumina and in fused silica. N has been detected in magnesia, in the mineral olivine and in fused silica. C in MgO has been most extensively studied in an attempt to elucidate the basic features of its structural incorporation, its diffusion mechanism and segregation behavior leading eventually to degassing. C forms anion complexes by covalently bonding to either one or two O-. The C diffusion involves the motion of the C atom together with that of the O- state through the essentially stationary O 2 - sublattice.

Moreover, a gradient may potentially appear in theories where the variability of the cosmological constant is connected to an anthropic selection mechanism, invoked to explain the smallness of this parameter.
