25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave {{a family}} dinner party prior to leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, there was no answer. Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give. Finally Loschek smashed in a panel with an axe to find the room shuttered and half-dark. Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the side of the bed, leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Before him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> table stood a glass and a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince had drunk poison from the glass, since he knew strychnine caused bleeding. On the bed lay the body of Mary Vetsera, white, ice-cold, and already quite rigid. The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E
500|$|The three objects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> cabinet {{represent}} the Virgin's purity: the water flask, the candleholder, and the ropewick light. [...] The light {{passing through the}} glass of the womb-shaped flask symbolizes her flesh, pierced by divine light, its clear and undisturbed water represents her purity at the moment of conception, a device also found in the earlier paintings as a metaphor of the Virgin's sanctity. The flask shows a reflection of the window's crossbar as a cross, a symbol of the Crucifixion, another small detail in which Memling [...] "lays one translucent symbolic form upon another".|$|E

In addition, the acute care nurses estimate that they are using <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> computers over 75 % of the time during the day shift to document vital signs/measurements and intake/output quantities.

40|$|Cees Th. Smit Sibinga ID Consulting, Zuidhorn, The NetherlandsTransfusion Medicine is a {{bridging}} science, {{spanning the}} evidence-based practice at <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> with <b>the</b> social sciences in the community.     Transfusion Medicine starts at <b>the</b> <b>bedside.</b> Surprisingly, only recently {{that has become}} rediscovered {{with the development of}} ‘patient blood management’ and ‘patient centered’ approaches to allow the growth of an optimal and rational patient care through supportive hemotherapy – safe and effective, affordable and accessible. 1     Where transfusion of blood found its origin in the need of a patient, it has drifted away {{for a long period of}} time from <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> and has been dominated for almost a century by laboratory sciences. At least the first ten editions of the famous and well reputed textbook Mollison’s Blood Transfusion in Clinical Medicine contained only a fraction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>bedside</b> practice of transfusion medicine and did not focus at all on patient blood management. 2     This journal will focus on all aspects of the transfusion chain that immediately relate to <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> practice and clinical use of blood and its components, and plasma derivatives as integral elements of a human transplant tissue. That includes legal and regulatory aspects, medical, ethical and cultural aspects, pure science and pathophysiology of disease and the impact of transfusion of blood, as well as aspects of the epidemiology of blood transfusion and clinical indications, and cost-effectiveness. Education through timely and continued transfer of up to date knowledge and the application of knowledge in clinical practice to develop and maintain clinical skills and competence, with the extension of current educational approaches through e-learning and accessible ‘apps’ will be given a prominent place...|$|R

30|$|In bedside {{ultrasound}} teaching, it {{has been}} generally accepted that Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) is well received by medical students and junior doctors.

As echocardiography is a quick and non-invasive diagnostic tool in the emergency department, the inclusion of this into junior doctors training should be a logical step.|$|R

Her firm hand trembled as she opened her dressing-case and took from it a little bottle of sal-volatile.

5000|$|Pel {{shared the}} opinion of Sir William Osler, a {{contemporary}} of his, {{that the way to}} teach and train new physicians is at <b>the</b> <b>bedsides</b> of patients, rather than at a desk listening to lectures.

Pel gave his inaugural speech <b>on</b> <b>the</b> importance of <b>bedside</b> medical teaching, which serves as {{a good example of the}} level of importance he ascribed to the adoption of this practice. Additionally, Pel was quoted as saying, [...] "Whereas, formerly, the sick patient functioned primarily as an example or illustration of the dominating theoretical education, in the modern world the careful, objective examination of the patient warrants priority attention." ...|$|R

He opened it, shut it, locked it, and sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> for a moment, in the darkness, so that he could scarcely hear any other sound, as he sat erect and still, like some night animal, wary of danger, attentively alert.

40|$|Background and Aim: Given The {{importance}} of patient satisfaction levels {{of health care}} is an effective role in planning health services management system. This study aimed to assess patient satisfaction of hospital services and related factors was designed in Baharloo study Hospital. Materials and Methods: This is a cross sectional. The data is collected by questionnaire and interview and after completing <b>the</b> questionnaire based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number of samples required in this study, the information was collected into the computer and analyzed. The study statistical society was 320 patients hospitalized in all {{different parts of the}} hospital in the second six months of 1387 were selected {{in the form of the}} random sampling. To measure the patient satisfaction used satisfaction questionnaire with six demographic questions and 20 satisfaction terms. Questionnaires was given to the patients by trained persons (non-medical staff) in the last session of therapy. In young patients the questionnaire was completed by the patients family or friend and about cases with illiteracy or low literacy the questionaire was completed by Trained questioners. Listen. Results: Satisfaction including satisfaction levels was as follows: heat and cooling systems (44. 8 %) - facilities (48. 3 %) - Food Quality (44. 8 %) - daily clothes and sheets change(41. 6 %) - Sanitation and hygience (48. 3 %) - room lighting (56 %) - the speed of filing reception files(58. 6 %) - Nurse attitude (55. 2) - time presence of clinical nurses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> patient's <b>bedside</b> (58. 6 %) - appropriate communication with sick relatives (55. 2 %).
