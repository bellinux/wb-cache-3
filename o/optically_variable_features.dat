The embossing of several different types of <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> device has been examined including portrait, non-portrait and 3 -dimensional images.

40|$|A novel {{printing}} process via hot embossing of either grating or micro-mirror microstructures {{has been demonstrated}} in thermoplastic acrylic lacquer. Embossing experiments were performed in the temperature range 100 - 150 °C and at 80 kN force. The range of microstructures has included a dot-matrix hologram, grating-based <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> devices (OVDs) and a micro-mirror based OVD. High quality replicas of each type of device have been fabricated using this process. Embossed replicas of grating-based OVDs have shown optical effects including image switching and color movement. For devices based on micro-mirror arrays, the embossed replicas have shown an <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> switch between a portrait and a non-portrait image. Printing via an embossing process offers the possibility of incorporating <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> devices into documents {{without the use of}} hot stamping foil. This is particularly relevant for documents based on polymeric substrates such as credit cards and polymer banknotes...|$|R

40|$|Deep X-ray surveys using Chandra {{have found}} the highest density of AGN on the sky (˜ 5000 deg- 2) and {{are thought to be}} the most {{efficient}} means of finding AGN. However, a recent two-epoch variability analysis of the HDF-N found comparable sky densities of sources with variable nuclei, which strongly suggest the presence of an AGN. There is only a small amount of overlap between the <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> (OV) and X-ray selected AGN, which indicates that the majority of these <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> selected AGN are underluminous in the X-ray band. In this poster we investigate the nature of the X-ray faint, <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> GOODS source population. We employ X-ray stacking techniques to measure the average X-ray photometric and spectroscopic properties of these sources. A comparison between the (stacked) X-ray undetected and X-ray detected OV sources shows the hardness ratios of the two populations differ with redshift. The X-ray undetected OV population appears to get harder with redshift, while the hardness ratios of the X-ray detected OV sources remain relatively unchanged. This is consistent with the X-ray undetected OV population being comprised of moderately Compton thick sources (NHI ˜ 2 × 1024 cm- 2) where, at higher redshifts, the > 10 keV photons that can penetrate this column {{can be seen in the}} hard (2 - 8 keV) X-ray band. In addition, we combine the optical spectra, when available, to look for the presence of high ionization lines that are indicative of AGN. We fail to find high-ionization lines in the stacked optical spectra of the X-ray undetected, <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> sources, but we do find weak NeIII, NeV, and MgII lines in the stacked X-ray detected, OV population...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{properties}} of active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected by optical variability in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field (SXDF). Based on the locations of variable components and light curves, 211 <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> AGN were reliably selected. We made three AGN samples; X-ray detected optically non-variable AGN (XA), X-ray detected <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> AGN (XVA), and X-ray undetected <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> AGN (VA). In the VA sample, we found a bimodal distribution of the ratio between the variable component flux and the host flux. One of these two components in the distribution, a class of AGN with a faint variable component i'_vari∼ 25 mag in bright host galaxies i'∼ 21 mag, is not seen in the XVA sample. These AGN {{are expected to have}} low Eddington ratios if we naively consider a correlation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass. These galaxies have photometric redshifts z_photo∼ 0. 5 and we infer that they are low-luminosity AGN with radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). The properties of the XVA and VA objects and the differences from those of the XA objects can be explained within the unified scheme for AGN. Optical variability selection for AGN is an independent method and could provide a complementary AGN sample which even deep X-ray surveys have not found.

40|$|At {{the past}} optical {{security}} conferences attention {{was focused on}} diffractive structures, e. g. holograms, embossed gratings and thin—film devices, as security elements on valuable documents. The main reasons for this emphasis are, that the iridescent effect of such diffractive <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> devices (OVD’s) can be easily observed by the naked eye and that their fraud-resistance is considered excellent. No {{attention has been paid}} to non—diffractive <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> phenomena like reversible photosensitivity, e. g. luminescence and photochroism. These may be employed in non-diffractive OVD’s which may be readily authenticated and may provide excellent fraud-resistance as well. In order to survey the enormous variety of document security features the library SECURIDAT was compiled from a number of public domain databases. This paper discusses a few security applications of reversible photosensitivity that resulted from a search in SECURIDAT, viz. dual fluorescence with longwave remanence, thermochroism, stimulation of mixed inorganic phosphors and photochroism...|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of micro-mirror based portrait and non-portrait images {{has been demonstrated}} by graytone lithography. The depiction of a portrait image was achieved by a novel modulation of the width of micro-apertures in the variable transparency mask. The non-portrait image was encoded as micro-mirrors of an opposing slope and orientation. An optical switch effect between the portrait and a non-portrait image was encoded into the mask by {{the arrangement of the}} micro-mirrors as a separate interleaved channel for each image. The lithographic exposure of the pattern into a layer of thick resist has produced an array of micro-mirrors with a depth of 10 - 30 µm. Various configurations of the micro-mirror arrays have been examined in relation to the type of micro-apertures and their orientation. <b>Optically</b> <b>variable</b> effects achieved in the micro-mirror devices have included a portrait to non-portrait switch, a positive to negative image switch and a non-portrait to non-portrait image switch.
