5000|$|Once the Mexican-American War {{had ended}} and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo was approved, Mexico {{reinstated}} a preexisting system of tariffs which angered merchants who planned {{to stay in the}} previously profitable region of Mexico and conduct business. The tariff caused goods to be so expensive they often could not be sold. In addition, the laws governing tariffs were changed frequently and often without reason, resulting in frustration among merchants and distrust among importers. Even worse, merchants grew more and more frustrated as they watched towns spring up and prosper on the American side of the border just opposite theirs, where business flourished without the high costs of the Mexican tariff system. In their book The Zona Libre, Samuel E. Bell and James M. Smallwood argue that after the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, many American border towns prospered at the expense of Mexican villages. Because goods were so much cheaper in the American towns, Mexicans would cross the border to purchase goods and then smuggle them back home across the Rio Grande. Merchants and other larger-scale buyers also profited a great deal from this illicit smuggling, resulting in American towns that thrived on illegal operations, along with tense relationships among the towns north of the border in Texas and south of the border in Tamaulipas. These poor economic conditions also contributed to increased emigration from Mexico to the US. To counteract emigration, the Mexican government passed a law in the spring of 1849 to slightly decrease the rates <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>provisions</b> could be imported. However, the law was not comprehensive enough and failed to curb emigration. [...] In the next ten years, merchants would continue to find ways around the Mexican tariff system and the Mexican side of the US-Mexican border would relentlessly deteriorate.|$|E
