5|$|After {{the death}} of Cromwell in 1658, Monck {{remained}} aloof from the political manoeuvring in London {{that led to the}} brief establishment of a regime under the protector's son Richard Cromwell and after its fall the subsequent contest for power between the army leaders. When this proved incapable of producing a stable government in 1659 Monk opened negotiations with Charles II and began a slow march south with his army. After reaching London he restored the English Long Parliament that had existed {{at the beginning of the}} civil wars. This body, having received some assurances from Charles II, voted for a restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> in England and then dissolved itself. This created a de facto restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monarchy</b> in Scotland, but without any safeguards as to the constitutional position in the country. Scottish notables were in a weak position in negotiations with the crown as to what the settlement would be.|$|E

5|$|In 1659, {{shortly before}} the {{restoration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monarchy,</b> the Protector's Council was abolished.

5|$|In the 1990s, republicanism in the United Kingdom grew, {{partly on}} account of {{negative}} publicity associated with the Royal Family (for instance, immediately {{following the death of}} Diana, Princess of Wales).

5|$|According to a {{tradition}} originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th-century, James's taste for political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established {{the foundations of}} the English Civil War. James bequeathed Charles a fatal belief in the divine right of kings, combined with a disdain for Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles and the abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monarchy.</b> Over the last three hundred years, the king's reputation has suffered from the acid description of him by Sir Anthony Weldon, whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.|$|E
