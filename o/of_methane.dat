In recent years, the {{research}} on the coal-bed methane productivity evaluation with the logging method has progressed slowly, and a great breakthrough is needed. The influencing factors <b>of</b> the coal-bed <b>methane</b> productivity are analyzed based on the characteristics <b>of</b> coal-bed <b>methane</b> reservoir and the principle <b>of</b> coal-bed <b>methane</b> exploration. And the methods of evaluating the logging reservoir parameters related to the coal-bed methane productivity are also discussed. Meanwhile, {{the research}} prospect on the evaluation <b>of</b> coal-bed <b>methane</b> productivity with the logging technology is proposed by utilizing the principle of complex oil-gas reservoir productivity evaluation...|$|R

5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production <b>of</b> <b>methane).</b> Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation <b>of</b> <b>methane,</b> many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E
5|$|Small {{quantities}} <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> and formaldehyde {{detected by}} Mars orbiters are both {{claimed to be}} possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere.

5|$|The {{hydrocarbons}} {{are thought}} to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> by the Sun's ultraviolet light, producing a thick orange smog. Titan spends 95% of its time within Saturn's magnetosphere, which may help shield it from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> {{and possibly}} nitrogen suggests that Makemake {{could have a}} transient atmosphere {{similar to that of}} Pluto near its perihelion. Nitrogen, if present, will be the dominant component of it. The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, a large amount of nitrogen was probably lost via atmospheric escape; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32–36K), which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance <b>of</b> <b>methane.</b> However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by New Horizons suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E

5|$|Energy {{from the}} Sun should have {{converted}} all traces <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time {{compared to the}} age of the Solar System. This suggests that methane must be replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself. The ultimate origin of the methane in its atmosphere may be its interior, released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's {{internal}} structure {{resembles that of}} Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations <b>of</b> <b>methane,</b> ammonia and water {{are found in the}} lower regions of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's spectra {{suggest that}} its lower {{stratosphere}} is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis <b>of</b> <b>methane,</b> such as ethane and ethyne.

5|$|Trujillo {{and colleagues}} have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface {{composition}} of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> further supports {{the existence of}} tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation <b>of</b> <b>methane.</b> Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, {{at least for a}} short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). However, its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto.|$|E
5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E

5|$|As {{with any}} heavy industry, the {{possibility}} of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of colliery disaster was the gas explosion, caused by either a buildup <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> gas or coal dust. As the mines became deeper and ventilation become more difficult to control the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster in which an explosion saw the loss of 178 lives. However, the major disasters only accounted for roughly 20% of overall fatalities, with individual accidents accounting {{for the bulk of}} deaths. The list below shows mining disasters which saw the loss of five or more lives during a single incident.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential toxic waste site {{in the path of the}} subway.

The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line.

40|$|AbstractCoal is {{the primary}} energy {{resource}} in China, with the raw coal production reaching 2. 8 billion tons in 2008. However, great amount <b>of</b> coalmine <b>methane</b> is released during coal exploitation, which runs up to over 3. 5 billion cubic meters. To minimize environmental pollution caused by coalmine methane and to promote resource utilization, various systems for utilizing coalmine methane energy are developed in China. Common types of such systems include power generation system utilizing coalmine <b>methane,</b> combined-heat-and-power system <b>of</b> coalmine <b>methane,</b> thermal energy provision system <b>of</b> coalmine <b>methane,</b> and fuel-gas provision system, etc. This paper describes elements, characteristics, and applicability of these systems and presents thermal economy analysis to specific system.
