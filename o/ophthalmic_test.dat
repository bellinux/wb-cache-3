40|$|SUMMARY In {{an effort}} to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the Doppler <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Test</b> (DOT) following carotid endarterectomy, a large group of patients was examined both pre- and postoperatively with non-invasive techniques. The DOT, which has proven to be a useful non-invasive diagnostic test for the determina-tion of significant carotid artery stenosis, was found to be persistently abnormal in 46 % of patients with a preoperative positive test. This occurred in spite of the fact that operative arteriography, direct ultrasonic auscultation, and Doppler imaging studies were all within normal limits. It is suggested from this study that the Doppler <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Test</b> alone is not adequate to follow patients postoperatively, especially if an abnormal study persists following a satisfactory endarterectomy. Other non-invasive techniques, which employ direct ul-trasonic imaging of the carotid flow, may be more accurate in determining vessel patency.

40|$|Abstract. The {{reliability}} of clinical methods is often taken for granted. There is considerable evidence, however, that variability of clinical measurements, interpretations, and judgements {{are greater than}} commonly thought. Inconsistency of clinical methods has profound and widespread implications in clinical practice. The inferential capacity of measurements depends on accuracy and reproducibility. Appropriate medical decisions cannot be reached without accurate and reliable data. This review will examine the conceptual relationship of reliability, accuracy, and validity.

Three prin-cipal patterns were identified, depending upon whether there was augmentation (Type 1), diminution (Type 2) or no change (Type 3) {{in the character of}} the supraorbital Doppler signal upon temporal artery compression. Type 1 records were seen in 28 of 33 instances where the carotid arteries remained patent. Type 2 records occurred in 10 of 14 instances where there was significant carotid stenoses or tortuosity and in two instances in a patient with a subclavian steal syndrome.

Matrix FDT is an <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>test</b> used to detect visual field loss. Method: A total of 13 patients, 13 parents, and 12 healthy controls {{were enrolled in the}} study. Participants were subjected to Matrix FDT perimetry in a single test session. We analyzed the mean deviation for each eye and used a generalized estimated equation to evaluate differences among the groups and correct the dependency between the eyes. Results: The global mean deviation (presented as the mean of both eyes) was significantly lower in the schizophrenic patients than in their parents or controls. Analysis of the general sensitivity of the fibers crossing the optic chiasm showed a difference between the groups (P = 0. 006), indicating that the sensitivity of the fibers crossing the optic chiasm was lower than those which did not cross. But when we analyzed the specific groups, the difference between the fibers was not considerable. Comparison of the right and left hemispheres showed that general sensitivity was lower for the left hemisphere, but when we analyzed specific groups, the difference was not significant (P = 0. 29). Conclusion: These findings are suggestive of a lower global sensitivity in schizophrenic patients and their parents compared with controls. This difference may be an endophenotype of schizophrenia.

40|$|Our {{conclusions}} {{differ in}} a few points from those of our first work on this subject. We are able to sum up our observations in this series of experiments as follows: 1. The ophthalmo-tuberculin test is of limited value in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle. In some cases the reaction is very slight (hyperæmia). In others more pronounced congestion with profuse exudates are noted. Accuracy of observation is important. We are inclined to rely primarily {{on the results of}} the first instillation of tuberculin. Second instillations {{in a few}} instances elicit reaction in non-tubercular animals. 2. In the majority of animals tested the reaction increased in its intensity with each subsequent instillation of tuberculin. This fact indicates the development of a local hypersusceptibility or anaphylaxis associated with a partial immunity; von Pirquet calls this condition "allergie" (9). 3. It is possible in some cases to create a condition of "allergie" in healthy cattle, when spaced instillations of tuberculin are made. It is evident, therefore, that the result of the first instillation of tuberculin should be made the only basis of diagnosis. Rosenau and Anderson (II) have recently called attention to this point in regard to the human subject. 4. When repeated instillations of tuberculin are made on the conjunctiva at short intervals (twenty-four hours, etc.) a local immunity results (No. 3 D et al.). If the instillations are separated two weeks or more anaphylaxis results. 5. We, therefore, hold that if tuberculin (0. 1 cubic centimeter) is carefully instilled into the conjunctival sac and if careful comparison of the instilled eye with the opposite eye shows that a reaction of varying intensity results in from ten to twelve hours after the first instillation, a tubercular lesion is present. 6. In our first report (7) we were inclined to believe that subcutaneous tubercular injection given previous to the ocular test would slightly inhibit it. We have since become convinced that this is true only to a limited extent, and that in some cases the ophthalmo-reaction is exaggerated by a subcutaneous injection of tuberculin. 7. The primary ophthalmo-tuberculin reaction is in direct proportion to the extent of the tubercular processes in the body. The more extensive the tubercular processes, the more anaphylactic the animal is. This is in direct variance with the condition in the usual subcutaneous tuberculin test. (See Necropsy Report.) 8. We are inclined to believe that the ophthalmo-tuberculin test will reveal tuberculosis at as early a state as the usual subcutaneous test. 9. The ophthalmo-reaction is of no value in determining whether vaccinated cattle are actively tubercular or not, or in demonstrating any hypersusceptibility in the offspring of tubercular cattle. 10. The cutaneous test from our brief series of experiments {{does not seem to be}} as accurate as the <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>test.</b> This conclusion has been reached by several investigators...|$|E
40|$|The {{conclusions}} to be deduced {{from this}} brief {{series of experiments}} are as follows: 1. The ophthalmo-tuberculin reaction is of some value for diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle. A characteristic conjunctivitis with fibrinous exudation coming on from six to eight hours, reaching a maximum in from sixteen to twenty-four hours and disappearing in forty-eight hours, is noted in tubercular animals. 2. The reaction is more pronounced in those animals which have not been recently tested with tuberculin. With this reaction as with the usual tuberculin test one injection and reaction probably inhibit a second reaction during a period from six weeks to a year. The ordinary tuberculin test {{does not seem to}} interfere to any great extent with the ophthalmo-tuberculin test at least within four weeks. Class B, though recently tested, showed the reaction, although not to the extent of Class A, which was tested some time ago. The tuberculin test occasionally prevents absolutely a second reaction, and usually no second reaction occurs within six weeks to a year, as before stated. 3. In cattle recently tested with tuberculin by the subcutaneous method the ophthalmo-tuberculin reaction is only slightly reduced in its intensity. The <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>test</b> may possibly serve as a means of diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle which have been tested with tuberculin by the ordinary method and will not react a second time, or where tuberculin has been injected into cattle in order that they may clear a second test. Another possibility must not be overlooked in this connection. It is well known that animals which have a slight tubercular infection often show a very marked and typical reaction to the tuberculin test as it is usually made, and those animals which show themselves clinically to be in the advanced stages of tuberculosis often show only a very slight reaction. The animals in Class B are in the advanced stages of tuberculosis and this fact might perhaps account for the lower intensity of the reaction. The exact cause of the lower reaction in these cattle can only be determined by further experimentation. 4. No constitutional disturbance being noticed in any of the cattle tested, that is, no rise in temperature, loss of appetite or falling off in the production of milk, it is evident that the instillation of tuberculin into the eye does not produce the general reaction which attends in some cases the subcutaneous injection of tuberculin, and is therefore decidedly advantageous. The exudate disappears and leaves the eye perfectly normal in forty-eight hours after injection. 5. If the ophthalmo-tuberculin test proves as efficacious as the foregoing experiments seem to indicate we have in it a comparatively rapid and easy means of diagnosing tuberculosis in cattle. Such being the case the method cannot fail to come into general use superseding the present laborious method of applying the test. Cattle can be injected and then inspected sixteen to twenty-four hours afterward. There are many problems in connection with the reaction which must necessarily be studied. The following {{are a few of the}} propositions: 1. Is it possible to tell by the reaction how far the tubercular process has progressed in the body? 2. Is there any relationship between the intensity of the reaction and the number and severity of the tubercular lesions? 3. Will the test prove to be more accurate than the ordinary tuberculin test which is said to reveal all but four per cent. of the cases ? 4. Will the test reveal tuberculosis after a subcutaneous tuberculin injection? 5. Will animals react a second time if the first tuberculin is placed in the eye and the second given by the ordinary subcutaneous method and conversely? These and many more points must be thoroughly investigated before the efficiency of the test is proven. The opththalmo-tuberculin test will be repeated on other cattle, and also on the cattle used in these experiments. Experiments are being made to determine the efficiency of the cutaneous tuberculin reaction in cattle. We wish in this paper to give only the preliminary findings...|$|E

40|$|Background: The Portable Eye Examination Kit (Peek) is {{a mobile}} phone-based <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>testing</b> {{system that has}} been {{developed}} to perform comprehensive eye examinations. Shortages in ophthalmic personnel, the high cost, and the difficulty in transporting equipment have made it challenging to offer services, particularly in rural areas. Peek offers a solution for overcoming barriers of limited access to traditional <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>testing</b> methods and has been pilot tested on adults in Nakuru, Kenya, and compared with traditional eye examination tools. Objective: This qualitative study evaluated the acceptability and usability of Peek in addition to perceptions regarding its adoption and nationwide deployment. Methods: Semistructured {{interviews were conducted with}} patients and analyzed using a framework approach. This included analysis of interviews from 20 patients, 8 health care providers (HCPs), and 4 key decision makers in ophthalmic health care provision in Kenya. The participants were purposefully sampled. The coding structure involved predefined themes for assessing the following: (1) the context, that is, environment, user, task, and technology; (2) patient acceptability, that is, patients' perceived benefits, patient preference, and patient satisfaction; (3) usability, that is, efficiency, effectiveness, learnability, and flexibility and operability of Peek; and (4) the benefits of Peek in strengthening eye care provision, that is, capabilities enhancer, opportunity creator, social enabler, and knowledge generator. Emerging themes relating to the objectives were explored from the data using thematic analysis. Results: Patients found Peek to be acceptable because of its benefits in overcoming the barriers to accessing ophthalmic services. Most thought it to be fast, convenient, and able to reach a large population. All patients expressed being satisfied with Peek. The HCPs perceived it to satisfy the criteria for usability and found Peek to be acceptable based on the technology acceptance model. Peek was also found to have features required for strengthening ophthalmic delivery by aiding detection and diagnosis, provision of decision support, improving communication between provider and patient and among providers, linking patients to services, monitoring, and assisting in education and training. Some of the deployment-related issues included the need for government and community involvement, communication and awareness creation, data protection, infrastructure development including capacity creation, and training and maintenance support.

Twenty five healthy sheep (Ovis aries), of the same breed (Texel), male or female, with three years of age, received an ophthalmic examination in both eyes, including pupillary reflexes, Schirmer tear test, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and fluorescein staining. For all <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>testing,</b> animals were gently physically restrained, with no pressure in the jugular area and the eyelids were carefully open.

40|$|AIM: To {{detect and}} analyze the changes on ocular surface and tear {{function}} in type II diabetic patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), an advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy (DR), using conventional <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>tests</b> and the high-resolution laser scanning confocal microscopy. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with type II diabetes were selected. Based on the diagnostic criteria and stage classification of DR, the patients were divided into the non-DR (NDR) group and the PDR group. Thirty-six patients with cataract but no other ocular and systemic disease were included as non-diabetic controls. All the patients were subjected to the conventional clinical tests of corneal sensitivity, Schirmer I Test, and corneal fluorescein staining. The non-invasive tear film break-up time (NIBUT) and tear interferometry were conducted by a Tearscope Plus. The morphology of corneal epithelia and nerve fibers was examined using the high-resolution confocal microscopy. RESULTS: The NDR group exhibited significantly declined corneal sensitivity and Schirmer I test value, {{as compared to the}} non-diabetic controls (P< 0. 001). The PDR group showed significantly reduced corneal sensitivity, Schirmer I test value, and NIBUT in comparison to the non-diabetic controls (P < 0. 001). Corneal fluorescein staining revealed the progressively injured corneal epithelia in the PDR patients. Moreover, significant decrease in the corneal epithelial density and morphological abnormalities in the corneal epithelia and nerve fibers were also observed in the PDR patients. CONCLUSION: Ocular surface changes, including blunted corneal sensitivity, reduced tear secretion, tear film dysfunction, progressive loss of corneal epithelia and degeneration of nerve fibers, are common in type II diabetic patients, particularly in the diabetic patients with PDR. The corneal sensitivity, fluorescein staining scores, and the density of corneal epithelial cells and nerve fibers in the diabetic patients correlate with the duration of diabetes. Therefore, ocular surface of the patients with PDR should be examined regularly by conventional approaches and confocal microscopy to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of keratopathy. ...|$|R

Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at the rest state as well as after treadmill exercise and analysed in detail with the following parameters: (i) left ventricle (LV) systolic function was assessed by Simpson’s method derived ejection fraction (EF) and speckle tracking derived global longitudinal strain (GLS), (ii) myocardial structural alteration by calibrated integrated backscatter (cIBS), (iii) diastolic function by tissue Doppler derived E/E’ ratio, and (iv) diastolic function reserve index (DFRI). Furthermore, all patients undertook a full-fledged photography programme. Retinopathy was scored and classified as with retinopathy or without diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS: Of the 251 subjects (mean age, 63. 13 ± 9. 31 years; 46. 2 % male), 24. 3 % had retinopathy. Patients with and without diabetic retinopathy (as a categorical variable) had similar LVEF and cIBS. However, retinopathy had a significant correlation with LV GLS (r = – 0. 18, P < 0. 01), E/E’ (r = 0. 19, P < 0. 01), diastolic dysfunction grade (r = 0. 18, P < 0. 01), and DFRI (r = – 0. 23, P = 0. 02). Furthermore, these correlations were independent of potential confounding factors. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the occurrence of retinopathy significantly correlates with GLS, E/E’, diastolic dysfunction grade, and DFRI. Above all, the correlation still existed after adjusted by potential confounding factors, suggestive of an independent relation between retinopathy and cardiac function. The link between these parameters highlighted the importance of further cardiac assessment and timely treatment for DM patients with diabetic retinopathy who have no cardiac disease history and relevant symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a robotic slit-lamp for remote ophthalmology is {{the primary purpose of}} this work. In addition to novel mechanical designs and implementation, it was also a goal to develop a control system that was flexible enough to be adapted with minimal user adjustment to various styles and configurations of slit-lamps. The system was developed with intentions of commercialization, so common hardware was used for all components to minimize the costs. In order to improve performance using this low-cost hardware, investigations were made to attempt to achieve better performance by applying control theory algorithms in the system software. Ultimately, the controller was to be flexible enough to be applied to other areas of human-robot interaction including pediatric rehabilitation via the use of humanoid robotic aids. This application especially requires a robust controller to facilitate safe interaction. Though all of the prototypes were successfully developed and made to work sufficiently with the control hardware, the application of advanced control did not yield notable gains as was hoped. Further investigations were made attempting to alter the performance of the control system, but the components selected did not have the physical capabilities for improved response above the original software implemented. Despite this disappointment, numerous novel advances were made in the area of teleoperated ophthalmic technology and pediatric physical rehabilitation tools. This includes a system that is used to remote control a slit-lamp and lens for examinations and some laser procedures. Secondly, a series of of humanoid systems suitable for both medical research and therapeutic modeling were developed. This included a robotic face used as an interactive system for <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>testing</b> and training. It can also be used as one component in an interactive humanoid robotic system that includes hands and arms to allow use of teaching sign language, social skills or modeling occupational therapy tasks. Finally, a humanoid system is presented that can serve as a customized surrogate between a therapist and client to model physical therapy tasks in a realistic manner. These systems are all functional, safe and low-cost to allow for feasible implementation with patients in the near future...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} {{suspected of}} {{allergic contact dermatitis}} because of topical <b>ophthalmic</b> medicaments, patch <b>tests</b> performed with patients' own products are often negative. The irritant anionic surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) may alter the stratum corneum and increase antigen penetration. Pre-treatment of the skin with SLS 0. 5 % for 24 h was performed in the sites of patch tests with patients' own products in 15 selected patients. In patients previously negative to their own products tested with conventional patch tests, SLS pre-treatment showed 6 new relevant positive reactions and induced a stronger positive reaction in 1 patient. SLS pre-treatment could be proposed as an alternative promising method, which may increase sensitivity of patch tests with patients' own products...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} refractive errors in Shiraz schoolchildren by age and gender. METHODS For this cross-sectional study, random cluster sampling was carried out from students of the 2008 - 2009 academic year. After the initial interview, <b>ophthalmic</b> examinations including <b>tests</b> of visual acuity, non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic refraction and binocular vision were performed. Myopia {{was defined as a}} spherical equivalent or =+ 2. 0 D, and astigmatism as a cylinder refraction > or = 0. 75 D. All values for school grade and gender were directly standardized based on the total student population in the 2008 - 2009 school year.

40|$|Initial {{comparisons}} {{of the results of}} digital subtraction angiog-raphy (DSA) and a battery of tests for noninvasive diagnosis of carotid artery disease indicate the two techniques are comple-mentary, rather than competitive. DSA provides important mor-phologic information at the carotid bifurcation and siphon, but the images are sometimes difficult to interpret with precision. Noninvasive testing gives discrete physiologic information re-lated to hemodynamics, but the findings are less specific for the level of the lesion in the carotid / <b>ophthalmic</b> system. Noninvasive <b>tests</b> may be more useful than DSA for determining if a lesion is hemodynamically significant and whether advanced disease shows evidence of progression on sequential studies. The non-invasive tests are not definitive procedures, but are useful in selecting patients for a contrast study. They are the initial pro-cedure of choice for the patient with asymptomatic bruit.

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} and compare ocular surface changes in {{type 2 diabetes}} patients treated either oral antidiabetic drugs(OAD) or insulin. METHODS: Forty eyes of twenty patients treated with OAD, 40 eyes of 20 patients treated with insulin and 10 non-diabetic controls seen at the Ministry of Health Ankara Educational and Research Hospital were studied. All subjects underwent routine <b>ophthalmic</b> examinations, Schirmer <b>test,</b> tear film break-up time analysis and conjunctival impression cytology analysis. Patients in three groups were compared for tear function parameters, goblet cell density and squamous metaplasia grade. The relation between status of retinopathy and ocular surface disorders were noted. RESULTS: The tear film break-up time values were significantly lower at patients treated with OAD(P CONCLUSION: Precorneal tear film stability {{is found to be}} worse in patients treated with OAD whereas impression cytology analysis is similar in all groups...|$|R
40|$|Pegylated titanates {{have been}} {{prepared}} as biomedical supports {{in the form of}} thin films. The independent preparation of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a ¿tetraisopropyl-orthotitanate (TIPT) precursorwas followed by mixing at different molar ratios and spin casting onto Si (100) substrates to form the films. Activation of the hybrid structure was induced by annealing at temperatures right below the PEG melting point. Structural and compositional changes during these steps were followed by Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, XPS) and water contact angle (CA) measurements. Biofunctionality of the pegylated titanates as antifouling <b>ophthalmic</b> films was <b>tested</b> on the one hand by determination of optical constants using genetic algorithms. On the other hand, indication of surface biocompatibility was provided by seeding mesenchymal stemcells. The results show that PEG-rich surfaces are less biocompatible than mild inorganic surfaces as derived from the inhibition of cytoskeleton polarization. JRC.

40|$|The major {{challenge}} associated with conventional eye-drop is the rapid drug loss due to precorneal defence barrier. In this context, controlled-release system of ciprofloxacin-conjugated chitosan (CS) -Dextran sulphate (DS) nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized, {{to increase the}} bioavailability. The formulated drug delivery vehicle was evaluated for its therapeutic value in the simulated tear fluidat pH 7. 4. <b>Ophthalmic</b> microbes were <b>tested</b> with this formulation, to confirm the drug efficacy; which showed conducive therapeutic values of both MIC and MBC. Ocular irritancy test was performed using HET-CAM test, which showed that the CS-DS system did not yield any vascular response, offering {{it to be a}} non-irritant to the ocular surface. The release studies showed monotonous controlled-release for duration of 21  h.

40|$|Class of 2010 AbstractOBJECTIVES: This is a {{selective}} systematic {{review of the}} methods used to monitor for the ocular adverse effects of chronic hydroxychloroquine use. This was done to describe the screening methods for detecting retinal toxicity and the recommendations for early detection of hydroxychloroquine associated retinopathy. METHODS: A literature search of OVID-MEDLINE and the Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) search database in the AHSL website were performed for the date range October 1999 to October 2009. Articles were selected based on content related to our purpose statement. Each article must {{have had at least}} one or more <b>ophthalmic</b> screening <b>test</b> including: fundus photography, Amsler grid, perimetry, color vision, and multifocal electroretinography. RESULTS: The search results returned a total of 67 articles. A total of twelve articles were selected for review. A total of 959 human subjects were studied and 22 patients had reported retinal changes attributed to hydroxychloroquine. Nine of the eleven studies that included mfERG recommended this specific test for monitoring for hydroxychloroquine induced retinopathy. Only six of the studies recommended the frequency of testing. The most common recommendation was to test at baseline and then at least annually. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the mfERG is the most sensitive and objective exam for early documentation of toxic retinopathy. In addition baseline and annual testing was suggested most often. The data also suggest that high risk patients be followed more closely as the most severe and irreversible damage occurs in this population...|$|R
