5|$|Burnside's {{road system}} was {{completely}} bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored roadworks programmes. Plans were also laid out {{to replace the}} winding and dangerous Mount Barker Road. One of these proposals was the Burnside-Crafers Highway, which was strongly supported by council; it envisaged leaving Greenhill Road <b>once</b> <b>reaching</b> Hazelwood Park. It was then to pass through Hazelwood Park and Beaumont, wind around the hills of Waterfall Gully and then go over Eagle on the Hill to meet Crafers. The Burnside Council put much effort into this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) {{in preparation for the}} highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Marianas Islands, {{the eye of}} Dolphin became much larger as the storm {{developed}} strong outflow channels, both indicative of further strengthening. On May16, the typhoon began rapid deepening as it reached the western periphery of the ridge, causing it to turn more to the north. At 06:00UTC that day, the JMA estimated peak 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). Based on the well-defined structure and Dvorak ratings of T7.0, the JTWC upgraded Dolphin to a super typhoon late on May16 with 1minute winds of 260km/h (160mph). The approaching westerlies turned Dolphin {{to the north and}} northeast on May17 while also imparting unfavorable conditions, causing the eye and the convection to elongate and weaken. By May18, increased wind shear had exposed the circulation as the winds continued to drop. After the convection decreased further, the JTWC discontinued advisories on Dolphin on May19, once Dolphin was beginning to become extratropical near the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. On the next day, the winds fell below typhoon force, and at 00:00UTC on May21, the JMA declared Dolphin extratropical. The storm accelerated to the northeast, passing through the Aleutian Islands on May22. The storm slowed <b>once</b> <b>reaching</b> the Gulf of Alaska, turning eastward to cross the International Date Line on May24.|$|E
5|$|At the New Yorkâ€“Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E

5|$|Another {{commodity}} {{that was}} a prominent source of trade was the production of sugar from the crop sugar cane. The original habitat of sugar was in India, where it was taken and planted in various islands. <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> {{to the people of}} the Iberian Peninsula, it was further migrated across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 16th century, the first plantations of sugar were started in the New World, marking the last great stage of migration of the cane to the West. Because of the conflict of transporting sugar in its raw form, sugar was not associated with commerce until the act of refining it came into play; this act became the center for industry. Venice was the center for refining during the Middle Ages, therefore making them the chief traders of sugar. Although, the Spanish and Portuguese held the monopolies of the sugar cane fields in America, they were being supplied by Venice. In the 17th century, England dominated Venice and became the center for refining and cultivating sugar; this leadership was maintained until the rise of French industry. Sugar throughout the 17th century was still considered a luxury until the latter half of the 17th century when the sugar was being produced in mass quantities making it available to the mass of the English people. This turn of events made the sugar a commodity, because the crop was not being used in only special occasion, but in all daily meals.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{characteristics}} of mastodon bone sites, it can be inferred that, as in modern proboscideans, the mastodon social group consisted of adult females and young, living in bonded groups called mixed herds. The males abandoned the mixed herds <b>once</b> <b>reaching</b> sexual maturity and lived either alone or in male bond groupings. As in modern elephants, there probably was no seasonal synchrony of mating activity, with both males and females seeking out each other for mating when sexually active.|$|E
25|$|There was {{speculation}} that engineer Earl, a senior engineer with an excellent record, exceeded {{the speed limit}} on the curve because of the competitive pressure the passenger railroads were receiving from the airlines.

25|$|At the anode a {{catalyst}} oxidizes the fuel, usually hydrogen, turning the fuel into a positively charged ion and a negatively charged electron. The electrolyte is a substance specifically designed so ions can pass through it, but the electrons cannot. The freed electrons travel through a wire creating the electric current. The ions {{travel through the}} electrolyte to the cathode. <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> the cathode, the ions are reunited with the electrons and the two react with a third chemical, usually oxygen, to create water or carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|When {{the series}} was {{reaching}} its climax, Wings editor Miki Ishikawa remembers receiving several letters in which fans requested for a happy ending. <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> the end, more letters expressed sadness and shock for the tragic ending and wanted more explications regarding Hokuto's fate. In regards to this character, Ishikawa considered her popularity an exception considering most readers {{tend to be more}} attracted by the series' male characters.

25|$|In the US, {{a system}} {{originally}} {{developed in the}} French ITT laboratories was widely used.

This system used a motor to quickly spin a radiogoniometer, as well as providing an input to electronics that spun the X and Y inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). This caused the signal to trace out a pattern on the display {{that could be used to}} determine the direction of the transmission almost instantly.|$|E
25|$|Hillary {{has been}} to Everest five times, <b>once</b> <b>{{reaching}}</b> 8,300 metres on the West Ridge and twice reaching the summit by the South Col route. With his first summit of Mount Everest in 1990, he and Sir Edmund became the first father and son to achieve the feat. His second ascent in May 2002 {{was part of a}} National Geographic Society expedition to mark the 50th anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay's historic first ascent in 1953. The anniversary expedition brought together Peter Hillary, Jamling Norgay and Brent Bishop, the sons of Sir Edmund, Tenzing Norgay, and Dr Barry Bishop, a member of the first successful American team to reach the summit in 1963. The 1990 expedition was led by veteran Everest climber Pete Athans, who holds the record for the most summits of Everest by a Western climber.|$|E

500|$|Cleveland {{shut out}} the Colts 28â€“0 in the third game of the regular season. The team scored three of its four touchdowns {{in the first quarter}} in a span of 12 plays. Two of those touchdowns came on runs, one by Motley and the other by Bill Boedeker; the third was a Colella {{interception}} returned for a score. The Browns' fourth touchdown, a short run by Bob Cowan, came {{at the end of the}} second quarter. Cleveland was helped by strong punting from Horace Gillom, who had a 55.7-yard average for the game, including punts of 85 and 80 yards. Graham was taken out of the game in the first half along with most of the team's first-string players. Bud Schwenk substituted at quarterback later in the game, but the team did not score in the second half. Baltimore had two opportunities to score, <b>once</b> <b>reaching</b> the Browns' four-yard line, but the Cleveland defense held. The victory made the Browns the only undefeated team in the AAFC after the San Francisco 49ers lost to the New York Yankees ...|$|E
500|$|Trescothick {{really came}} into his own on the winter tour of India in 2001. The three-Test series saw him {{averaging}} 48.00, with a highest score of 99. He was England's best batsman in the ODI series, averaging 53.00 with a strike rate of over 100. He scored a century in the first ODI, although England lost by 22 runs. He established a reputation for keeping his composure {{while the rest of}} the team were failing; at this point, none of Trescothick's four international centuries had resulted in an England win. He was also man-of-the-match in the final ODI, setting up an England victory, with 95 runs from 80 balls. This tour established Trescothick's reputation as one of England's best batsmen against spin bowling: according to David Gower, he was [...] "judging line and length very well". Indian Cricket named him one of their five Cricketers of the Year for 2002. The following tour of New Zealand was less successful for Trescothick, only <b>once</b> <b>reaching</b> double figures in a poor ODI series, coupled with an average Test match performance.|$|E

After the short brake run the train drops down into the ravine, raising into a bunny hop hill, then into another bunny hop and into the final clockwise helix of 323Â°. After the final helix, the train passes over the Rivertown midway a second time and drops into the splashdown finale, slowing the train down and leading it into the final brake run. After braking, the train takes a left U-turn and heads back into the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 3 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Lecourbe {{made several}} feints {{on the bridge}} at Dillingheim, but his {{reconnaissance}} suggested instead that he focus on the bridges at Gremsheim, Blindheim and HÃ¶chstÃ¤dt, which he did the next day. [...] A small group of 80 or so men from the 94th Demi-Brigade managed a spectacular crossing of the river. [...] After stripping their clothing and weapons, and loading them into a small raft, the naked men swam the river, pulling their weapons on rafts behind them.
