5|$|A {{petition}} {{was filed}} by King David Kalakaua and his sisters and brother-in-law, Lydia K. Dominis, Miriam K.

While the Justices {{felt that the}} claim of Kalakaua and his sisters had not been proven, they were impressed with that of Kilinahe (Kanaʻina's first cousin) and other claimants based on testimony and witnesses. The court decreed that the estate be split into four equal shares: <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> to go to Haalilio (k), Haalelea (k) and Kahukaiola (k); <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> each to Pahua (w) and Kaahua (k); and <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> to the widow and children of Kilinahe, who had died before the adjudication of his claim.|$|E
