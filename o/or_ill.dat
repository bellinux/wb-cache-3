Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida, (1930s) and Cuba (1940s and 1950s), and in 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where he killed himself in mid-1961.|$|E
5|$|On the five-Test Indian series which followed, O'Neill started slowly, {{aggregating}} 60 runs in {{the first}} two Tests, which were shared 1–1. He returned to form with a leg-side dominated 163 in a high-scoring draw in the Third Test at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay. After scoring 40 in an innings victory in the Fourth Test in Madras, Australia needed a draw in the Fifth Test in Calcutta with four players injured <b>or</b> <b>ill,</b> while Benaud had a dislocated spinning finger. O'Neill scored 113 in the first innings to help a depleted team take a 137-run first innings lead and prevent India from squaring the series. He was Australia's leading scorer in the Tests, with 376 runs at 62.66. He also made his highest first-class score of 284, against an Indian President's XI in Ahmedabad. He was the top scorer for the whole subcontinental Test tour, with 594 runs in eight matches at 66.00.|$|E
5|$|Tito came to Drvar {{at the end}} of January 1943, {{during a}} major Axis {{offensive}} against the Partisans (code-named Fall Weiss in German). After consulting with Đuro Pucar, the head of the KPJ regional committee for Bosanska Krajina, Tito decided to form a Partisan brigade around a battalion of experienced fighters from Drvar. Additional manpower would consist of recovered Partisans who had been wounded <b>or</b> <b>ill,</b> older men not previously in combat units and young male and female volunteers. The four-battalion 10th Krajina Brigade, intended to play a primarily-defensive role at this stage, was established on 4February 1943; its 800 members included about 120 women. Bursać, one of the volunteers, was assigned to the 2nd Battalion and was transferred to the 3rd Battalion's 3rd Company the following month. Until September 1943, she fought the Ustaše, Germans, Italians, and anti-communist Chetniks around Grahovo, Knin, Vrlika, Livno and Mount Dinara, was commended for her courage and skill in combat, and served as a nurse. In February and March 1943, during the Axis offensive, the brigade experienced constant enemy attacks, food shortages, cold, deep snow and outbreaks of typhus. Emaciated, Bursać was transferred to the military kitchen at brigade headquarters at the beginning of spring; after a month, she was returned to her company at her insistence. When she became ill some time later, Bursać was sent home to recover.|$|E

5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good <b>or</b> <b>ill,</b> were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E

25|$|Due to the Horn of Africa's {{semi-arid}} and arid climate, droughts are not uncommon. They {{are complicated}} by {{climate change and}} changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's pastoral groups have observed careful rangeland management practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young <b>or</b> <b>ill</b> animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983–85, 1991–92, 1998–99 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population. Initiatives by ECHO and USAID have succeeded in reclaiming hundreds of hectares of pastureland through rangeland management, leading {{to the establishment of}} the Dikale Rangeland in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The Avenger's rate of {{fire was}} {{originally}} selectable, 2,100 rounds per minute (rpm) in the low setting, or 4,200 rpm in the high setting. Later this was changed to a fixed rate of 3,900 rpm. In practice, the cannon is limited to one and two-second bursts to avoid overheating and conserve ammunition; barrel life is also a factor, since the USAF has specified a minimum life of at least 20,000 rounds for each set of barrels. There is no technical limitation on the duration the gun may be continuously fired, and a pilot could potentially expend the entire ammunition load in a single burst with no damage <b>or</b> <b>ill</b> effects to the weapons system itself. However, this constant {{rate of fire}} would shorten the barrel life considerably and require added barrel inspections and result in shorter intervals between replacement.|$|E

40|$|Suresh Durgam, 1 Changzheng Chen, 1 Carl P Gommoll, 1 John Edwards, 1 Leslie Citrome 2 1 Allergan, Jersey City, NJ, USA; 2 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA Background: In three 8 -week {{studies of}} vilazodone 40  mg/d (NCT 00285376, NCT 00683592, and NCT 01473394) and a 10 -week study of vilazodone 20 or 40  mg/d (NCT 01473381), adults with major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) showed significantly greater improvement with vilazodone versus placebo in global disease severity as measured by mean change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score. To assess the proportion of patients achieving clinically meaningful improvement, a post hoc pooled analysis was conducted using categorical shifts in disease severity based on CGI-S scores at baseline and end of treatment (EOT). Methods: Analyses were conducted in the pooled intent-to-treat population (N= 2, 218). Definitions of categorical shifts included CGI-S ≥ 4 (moderately <b>ill</b> <b>or</b> worse) at baseline to CGI-S ≤ 2 (normal <b>or</b> borderline <b>ill)</b> at EOT; CGI-S ≥ 5 (markedly <b>ill</b> <b>or</b> worse) at baseline to CGI-S ≤ 2 at EOT; and CGI-S ≥ 6 (severely <b>ill</b> <b>or</b> worse) at baseline to CGI-S ≤ 3 (mildly <b>ill</b> <b>or</b> better) at EOT. Results: At baseline, 2, 217 patients were moderately <b>ill</b> <b>or</b> worse. The percentage who improved to normal <b>or</b> borderline <b>ill</b> was significantly higher with vilazodone than with placebo (40. 0 % versus 27. 8 %; odds ratio [OR] = 1. 7, P< 0. 001; number needed to treat [NNT] = 9). In the 979 patients who were markedly <b>ill</b> <b>or</b> worse at baseline, the percentage who improved to normal <b>or</b> borderline <b>ill</b> was significantly higher with vilazodone than with placebo (36. 8 % versus 25. 5 %; OR = 1. 7, P< 0. 001; NNT = 9). The small number of severely ill patients at baseline (n = 43) provided inadequate power to detect statistically significant between-group differences, but an NNT = 5 was found for improvement to mildly <b>ill</b> <b>or</b> better. Conclusion: Categorical shift analyses, defined using baseline and EOT CGI-S scores, showed that significantly higher proportions of patients had clinically meaningful improvements in global disease severity with vilazodone 20 – 40  mg/d versus placebo. This type of analysis may be useful for evaluating the effects of antidepressant treatment in adults with MDD. Keywords: depression, antidepressant, global improvement, clinical tria...|$|R
