Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced with a feeling for the tradition's roots.|$|E

5|$|March {{was more}} {{successful}} in selling large numbers <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> cars in the lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season, rather than buying them outright. Losing money on a deal to supply Jochen Neerpasch, then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula Two car paid off when Neerpasch moved to BMW and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW's Formula Two engine for the 1973 season. March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships. However, BMW also put pressure on Herd {{to concentrate on the}} Formula Two programme. As a result, he spent less time with the Formula One team, where Mosley started to act as a race engineer.|$|E
5|$|The provincial {{judiciary}} {{launched an}} investigation into the circumstances surrounding the explosion. The prosecution conducted a search and seizure at the offices of Litoral Gas to confirm the absence <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> complaints about the gas leak. Judge Juan Carlos Curto ordered the arrest of Carlos Osvaldo García, an employee of the department responsible for gas service to the area. He was captured during the night, and his assistant Pablo Miño surrendered to police the following day. According to witnesses, one employee fled in a van before the explosion, when he realized the severity of the gas leak, while another remained to try to evacuate people from the endangered area. The van belonged to García, who experienced an acute stress reaction during the trial. Curto checked the remnants of the gas employee's workshop to verify García's testimony.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In business, the {{customer}} as capital {{is not a}} new idea, but scientific literature has only recently begun to explore the topic in depth. Increasingly, studies are focusing on consumers as <b>customers</b> <b>of</b> enterprises. Attempts to measure the value <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> for the company have a short history and a single approach has not yet been worked out. On the basis of literature on the subject and practical approaches, this study presents several ways to measure the value <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> for the company. Strategies for the management <b>of</b> value for <b>customers,</b> with the aim of providing higher value <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> for the company, are a critical part of the operation of enterprises. Therefore, the aim of this work is to attempt to present a model for increasing the value <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> for the company through relationship marketing. The work also reveals mechanisms for increasing the value <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> with the use of modern information technology.

The Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 had shocked potential buyers, and public concern over the environmental issues presented by a supersonic aircraft– the sonic boom, take-off noise and pollution– had produced a shift in public opinion of SSTs. By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers: Britain, France, China, and Iran. Only Air France and British Airways (the successor to BOAC) took up their orders, with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made.|$|E
