Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window.

5|$|Waters {{followed}} Roman Candles {{with a third}} short film, Eat Your Makeup (1968), {{in which}} Divine once more wore drag, this time to portray a fictionalized version of Jackie Kennedy, the widow of recently assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy. In the film, she turns to kidnapping models and forcing them to eat their own makeup.

Not long after, in the summer of 1968, he moved out of his parental home, renting his <b>own</b> <b>apartment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients.

In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England.
