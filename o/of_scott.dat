5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> that he liked to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The loss <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> and {{his party}} overshadowed all else in the British public's mind, {{including}} Amundsen's feat in being first at the Pole. For many years the image <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> as a tragic hero, beyond reproach, remained virtually unchallenged, for although there were rifts among some who were close to the expedition, including relatives of those who died, this disharmony was not public. There was no real change in public perceptions until the 1970s, by which time nearly all those directly concerned with the expedition were dead.|$|E

5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream {{with some}} {{wetlands}} in its watershed. Its relatively narrow watershed occupies parts <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> Township, Blakely, Archbald, and Dickson City. Several flooding events have occurred on Hull Creek.

Macroinvertebrate taxa such as mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), and caddis flies (Trichoptera) inhabit the creek as well.|$|E

The Rays have failed to sign one of their first-round picks, LeVon Washington (2009), a client <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> Boras who could not come to an agreed contract with the team.

However, the negotiators could not secure a general amnesty for the provisional government.|$|E

5|$|The expedition's {{success was}} widely applauded, though {{the story of}} Scott's heroic failure overshadowed its {{achievement}} in the United Kingdom. Amundsen's decision to keep his true plans secret until the last moment was criticised by some. Recent polar historians have more fully recognised the skill and courage of Amundsen's party; the permanent scientific base at the pole bears his name, together with that <b>of</b> <b>Scott.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) under the supervision <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> Farrar (who served as visual effects cameraman on the first three Star Trek films) and animator Wes Takahashi. After receiving the script, ILM created storyboards for the effects sequences before meeting Meyer and producers Winter and Steven-Charles Jaffe to discuss the planned scenes. These discussions began before the film was greenlit. ILM's initial cost estimates were over Paramount's budget, so to save money the filmmakers redesigned some shots and outsourced some to other companies.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E

50|$|The {{inclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>Scott's</b> name in {{the award}} has been controversial because <b>of</b> <b>Scott's</b> actions as a Canadian government official supervising Indian affairs for many years.

5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E
5|$|Bessell, {{anxious to}} be of service to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a {{sympathetic}} Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman, who believed {{that at least some}} of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, why had he flown all the way from London to deal with them? Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card. He also hinted at the possibility of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards—although, according to Josiffe, letters implicating Thorpe had been removed. For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely quiescent in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name <b>of</b> <b>Scott.</b>|$|E
5|$|Collectors {{tend to use}} the {{catalogues}} {{produced in}} their own region and language, so in the United States, Scott is used most often {{as evidenced by the}} use <b>of</b> <b>Scott</b> numbers in American stamp auction catalogues. In contrast, SG numbers are used in England and Ireland because Stanley Gibbons (a British publisher) produces the catalogue of choice in those countries. Advanced and more specialist collectors have used the David Feldman, later called MacDonnell/Feldman, and later again called MacDonnellWhyte, catalogues between 1978 and 1991, and Hibernian catalogues (1972, 1976, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986, 2002 and 2009 editions).|$|E
