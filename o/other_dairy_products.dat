40|$|Conference Theme: Changing populations, {{changing}} diseases: Epidemiology for Tomorrow’s WorldFree papers: 1. 5 Chronic Disease: NutritionThis journal suppl. contain programme and abstracts of the IEA World Congress of Epidemiology, 2011 Introduction Observational studies, {{mainly from}} western populations, suggest that <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> consumption is inversely associated with adiposity. However, in such populations, {{there is a}} limited range of <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> intake while dietary intake and obesity share social patterning making evidence from non-western developed settings valuable in distinguishing whether the observed associations are biologically mediated or socially confounded. Methods We used multivariable linear regression to examine the adjusted association of the frequency of milk or <b>other</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> consumption at 11  years with clinically measured body mass index (BMI) z-scores at about 13  years, relative to the 2007 WHO growth reference in a large (n= 8327), population-representative Chinese birth cohort, comprising 88 % of all births in Hong Kong in April and May 1997. Results Of the original 8327 cohort members, 7933 are alive, participating and living in Hong Kong. At approximately 13  years, 7488 had clinically assessed BMI. Socio-economic position was positively associated with frequency of milk and <b>other</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> consumption. Neither milk nor <b>other</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> consumption was associated with BMI z-score (milk − 0. 02, 95 % CI − 0. 06 to 0. 03 and <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> 0. 03, 95 % CI − 0. 01 to 0. 07), adjusted for sex, mother's birthplace, highest parental education, pubertal stage, physical activity and other food consumption. Conclusions In a non-western setting, milk and <b>other</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> consumption {{was not associated with}} adiposity, suggesting that any observed anti-obesigenic effects in western settings may be due to socially patterned confounding by socio-economic position. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the growth and future scale of artisan <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> The purpose {{of this paper is to}} analyze why there has been such a great demand for artisan <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> how they are produced, and the promotion and scale of the specialty <b>dairy</b> industry <b>product</b> production. The review begins with a brief discussion on the different terms used for specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Followed by the introduction is history of the dairy industry and its growth and change over many, many years. <b>Dairy</b> <b>products</b> have been around longer than they have actually been recorded. As the population increased so did the production of <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> In 1850, the production of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in American was larger than any other country. The first major increase in the distribution and consumption of milk happened from approximately 1870 - 1950. With the development of the centrifugal cream separator by Alfred de Laval, and soon after the factory system of production was established. With the big industrial push came the escalated production of commodity products produced in a large scale by machinery. In the past few decades the United States consumers have been pushing away from the commodity dairy processing industry and are interested in the smaller scale specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Many more <b>dairy</b> producers and processors have been converting over to either shipping their milk to processors to make specialty products or use their own milk to produce artisan and farmstead <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Some of the specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> produced are a variety of different cheeses, yogurt, butter, and bottled milk. Specialty cheese is by far produced on the largest scale compared to any <b>other</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product.</b> Specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> especially specialty and artisan cheese, have increased production substantially in the last few decades. The production of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> has grown due to various factors. According to the California Milk Advisory Board, specialty cheese consumption has increased five times faster than the total cheese consumption in the past ten years. In 2003, the CMAB recorded that the United States specialty cheese production totaled 815 million pounds with an estimated value of $ 6. 4 billion. Recently, the specialty cheese category in the dairy industry is a major factor driving the sales of United States cheese production. The specialty dairy industry is growing due to many different areas. Some reasons of the growth of the specialty cheese market are: that Americans are wanting more variety and flavor in their food, Americans are traveling abroad and wanting the unique flavor of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> that they have had in other countries, the growth of ethnic groups and their ethnic food, and the greater availability to a variety of different and unique cheeses. Other areas of growth include specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> used in food services, restaurants, farmer’s markets, supermarkets, and ingredients in prepared foods. Although the specialty dairy industry has been increasingly growing over the years a big question is whether it is profitable to an on-farm processor and specialty processor to produce value- added specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> On-farm processing is very difficult to manage because of both the farm and the processing plan, and the expenses that go along with it. Many considerations and evaluations need to be analyzed before making the commitment of producing specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> There is value in the production of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> but many factors and variables need to be considered because, many risk arise in the production of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> also...|$|R
