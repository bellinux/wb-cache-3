5|$|An <b>occluded</b> {{front is}} formed {{during the process}} of {{cyclogenesis}} when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an <b>occluded</b> front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. <b>Occluded</b> fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. <b>Occluded</b> fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

Eighty-four patients (79 men, 5 women; age range 60 - 95 yr; mean age, 76 yr) with aortoiliac aneurysms underwent endovascular stent-graft repair. The repair consisted of a stent-graft extending from the abdominal aorta to the iliac or common femoral artery, a cross-femoral bypass graft, and an endovascular arterial <b>occluder</b> device within the contralateral common iliac artery. The <b>occluder</b> device consisted of a 5 -cm segment of 6 -mm diameter polytetraflu-oroethylene (PTFE) graft with a purse-string suture <b>occluding</b> the leading end and a Palmaz stent sutured to the trailing end. The <b>occluder</b> device was delivered through a 1 7 F catheter via an arteriotomy. Eighty-three of the 84 patients received aortic endografts.

5|$|Early on October26, a {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} central Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into Hurricane Juan while meandering northward. The storm had a large wind field and was somewhat subtropical in nature. Due to weak steering currents, Juan looped once offshore Louisiana and later looped again over the state, weakening into {{a tropical}} storm over land on October29. The storm turned eastward and later northeastward, striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October31. Juan turned to the north over land and became extratropical on November1 over Tennessee. After the remnants of Juan continued to the north into Canada, it spawned an <b>occluded</b> low in the Tennessee Valley. This low continued to the east through North Carolina, bringing moderate rainfall throughout the region, and saturating soils; overcast skies and the weak sunlight of early November prevented much of the rains from evaporating.|$|E
5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely <b>occluded</b> vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E

Over the following two days, the system executed a counter-clockwise loop near the Azores.

Although the storm was tropical at this time, the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is <b>occluded,</b> slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the <b>occluder</b> approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the <b>occluder</b> and the valve housing causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve <b>occluder</b> as it contacts the valve housing. This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential lip of the <b>occluder</b> whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the <b>occlude</b> housing.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To apply three {{dimensional}} echocardiography {{to describe}} the geometric profile of the Amplatzer and Cardioseal occluders after deployment for closure of atrial septal defect.  METHODS— 20 patients (mean (SD) age, 14  (5) years) were enrolled for transcatheter closure of a secundum atrial septal defect with the Amplatzer <b>occluder</b> (10) or with the Cardioseal <b>occluder</b> (10). The two populations were matched for the stretched diameter of the defect (mean 18  (6) mm). The profile of the two occluders was examined.  RESULTS—Transoesophageal echocardiography did not show any residual shunts after Amplatzer <b>occluder</b> deployment, whereas three patients had a small residual leak after Cardioseal deployment. One patient had transient atrioventricular block with the Amplatzer device. The mean surface area of the Amplatzer <b>occluder</b> was 6. 9  (2)  cm 2, {{and that of the}} Cardioseal device 5. 4  (3)  cm 2 (p =  0. 03). The mean volume of the Amplatzer <b>occluder</b> was 9. 2  (1)  cm 3, while that of the Cardioseal <b>occluder</b> was 3. 5  (1)  cm 3 (p <  0. 0001). From the three dimensional views, the Cardioseal <b>occluder</b> looked like a flat square after deployment whereas the Amplatzer <b>occluder</b> took up a ball shape in the atrial cavity.  CONCLUSIONS—Three dimensional views by multiplane transoesophageal echocardiography allow a realistic in vivo description of atrial septal occluders. The Amplatzer <b>occluder,</b> with its high geometric profile, allows complete closure of large atrial septal defects but with some risk of mechanical complications. Use of the Cardioseal device, with its small surface coverage and high residual shunt rate, should be limited to transcatheter closure of a patent foramen ovale or small atrial septal defects.    Keywords: atrial septal occluder; three dimensional echocardiograph...|$|R
5000|$|A pinhole <b>occluder</b> is an opaque disk {{with one}} or more small holes through it, used by ophthalmologists, orthoptists and optometrists to test visual acuity. The <b>occluder</b> is a simple way to focus light, as in a pinhole camera, {{temporarily}} removing the effects of refractive errors such as myopia. Because light passes only {{through the center of the}} eye's lens, defects in the shape of the lens (errors of refraction) have no effect while the <b>occluder</b> is used. In this way the ophthalmologist, orthoptist or optometrist can estimate the maximum improvement in a patient's vision that can be attained by lenses to correct errors of refraction. [...] This can be used to distinguish visual defects caused by refractive error, which improve when the <b>occluder</b> is used, from other problems, which do not. The pinhole <b>occluder</b> can also be used in testing visual acuity in mydriatic patients.

40|$|Objective: Off-pump trans left {{ventricular}} approach provides more precise deployment of stented aortic valve {{of any size}} {{with respect to the}} endovascular replacement. One of the key steps of this procedure is the ventricle repair after catheter withdrawing. We designed an animal study to compare the consistency of a sutureless repair of the left ventricle access using nitinol <b>occluder</b> with and without pericardial cuff on the ventricular side. Methods: Material description: The Amplatz-nitinol <b>occluder</b> consists of two square heads squeezing ventricle wall in between them, sealing the defect. To improve its sealing property, a pericardial patch was sutured to the ventricular head of the <b>occluder.</b> Animal study setup: In adult pigs, a 30 F sheath was inserted into the epigastric area through the cardiac apex, up to the left ventricle, simulating the approach for off-pump aortic valve replacement. The sheath was then removed and the ventricle closed with standard <b>occluder</b> in half of the animals, and cuffed <b>occluder</b> in the other half. Animals were followed-up for 3 h, collecting haemodynamics data and pericardial bleeding. Results: Device was successfully deployed in 12 animals in less than 1 min. In the group where the standard <b>occluder</b> was used, bleeding during the deployment was 80 ± 20 ml and after the deployment was 800 ± 20 ml over 3 h. In the group where the cuffed <b>occluder</b> was used, bleeding during the deployment was 85 ± 20 ml and after the deployment was 100 ± 5 ml over 3 h.

40|$|Abstract Introduction The Amplatzer septal <b>occluder</b> is {{frequently}} used for percutaneous closure of an atrial septal defect. Complications include thrombosis and embolism, dislocation, cardiac perforation, and, rarely, infection. We report {{the case of}} a patient who had survived an occluder-related thromboembolism two years previously. Case presentation A 72 -year-old Caucasian woman had received a septal <b>occluder</b> because of an atrial septal defect seven years ago. Two years ago, she underwent chemotherapy of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma, developed atrial fibrillation, and experienced a left-sided <b>occluder</b> thrombosis with stroke and peripheral embolism. Now, she presented with cerebral lymphoma, received glucocorticoids, and subsequently developed skin lesions. Swabs from the lesions and blood cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Endocarditis, however, was considered only two months later and echocardiography suggested aortic valve endocarditis. Despite antibiotic therapy, she died three days later because of septicemia, and no post-mortem investigation was carried out. It remains uncertain whether the septal <b>occluder</b> was endothelialized or infected and whether explantation might have changed the outcome. Conclusions If infections occur in patients with a septal <b>occluder,</b> endocarditis should be considered and echocardiography should be performed early. To prevent a fatal outcome, explantation of the septal <b>occluder</b> should be considered, especially in patients with problems that suggest delayed endothelialization. Post-mortem investigations, including bacteriologic studies, should be carried out in patients with a septal <b>occluder</b> in order to assess the focal and global long-term effects of these devices. </p...|$|R
