25|$|The Chanel {{wristwatch}} {{division was}} established in 1987. In 1995, division presented a second design, the Matelassé. Although the Première and Matelassé wristwatches were successful products, the presentation, in 2000, of the Chanel J12 line of unisex style wristwatches, made <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials,</b> established Chanel wristwatches as a Chanel marque. The J12 line of wristwatches features models in four dial-face sizes: (i) 33mm., (ii) 38mm., (iii) 41mm., and (iv) 42mm. In 2008, Chanel S.A. and Audemars Piguet developed the ceramic Chanel AP-3125 clockwork, exclusive to the House of Chanel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{deals with}} {{calculation}} of the parameters <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> from a set of destruction tests <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> heads <b>of</b> total hip joint endoprosthesis. The standard way of {{calculation of the}} material parameters consists in carrying out a set of 3 or 4 point bending tests of specimens cut out from parts <b>of</b> the <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> to be analysed. In case <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> heads, {{it is not possible}} to cut out specimens of required dimensions because the heads are too small (if the cut out specimens were smaller than the normalised ones, the material parameters derived from them would exhibit higher strength values than those which the given <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> really has). On that score, a special testing jig was made, in which 40 heads were destructed. From the measured values of circumferential strains of the head’s external spherical surface under destruction, the state of stress in the head under destruction was established using the final elements method (FEM). From the values obtained, the sought for parameters <b>of</b> the <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> were calculated using Weibull’s weakest-link theory.

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{behavior of}} cellular materials is determinded by the type <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>material,</b> the amount <b>of</b> pores / cells, the specific pore features, {{and the general}} cellular structure. The dielectric properties mainly depend on the volume fraction of pores and cells and the type <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>material.</b> This causes exclusively {{a decrease in the}} dielectric constant in comparison to dense materials. Models of electric properties are related to models of other properties like Young's modulus or thermal conduction, which are based on more extensive work than those of electrical phenomena. Since the manufacture of cellular materials often differs from conventional ceramics the material properties have to be considered specifically for modeling. Honeycombs, foams, and biomimetic materials can be used for numerous specific applications which include electrical features. Some examples were given in this chapter...|$|R
50|$|These {{materials}} do show plastic deformation. However, due to {{the rigid}} structure of the crystalline materials, {{there are very few}} available slip systems for dislocations to move, and so they deform very slowly. With the non-crystalline (glassy) materials, viscous flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation, and is also very slow. It is therefore neglected in many applications <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many technical, still {{unresolved}} difficulties {{arise in}} the forming process <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials.</b> In fact, if on one hand the compact should result intact after ejection, should be handleable without failure and essentially free of macro defects, on the other hand, defects of various nature are always present in the green bodies, negatively affecting local shrinkage during sintering, Fig. 1.|$|E
50|$|The {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials,</b> {{like all}} materials, are {{dictated by the}} types of atoms present, the types of bonding between the atoms, {{and the way the}} atoms are packed together.

50|$|The special {{character}} <b>of</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials</b> {{gives rise to}} many applications in materials engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering.
