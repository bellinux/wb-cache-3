The outstanding feature of <b>our</b> <b>policy</b> is that it takes account of pre-loaded services, ones for which process allocation has already been determined before the newly arrived service. In other words, <b>our</b> <b>policy</b> tries to keep the performance of the pre-loaded services at a desirable level while the newly arrived service processes are loaded and run. We measured the response time and the throughput when the process allocation is determined using <b>our</b> <b>policy,</b> and we compared them with those <b>our</b> <b>policy</b> estimates.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{classical}} single-item inventory {{system in which}} unsatisfied demands are backlogged. Replenishment lead times are random, independent identically distributed, causing orders to cross in time. We develop a new inventory policy to exploit implications of lead time randomness and order crossover, and evaluate its performance by asymptotic analysis and simulations. <b>Our</b> <b>policy</b> does not follow the basic principle of Constant Base Stock (CBS) policy, or more generally, (s,S) and (r,Q) policies, which {{is to keep the}} inventory position within a fixed range. Instead, it uses the current inventory level (= inventory-on-hand minus backlog) to set a dynamic target for inventory in-transit, and place orders to follow this target. <b>Our</b> <b>policy</b> includes CBS policy as a special case, under a particular choice of a policy parameter. We show that <b>our</b> <b>policy</b> can significantly reduce the average inventory cost compared with CBS policy. Specifically, we prove that if the lead time is exponentially distributed, then under <b>our</b> <b>policy,</b> with properly chosen policy parameters, the expected (absolute) inventory level scales as o(√(r)), as the demand rate r→∞. In comparison, it is known to scale as O(√(r)) under CBS policy. In particular, this means that, as r→∞, the average inventory cost under <b>our</b> <b>policy</b> vanishes in comparison with that under CBS <b>policy.</b> Furthermore, <b>our</b> simulations show that the advantage of <b>our</b> <b>policy</b> remains to be substantial under non-exponential lead time distributions, and may even be greater than under exponential distribution.

In response, David Cameron said that he “profoundly disagreed” with Williams's claim that the government was forcing through “radical policies for which no one voted”. Cameron said that the government was acting in a “good and moral” fashion and defended the “Big Society” and the Coalition’s deficit reduction, welfare and education plans. “I am absolutely convinced that <b>our</b> <b>policies</b> are about actually giving people a greater responsibility and greater chances in their life, and I will defend those very vigorously”, he said. “By all means let us have a robust debate but I can tell you, it will always be a two-sided debate.” ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change <b>our</b> <b>policies</b> in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food.
