40|$|The {{geometric}} {{shape of}} a dental implant {{plays an important role}} on the <b>osteo-integration</b> process. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study the biomechanical behavior of different commercial dental implants and to analyse how thread profile may affect the stress concentration and distribution. Three different commercially-available dental implants were considered and acquired by means of a no-contact reverse engineering system. Stresses at bone–implant interface, in presence of perfect and not-perfect <b>osteo-integration,</b> were numerically evaluated by means of finite element (FEM) analyses applying occlusal and lateral loads. The results show more dangerous stresses at implant–bone interface in the case of not-perfect <b>osteo-integration</b> and stresses gradient enough uniform around the threads in the case of <b>osteo-integration.</b> In particular, the implant with the lowest thread-pitch exhibits the lowest bone damage. This confirms the crucial role of the geometric shape of the implant to reduce bone induced stresses and bone damage. The structural and functional connection between living bone and implant is a key issue in implantology field. When a guest device is installed in the living bone, many clinical responses may arise, such as inflammatory processes or <b>osteo-integration</b> failure. The results of this study can give useful information to understand the influence of the implant features and to appropriately apply it in the science of dental implants with the aim to reduce the potential implant failure. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{success of}} any orthopaedic implant {{is dependent upon}} {{the interaction between the}} implant surface and the respective bone tissue, termed <b>osteo-integration.</b> However, current orthopaedic implants are still limited in effectiveness by the lack of appropriate cell adhesion and <b>osteo-integration</b> due to the intervention of fibrous tissue, leading to implant dislocation, premature loosening and consequently a reduced implant lifespan. Titanium (Ti) and its alloys, which have favourable mechanical properties, superior corrosion resistance and excellent biocompatibility, have been widely investigated for use in orthopaedic implants, but yet fail to achieve exemplary clinical results due to poor <b>osteo-integration.</b> To address these limitations, we investigated and assessed the modification of Ti oxide surface structures by introducing nanotopographical features that mimic the physiological hierarchical nanostructures of natural bone tissue to impart enhanced <b>osteo-integration.</b> Titania (TiO 2) nanofiber/nanowire arrays, fabricated by a simple thermal oxidation technique, provide an interface that is capable of promoting <b>osteo-integration</b> similar to native bone tissue. In this study, we focus on the fabrication of in situ titania nanofiber/nanowire arrays via a thermal oxidation technique, and the clinical feasibility of these nanostructured surfaces for various in vitro cellular behaviours. The outcomes of this work have been promising as these as-grown TiO 2 nanofibrous/nanowire surface structures resulted in enhanced cellular response of osteoblast, chondrocytes, and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). These evidences suggest an inexpensive and highly scalable means to fabricate TiO 2 nanofiber/nanowire arrays and demonstrate their potential use as a beneficial interface for orthopaedic implants...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{structural}} behaviour of a mandible with a dental implant, considering a unilateral occlusion, is numerically analysed {{by means of}} the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The mandible, whose CAD model was obtained by computer tomography scans, is considered as completely edentulous and only modelled in the zone surrounding the implant. The material behaviour of bone is assumed as isotropic linear elastic or, alternatively, as orthotropic linear elastic. With reference to the degree of <b>osteo-integration</b> between the implant and the mandibular bone, a partial <b>osteo-integration</b> is considered; consequently a nonlinear contact analysis is performed, with allowance for friction at the interface between implant and bone. A model of a commercial dental implant is digitised by means of optical 3 D scanning process and fully reconstructed in all its geometrical features. Special attention is drawn to the mathematical reconstruction of the CAD model in order to facilitate the meshing process in the BEM environment and reduce the geometrical imperfections generated during the CAD to CAE translation process. The results of FEM and BEM analyses in terms of stress distribution on the mandible are compared in order to benchmark the two methodologies against accuracy and pre-processing efforts. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Osteo-integration</b> {{and tissue}} {{regeneration}} are vital for the longevity, durability, and unremitting functionality of medical implants/scaffolds implanted in vivo. It’s essential for biomaterials used for in vivo implantation to induce the cellular secretion of growth factors, {{necessary for the}} desired tissue generation, since the administration of artificial growth factors, in vivo, is largely prohibited. Plasma functionalized (N 2 and O 2) and stabilized Graphene Oxide (GO) thin layers in a hybrid with amorphous carbon (aC) induced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) growth factors in fibroblasts (hGF) and, more remarkably, in osteoblasts (hFOB) cells confirming the suitability for tissue regeneration and <b>osteo-integration</b> applications. We also observed a negative trend between hGF fibroblasts, but not hFOB osteoblasts, cellular viability and GO presence in the hybrid films that might indicate the phenomenon of oxidative stress. We traced that back {{to the presence of}} higher concentrations of carboxyl and the carbonyl groups {{on the surface of the}} GO rich coatings. The above described properties provided by GO coatings might be desirable for bioselectivity applications and for the reduction of the undesired fibrosis process that is associated with medical implants in vivo environment.

40|$|Single energy X-ray imaging, {{due to its}} {{low cost}} and flexibility, {{is one of the}} most used and common {{technique}} to assess bone state and bone remodeling over time. Standardized X-ray images are needed to compare sets of radiographs for semi-quantitative analyses of tissue remodeling. However, useful mathematical modeling for the analysis of high level radiographic images are not easily available. In order to propose a useful evaluation tool to a wide clinical scenario, we present an innovative calibration algorithm for a semi-quantitative analysis of non-standardized digitized X-ray images. For calibration on a unique standardization scale, three time invariant regions (ROI) of radiographs were selected and analyzed. The accuracy of the normalization method for X-ray films was successfully validated by using an aluminum step wedge for routine X-ray exposures as tool to standardize serial radiographs (Pearson correlation test: R- 2 = 0. 96). This method was applied to investigate the progression of the new bone deposition within ceramic scaffolds used as osteoconductive substitute in large bone defects taking advantage of a large animal model. This innovative image-processing algorithm allowed the identification and semi-quantification of the bone matrix deposited within the implant.

40|$|Introduction: The {{most common}} {{indication}} for application of implants {{is the total}} lack of teeth {{in order to obtain}} a stable fixed prosthetic construction which will result in maximum aesthetic and functional effect. ROOTT IMPLANT system is simple to use and offers good solutions that is supported by reliable therapeutic cases. As such, it offers three types of implants depending on the function that has to be performed and the condition of the teeth. Objective: Application of ROOTT IMPLANT system in total lack of teeth in the lower jaw. Case: Patient at age 65 with total lack of teeth in the lower jaw and mobile denture in the upper jaw that has been done several years ago was received. An orthopantomographic picture and plan appropriate to the condition of the mandible were made. In accordance with the results of the measurements it is decided to be applied insertion of 6 implants of compressive type of implants in order to be burdened prostheticaly. Placing the implants was done in one visit of the patient and an imprint for making metal-ceramic construction was also taken. A control panoramic image with the already implied implants was made and a good <b>osteo-integration</b> was noticed on the image. The patient is scheduled for seven days to make the metal sample for the fixed structure, and after two days a finished metal-ceramic construction was given. The patient is observed in certain intervals, and there are no visible changes. Conclusion: The use of compressive implants from the ROOTT IMPLANT system is simple for the therapist and the patient and it offers good results. The patient is monitored and there is visible excellent <b>osteo-integration</b> of the implants, and there is a re-scedueled control after 6 months. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} an elastic-static {{analysis}} is developed {{in order to}} assess how the masticatory loads, applied on a system of multiple independent implants in a mandible, are transferred to the trigeminal nerve. The simulation is based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and consider a perfect <b>osteo-integration</b> between implant and bone (continuity condition for traction and displacement at the implant-bone interface). The analysis considers the mandible segment containing two adjacent implants at different distances, each one loaded with a vertical load. Both the cortical and spongy bone are modeled as transversally isotropic. A non linear contact analysis is needed in order to properly model the nerve-canal interactions. The results obtained show the pressure on the trigeminal nerve against a varying distance between implants. Such information is useful for a correct surgical planning...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Successful {{management}} of large bone defects is of crucial importance when performing revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Trabecular tantalum cones may improve prosthesis fixation via {{their potential for}} reconstructing a stable metaphyseal support. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes and the complications of tantalum cones in revision TKA. Hypothesis: Trabecular tantalum cones provide stable and durable metaphyseal reconstruction when used during revision TKA. Material and methods: Trabecular Metal (TM) cones (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) were used for 52 revision TKAs in 51 patients (mean age, 68 +/- 9 years) managed in two centres between 2008 and 2013. A rotating hinge prosthesis was chosen for 38 (73 %) knees and a condylar constrained knee prosthesis for 14 (27 %) knees, with 37 tibial and 34 femoral cones. The two most common reasons for revision surgery were aseptic loosening (n= 22, 42 %) and infection (n= 19, 37 %). The bone loss was severe in most cases. At each centre, after a mean follow-up of 34 months (range, 24 - 52 months), two independent observers assessed the Knee Society Score (KSS), range of motion, mechanical axis, and <b>osteo-integration</b> for each patient. Results: Mean KSS increased from 46 preoperatively to 77 (P= 0. 001) at last follow-up and the mean KSS function from 39 to 57 (P= 0. 007). Mean range of motion improved from 93 degrees (45 degrees- 120 degrees) to 110 (65 degrees- 130 degrees) (P= 0. 001). Mean postoperative mechanical axis was 180 degrees (172 degrees- 190 degrees). Radiographic evaluation showed evidence of <b>osteo-integration</b> for all cones. Four revisions were performed for recurrence of infection but none for mechanical failure. Discussion: The findings of our study confirm the biomechanical and biological reliability of Trabecular Metal (TM) cones used to fill metaphyseal bone defects during revision TKA.

Patients affected by Osteoporosis and undergoing Biphosfonate thera-pies that need any oral surgery in general, and implant treatment in particular, could be considered as more risky patients compared with normal patients, but once again not much data is available.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the number of hip arthroplasties is {{constantly}} increased, and an incessant growing demand is expected for the next decades. Considering the increased life expectancy for elderly patients and a larger extension of surgical indications in younger adults, {{the need for an}} appropriate implant choice is now emphasized. Long-term survival implants which can satisfy current patients’ high physical demands are required. Thus, in order to avoid high revision rates of cemented implants described for young and active patients, orthopaedic surgeons’ attention has been focusing on materials used for primary (mechanical) and secondary stability (<b>osteo-integration</b> of components) through the concept of “biological fixation”. The process of bonding osteogenesis in prosthesis using biological fixation could enable a stability which resembles permanent physiological union after fractures in healthy cancellous bone. Hydroxyapatite coating on femoral component of uncemented total hip arthroplasty was proposed {{on the basis of its}} biocompatibility and osteoconductive properties.

40|$|Bone–implant {{interaction}} of endosseus oral implants is investigated {{by means of}} numerical models to describe their mechanical behaviour. The constitutive models of bone tissue include the definition of anisotropy, visco-elasticity and plasticity and are implemented in a finite element code {{for the analysis of}} phenomena induced by a non-passive connection between oral implants and framework. This condition induces relevant stress/strain fields that also depend on bone–implant adhesion process, as term capable of affecting the <b>osteo-integration</b> and the consequent stability of the implant. In particular, a fixed prosthesis placed in the premolar region of a mandible is modelled, made up of two implants connected by a framework. The mechanical state arising from the misfit is considered for its effects in dependence on the properties of peri-implant bone tissue and bone–implant interface configuration. Continuity or detachment with or without adhesion between implant and bone are considered and the consequent response of mandible-prosthesis system is evaluated.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study is to assess the implant <b>osteo-integration,</b> as well as the course of bone {{regeneration}} and healing processes, thanks to the sinus lift procedure and by using PRF (R) as a filling material, in association with the Bio-Oss (R). Materials and Methods: 23 patients, requiring maxillary sinus lift in order to place implants into posterior maxillary region, were involved in this study. Selected cases, in which the height of the residual bone was superior to 5 mm, were adopted for surgical procedure of "one-stage sinus lift" (implant insertion concurrently occured with sinus lift resulting 6 - 9 months the healing and integration time). Before inserting the implant, a small quantity of filling material was placed in the cavity. For this purpose the bone fragment, stored in saline solution, was employed mixed with Bio-Oss (R) and PRF (R), after being ground. Results: All patients reported no pain to percussion, no sign of tissue suffering in the soft peri-implant tissues, the presence of an optimal primary stability of the inserted implants and {{a significant increase in the}} peri-implant bone density.

Chitosan, the partly deacetylated form of chitin, is one of the materials under investigation as surface coating for orthopaedic implants in order to improve <b>osteo-integration</b> and cellular attachment. In this study, we determined the effects of the degree of deacetylation (DD) of chitosan membranes on attachment, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 mouse preosteoblasts. Chitosan membranes were coated with fibronectin to promote biocompatibility and cellular attachment. Membranes were characterized in terms of wettability and surface topography using water contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy. The results in this study indicate that the surface roughness and fibronectin adsorption increase with increased DD. A higher DD also facilitates attachment and proliferation of cells, but no induction of spontaneous osteogenic differentiation was observed. Lower DD chitosan membranes were successfully prepared to sustain attachment and were modified by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde to promote long-term studies.

Tantalum has been introduced {{in an effort to}} enhance osseointegration potential of uncemented components. We therefore compared the clinical outcome of acetabular components with two dif-ferent porous surfaces. We retrospectively reviewed 283 patients (295 hips) who underwent cementless revision hip arthroplasty with either an HA-coated titanium cup (207 patients, 214 hips) or porous tantalum cup (79 patients, 81 hips). The minimum followup was 24 months in both groups (titanium: average 51. 8 months, range, 24 – 98 months; tan-talum: average, 35. 4 months, range, 24 – 63 months). The titanium and tantalum groups had a mechanical failure rate (clinical plus radiographic) of 8 % and 6 %, respectively. In hips with minor bone deficiency (type 1, 2 A, 2 B using the classification of Paprosky et al.), 6 % of titanium cups and 4 % of tantalum cups failed. In hips with major bone defi-ciency (type 2 C, 3), 24 % of titanium cups and 12 % of tantalum cups developed failure. In the major bone defi-ciency group, the tantalum cups had fewer numbers of lucent zones around the cup.

After finding lucent lines around cementless lateralised stems (Corail™, DePuy Synthes, St Priest, France) in several patients, we evaluated {{the effects of}} lateralisation in a large case-series. The objective of our study was to compare lateralised vs standard stems of identical design in terms of radiological <b>osteo-integration</b> and survival. HypothesisLateralised stems, despite being used only when indicated by the anatomical parameters, carry {{a higher risk of}} impaired <b>osteo-integration.</b> Materials and methodsA retrospective study was conducted in 807  primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) performed between 2006 and 2010 in 798  patients {{with a mean age of}} 65 ± 14. 2  years. Lateralised stems were used in 280  cases (Corail High Offset KHO, n= 169; and Corail coxa vara KLA, n= 111  cases) and standard stems in 527  cases (Corail KA). Mean follow-up was 2. 3  years (range, 1 – 7  years). The clinical evaluation included determination of the Postel-Merle d’Aubigné (PMA) score. Bone fixation and stability of the implants were assessed by determining the Engh and Massin score and the ARA score on the radiographs at last follow-up. Femoral, acetabular and global offset values were determined before and after THA. Nobles's Canal Flare Index was computed. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with surgical revision for aseptic loosening as the end-point. ResultsThe PMA score improved from 12 (10 – 15) pre-operatively to 17. 7 (14 – 18) (P< 0. 05). After THA, in the lateralised stem group, femoral offset was restored in 217 (77 %) hips and the mean change vs the pre-operative offset value was − 2 mm; in the standard stem group, femoral offset was restored in 440 (83. 5 %) hips and the mean change was + 1 mm. The Engh and Massin score values were similar in the standard stem and lateralised stem groups (24. 4 ± 2. 2 and 22. 6 ± 2. 4, respectively, NS). Revision for aseptic loosening was required in 5  patients with lateralised stems (3  KHO and 2  KLA) versus none of the patients with standard stems. There were no cases of excessive femoral offset and the mean change in offset was − 2. 3 mm (− 5. 3 to − 1. 1). Noble's index was increased (4. 27 ± 0. 5 for the loosened lateralised stems, 3. 65 ± 0. 8 for the well-fixed lateralised stems and 3. 82 ± 0. 6 for the standard stems), with no significant difference across groups. Overall survival after 3. 5  years of follow-up was 94. 6 % (95 % confidence interval, 88. 4 – 100 %) with lateralised stems and 100 % with standard stems (P< 0. 05). DiscussionThe risk of aseptic loosening was significantly higher with the lateralised stem (5 / 280, 1. 8 %) than with the standard stem (n= 0).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reversed {{shoulder}} arthroplasty is {{an accepted}} treatment for glenohumeral arthritis associated to rotator cuff deficiency. For most reversed shoulder prostheses, the baseplate of the glenoid component is uncemented and its primary stability {{is provided by}} a central peg and peripheral screws. Because {{of the importance of}} the primary stability for a good <b>osteo-integration</b> of the baseplate, the optimal fixation of the screws is crucial. In particular, the amplitude of the tightening force of the nonlocking screws is clearly associated to this stability. Since this force is unknown, it is currently not accounted for in experimental or numerical analyses. Thus, the primary goal of this work is to measure this tightening force experimentally. In addition, the tightening torque was also measured, to estimate an optimal surgical value. METHODS: An experimental setup with an instrumented baseplate was developed to measure simultaneously the tightening force, tightening torque and screwing angle, of the nonlocking screws of the Aquealis reversed prosthesis. In addition, the amount of bone volume around each screw was measured with a micro-CT. Measurements were performed on 6 human cadaveric scapulae. FINDINGS: A statistically correlated relationship (p< 0. 05, R= 0. 83) was obtained between the maximal tightening force and the bone volume. The relationship between the tightening torque and the bone volume was not statistically significant.

40|$|In {{this work}} the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) {{have been used}} for an elastic-static {{analysis}} of both a Branemark dental implant and a generic conic threaded implant, modelled either in the complete mandible or in a mandibular segment, under axial and lateral loading conditions. Two different hypotheses are considered with reference to degree of <b>osteo-integration</b> between the implant and the mandibular bone: perfect and partial osteointegration. The BEM analysis takes advantage of the submodelling technique, applied on the region surrounding the implant. Such region is extracted from the overall mandible and the boundary conditions for such submodel are obtained from the stress analysis realised on the complete mandible. The obtained results provide the localisation of the most stressed areas at the bone-implant interface and at the mandibular canal (containing the alveolar nerve) which represent the most critical areas during mastication. This methodology, enriched with the tools necessary for the numerical mandible reconstruction, is useful to realise sensitivity analysis of the stress field against a variation of the localisation, inclination and typology of the considered implant, in order to assess the optimal implant conditions for each patient under treatment. Due to the high flexibility in the pre- and post-processing phase and accuracy in reproducing superficial stress gradients, BEM is more efficient than FEM in facing this kind of problem, especially when a linear elastic constitutive material law is adopted...|$|E

30|$|Numerous studies {{investigated}} {{the benefits and}} drawbacks of collared stems and found little differences compared to collarless stems (Al-Najjim et al., 2016; Caglar et al., 2008; Ebramzadeh et al., 2004; Lenart et al., 2012; Weber et al., 2014). Other clinical studies {{encourage the use of}} collars because it may improve stem survival and simplify revision THA (Flecher et al., 2012; Kale et al., 2000; Van Kleunen et al., 2006). Finite element analyses suggested that collars improve the distribution of axial loads on the femoral calcar and reduce tensile and rotational stresses within the cancellous bone, and thereby reduce risks of fracture and thigh pain (Fischer et al., 1992; Jeon et al., 2011; Whiteside et al., 1988). In case of insufficient support of an uncemented stem within the metaphysis, good collar-calcar coverage could prevent implant subsidence and rotation, and therefore secure its ideal position and <b>osteo-integration.</b> Collarless stems typically subside by 0.5 to 1.5  mm within the first few weeks following THA (Campbell et al., 2011; Parvizi et al., 2004; Simpson et al., 2010; Strom et al., 2007; Weber et al., 2014), which could be limited using collared stems that can withstand twice as much load (Demey et al., 2011; Whiteside et al., 1988). It remains unclear, however, whether collars tend to decrease or increase calcar resorption, as the bone remodelling process depends on multiple factors related to load transfer along the stem surface (Carlsson et al., 1995; Gibbons et al., 2001; Kadar et al., 2011; Sharif & Parker, 2002).|$|E
40|$|Each year {{approximately}} 600, 000 and 2. 2 million {{bone graft}} procedures are performed worldwide with 600, 000 of them performed {{only in the}} United States. With a high success rate of <b>osteo-integration</b> and limited activation of the immune response, autografts are currently considered {{the gold standard for}} bone grafting. However, autografts are limited by the volume of bone tissue that can be harvested and by the threat of donor site morbidity. Allografts are alternatives to autografts since they are available in nearly unlimited supply and avoid donor-site morbidity and pain. However, allografts {{have been shown to be}} less frequently osteoinductive than autografts due to lack of biological factors, i. e., cells, growth factors. Limited vascularization, new bone formation and remodeling associated with large allograft healing are directly associated with clinical failure due to non-unions, late graft fractures and infections. The objective of this thesis is to increase the functionality and subsequent incorporation of allograft into host bone by applying a thin polymeric coating to allografts that would be capable of carrying and delivering growth factors with quantitative precision in hopes of increasing the ability of allografts to heal large scale bone defects. It is hypothesized that loading the dual growth factors, bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), onto a polymeric coating with two different techniques will result in short term and long term delivery kinetics. We also hypothesized that dual sequential delivery of BMP- 2 and VEGF will show enhanced bone repair over BMP- 2 delivered alone. We introduced a thin coating of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), that has been used for orthopaedic and musculoskeletal applications, to functionalize rat femoral allografts. Allografts was coated and loaded with BMP- 2 and VEGF independently and simultaneously using two different loading techniques, surface adsorption and encapsulation, each with distinct delivery kinetics. The rapid release of VEGF stimulated osteoclastogenesis and the sustained release of BMP- 2 encouraged osteogenesis. The bioactivity of the growth factors, BMP- 2 and VEGF was evaluated through different bioassays using Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) and Bone Marrow Macrophages (BMMs), respectively. Healing of rat femoral segmental defect was assessed after 4 and 8 weeks to determine the effect of controlled release of VEGF and BMP- 2...|$|E
40|$|This review {{emphasizes}} the current knowledge related to {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) as a non-invasive diagnostic tool to perform ex vivo and showing great potential for in vivo structural imaging of features in the oral cavity. OCT technology can generate high-resolution cross-sectional and en-face images of the internal architecture of the investigated sample (2 - 3 mm in depth). To this goal, en-face time domain OCT (TD-OCT) and spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) were employed. Topics included in this review refer to OCT non-destructive evaluations of: dental abfraction and attrition, material defects and micro-leakages at the tooth-filling interface, temporal-mandibular joint disc, quality of bracket bonding on dental hard tissue, prosthetic restorations and micro-leakages at prosthetic interfaces, root canals, {{presence or absence of}} apical micro-leakages, and <b>osteo-integration</b> of dental implants and of bone grafting materials. OCT revealed internal features of the material investigated with greater sensitivity than current diagnostic methods. We put our research in context with others’ results but the review reflects primarily our joint group experience and it presents images collected with our OCT systems only. The studies demonstrate the viability of OCT as a useful tool in dental medicine practice, as well as in research. Being completely non-invasive, OCT can be extended to soft tissue. Both TD and SD implementations prove the unique capabilities of OCT. For handheld scanning devices it is expected that the swept source principle (as one of the SD possibilities) will prevail, due to its high speed that allows for the reduction of distorting effects caused by the involuntary movements of the hand and of the patient. For high transversal resolution investigations, especially in more research oriented studies, it is expected that en-face TD-OCT will continue to coexist with SD-OCT methods, offering additionally a low cost quick provision of en-face view and compatibility with dynamic focus. Dynamic focus, that is the simultaneous adjustment of focus and coherence gate in depth is incompatible with SD-OCT methods and require repetitions of acquisitions under different focus in order to improve the transversal resolution, or more complex heads with division of the optical path in the object arm along different focus adjustments. In this respect, en-face TD-OCT provides a lower cost alternative to high transversal resolution of static samples. We have shown that complementary studies are possible embracing OCT with more traditional methods, such as confocal microscopy and microCT. Combination of principles is expected to evolve due to their limitations when considered separately...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{modifications}} {{are usually}} performed on titanium alloys to improve <b>osteo-integration</b> and surface bioactivity. Modifications such as alkaline and acid etching, or coating with bioactive {{materials such as}} hydroxyapatite, have previously been demonstrated. The aim of this work {{is to develop a}} peptide with combined titanium oxide and hydroxyapatite binders in order to achieve a biomimetic hydroxyapatite coating on titanium surfaces. The technology would also be applicable for the functionalisation of titanium and hydroxyapatite surfaces for selective protein adsorption, conjugation of antimicrobial peptides, and adsorption of specialised drugs for drug delivery. In this work, functionalisation of Ti 6 Al 4 V and hydroxyapatite surfaces was achieved using combined titanium-hydroxyapatite (Ti-Hap) peptides based on titanium binder (RKLPDA) and hydroxyapatite binder (EEEEEEEE) peptides. Homogeneous peptide coatings on Ti 6 Al 4 V surfaces were obtained after surface chemical treatments with a 30 wt % aqueous solution of H 2 O 2 for 24 and 48 hours. The treated titanium surfaces presented an average roughness of S a = 197 nm (24 h) and S a = 128 nm (48 h); an untreated mirror polished sample exhibited an S a of 13 nm. The advancing water contact angle of the titanium oxide layer after 1 hour of exposure to 30 wt % aqueous solution of H 2 O 2 was around 65 °, decreasing gradually with time until it reached 35 ° after a 48 hour exposure, suggesting that the surface hydrophilicity increased over etching time. The presence of a lysine (L) amino acid in the sequence of the titanium binder resulted in fluorescence intensity roughly 16 % higher compared with the arginine (R) amino acid analogue and therefore the lysine containing titanium binder was used in this work. The Ti-Hap peptide KKLPDAEEEEEEEE (Ti-Hap 1) was not adsorbed by the treated Ti 6 Al 4 V surfaces and therefore was modified. The modifications involved the inclusion of a glycine spacer between the binding terminals (Ti-Hap 2) and the addition of a second titanium binder (KKLPDA) (Ti-Hap 3 and Ti-Hap 4). The Ti-Hap peptide aptamer which exhibited the strongest intensity after the titanium dip coating was KKLPDAKKLPDAEEEEEEEE (Ti-Hap 4). On the other hand, hydroxyapatite surfaces, exhibiting an average roughness of S a = 1. 42 µm, showed a higher fluorescence for all peptides compared with titanium surfaces...|$|E
