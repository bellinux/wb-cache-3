40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to predict the mechanical behaviour of yarns under various levels of strain, by using only their technical parameters. The study of the yarn response to tensile test and relaxation test at different strain levels has permitted us to propose an analytical model predicting the entire stress-strain response of yarn. We have used the rheological approach to propose this analytical model. This model permitted to describe the viscoelastic behaviour of ring and <b>open-end</b> <b>spun</b> yarns during traction and relaxation. In order to characterize the coefficients of the proposed model, traction and relaxation tests were performed for 44 yarns. The neuronal approach is used to study the correlation between the mechanical coefficients of the analytical model and the technical parameters of the spinning mill. This allowed us to predict the yarns mechanical behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Rotor {{speed and}} twist per metres (tpm) are two key {{parameters}} in <b>open-end</b> rotor <b>spinning</b> of cotton yarns. High spinning productivity {{can be obtained}} by keeping the rotor speed high and twist level as low as possible. However, too high rotor speed may result in yarn imperfections and too low twist level may result in lower tenacity yarns. This study aimed at optimising the multiple yarn characteristics in <b>open-end</b> rotor <b>spinning</b> using the Taguchi method and the grey relational analysis. Cotton yarn samples of 30 tex were produced on rotor spinning machine with different twist levels (i. e. 500, 550, 600 and 700 tpm) at different rotor speeds (i. e. 70, 000, 80, 000, 90, 000 and 100, 000 rpm) according to the Taguchi design of experiment. Optimal spinning process parameters were determined using the grey relational grade as the performance index.

40|$|A queuing {{model of}} staple yarn {{structure}} {{was presented in}} Part I of this work, where the migration behaviours of fibres were simulated by the movement of customers in a Markovian network of queuing systems. Part II of the series proposes (i) a multi-dimensional minimization method for estimating the migration probabilities of fibres based on {{the analysis of the}} distribution of number of fibres in yarn cross-sections; (ii) a yarn structure simulation algorithm which uses the migration probabilities of fibres, yarn technical specifications (e. g. linear density and twist) and colour composition to produce a realistic three-dimensional image of a melange yarn. The result is a high quality three-dimensional image of a melange yarn showing its fibrous structure as well as the formation of hairiness. Due to the generic nature of the model and the simulation algorithm, this approach can be applied {{to a wide range of}} yarns including ring-spun or <b>open-end</b> <b>spun</b> yarns of solid shade or produced from melange blends.

5000|$|One {{disadvantage}} of <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning</b> {{is that it}} is limited to coarser counts, another is the structure of the yarn itself with fibres less in parallel compared to ring-spun yarns, for example, consequently cloth made from open-end yarn has a [...] "fuzzier" [...] feel and poorer wear resistance.|$|E

In <b>open-end</b> and air-jet <b>spinning,</b> the roving operation is eliminated. The spinning frame winds yarn around a bobbin.

In this study, combing system based on drawing cylinder and nipping by aprons is studied. The drawing is carried out noncontinueusly by nipping. The results obtained are {{compared with those of}} the pressure combing cylinder and flat feeding. It is shown that in the system of combing through drawing, a more uniform combing of the wool sliver is obtained as compared to the pressure combing cylinder system. It is also less sensitive to the type of finish employed. The yarns obtained have relatively high tenacity and are more regular than those spun by conventional woolen system. They can be considered quite suitable for Ladies wear and knitted fabrics...|$|R

50|$|Ring {{spinning}} technology {{had successfully}} replaced the spinning mule, with mills having been converted mules to rings. However in the 1970s, the depleted industry was challenged {{by a new}} technology open-end or break spinning. In 1978 Carrington Viyella opened a factory to do <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning</b> in Atherton. This was the first new textile production facility in Lancashire since 1929. Immediately Pear Mill, Stockport and Alder Mill, Leigh were closed. These were both Edwardian mills designed by Stott and Sons.The mill built in 1978 {{was built on the}} Howe Bridge mills site and was named Unit One. It was not an open end mill but a combed cotton ring mill.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also known}} as break {{spinning}} or rotor spinning. The principle behind <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning</b> {{is similar to that of}} a clothes dryer spinning full of sheets. If you could open the door and pull out a sheet, it would spin together as you pulled it out. Sliver from the card goes into the rotor, is spun into yarn and comes out, wrapped up on a bobbin, all ready to go to the next step. There is no roving stage or re-packaging on an auto-coner. This system is much less labour-intensive and faster than ring spinning with rotor speeds up to 140,000 rpm. The Rotor design is the key to the operation of the open-ended spinners. Each type of fibre may require a different rotor design for optimal product quality and processing speed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} technological parameters of spinning of 100 % CV Vortex yarns of different counts and its selected geometrical parameters (a lead of helix of wrapping fibre ribbon, yarn diameter) as well as yarn properties. The number of twist of wrapping fibre layer is determined. The effect of the yarn delivery speed, hollow spindle diameter, and the main draft on the hairiness, mass irregularity, tenacity, elongation, resistance to abrasion and bending rigidity of Vortex yarn is observed. The yarn properties are compared with the properties of <b>open-end</b> rotor <b>spun</b> yarns. Slivers of the same spinning lot {{were used for the}} production of both kinds of yarn. The results showed that the delivery speed in combination with spindle diameter affects yarn diameter, hairiness and abrasion resistance. Mass irregularity and imperfections of yarn is mainly affected by the main draft of drafting unit. Technological parameters of spinning do not affect the level of bending rigidity of the Vortex yarn. Tested rotor spun yarns had a larger diameter, higher hairiness, lower tenacity and higher elongation, lower mass irregularity and number of imperfections, higher abrasion resistance and lower bending rigidity compared to tested Vortex spun yarns...|$|R

The experiences {{have been made in}} a Spanish company from short fibers sector that has three spinning systems, with tradition and prestige in world market, validating the results in Innotex Center laboratories of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Considering the results, it shows that the technology of manufacture of yarns by air is suitable for yarn, woven fabrics and knitting, structures to textile medical-sanitary application, by specific properties as well as enhanced competitiveness, due to the high production rate and shortened spinning process. The viscose yarns manufactured by air mass are more mass regular. The new DR parameter clearly indicates a better look of the finished fabric when we work with yarns produced by air technology. The significant reduction of the hairiness means less formation of loose fibres by friction, very important in the application of these yarns in the manufacture of textile structures for medical-sanitary use. Also no-table increase of about 15 % in the absorption capacity of the fluids, especially water, from the yarns made by air.

50|$|Hand-spinning was {{a cottage}} {{industry}} in medieval Europe, where the wool spinners (often women and children) would provide enough yarn to service {{the needs of the}} men who operated the looms. This would occur in districts favourable to sheep husbandry. The introduction of the flying shuttle upset this balance. The subsequent invention of the spinning jenny water frame redressed the balance but required water power to operate the machinery, and the industry relocated to West Yorkshire where this was available. The British government was very protective of the technology and restricted its export. After World War I the colonies where the cotton was grown started to purchase and manufacture significant quantities of cotton spinning machinery. The next breakthrough was with the move over to break or <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning,</b> and then the adoption of artificial fibres. By then most production had moved to India and China.|$|E
30|$|According to Adanur (2001), the open-end is {{a process}} notably {{employed}} to produce denim yarn. The open-end yarns are cheap and rustic for not passing through machines that add a sophisticated finishing, such as textile laminating and combing machines, differing, for example, from the ring spinning process where a set of parallelized fibers is well twisted so there is high cohesion and strength. Additionally, in <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning,</b> the individual fibers are not uniformly arranged in the produced yarn as in the spinning ring produced yarn. In an <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning</b> yarn most of the fibers are parallel, but with some intersections and some irregular fibers surrounding the main cable (Fabriclink – Fabric University 2012).|$|E
30|$|The rotor spinning, {{also known}} as <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning,</b> is used for wiring very short length fibers {{and it is a}} generic term for the {{production}} of yarn from staple fibers.

Cultivars that represent improvements in fiber length, fiber strength, and length uniformity include the AgrEvo Cotton Seed International cultivar FiberMax 832, and Agripro cultivar 6102.

This study {{examined}} the characteristics of natural dyed palm yarns and fabrics produced from treated palm fibres. The results showed that fibre characteristics were improved by anaerobic fermentation, and following crushing and carding, were 3 - 5 times smaller, softer and more pliable. In the production of palm/cotton yarns of No. 7 (50 / 50), No. 10 (40 / 60), No. 16 (30 / 70) and No. 10 (0 / 100), the 3 - 5 denier palm yarns and cotton yarns were spun in <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning</b> units.

The research described was primarily concerned with working towards {{the solution of the}} problem of yarn tension control when building conical packages on an <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning</b> machine at yarn delivery speeds of 500 m 1 min"cause of the total lack of published work on the mathematical modelling of the parameters affecting tension variation, a considerable amount of effort was spent in the establishment of this basic understanding. This mathematical analysis appears, in the main, in the appendices to this thesis. In addition to the analysis of yarn tension variations depending on machine geometry parameters, mathematical models have also been produced which predict the effect on tension of fitting curved distribution bars of various shapes. The work includes the development of concept ideas which appeared capable of providing routes for solution of the tension control problem. These ideas were evaluated and compared against a design specification which was also developed as part of this research. Two promising concepts were selected for detailed investigation. These were: a pneumatic passive compensator and, a positive mechanical compensator. The pneumatic compensator was a novel idea which was conceived by the author, and which eventually provided a solution which met the design specification in every way. The mechanical compensator was shown to be a far less attractive concept with several serious problems which have been explored but not eliminated.

40|$|Abstract]: The textile {{industry}} has a recurrent white speck nep problem in cotton. “White specks” are immature clusters of fibres {{that are not}} visible as defects until dyeing, after which they remain white {{on the surface of}} a darkly dyed fabric, or appear as non uniform streaks in the fabric. Both results render the fabric unsuitable for commercial fashion fabrics. The white speck potential of cotton is difficult to predict except in extremely immature cottons. Competitive synthetic fibres are uniform in length and strength and never have a maturity problem resulting in dye defects. They are much more predictable in the mill. As a result, cotton faces the risk of being replaced by synthetic fibres. Industry requires a method to predict fabric quality from cotton bale fibre properties to minimize this risk. This research addresses the problem of predicting white specks in dyed cotton fabrics. It is part of a large study, which is supported jointly by US and Australian agencies. The main objective is to predict fabric quality from bale fibre properties given controlled gin and mill processing. Gin and mill processing must be controlled so that field and varietal effects can be seen without the interaction of mechanical processing differences. This results in achieving other objectives, including the provision of baseline data for Australian varieties, ginning effects and comparison of ring and <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning.</b> Initially a reliable method for measuring white specks had to be found. Several systems have been evaluated and are reported here. The systems accuracy was compared using fabrics from the US Extreme Variety Study (EVS), which was grown specifically to have different levels of white specks. The fabrics made from the US (Leading Variety Study 1993 (LVS) and The American Textile Manufacturers Institute (ATMI) Cotton Variety Processing Trials, 2001) and the Australian (1998 & 1999) variety studies were analysed using AutoRate- 2 - 03, the best of the image analysis systems studied. The final release of AutoRate (February 2003) was developed by Dr. Bugao Xu to measure white specks on dark fabrics in conjunction with this research. This final analysis of these studies results in white speck prediction equations from high-speed fibre measurement systems. This information should be immediately useful to as a tool to measure the effects of field and ginning practices on the levels of white specks without having to carry the research out to finished fabrics. Cotton breeders {{will be able to use}} the equations in the development of new varieties with low white speck potential, by eliminating varieties with high white speck potential early on. The research will continue on a much larger scale in the US and hopefully a WSP (White Speck Potential) value will be incorporated into the US Cotton Grading System...|$|E
