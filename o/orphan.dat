5|$|On the Palamecia, {{the other}} members of the party reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch, who is the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus in disguise. Barthandelus tells the party that their Focus is to {{transform}} into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie <b>Orphan,</b> who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse. Slaying <b>Orphan</b> will result in the destruction of Cocoon. The party flees and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm <b>Orphan</b> themselves. Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries earlier, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy <b>Orphan.</b> The party flies away to Pulse and journeys to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where they hope to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. The town is deserted, and they find no living people on the surface. The party is unsuccessful in removing their marks, and Barthandelus confronts them again. The party learns that Barthandelus has made Cid the new Primarch to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and <b>Orphan</b> in a coup d'état.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{researchers}} have explored the toll of AIDS on the children who have become <b>orphans</b> {{as a result of}} the disease; others have investigated the roles of aid-giving agencies on the alleviation of the <b>orphans</b> 2 ̆ 7 situation. However, despite researchers 2 ̆ 7 pointing to the germaneness of community and goodwill agency liaison, no study had examined the impact of such collaboration on the resources available to the <b>orphans.</b> To this end, the heads-of-household of 532 AIDS <b>orphans</b> under 18 years old in Kenya 2 ̆ 7 s Nyanza province were surveyed to investigate the impact of community-referral on the state of AIDS <b>orphans</b> with regard to homelessness, birth registration, food security, school attendance, and sibling separation. The theoretical framework for the study was rooted on the interplay of resource-availability and stressors on AIDS <b>orphans.</b> Results of regression analysis showed that double <b>orphans</b> ate fewer meals than maternal or paternal <b>orphans.</b> There was an inverse relationship between the number of AIDS <b>orphans</b> in a home and the likelihood of homelessness; older <b>orphans</b> tended to not be separated from their siblings; double <b>orphans</b> were more likely than single <b>orphans</b> to be separated from their siblings; school absenteeism was higher among older <b>orphans</b> and when the head-of-household was female; community-referred, male children, offsprings of the respondents tended to have birth registration. The results of the assessment will be pertinent to stakeholders as a framework to guide program planning and implementation as they address the needs of AIDS <b>orphans</b> in Nyanza province and other similar communities...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of orphanhood on children’s school {{enrollment}} in 10 Sub-Saharan African countries. Although poorer children in Africa are less likely to attend school, the lower enrollment of <b>orphans</b> is not accounted for solely by their poverty. We find <b>orphans</b> {{are less likely to be}} enrolled than are non-orphans with whom they live. Consistent with Hamilton’s Rule, the theory that the closeness of biological ties governs altruistic behavior, outcomes for <b>orphans</b> depend on the relatedness of <b>orphans</b> to their household heads. The lower enrollment of <b>orphans</b> is largely explained by the greater tendency of <b>orphans</b> to live with distant relatives or unrelated caregivers. ...|$|R
