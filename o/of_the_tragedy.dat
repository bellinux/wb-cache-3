5|$|In 1881 Barlow sat {{as member}} of the Wind Pressure (Railway Structures) Commission {{established}} at {{the recommendation of the}} Tay Bridge report. He led the design of the replacement Tay Bridge (188287) with his son Crawford Barlow as engineer. The new design used large monocoque piers to support a double railway track. The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream. They can still be seen today as a forlorn reminder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> of 1879.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 a {{memorial}} {{to the men who}} died in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board, followed by a second in 2006, to honour the dead of both the 1901 and 1913 explosions.

5|$|German war cemeteries are {{somewhat}} different from French and British ones, being more austere and simple in design. They were built around lawns, without flowers or other decorations, intended to highlight acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> {{and avoid the}} expensive and pretentious sentimentality that the German VDK felt Allied cemeteries invoked. German war cemeteries also included heldenhaine, heroes' groves populated with oak trees and large boulders, dolmen.

The cemeteries used slate grave markers, less individualised than British or French equivalents, and felt to better symbolise the importance German nation as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Lhermitte {{filed for}} and {{received}} a judgment of divorce before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection. Following the trial, Lhermitte {{was not able to}} pay for the trial costs, so under Belgian law it fell to her now ex-husband to pick up the bill. This conformed to the Law of Belgium, with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement. The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system. Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be balanced by decency” given the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragedy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt {{has argued that the}} coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragedy.</b> He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.|$|E
5|$|News of the Donner Party's {{fate was}} spread eastward by Samuel Brannan, an elder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and journalist, who {{ran into the}} salvage party as they {{came down from the}} pass with Keseberg. Accounts of the ordeal first reached New York City in July 1847. Reporting on the event across the U.S. was heavily {{influenced}} by the national enthusiasm for westward migration. In some papers, news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> was buried in small paragraphs despite the contemporary tendency to sensationalize stories. Several newspapers, including those in California, wrote about the cannibalism in graphic exaggerated detail. In some print accounts, the members of the Donner Party were depicted as heroes, and California a paradise worthy of significant sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|Paisley {{retired in}} 1983 and was {{replaced}} by his assistant, Joe Fagan. Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season. Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence which separated the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragedy,</b> English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} the storm, the bodies of {{drowning}} victims had been recovered by the hundreds, and it was suspected many of the deceased had been washed into the sea. One preliminary estimate placed the number of dead in the Jérémie area alone at 1,500, suggesting the worst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> occurred there. Indeed, some modern sources have unofficially referred to the storm as Hurricane Jérémie. The Haitian government worked to bring emergency supplies and relief workers, at least partially by way of ship, to the flood-stricken region.

5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly {{struck by the fact that}} Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E
