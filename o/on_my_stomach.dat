5|$|The {{world record}} jump was very smooth. It felt like I was lying <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> on a glass coffee table, {{watching}} a movie projected on a screen underneath the table. Although the flight was very smooth, {{it seemed like the}} movie projector was running the film faster than intended.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not for Joe!" [...] yelled Higgs in {{his high}} voice. [...] "If you fellows think that I'm going to let a great cat sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> for nothing, you are jolly well mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|I do {{not know}} how long it was before I {{scrambled}} on to the tree to which I was left clinging, but it was longer than I cared about. My thoughts were of a grave and almost sombre character, but I still clung to my paddle. The stream ran away with my heels as fast as I could pull up my shoulders, and I seemed, by the weight, to have all the water of the Oise in my trousers-pockets. You can never know, till you try it, what a dead pull a river makes against a man. Death himself had me by the heels, for this was his last ambuscado, and he must now join personally in the fray. And still I held to my paddle. At last I dragged myself <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>on</b> the trunk, and lay there a breathless sop, with a mingled sense of humour and injustice. A poor figure I must have presented to Burns upon the hill-top with his team. But there was the paddle in <b>my</b> hand. <b>On</b> <b>my</b> tomb, if ever I have one, I mean to get these words inscribed: [...] "He clung to his paddle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So," [...] responded Mr. Beach, [...] "I {{have been}} informed." [...] He brooded for a space. [...] "I, too," [...] he proceeded, [...] "suffer from <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> I have a weak stomach. The lining of <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> {{is not what}} I could wish the lining of <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> to be." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{horror and}} loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle, both confounded my senses, {{and made me}} {{discharge}} from <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> in an excessive manner. I then returned towards my habitation; and, in my way thither, shedding floods of tears, and falling down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bended knees, gave God thanks for making my nature contrary to these wretches, and delivering me so long out of their hands.|$|R
60|$|A little bilious this morning, for {{the first}} time these six months. It cannot be the London matters which stick <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> for that is mending, and may have good effects on myself and others.|$|E
6000|$|MRS O'FLAHERTY. Mind {{you have}} a sup of good black tea {{for me in the}} kitchen afterwards, acushla. That washy drawing-room tea will give me the wind if I leave it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> [She goes into the house, leaving the two young people alone together.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me hear {{no more of}} it!" [...] says I. [...] "You {{have got}} me to that pitch that the bare name of soldier rises <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> Our traffic is settled; I am now going forth and will return in one half-hour, when I expect to find my {{chambers}} purged of you." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>My</b> <b>stomach</b> is showing, so I {{just get}} the one piece but <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> still shows. You can see my rolls {{in the back and}} I don’t like that so I just try to put stuff over so you don’t see.|$|R
40|$|I {{lean forward}} {{and as we}} flip through the air, <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> leaves <b>my</b> body. I am free falling, plummeting to the earth at 120 miles per hour. An inexplicable feeling of invincibility mixed with a humbling sense of my {{mortality}} wash over me. Intense adrenaline rushes out every extremity. Somehow, {{there is a huge}} grin <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face which wouldn’t disappear until long after I arrived back on the ground...|$|R
50|$|Nineteen, twenty, <b>my</b> <b>stomach's</b> empty.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Girls is so 'cute. Ruby {{is awful}} 'cute. It {{makes me feel}} as though I had two hun'erdweight o' meal <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> lying awake o' nights and {{thinking}} as how he is, may be,--pulling of her about! If I thought that she'd let him--; oh! I'd swing for it, Muster Carbury. They'd {{have to make an}} eend o' me at Bury, if it was that way. They would then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a {{thousand}} miles from judging," [...] I replied. [...] "And I give you my word I do rejoice to know your heart is lightened. If my face fell at all, as I suppose it must, you will allow this is rather an ill day for compositions, {{and the people in}} power extremely ill persons to be compounding with. I have Simon Fraser extremely heavy <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, the chain. I didn't {{care for}} the ship, as I saw it {{contained}} some skippers. On the way home the chain and anchor began to lie heavily <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> I didn't seem to digest them properly, {{and by the time}} I got to my palace, where you will notice there is no throne, I was thrown into throes of severe pain. So I at once sent for Dr. Shark--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't make me angry." [...] Al {{smiled with}} cunning, and glanced triumphantly at his wife. [...] "You can't make me angry," [...] he repeated, {{as though the}} idea were {{thoroughly}} gratifying to him. [...] "I know your game. It's <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> I tell you. I can't help it. Before God, I can't! Isn't it <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> Mary?" ...|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT [making a wry face]. DON'T be paradoxical, Larry. It really {{gives me}} a pain in <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "I then pass to {{the back}} of the stage and lie down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> still holding the skull before my eyes. After holding this posture for some time, I crawl slowly forward, portraying by the {{movement}} of my legs and stomach the whole sad history of Yorick. Finally I turn my back on the audience, still holding the skull, and convey through the spasmodic movements of my back Hamlet's passionate grief at the loss of his friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, look here,' said Mr Rackstraw. 'I want {{to explain}} to you just what this game means to me. Don't run away with the idea I've had you fellows down to play an {{exhibition}} game just to keep me merry and bright. If Houndsditch wins today, K means that I shall {{be able to hold}} up my head again and look my fellow-man in the face, instead of crawling round <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> and feeling like a black-beetle under a steam-roller. Do you get that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{favorite}} place in winter time was {{directly under the}} kitchen stove. It {{was one of the}} old-fashioned high-stepping breed, with long hind legs and an arching belly, and as the oven was on top, the space beneath the arch offered a delightful den for a cat, a dog or small boy, and I was usually to be found there, lying <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> spelling out the [...] "continued" [...] stories which came to us in the county paper, for I was born with a hunger for print.|$|E
5000|$|Jim Walker (2001): “Not even a song just a wank, {{ripping off}} our fans. It still turns <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> {{thinking}} about it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{was young}}... once. I was young twelve years ago, and I had hair <b>on</b> top of <b>my</b> head, and <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> was lean as a runner's, and the longest day was none {{too long for}} me. I was a husky back there in '98. You {{remember}} me, Milner. You knew me then. Wasn't I a pretty good bit of all right?" ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> {{was fairly}} well filled, then did there {{come back to}} me that courage under which I should never have lost hope.|$|R
6000|$|... 5. When I {{went out}} to-day, I found it had rained mightily in the night, {{and the streets}} were as dirty as winter: it is very {{refreshing}} after ten days dry.--I went into the City, and dined with Stratford, thanked him for his books, gave him joy of his being director, {{of which he had}} the first notice by a letter from me. I ate sturgeon, and it lies <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> I almost finished Prior's Journey at the printer's; and came home pretty late, with Patrick at my heels.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I, five," [...] his {{companion}} added, turning gloomy {{with the memory}} of it. [...] "Five days once, with nothing <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> but a bit of orange peel, an' outraged nature wouldn't stand it, sir, an' I near died. Sometimes, walkin' the streets at night, I've ben that desperate I've {{made up my mind}} to win the horse or lose the saddle. You know what I mean, sir--to commit some big robbery. But when mornin' come, there was I, too weak from 'unger an' cold to 'arm a mouse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seemed like}} a long time," [...] {{answered}} the King. [...] "Dr. Shark said I ought to put a mustard poultice <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> so I uncoiled myself and summoned my servants, and they began putting on the mustard plaster. It had to be bound all around me so it wouldn't slip off, and I began {{to look like an}} express package. In about four weeks fully one-half of the pain had been covered by the mustard poultice, which got so hot that it hurt me worse than the stomach ache did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've--I've got a red-hot stone," [...] groaned Rainiharo, [...] "somewhere in my inwards! Thorny shrubs are {{revolving}} in <b>my</b> <b>stomach!</b> Young crocodiles are masticating my--oh!" ...|$|R
60|$|I was so {{astonished}} {{with the}} sight of these things, that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it, for a long while; all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and {{the horror of the}} degeneracy of human nature; which, though I had heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of before: in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> and, having vomited with an uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked <b>on</b> towards <b>my</b> own habitation.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Come thou, Sir Tristram,' quoth the King. [...] Quoth he, 'It cannot be, [...] For ne'er can I <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> bring [...] To do it willingly.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{must have}} lost consciousness, for when I {{recovered}} I was lying <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> {{in a heap}} of soft white sand, and the dawn was beginning to break dimly {{over the edge of}} the slope down which I had fallen. As the light grew stronger I saw that I was at the bottom of a horse-shoe shaped crater of sand, opening on one side directly on to the shoals of the Sutlej. My fever had altogether left me, and, with the exception of a slight dizziness in the head, I felt no had effects from the fall over night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ruey, do hush up," [...] said Miss Roxy, {{frowning}} sternly {{down from}} {{under the shadow of}} a preternatural black straw bonnet, trimmed with huge bows of black ribbon, which head-piece sat above her curls like a helmet. [...] "Don't be a-gettin' sentimental, Ruey, whatever else you get--and talkin' like Miss Emily Sewell about match-makin'; I can't stand it; it rises <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> such talk does. As to that ar Moses Pennel, folks ain't so certain as they thinks what he'll do. Sally Kittridge may think he's a-goin' to have her, because he's been a-foolin' round with her all summer, and Sally Kittridge may jist find she's mistaken, that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{every night}} some men disappeared," [...] confessed Jaffir. [...] "They were weary and hungry {{and they went}} to eat with their enemies. We are only ten now--ten men and a woman with the heart of a man, who are tonight starving, and to-morrow shall die swiftly. We saw your ship afar all day; but you have come too late. And for fear of treachery and lest harm should befall you--his friend--the Rajah gave me the ring and I crept <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> over the sand, and I swam in the night--and I, Jaffir, the best swimmer in Wajo, and the slave of Hassim, tell you--his message to you is 'Depart and forget'--and this is his gift--take!" ...|$|E
60|$|Wild. 'Tis {{well you}} are so; for {{otherwise}} I feel <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> a little maukish. I should have doubted another fit of love were coming up.|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{drinking}} brandy so long I hardly {{think that}} 12s. claret {{will agree with}} <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> You ask for the truth, and there it is,--very plainly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{stuff in}} <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> but I get no good of it. Think you, Bagheera, the Rains have {{forgotten}} us {{and will never}} come again?" ...|$|R
