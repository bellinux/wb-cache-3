5|$|Five {{individuals}} died in maritime {{accidents involving}} {{at least one}} catamaran. There was an accident involving a bus carrying evacuees, killing four people on board. Three people died on the offshore Ambergris Caye. Overall, 19 people perished in the country. Several injuries, mainly from flying debris, were reported in San Pedro, and there were 142 people who were injured in the storm. Throughout the country, approximately 3,279 homes were either damaged or destroyed. The damage total from Keith was initially estimated at $200 million, about half of which to tourism facilities; the remainder was roughly split between crop and infrastructure damage. About 75% of the crops in the country were damaged, including much of the corn harvest that was expected to begin in October. The damage total was later estimated at $280 million, most <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> offshore Ambergris Cay and Caye Caulker.|$|E
5|$|M-114 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway and planned beltline in the US state of Michigan around the city of Grand Rapids. It was designated {{by the end of}} 1929 on various streets in adjoining cities and townships. By the 1940s, sections <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west and south sides of Grand Rapids were given new designations and the segment along the east side of town was finished. By late 1945 the highway designation was completely decommissioned in favor of other numbers. M-114 split into two branches, one running east–west and the other running north–south. The east–west spur routing is now local streets while the rest is part of state highways.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1942, the H-11, based on the H-3 was introduced. With the H-11, the Luftwaffe had at its {{disposal}} a powerful medium bomber with heavier armour and revised defensive armament. The drum-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 was replaced with a belt-fed 13mm (.51in) MG 131 in the now fully enclosed dorsal position (B-Stand); the gunner in the latter was now protected with armoured glass. The single MG 15 in the ventral C-Stand or Bola was also replaced, with a belt-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 81Z with much higher rate of fire. The beam positions originally retained the single MG 15s, but the H-11/R1 replaced these with twin MG 81Z as well; this latter arrangement was standardized in November 1942. The port internal ESAC bomb racks could be removed, and an 835L (221US gal) fuel tanks installed in its place. Many H-11s were equipped with a new PVC rack under the fuselage, which carried five 250kg (550lb) bombs. Additional armour plating was fitted around crew spaces, some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower fuselage and could be jettisoned in an emergency. Engines were two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Junkers Jumo 211F-2, allowing this variant to carry a 2,000kg (4,410lb) payload {{to a range of}} 2,340km (1,450mi). Heinkel built 230 new aircraft of this type and converted 100 H-3s to H-11s by {{the summer of}} 1943.|$|E

25|$|A {{complete}} ring {{has much}} simpler structure than a commutative ring.

Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated, among other things, the definition of excellent ring.|$|E

25|$|In October 2009, Heather Roy's Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill {{was drawn}} from the ballot. The bill was greatly delayed due to {{a large number of}} public {{submissions}} (4837 in total, including 132 oral submissions), necessitating the Select Committee stage to be extended from the normal six months to a full year. It was later delayed due to filibustering by the Labour Party and of particular note, Trevor Mallard, of a bill ahead <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Order Paper - the aim was to push the debate out so the third reading could not occur before the 2011 election, causing the bill to die as Roy was not seeking re-election. However, the bill eventually passed its third reading on 28 September 2011, 63 votes in favour to 58 opposed. All student associations in New Zealand are now voluntary.|$|E
25|$|Stout was {{probably}} born in Little Creek Hundred, Kent County, Delaware, son of Jacob Emanuel Stout {{and his second}} wife Mary Griffin Stout. His ancestors came to Kent County from New Jersey in the 17th century.

Jacob Stout married Angelica Killen in 1795 and had four children, Mary, William, Henry, Sarah Ann, and William Jacob. The exact location of their home is debated. Some say it was north of Leipsic and others say it was west <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cheswold Road. It was nearby in any case, as {{he was one of the}} founders of Leipsic.

Murat and Ney with 28,000 troops cornered their adversary at Treuchtlingen on 19 October. On that day Werneck capitulated with 15,000 troops, 28 guns, 12 colors, two standards, and four generals. Murat demanded that the terms include nearby Austrian units and Werneck accepted. Because of this the artillery reserve also surrendered. Hohenzollern refused to join in the capitulation and got away with 10 squadrons of cavalry. Ferdinand also managed to escape to Bohemia with Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg and 12 squadrons of horsemen. On 20 October Mack surrendered at Ulm with 20,000 infantry, over 3,000 cavalry, and 59 guns.|$|E
