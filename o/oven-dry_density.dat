40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} {{the effect of}} microwaving on the anatomical properties of oil palm timber. It also compares the changes with those in timbers in general use. This work examines the application of microwave technology by exposing oil palm timber to a microwave device. The effects on wood moisture content, <b>oven-dry</b> <b>density</b> and permeability were studied. The anatomical changes were also investigated and compared to those that occurred in radiata pine, messmate and Paulownia. Compared to the timbers in general use, which are classed as coniferous and dicotyledonous, oil palm timber as monocotyledonous experiences different anatomical changes when expressed to high intensity microwaves. In gymnosperm and dicotyledonous wood species, microwaves modify timber properties by rupturing ray tissue {{and the formation of}} micro-checks along the radial direction. As oil palm timber has no ray tissue, after microwave application, the rupture occurs in highly moisture saturated parenchymatous ground tissue. The micro-checks occur tangentially instead of along the radial direction. Microwaves also cause oil palm stems to shrink rather than expand because the collapse of ruptured parenchyma cells from the parenchymatous ground tissue. Microwave heating reduces the moisture content of the timber significantly. The treatment reduced the wet palm timber with an initial average moisture content of approximately 108 % to approximately 26 % moisture content. In regard to the effect of microwave heating on <b>oven-dry</b> <b>density</b> it was similarly found that the <b>oven-dry</b> <b>density</b> of modified palm timber was reduced significantly during microwave heating. The initial <b>oven-dry</b> <b>density</b> of oil palm timber, which is on average 186 kg/m 3, reduced to about 160 kg/m 3. The rupturing of parenchymatous ground tissue during microwave heating causes the reduction in <b>oven-dry</b> <b>density.</b> Microwave heating changed palm wood permeability, which was indicated by an increased percentage uptake of resin. In the longitudinal direction, the uptake improved significantly from 6. 9 % in controls to 7. 8 % after microwave modification, while in the tangential and radial directions, the percentage uptake was almost doubled. In the tangential direction, the uptake was approximately 2. 7 % in the control and 4. 6 % after modification. In the radial direction, the percentage uptake increased from about 2. 5 % in the control to 4. 4 % after modification. The microwave variables studied were conveyor belt speed and microwave power output. The microwave powers of 4 kW, 3 kW and 2 kW were used and had no significant effect on moisture reduction or in uptake improvement, but the conveyor belt speed variation (3 mm/sec, 6 mm/sec) had a significant effect on moisture and density reduction. The modifications of palm-wood properties during microwave heating are going to be important for oil palm stem utilization. The significant moisture reduction leads to faster drying of oil palm timber, while the permeability changes are important for preservative and resin treatment.

Eight indicators are related to wood physical and mechanical properties, such as <b>oven-dry</b> <b>density</b> (Den), volumetric shrinkage from water-swollen to air-dry condition (SH-air), volumetric shrinkage from water-swollen to oven-dry condition (SH-ov), volumetric swelling from oven-dry to water-swollen condition (SW-ov), volumetric swelling from air-dry to water-swollen condition (SW-air), equilibrium moisture content (EMC) at 20  °C and 65  % relative humidity, modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE). The measurements were made according to ISO standards [18, 19].|$|E
40|$|The wood of 25 -year-old Pinus radiata D. Don. from Jebel Marra area Western Sudan was {{studied as}} a {{potential}} exotic timber tree. The physical and mechanical properties were determined including wood density,, static bending, modulus of rupture(MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), Impact bending, compression strength parallel to grain, and shear stress. The obtained results were compared with the values for the same Pinus species from Southern Sudan and California state. The results {{have shown that the}} average value for the <b>oven-dry</b> wood <b>density</b> (529. 0 kg m- 3) for the Western Sudanese pine was lower than that for the Southern Sudan pine (600 kg m- 3). And nearer to the California pine (515 kg m- 3). The Sudanese radiata pine has shown lower shrinkage ratio (1. 55). The average value for the modulus of rupture (MOR) for the Western Sudan pine (807. 0 kPa cm - 2) was higher than for the Southern Sudan pine (775. 7 kPa m- 2) and a bit lower than the California pine (814 kPa m- 2). The modulus of elasticity (MOE) was higher average value for the Southern Sudan pine (12. 72 GPa cm- 2) which resembles that of the California pine (12. 70 GPa cm - 2) while it was lower for the Western Sudan pine (11. 63 GPa cm- 2). The compressive strength was higher than both Southern Sudan and the California pines while the shear stress was lower than that of the American pine...|$|R
30|$|Functional {{analysis}} of genes and proteins involved in wood formation and fiber properties often involves phenotyping saplings of transgenic trees. The {{objective of the}} present study was to develop a tensile test method for small green samples from saplings, and to compare mechanical properties of juvenile European aspen (Populus tremula) and hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × tremuloides). Small microtomed sections were manufactured and successfully tested in tension parallel to fiber orientation. Strain was determined by digital speckle photography. Results showed significantly lower values for juvenile hybrid aspen in both Young’s modulus and tensile strength parallel to the grain. Average Young’s moduli spanned the ranges of 5.9 – 6.6 and 4.8 – 6.0 GPa for European aspen and hybrid aspen, respectively. Tensile strength was in the range of 45 – 49 MPa for European aspen and 32 – 45 MPa for hybrid aspen. The average <b>density</b> (<b>oven-dry)</b> was 284 kg/m 3 for European aspen and 221 kg/m 3 for hybrid aspen. Differences in mechanical properties correlated with differences in density.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} studies about the thermal {{conductivity}} coefficient of lightweight concrete using lightweight aggregates such as perlite, pumice, vermiculite, diatomite earth and expanded clay aggregates. However, researches {{related to the}} thermal conductivity of lightweight aggregates is limited. The lightweight aggregates are the main raw materials of lightweight construction material. In addition, the usability of lightweight aggregates as core material has been investigated in recent years. Thermal conductivity of lightweight aggregates significantly affects the thermal insulation performance of such composites. The thermal conductivity coefficients of lightweight aggregates are related {{to many of the}} physical properties of aggregates such as specific gravity, porosity, particle size etc. In this study, the effects of loose unit weight, the volume of aggregate matrix, porosity and grain size on the thermal conductivity of lightweight aggregates was investigated. Limestone aggregate (normal aggregate) was also used for comparison in the study. At first, all of the aggregates were divided into 4 different grain groups (2 - 1 mm, 1 - 0. 5 mm, 0. 5 - 0. 1 mm and < 0. 1 mm). The specific gravity, <b>oven-dry</b> particle <b>density</b> and loose unit weight values of aggregates were determined according to TS 699 and TS EN 1097 - 6 standards for each grain group, then the open and closed pore rates of aggregates were calculated with obtained data. Next, the aggregates were dried up until it reached a constant weight. Afterwards, the thermal conductivity coefficients at atmospheric pressure of the lightweight aggregates were measured according to the TS EN 12664 standard. By analyzing data, the thermal conductivity coefficients of lightweight aggregates were associated with their physical properties. As a result, an empirical formula was proposed in order to estimate the thermal conductivity coefficient depending on the physical properties of lightweight aggregates...|$|R
