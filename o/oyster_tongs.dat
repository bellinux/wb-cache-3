25|$|Oysters are {{harvested}} by simply gathering {{them from their}} beds. In very shallow waters, they can be gathered by hand or with small rakes. In somewhat deeper water, long-handled rakes or <b>oyster</b> <b>tongs</b> are used to reach the beds. Patent tongs can be lowered on a line to reach beds that are too deep to reach directly. In all cases, the task is the same: the oysterman scrapes oysters into a pile, and then scoops them up with the rake or tongs.|$|E

50|$|Sharpies {{first became}} popular in New Haven, Connecticut, {{towards the end}} of the 19th century. They came into use as a {{successor}} to the dugout log canoe and most likely were derived from the flatiron skiff. In an 1879 edition of Forest and Stream, a man named Goodsell claimed to have built the first sharpie with his brother in 1848 and his claim was never contested. These sharpies were typically used for <b>oyster</b> <b>tonging</b> and evolved to suit that work. They grew in popularity because they were easy to row, cheap to build and fast under sail.|$|R
5000|$|When the Chesapeake Bay {{area was}} first {{settled in the}} 1600s, it was a {{bountiful}} source of fish and other seafood. The area around Tilghman Island had particularly rich oyster beds. Watermen earned their livelihood {{from a variety of}} tasks: crabbing, <b>oystering,</b> <b>tonging</b> and dredging, seafood packing and canning, and guiding hunting parties. The maritime industry of shipbuilding became established on the island, and several types of boats developed for use in local conditions. [...] Log canoes with sails, adapted from the canoes of Powhatan tribes, are local to the area. So are skipjacks, two-masted sailboats used for oystering on Chesapeake Bay. Skipjacks have remained the primary boat for oystering due to a Maryland law banning the use of motors for oystering.|$|R

40|$|In the backwaters of Chesapeake Bay {{many people}} spend days {{crabbing}} or shellfishing alone from small boats, speak with local accents reminiscent of Old World forebears, believe and practice fundamental religion, and value {{their work on}} the water and raising families over education. Cut off by the water and marshes that provide their livelihood, they have tenaciously maintained their traditional ways of life. In this new book, Carolyn Ellis, who lived among these fisher folk, provides an intimate view of everyday life in two communities on the Bay. She describes the work of crabbing, <b>oyster</b> <b>tonging,</b> and <b>oyster</b> shucking in the seafood plants. She enters households to observe the people within their family circle and notes their activities within the community and their churches. Although similar in their economy and their resistance to outside control, the two communities have evolved different patterns of social organization. In one the church has come to play a dominant role. It serves as the only local government, even providing street lights and nursing services. It supports an ethic of hard work and the pursuit of a higher standard of living. In the other community, kin loyalties exercise paramount control. The people exhibit a marked individualism, and family members assist and fill in for one another. Living more on a day-to-day basis, they supplement their seasonal fishing income with wage labor. Yet even in these relatively isolated reaches of Chesapeake Bay the practices and values of the mass society intrude, and Carolyn Ellis shows the changes already taking place in the two communities. It is likely, she suggests, that they will go the way of other small towns in America, now hardly distinguishable from one another Alternatively, they might become tourist towns or museum communities, preserving a quaint blend of tradition and progress...|$|R
50|$|Shipbuilding {{declined}} {{after the}} War of 1812, but an oyster industry revived the town {{a few decades}} later. By the late nineteenth century, most households in the town {{had at least one}} person engaged in some aspect of this fishery, either <b>tonging</b> <b>oysters</b> from the nearby waters of Miles River and Eastern Bay, or engaged in the shucking houses that came to line the waterfront. One of these businesses, Coulbourne and Jewett, founded {{in the early years of}} the twentieth century, is notable as a black-owned enterprise, and it early on came to specialize in crabmeat. As a means of marketing crabmeat, owner Frederick Jewett devised a five level grading system (regular, claw, special, backfin, and lump) which is still used by the industry today.|$|R
