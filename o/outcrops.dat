5|$|The slate {{deposits}} of Wales belong to three geological series: Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian. The Cambrian deposits run south-west from Conwy to near Criccieth; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries {{and in the}} Nantlle Valley. There are smaller <b>outcrops</b> elsewhere, for example on Anglesey. The Ordovician deposits run south-west from Betws-y-Coed to Porthmadog; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog. There is another band of Ordovician slate further south, running from Llangynnog to Aberdyfi, quarried mainly in the Corris area, with a few <b>outcrops</b> in south-west Wales, notably Pembrokeshire. The Silurian deposits are mainly further east in the Dee valley and around Machynlleth.|$|E
5|$|The {{work which}} led to the {{recognition}} of Adiantum viridimontanum as a distinct taxon began in the early 20th Century. Following the discovery of disjunct specimens of western maidenhair fern, then classified as A.pedatum var. aleuticum, on the serpentine tableland of Mount Albert by Merritt Lyndon Fernald in 1905, botanists began to search for western maidenhair on ultramafic <b>outcrops</b> elsewhere in Quebec and Vermont. It was first identified in Vermont by L. Frances Jolley in 1922 at Belvidere Mountain in Eden. In 1983, William J. Cody transferred A.pedatum growing on serpentine, both in eastern and western North America, to A.pedatum ssp. calderi instead. Many of the stations for the fern in Vermont were described in 1985, in a survey of ultramafic <b>outcrops</b> in that state.|$|E

30|$|However, <b>outcrop</b> studies {{only provide}} limited 2 D/ 3 D {{information}} {{and it is}} necessary for the observed rock properties to be corrected to be comparable with the conditions at reservoir depth.

5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite <b>outcrops</b> along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|Drainage of the Widnes area is {{into the}} Mersey via Ditton, Steward's and Bower's Brooks. The bedrock {{of the area}} is rock from the Sherwood {{sandstone}} group. There are a few <b>outcrops</b> of sandstone but elsewhere the bedrock is covered by drift. Most of this consists of till except near {{the bank of the}} Mersey where it is recent alluvium.|$|E
5|$|During the Triassic (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert conditions, with higher {{ground in the}} Highlands and Southern Uplands providing sediment to the surrounding basins via flash floods. This is the origin of sandstone <b>outcrops</b> near Dumfries, Elgin and the Isle of Arran. Towards the close of this period sea levels began to rise and climatic conditions became less arid.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{geological}} definition, {{the seam}} <b>outcrop</b> definition, only includes {{areas where the}} coal seam is shallow making the soil black at the surface. Some coal mining areas {{to the east and}} west of the geologically defined Black Country are therefore excluded by this definition because the coal here is too deep down and does not <b>outcrop.</b> The seam <b>outcrop</b> definition excludes areas in North Worcestershire and South Staffordshire.|$|R
40|$|The {{steady state}} {{bifurcation}} {{structure of the}} double-gyre wind-driven ocean circulation is examined in a shallow water model where the upper layer is allowed to <b>outcrop</b> at the sea surface. In addition to the classical jet-up and jet-down multiple equilibria, we find a new regime in {{which one of the}} equilibrium solutions has a large <b>outcropping</b> region in the subpolar gyre. Time dependent simulations show that the <b>outcropping</b> solution equilibrates to a stable periodic orbit with a period of 8  months. Co-existing with the periodic solution is a stable steady state solution without <b>outcropping.</b> A numerical scheme that has the unique advantage of being differentiable while still allowing layers to <b>outcrop</b> at the sea surface is used for the analysis. In contrast, standard schemes for solving layered models with <b>outcropping</b> are non-differentiable and have an ill-defined Jacobian making them unsuitable for solution using Newton’s method. As such, our new scheme expands the applicability of numerical bifurcation techniques to an important class of ocean models whose bifurcation structure had hitherto remained unexplored...|$|R
