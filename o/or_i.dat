5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium shows enormous, and reversible, {{reaction}} rates {{with pure}} hydrogen, forming plutonium hydride. It also reacts readily with oxygen, forming PuO and PuO2 {{as well as}} intermediate oxides; plutonium oxide fills 40% more volume than plutonium metal. The metal reacts with the halogens, giving rise to compounds with the general formula PuX3 where X can be F, Cl, Br <b>or</b> <b>I</b> and PuF4 is also seen. The following oxyhalides are observed: PuOCl, PuOBr and PuOI. It will react with carbon to form PuC, nitrogen to form PuN and silicon to form PuSi2.|$|E

5|$|The halides ScX3, where X = Cl, Br, <b>or</b> <b>I,</b> {{are very}} soluble in water, but ScF3 is insoluble. In all four halides, the {{scandium}} is 6-coordinated. The halides are Lewis acids; for example, ScF3 dissolves {{in a solution}} containing excess fluoride ion to form 3−. The coordination number 6 is typical for Sc(III). In the larger Y3+ and La3+ ions, coordination numbers of 8 and 9 are common. Scandium(III) triflate is sometimes used as a Lewis acid catalyst in organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} missing B {{vitamins}} which were reclassified or {{determined not to}} be vitamins. For example, B9 is folic acid and five of the folates {{are in the range}} B11 through B16, forms of other vitamins already discovered, not required as a nutrient by the entire population (like B10, PABA for internal use), biologically inactive, toxic, or with unclassifiable effects in humans, or not generally recognised as vitamins by science, such as the highest-numbered, which some naturopath practitioners call B21 and B22. There are also nine lettered B complex vitamins (e.g. Bm). There are other D vitamins now recognised as other substances, which some sources of the same type number up to D7. The controversial cancer treatment laetrile was at one point lettered as vitamin B17. There appears to be no consensus on any vitamins Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y or Z, nor are there substances officially designated as Vitamins N <b>or</b> <b>I,</b> although the latter may have been another form of one of the other vitamins or a known and named nutrient of another type.|$|E
