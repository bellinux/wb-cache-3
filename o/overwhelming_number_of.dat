5|$|In 1987, {{the school}} {{reached its peak}} {{attendance}} with 35,945 students, resulting in SDSU being the largest university in California and 10th in the nation. Due to the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> students and available facilities and majors, the California State University Board of Trustees decided to limit enrollment to 33,000. However, in 1993, enrollment dropped to 26,800, the lowest attendance since 1973 {{as a result of}} the budget crisis of 1991.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers was {{released}} for Windows in February 2016, after being greenlit for release on digital distribution platform Steam. OS X and Linux versions were released in July and September 2016 respectively. The game received a positive reception from reviewers, with praise directed towards its sound design, unique visual style and challenging gameplay. However, some reviewers noted {{that during the}} latter stages of the game, the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> enemies and visual style {{made it difficult to}} understand what was happening. Critics likened the aesthetics, movement and shooting mechanics of Devil Daggers to Doom, Quake and other first-person shooters of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief {{of the invasion}} force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1950 Tibor Rubin {{was serving}} as a rifleman in Korea when his unit was forced to retreat and {{he was ordered to}} stay behind and keep the road open for the {{withdrawing}} unit. During the 24-hour battle he single-handedly fought off an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> North Korean troops, inflicting severe casualties on the attacking unit and assisted in the capture of many prisoners. A few months later Chinese forces staged a night-time assault on his unit and Rubin manned a machine gun allowing the unit to retreat southward, again inflicting heavy casualties on the attacking unit. During the battle he was severely wounded and was eventually captured by Chinese forces. Although the Chinese offered to release him early and return him to his native Hungary, he refused, remaining a prisoner and risking his life repeatedly by sneaking out at night to get food and medical supplies for other wounded prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} so popular that in 1999 the East Sussex county council made an appeal to Disney as the old wooden bridge had been worn down by an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> visitors. The company {{provided}} a substantial donation towards the estimated £30,000 needed to replace the bridge. Partly rebuilt in 1979, the donations from Disney, building firms {{and members of the}} public funded its complete reconstruction. The newly built and modernised bridge retained its precursor's original style. A plaque was also placed to commemorate the occasion and thank those who financially contributed to the project. The sport can still be played in Ashdown Forest to this day and the site regularly attracts tourists from as far afield as the United States and Japan. However, visitors are now advised to bring their own sticks, as previous visitors have caused damage to the trees in the vicinity.|$|E

25|$|As Gritti {{no longer}} {{controlled}} {{the development of}} Galeon, the previous functionality was restored in subsequent releases and some new features were added, though development got slow after the split.

25|$|On 10 October 2007, the MBTA {{introduced}} {{a pilot program}} in North, South, and Airport stations called T-Radio. The program would have been expanded to pipe in music, light news, weather, entertainment tips, and eight to ten minutes of commercials each hour to every MBTA subway station. After the agency received an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> e-mails— 1,800, mostly complaints— it decided to shelve the program on 25 October.|$|E
25|$|Despite the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Aztecs and the {{generally}} poor {{condition of the}} Spanish survivors, Cortés snatched victory from the jaws of defeat when he spotted the Aztec commander in his ornate and colourful feather costume, and immediately charged him with several horsemen, killing the Aztec commander. The Spanish suffered heavy losses, but were eventually victorious over the Aztecs, who then retreated.|$|R

This species were also found in well water {{in the rural areas}} of Gadap.|$|R
25|$|There are an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{mathematical}} models {{which are}} referred to as Boussinesq equations. This may easily lead to confusion, since often they are loosely referenced to as the Boussinesq equations, while in fact a variant thereof is considered. So it is more appropriate to call them Boussinesq-type equations. Strictly speaking, the Boussinesq equations is the above-mentioned set B, since it is used in the analysis in the remainder of his 1872 paper.|$|E
25|$|By 1910, the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{people in}} the city were Americans {{creating}} a settled environment. However, this period was short lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees – and capital – to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915.|$|E
25|$|Immediately thereafter, a {{substantial}} number of Moldovans began to apply for Romanian citizenship. Unofficial data from 2001 suggested that about 200,000 Moldovans also held a Romanian citizenship, despite the fact that dual citizenship was officially illegal in Moldova at the time. Due to the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> applications, the Romanian embassy imposed a moratorium in 2002. Dual citizenship became an election issue during the 2003 local elections in Moldova. In November that year, the Moldovan parliament passed a law which allowed dual citizenship; this applied to other countries besides Romania, particularly Russia and Ukraine.|$|E

They soon began to overpower and drive them back towards the wigwams, where the poor women and children were huddled together in terror.|$|R
25|$|The first {{recorded}} instance of perpetual adoration formally began in Avignon, France on 11 September 1226. To celebrate and give {{thanks for the}} victory over the Albigensians in the later battles of the Albigensian Crusade, King Louis VIII asked that the sacrament be placed {{on display at the}} Chapel of the Holy Cross. The <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> adorers brought the local bishop, Pierre de Corbie, to suggest that the exposition be continued indefinitely. With the permission of Pope Honorius III, the idea was ratified and the adoration continued there practically uninterrupted until the chaos of the French Revolution halted it from 1792.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War, {{the concern}} arose that the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> medals which were being awarded would devalue the {{prestige}} of those already awarded. The Military Medal for bravery in battle on land was therefore instituted on 25 March 1916, as an alternative award to the Distinguished Conduct Medal. The lesser Military Medal was usually awarded for bravery from this date and the Distinguished Conduct Medal was reserved for exceptional acts of bravery. Around 25,000 Distinguished Conduct Medals were awarded during the First World War, while approximately 1,900 were awarded during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Robert Van Niel in {{his book}} The Emergence of the Modern Indonesian Elite wrote that {{many members of the}} Sarekat Islam were former members of the Jamiat Kheir. Although, as stated in the Budi Utomos {{resolution}} in 1911, a decision was made to no longer accept non-native Indonesians as members, many Arabs remained members of or actively collaborated with Sarekat Islam. In Batavia, the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> registrations from people to become members of Sarekat Islam made the Sarekat Islam in March 1913 decided to stop admitting new members. The intention was to avoid the administration become chaotic and out of control.|$|E

Various metabolic inhibitors were tested to determine whether they would suppress the growth of Bacillus cells without appreciably affecting the staphylococcal growth. The use of Staphylococcus Medium No. 110 modified by the addition of 0. 75 mM sodium azide appears to be practical for the isolation <b>of</b> small <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> coagulase-positive staphylococci from frozen meat pot pies...|$|R

After Winter's men, including Captain Peretz, disobey his orders and refuse to kill Irwin, Winter fatally shoots Irwin in the back as he lifts the flag.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this was}} successful, {{most of the}} men in the sortie were quickly killed before he and other {{survivors}} escaped into the fort, which subsequently proved insufficient to hold off the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> the Comanche raid.
