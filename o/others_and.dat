40|$|THE rate of gastric {{emptying}} in dogs {{is determined}} primar-ily by the particle size (Meyer <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1979), energy den-sity (Meyer <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1994, Wyse <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2001) <b>and</b> osmolarity (Lin <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1993) of the ingested meal. In addition, {{the rate of}} solid-phase emptying may {{be affected by the}} age (Weber <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2002), <b>and</b> body size of the dog (Allan <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1996), <b>and</b> by stress (Gue <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1989, Mistiaen <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2002). All of these variables combine to determine the rate at which food is delivered from the stom-ach to the duodenum, and their complex inter-relationship accounts for the wide variability that has been reported for the rate of gastric emptying in human beings (Roland <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1990), <b>and</b> dogs (Lester <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1999, Wyse <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2001).

In wild ruminants, such as bighorn sheep (Ovis canadiensis), pasteurellosis {{is a major}} cause of mortality (Onderka <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1988, Callan <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1991) while in cattle acute pleuropneumonia is caused by P haemolytica (Whiteley <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1992).

40|$|RENAL {{dysplasia}} (RD) is {{a developmental}} disorder of the renal parenchyma characterised by anomalous differentiation of the nephrons and collecting ducts (Woolf <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2004). In human medicine, RD {{is one of}} the principal causes of childhood end-stage renal failure. In veterinary medicine, it has been described in several species, including cattle (Dunham <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1989, Simon <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1999, Ohba <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2001, Castro <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2007, Maxie <b>and</b> Newman 2007, Aresu <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2009, Philbey <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2009). In Japanese Black cattle, RD shows autosomal recessive inheritance, caused by CLDN 16 mutations (Hirano <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2000, Ohba <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2000, Hirano <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2002). These mutations affect {{one of the members of}} the claudin family of genes which plays an important role in the formation of tight junctions in the kidney (Simon <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1999). In Japanese Black cattle, RD is classified into two types, according to two independent CLDN 16 mutations (Hirano <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2002), but no morphological or histopathological differences between the two types have been reported.
