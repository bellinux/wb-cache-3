5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> trails in the park, {{which has been}} gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> {{stories of the}} war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, {{might have been the}} source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E

25|$|By far, Gurney Drive {{has been}} {{touted as the}} most popular food {{destination}} in Penang, offering {{a wide variety of}} Penang dishes and seafood snacks. However, in recent years, prices at the Gurney Drive Hawker Centre have burgeoned due to its increasing popularity among tourists from outside Penang. The other notable places within George Town to sample Penang cuisine include New Lane, Kimberley Street, Chulia Street and Penang Road, with the latter famous for the two chendol stalls nestled at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> streets. Burmah Road at Pulau Tikus is also famous for a number of dishes, such as Hokkien mee. Meanwhile, the old market at Air Itam {{has become one of the}} more well-known places to sample asam laksa. Another popular Penang dish, char kway teow, can be found all over the city, with the varying opinions on the best-tasting char kway teow include Siam Road, Burmah Road and Carnavon Street.|$|E
25|$|Not {{directly}} on the street but {{a short distance away}} on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> streets stands the Palazzo Belgioioso, one of the masterpieces of Milan's Neoclassical architecture. The building is certainly one of the finest examples of the Neoclassical citizens' residences and was a haunt of Milan's intellectuals. It was designed in 1772 by Giuseppe Piermarini who in this instance abandoned the sober and austere style of early Neoclassicism, building an imposing and highly decorated mansion which dominates the street. Here too, the most lavishly decorated part of the facade is the slightly protruding central section with a series of four giant columns, an entablature and a tympanum enclosed by pilasters. The ground floor is finished in rusticated bugnato ashlar, the first floor, separated from the second with bas-reliefs of heraldic symbols, has windows crowned with garlands and decorative mouldings. Some of the rooms still have period decorations, the most famous of which are the gallery decorated with frescoes by Martin Knoller and stuccos by Giocondo Albertolli. Rinaldo's room, also decorated by Knoller, was inspired by Torquato Tasso's epic poem Jerusalem Delivered.|$|E

25|$|The chief synagogue is very {{ancient and}} has many peculiarities. There are several modern {{additions}} to it, {{but the main}} structure is dated by the Abbe Chagnot {{as early as the}} fourth century. It has several inscriptions, some carved on its walls, others painted on them. One is as late as 1861, another as early as 834. The latter is on a chapel stated to have been erected by Mar Ali ben Nathan b. Mebasser b. HaAram....Hebrew inscription... Only four letters are starred, so that the date is probably 1145, sel.=834. The local Jews, however, assume that all the letters count in the perat, but that no thousand is omitted, so that the date would be 654 sel., i.e., 345 of the common era! The letters are certainly archaic, so early an inscription should not be accepted as such without further evidence. There are several chapels surrounding the main building, evidently added from time to time, as the community grew. In each of these minyan is separately held. The chief peculiarity of the Aleppo synagogue is a raised pulpit called the Kiseh Eliyahu approached by a flight of some twenty steps and still used for the solemnization of a Brit milah. Over the synagogue there is a yeshivah and in a secret chamber in the eaves of the roof of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> chapels is the genizah.|$|E
500|$|An early January 1999 Marist Institute of Public Opinion {{poll showed}} Giuliani {{trailing}} Clinton by 10 points. [...] By January 2000, the Marist poll showed Giuliani up by 9 points. [...] Giuliani's tactics involved intentionally baiting the Clinton campaign with deliberate overstatements, keeping them off balance and {{behind in the}} response cycle. [...] Giuliani emphasized his depiction of Clinton as a carpetbagger. [...] He made a one-day visit to Little Rock, Arkansas, where he announced he would fly the Arkansas state flag over New York's City Hall. [...] When Hillary Clinton visited New York from Washington, he said, [...] "I hope she knows the way. I hope she doesn’t get lost on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> streets." [...] Giuliani's campaign prepared a 315-page opposition research dossier that {{went back to her}} time at Wellesley College; it included eleven pages of what they termed [...] "Stupid Actions and Remarks". [...] The Giuliani campaign had no problems raising money, getting over 40percent of its funds from out-of-state and outraising Clinton overall two-to-one.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the episode}} was {{completed}} in the Upper Boat Studios, particularly the interior car scenes. For this, only one car set was used, with it being redecorated for each different car. The cars were decorated to look like they had been lived in, and incorporated futuristic and well-known home objects. Brannigan and Valerie's children were played by real kittens, which proved difficult to direct. The production team shot for four days in the [...] "6-foot by 6-foot" [...] car, which Davies called a [...] "nightmare" [...] because not many camera angles were available and only one crew member could adjust the props and lighting at a time. In addition, smoke was generated around the car so it would {{blend in with the}} CGI smoke from the CGI cars. The small set was intended to benefit the actors, as they would feel claustrophobic. For the scene in which the Doctor jumps from car to car, the underside of a car was built and suspended ten to fifteen feet above the top of the car set with a green screen all around to get as many angles as possible. Davies preferred action sequences that moved up and down, a scale that is not seen much on television. The Temple of Peace in Cardiff was the location for the Darkened Temple, as well as the TV Studio with news reporter Sally Calypso. The production team spent two days filming there, on 18 and 19 September 2006. The undercity where the Doctor and Martha arrive was filmed at the Cardiff Bay maltings and the Ely Papermill, which were designed to look in disrepair. The artificial rain proved difficult in some shots, as the production team had trouble getting <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> walls wet.|$|E

40|$|Two {{polarizing}} sheets {{have their}} polarizing axis at 45 ? to <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheets, {{as shown in}} Figure 1. Initially the two sheets are placed {{on top of each}} other such that their polarization axes are parallel, so light can pass through the two polarizing sheets. When the top sheet is turned upside down by rotating it about an axis parallel to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>the</b> two polarization axes become perpendicular, and no light is transmitted. This demonstration has a counterintuitive aspect. In most cases polarizing sheets are cut so that the polarization axis is in the same direction as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> so flipping <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheets in the above manner will not affect the light coming through.
