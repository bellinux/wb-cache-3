5|$|The missile {{strikes on}} al-Qaeda's Afghan {{training}} camps, aimed at preempting more attacks and killing bin Laden, damaged the installations and inflicted an uncertain number of casualties; however, bin Laden {{was not present}} at the time.

50|$|A {{major issue}} during the {{campaign}} were allegations that Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral campaign benefited from $357,000 in illegal contributions.

5|$|When the town's ruffians vandalize the half-restored carousel, {{the captain}} redoubles his efforts. By {{this time he}} has found, to his displeasure, that Mike's {{favorite}} pastime is to officiate the weekly cock fights, and the two have a falling-out. Mike refuses to make good <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of a much needed part for the carousel, unless the soldier agrees to fight a dog. The veteran reluctantly agrees to the fight during which he kills the dog. After installing the last piece that completes the carousel's restoration, he lays the dog's body inside it, starts it up and walks away, while the townspeople look on.|$|E
5|$|With {{some notable}} exceptions, Reformed Christians baptize infants who {{are born to}} believing parents. Reformed Christians do so {{on the basis of}} the {{continuity}} from the old covenant between God and Israel and the new covenant with the church, since infants were circumcised under the old covenant. They also see God's saving purpose in the new covenant as having to do with families as well as individuals. Because Reformed Christians believe baptism must be embraced by faith to have any benefit, they recognize that faith may come later in life rather than preceding baptism. Infants may also be said to possess a seed of faith which will come to fruition later, or baptism may be administered based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of faith offered by their sponsors (usually their parents) which will be kept at a later age.|$|E
5|$|A {{bipartisan}} {{group of}} MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a Conciliation Bill {{that would have}} brought the vote to a million women, {{so long as they}} owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day Black Friday, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the Crown Office in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.|$|E

5|$|Wallace Glenn Wilkinson (December 12, 1941 – July 5, 2002) was an American {{businessman}} and politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1987 to 1991, {{he served as}} the state's 57th governor. Wilkinson {{dropped out of college}} at the University of Kentucky in 1962 to attend to a book retail business he started. The business rapidly became a national success, and Wilkinson re-invested his profits in real estate, farming, transportation, banking, coal, and construction ventures, becoming extremely wealthy. In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After running behind two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant James Carville. Wilkinson campaigned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of no new taxes and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state. Wilkinson surprised most political observers by winning the primary and going on to defeat his Republican challenger in the general election.|$|E
5|$|George's French opponents {{encouraged}} rebellion by the Jacobites, {{the supporters}} of the Roman Catholic claimant to the British throne, James Francis Edward Stuart, often known as the Old Pretender. Stuart {{was the son of}} James II, who had been deposed in 1688 and replaced by his Protestant relations. Two prior rebellions in 1715 and 1719 had failed. In July 1745, the Old Pretender's son, Charles Edward Stuart, popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed in Scotland, where support for his cause was highest. George, who was summering in Hanover, returned to London at the end of August. The Jacobites defeated British forces in September at the Battle of Prestonpans, and then moved south into England. The Jacobites failed to gain further support, and the French reneged <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of help. Losing morale, the Jacobites retreated back into Scotland. On 16/27 April 1746, Charles faced George's military-minded son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, in the Battle of Culloden, the last pitched battle fought on British soil. The ravaged Jacobite troops were routed by the government army. Charles escaped to France, but many of his supporters were caught and executed. Jacobitism was all but crushed; no further serious attempt was made at restoring the House of Stuart. The War of the Austrian Succession continued until 1748, when Maria Theresa was recognized as Archduchess of Austria. The peace was celebrated by a fête in Green Park, London, for which Handel composed Music for the Royal Fireworks.|$|E
25|$|During the 2001 election, the BC Liberals also campaigned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> {{to hold a}} consultative {{referendum}} seeking a mandate from the general public to negotiate treaties with First Nations. In the spring of 2002, the government held the referendum.|$|E

Coming {{on the heels of}} the $3.2 million that the team had to pay for joining the NBA, this left Boe short of cash, and he was forced to renege <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promised</b> pay raise for Erving. Erving refused to play for the Nets under these conditions and refused to report to camp.|$|R
5000|$|The {{incumbent}} president Borut Pahor announced {{his intention to}} run {{for a second term}} in December 2016. A member of Social Democrats, he later stated he intends to run as an independent candidate. Pahor is seen as a clear frontrunner to win the election. [...] Milan Jazbec, Slovenian Ambassador to Macedonia, announced he would run as an independent candidate. Jazbec stated that his decision was based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promised</b> to the late Slovenian statesman France Bučar, that he would become actively involved with national politics.|$|R
50|$|Turnout {{was high}} (70%). The White House was {{encouraged}} by the relatively low levels of violence during polling, with one insurgent group making good <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promised</b> election day moratorium on attacks, even {{going so far as}} to guard the voters from attack. President Bush frequently pointed to the election as a sign of progress in rebuilding Iraq. However, post-election violence threatened to plunge the nation into civil war, before the situation began to calm in 2007. The election results themselves produced a shaky coalition government headed by Nouri al-Maliki.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to being {{the leader of a}} great political party and the head of Her Majesty's Government, the modern Prime Minister directs the law-making process, enacting into law his or her party's programme. For example, Tony Blair, whose Labour party was elected in 1997 partly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> to enact a British Bill of Rights and to create devolved governments for Scotland and Wales, subsequently stewarded through Parliament the Human Rights Act (1998), the Scotland Act (1998) and the Government of Wales Act (1998).|$|E
25|$|Luvera {{ran for the}} Washington State senate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> to fix {{the main}} road into the city of Anacortes. The road was near the ocean and prone to flooding. Luvera won a senate seat and served one term from 1953 to 1957. During his term, Luvera secured funding for a new segment of highway built on a {{hillside}} safely above floodways. In 2000, in honor of Luvera’s efforts to create the roadway, the Washington Senate voted to name it the Paul N. Luvera, Sr. Memorial Highway.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May 2010, the {{defeated}} Liberal Democrat candidate Elwyn Watkins lodged a petition against {{the election of}} Phil Woolas (Labour) in Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency. The petition challenged leaflets issued by Woolas' campaign as having contained false statements of fact concerning Watkins' personal character, which is an illegal practice under section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. The statements attempted to link Watkins with Muslim extremists and death threats to Woolas, accused him of reneging <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> {{to live in the}} constituency, and implied that his campaign was funded by illegal foreign political donations.|$|E

25|$|Pombo is {{especially}} {{known for his}} defense of private property rights. This was spurred by the Southern Pacific Railroad's abandonment of the Altamont Pass route through Tracy. Pombo owned land adjacent to the abandoned railroad line. Pombo argued that the abandoned easement should legally revert to the adjacent property owners (such as himself) {{rather than to the}} local park district. He argued that as the easement was granted based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> that the land would be used for railroad purposes only, that the easements ended entirely when they were abandoned. Pombo's case resulted in Congress passing the Rails to Trails Act.|$|E
25|$|His {{first elected}} office was {{president}} of the New Castle County Council, elected in 2000 and serving four years before being elected county executive in 2004. He was the endorsed candidate of the New Castle County Democratic Party in 2008, and was re-nominated by the party on September 9, 2008. Coons was re-elected on November 4, 2008, unopposed in the general election. In his six years in office as county executive, Coons balanced the budget with a surplus in fiscal year 2010 by cutting spending and raising taxes. As New Castle county executive, Coons raised taxes despite having campaigned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> not to increase them. New Castle County maintained a AAA bond rating throughout his tenure.|$|E
25|$|No new rail {{projects}} {{were able to}} get off the ground for many years until the 1990s when several factors combined to make the idea more palatable to area politicians. Governor Jesse Ventura and Minnesota Transportation Commissioner Elwyn Tinklenberg heavily promoted the idea of rail transport, and significant amounts of money became available from the federal government. Previous governors had advocated light rail, but {{had not been able to}} get legislation passed. Governor Tim Pawlenty had campaigned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> to fight the expansion of light rail, but altered his opinions after taking office. He also initially opposed the Northstar Line commuter rail project, which is a rail corridor north of Minneapolis, but changed his mind about that project in January 2004 when a scaled-back version was shown to have good potential.|$|E
40|$|A {{first order}} linear {{differential}} equation {{is used to}} describe the dynamics of an investment fund that promises more than it can deliver, also known as a Ponzi scheme. The model is based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promised,</b> unrealistic interest rate; on the actual, realized nominal interest rate; on the rate at which new deposits are accumulated and on the withdrawal rate. Conditions on these parameters are given for the fund to be solvent or to collapse. The model is fitted to data available on Charles Ponzi’s 1920 eponymous scheme and illustrated with a philanthropic version of the scheme...|$|R
50|$|In February 1912 the Liberal Government led by Joseph Ward {{was saved}} from defeat in a {{confidence}} {{only by the}} casting vote of the speaker. Ward made good <b>on</b> <b>an</b> earlier <b>promise</b> and resigned the premiership.|$|R

25|$|On 9 July 1787 as Nicol and Mary Boydell {{were walking}} up Prince's Street (now the {{southern}} section of Wardour Street) near Leicester Square, Mary Boydell {{was shot by}} Dr. John Elliot {{with a pair of}} pistols tied together. Although the shots had been close enough to burn half her cloak, Mary was only bruised by the attack. Elliot was a former suitor of Mary's who had become convinced that she had reneged <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> to marry him, and that he had thereby lost a share in what he believed to be John Boydell's £30,000 fortune. Elliot was also the developer of the idea that different elements of the retina respond to different portions of the spectrum of light, a theory advanced in a posthumously published medical textbook.|$|E
25|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} his 1999 mayoral reelection {{campaign}} were former Mayor Frank Jordan and Clint Reilly. They criticized Brown for spending the city's US$1billion in budget growth without addressing the city's major problems and creating {{an environment in}} city hall of corruption and patronage. Tom Ammiano was a late write-in candidate and he faced Brown in the runoff election. Brown won reelection by a 20 percent margin. He was supported by most major developers and business interests. Ammiano campaigned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> that he would {{raise the minimum wage}} to US$11 per hour and scrutinize corporate business taxes. Brown repeatedly claimed that Ammiano would raise taxes. President Clinton recorded a telephone message on Brown's behalf. Brown's campaign spent US$3.1million to Ammiano's US$300,000. The 1999 mayoral race was the subject of the documentary See How They Run.|$|E
25|$|Though debt {{almost always}} {{increased}} under every {{president in the}} latter half of the 20th century, it declined as a percentage of GDP under all Presidents after 1950 and prior to Reagan. In addition to the fiscal deficits, the U.S. started to have large trade deficits. Also it was during his second term that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed. Vice President George H. W. Bush was elected to succeed Reagan in 1988. The early Bush Presidency's economic policies were sometimes seen as a continuation of Reagan's policies, but in the early 1990s, Bush went back <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> and increased taxes in a compromise with Congressional Democrats. He ended his presidency on a moderate note, signing regulatory bills such as the Americans With Disabilities Act, and negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1992, Bush and third-party candidate Ross Perot lost to Democrat Bill Clinton.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 October 2015 the Liberal Party of Canada under Justin Trudeau won a {{majority}} in part <b>on</b> <b>a</b> campaign <b>promise</b> to not purchase the F-35, but instead [...] "one of the many, lower-priced options that better match Canada’sdefence needs".|$|R

50|$|The {{settlement}} is traditionally credited to its patron saint, a disciple of Saint Beuno, {{who was supposed}} to have been resurrected nearby. Both Aelhaiarn and Beuno were noble monks from Powys who came north under the patronage of King Cadfan of Gwynedd. They settled in the area of Clynnog and Llanaelhaearn after Cadfan's son Cadwallon reneged <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>promised</b> grant elsewhere; his cousin, shamed by his behaviour, made good on his promises by donating his own land for their monastery. The nearby Afon Erch includes a stone whose petrosomatoglyph is traditionally taken to represent the marks of the kneeling Saint Beuno, worn through during his nightly visits to pray in the middle of the stream.|$|R
