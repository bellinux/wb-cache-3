5|$|The Turin {{panel has}} {{suffered}} heavy <b>overpainting</b> and cracking along the vertical join. The marbleized reddish-brown paint on its reverse is heavily worn. In the 20th century the panel underwent three restorations and extensive technical analyses. The earliest, in 1952, removed <b>overpainting</b> and repaired pigment loss to Francis's tonsure, Leo's cowl {{and areas of}} vegetation between the two figures. Restorers discovered an irretrievably lost inscription on a rock adjacent to the seraph-Christ, and evidence of earlier <b>overpainting</b> of one of Leo's feet. Continued paint loss and cracking along the join required further restoration in 1970, when a fixing agent was applied to prevent cracking, and Francis's tonsure was repainted.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{small areas}} were left unrestored, {{in order to}} {{maintain}} a physical record of the previous restorations that had taken place, for example, an area left with <b>overpainting</b> and candle wax, and another area demonstrating the attempt to counteract salination with oil.|$|E
5|$|The underdrawing {{is visible}} through modern {{technical}} analysis, revealing the main group of figures and contour {{lines in the}} folds and drape of the clothing. The angels' wings to Mary's left are visible, but not those to the right, probably because of later <b>overpainting.</b> In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends {{far to the left}} of the angel, but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution.|$|E

A crowd of villagers surround and confront a red-coated soldier standing over a dead baby (<b>overpainted</b> as a bundle), and a seated woman grieves with her dead baby on her lap (changed to a bundle).|$|R

5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by <b>overpainting</b> details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the lunettes.|$|E
5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join {{of the wooden}} panels was severe enough to warrant a third restoration in 1982. Raking light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further <b>overpainting</b> was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E
25|$|Overglaze decorations of earthenware, Faience or {{porcelain}} were traditionally {{made with}} carefully outlined designs that were then colored in. Later designs represented flowers, landscapes or portraits with little <b>overpainting</b> or blending of the colors. In the 20th century china painting techniques became more like oil painting, with blended colors and designs in which attention to light gives three-dimensional effects. More recently a style more like watercolor painting {{has become more}} common.|$|E

50|$|In 1576, the Sgraffitohaus was built. In 1928, the <b>overpainted</b> {{paintings}} were discovered and uncovered again.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} {{support is}} a canvas of fine thread, {{and has been}} lined, with white lead applied {{to the rear of}} the lining. The painting has two grounds, one a thick red-brown, the other a thin gray. The figure was initially drawn with brown underpaint left exposed in several places, now abraded. The face and hands are in good condition; extensively damaged areas in the figure and background have been covered with black <b>overpainting,</b> some of which was removed during a 1992 restoration.|$|E
25|$|The oldest known {{surviving}} {{example of}} the icon of Christ Pantocrator was painted in encaustic on panel in the sixth or seventh century, and survived the period of destruction of images during the Iconoclastic disputes that twice racked the Eastern church, 726 to 787 and 814 to 842. It was preserved in Saint Catherine's Monastery, in the remote desert of the Sinai. The gessoed panel, finely painted using a wax medium on a wooden panel, had been coarsely overpainted around the face and hands at some time around the thirteenth century. When the <b>overpainting</b> was cleaned in 1962, the ancient image was revealed {{to be a very}} high-quality icon, probably produced in Constantinople.|$|E
500|$|Generally the {{condition}} is good. Memling painted the work on two panels of about 28cm each. The dated and inscribed frame, probably the original, was discarded in 1830. There have been three documented restorations. The painting had been pierced by an arrow when Anton Radziwill found it; he had it restored and the damage repaired. At that time the Virgin's mantle and the flesh tones sustained heavy <b>overpainting.</b> The original frame was discarded, but its inscription was inserted into the new frame. A description of the original frame suggests it carried a coat-of-arms, perhaps belonging to Jerzy Radziwill. The second restoration was after its exhibition in Bruges in 1902; and the third when Lehman had it restored and transferred to canvas sometime after 1928. The painting survived the transfer without significant damage. [...] A late-19th century photograph shows wood on all four sides of the painted surface, which suggests the edges may have been extended during the transfer. Areas that suffered paint loss and <b>overpainting</b> are Gabriel's cope and the vase holding the flowers.|$|E

25|$|<b>Overpaint</b> is a {{technique}} {{that is used to}} cover imperfection on the surface of a ceramic piece. Differences can be seen to the naked eye due to discoloration, being matched poorly, and change in texture or gloss. subtle difference can also been seen by restorers by using lighting and magnification. <b>Overpaint</b> and surface coatings can be removed either mechanically or with the use of solvents.|$|R

500|$|Further {{conservation}} {{was undertaken}} between 1983 and 1989 using a stereo microscope. Restorers removed varnish that had turned brown {{as well as}} layers of old fillers– one of which contained the pigment viridian, not available until 1859. They stripped paint additions from the mountain peaks, Leo's robe and {{in the area around}} Francis's tonsure. The removal of <b>overpainting</b> revealed an X that had been scratched into the original paint on the upper right stones at some unknown time. According to Butler, the removal of pigment exposed underlying paint in [...] "amazingly good condition".|$|E
500|$|Other {{characteristics}} of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details, the dramatic landscape background in which the world {{seems to be in}} a state of flux, the subdued colouring, and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils laid on much like tempera and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable. Vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even [...] "the most confident master... despair and lose heart." [...] The perfect state of preservation and {{the fact that there is}} no sign of repair or <b>overpainting</b> is rare in a panel painting of this date.|$|E
2500|$|The single {{exception}} to {{the style of the}} borders is a destroyed page, with the main miniature a Virgo inter virgines [...] by Hand H. [...] The border here is in a richer and later 15th century style, from 1430 at the earliest, partly <b>overpainting</b> a normal border, which has also been partly scraped off. This is probably because the original border contained a portrait of a previous owner, of which traces can be seen.|$|E

The $12 million {{restoration}} project included “recreating and replacing the rosette that fell, reinforcing each rosette with steel cables, and installing LED lighting.” The NYPL commissioned EverGreene Architectural Arts to recreate the mural in the Bill Blass Public Catalog Room, which had “suffered irreparable discoloration, <b>overpainting</b> and water damage” during its 105-year history. The NYPL also installed a $2.6 million book delivery system, using a conveyor belt and 24 book carts that could each carry up to [...] through the library's eleven levels.

2500|$|The {{underside}} or verso {{generally has}} a simpler and often less elevated subject, with fewer, larger figures, and usually includes heraldry, with {{the arms of}} both parents shown. [...] Scenes {{with one or two}} naked boy toddlers, with the coats of arms of both parents at the sides, are especially popular. [...] The arms of the mother's family traditionally take the right hand side, but in some examples the arms have been changed by <b>overpainting</b> them. [...] Inscriptions in the field or round the rim sometimes provide the date of the fortunate event, providing art historians with a useful fixed point. [...] Like some other types of art, such as the [...] "Otto prints", desci were mostly expected to be decorated in what was considered to be feminine taste, although how the design was selected is unclear. [...] In an example painted by Masaccio's brother two boys wrestle, with certainly one and probably both using the hold of pulling on the other's penis with one hand and hair with the other (see gallery).|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the first}} half of the 1940s, Krasner {{struggled}} with creating art that satisfied her critical nature. She was highly affected by seeing Pollock's work for the first time in 1942, causing her to reject Hofmann's cubist style which required working from a human or still life model. She called the work produced during this frustrating time her [...] "grey slab paintings." [...] She would create these paintings by working on a canvas for months, <b>overpainting,</b> scraping paint off, rubbing paint off, and adding more paint until the canvas was nearly monochrome from so much paint build up. [...] She eventually would destroy these works, which is why there is only one painting that exists from this time period. Krasner's extensive knowledge of cubism was the source of her creative problem since she needed her work to be more expressive and gestural to be considered contemporary and relevant. In the fall of 1945, Krasner destroyed many of her cubist works she created during her studies with Hans Hofmann, although the majority of paintings created from 1938 to 1943 survived this reevaluation.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Overpainting</b> {{can mean}} the final layers of paint, over some type of underpainting, {{in a system of}} working in layers. It can also mean later paint added by restorers, or an artist or dealer wishing to [...] "improve" [...] or update an old image—a very common {{practice}} in the past. The underpainting gives a context in which the paint-strokes of the <b>overpainting</b> become more resonant and powerful. When properly done, <b>overpainting</b> does not need to completely obscure the underpainting. It is precisely the interaction of the two that gives the most interesting effects.|$|E
