5|$|In general, {{the party}} {{maintained}} excellent health. The exception was the ship's engineer, Allan Ramsay, {{who had been}} taken ill with a heart condition in the Falklands during the <b>outward</b> <b>voyage.</b> He chose to remain with the expedition, but he grew steadily weaker as winter progressed. He died on 6 August, and was buried on the island.|$|E
5|$|Despite the relaxed atmosphere, {{relations}} between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain—often {{in front of}} the crew and the native Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the <b>outward</b> <b>voyage,</b> now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs was {{selected}} to tour Australia in the 1907–08 season with an MCC team, given his opportunity by the unavailability of several leading players. Throughout the <b>outward</b> <b>voyage,</b> Hobbs was severely affected by sea-sickness, a condition which afflicted him on sea voyages throughout his life; in later tours, he travelled overland {{as far as possible}} to reduce his time on ships. Consequently, he missed the first two games of the tour against the Australian state teams. His appearances were further limited by the reluctance of the MCC captain, Arthur Jones, to select him. He played in only two of the early matches, failing on both occasions, and was left out of the team for the first Test match. After England lost the game, Hobbs was chosen for the second Test. Hobbs made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at Melbourne Cricket Ground. Opening the England batting on the second day, Hobbs scored 83 runs in 182 minutes. Eventually, England needed 282 to win and did so by one wicket; Hobbs scored 28. He retained his place {{for the rest of the}} series. In the fourth match, he scored 57 on a pitch badly affected by rain; by adopting a policy of attacking the bowling he hit ten fours. He concluded his series with an innings of 72 in the final game, but could not prevent a third successive English defeat—the home side won the five-match series 4–1. He scored 302 runs in the Tests at an average of 43.14. In other first-class matches, he scored centuries against Tasmania and Victoria, totalling 876 runs at 41.71.|$|E

25|$|By the 1930s most British {{shipping}} companies specified oil fuel for new steamships {{because it was}} more economical. Booth, however, still specified coal because it was cheaper, and as the company's ships carried little cargo on <b>outward</b> <b>voyages</b> to South America and it considered it could afford larger coal bunkers. Anselms bunkers had capacity for 980 long tons of coal.|$|R
25|$|From October 1939 until 1940 Aguila {{continued}} her peacetime run between Liverpool and the Canary Islands. Her only convoy protection was on <b>outward</b> <b>voyages</b> from Liverpool to the North Atlantic west of Portugal, {{where she would}} leave the convoy to enter neutral Portuguese waters and proceed to Lisbon unescorted. After calling at Lisbon she would continue unescorted to Las Palmas and Tenerife, and return unescorted to Liverpool.|$|R

25|$|With so {{many players}} under consideration, it was {{difficult}} to predict who would go to the West Indies in the winter and that question became even more complex when several players decided not to go. Bedser, Compton, Edrich, Hutton, Wright and Yardley from the 1947 series all declined the tour before the squad was selected, as did Trevor Bailey who was in contention for a place. With Yardley missing, MCC reappointed pre-war captain Gubby Allen to lead the party but he was the first in a spate of injuries when he damaged a leg muscle on the <b>outward</b> <b>voyage.</b> Following further injuries to Dennis Brookes and Joe Hardstaff junior, Allen asked MCC to send reinforcements and Hutton then changed his mind, flying out just in time to play against British Guiana.|$|E

25|$|Empire Drayton was {{transferred}} to the Belgian Government shortly after completion. She was placed under the management of Compagnie Maritime Belge SA, but would later be managed by Agence Maritime Internationale. She departed from the Tyne on 10 March 1942 to join Convoy FN 651, which had departed from Southend, Essex the previous day and arrived at Methil, Fife on 11 March. She then joined Convoy EN 58, which departed on 13 March and arrived at Oban, Argyllshire on 16 March. Belgian Sailor left the convoy at Loch Ewe and sailed to New York, United States, where she arrived on 2 April. She departed from New York on 28 April for Cape Town, South Africa, arriving on 4 June. Over the next four months, Belgian Sailor made a round trip to Alexandria, Egypt, calling at Durban, Aden, Port Sudan, Suez and Port Said on the <b>outward</b> <b>voyage,</b> and Port Said, Suez, Aden and Lourenço Marques, Mozambique on the return voyage. She arrived back at Cape Town on 14 October.|$|E
500|$|Huggan died on 10 December. Bligh {{attributed}} this to [...] "the {{effects of}} intemperance and indolence... {{he never would}} be prevailed on to take half a dozen turns upon deck at a time, through the whole course of the voyage". For all his earlier favoured status, Christian did not escape Bligh's wrath. He was often humiliated by the captain—sometimes {{in front of the}} crew and the Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the <b>outward</b> <b>voyage,</b> now became increasingly common. On 5 January 1789 three members of the crew—Charles Churchill, John Millward and William Muspratt—deserted, taking a small boat, arms and ammunition. Muspratt had recently been flogged for neglect. Among the belongings Churchill left on the ship was a list of names that Bligh interpreted as possible accomplices in a desertion plot—the captain later asserted that the names included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh was persuaded that his protégé was not planning to desert, and the matter was dropped. Churchill, Millward and Muspratt were found after three weeks and, on their return to the ship, were flogged.|$|E
500|$|Earl Camden sailed from Canton {{with the}} rest of the fleet on 31 January 1804, bound for England. By virtue of his {{seniority}} Dance was appointed commodore of the fleet of 11 [...] "country" [...] ships, and 16 East Indiamen. The fleet that had been assembled was the richest to date, carrying cargoes with an estimated value of £8million, (approximately £ in present-day terms). Dance had been taken seriously ill at Bombay during the <b>outward</b> <b>voyage,</b> but had recovered in time to sail with the convoy. The fleet did not have any naval escorts, and though the East Indiamen were heavily armed for merchants, carrying nominal batteries of between 30 and 36 guns, they were no match for disciplined and professional naval forces. Not all of their listed armament was always carried, but to give the illusion of greater strength, fake gunports were often painted on the hulls, in the hope of distant observers mistaking them for 64-gun ships of the Royal Navy. By the time the fleet approached the Strait of Malacca on 14 February, Dance's convoy had swelled to include 16 East Indiamen, 11 country ships, a Portuguese merchant ship from Macau, and a vessel from Botany Bay in Australia. Although the HEIC had provided the small, armed brig Ganges as an escort, this vessel could only dissuade pirates; it could not hope to confront a French warship. As they neared the entrance to the straits suspicious sails were sighted in the south west. Dance sent some of his ships to investigate, and it was soon discovered that this was Linois's squadron, consisting of the 74-gun Marengo, the two heavy frigates Sémillante and Belle Poule, the corvette Berceau, and the Dutch brig Aventurier.|$|E

25|$|As {{described}} in the abstract of his log made by Bartolome de Las Casas, on the <b>outward</b> bound <b>voyage</b> Columbus recorded two sets of distances. Las Casas originally interpreted that he reported the shorter distances to his crew so they would not worry about sailing too far from Spain. However, according to Oliver Dunn and James Kelley, this was a misunderstanding by Las Casas. Columbus did report two distances each day but one was in measurements he normally used, {{the other in the}} Portuguese maritime leagues used by his crew.|$|R

2500|$|The fatal voyage was {{arranged}} when, despite {{the absence of}} licences certifying seaworthiness, [...] the boat's skipper Brian Bown agreed to take a group of guests from the Greatwood guest house in Mylor, on a sea trip to Fowey. [...] On the morning of 31 July the <b>outward</b> <b>voyage</b> was completed without mishap, but the weather subsequently deteriorated. Bown disregarded advice to remain in Fowey harbour, and shortly after 4.00 pm began the return trip to Mylor. An unconfirmed sighting at around 6.00 pm placed the boat, in worsening conditions, in the vicinity of Dodman Point, a prominent coastal landmark. Following its non-arrival at Mylor the alarm was raised early on 1 August, and full air and sea searches began at dawn. After the recovery of the twelve bodies, operations continued intermittently for several months, without result.|$|E
2500|$|A fourth (but also unlikely) {{possibility}} {{is that it was}} discovered by the Third India Armada of João da Nova, which set out from Lisbon in March or April 1501, and arrived back in September 1502, also in time to influence the Cantino map. [...] Chronicler Gaspar Correia asserts that on the <b>outward</b> <b>voyage,</b> the Third Armada made a stop on the Brazilian coast around Cape Santo Agostinho. [...] Two other chroniclers (João de Barros and Damião de Góis) do not mention a landfall, but do report they discovered an island (which they believe to be identified as Ascension island, but this is not certain). [...] So {{it is possible that the}} Third Armada may indeed have discovered Fernando de Noronha island on their outward leg. [...] However, the timing is very tight: Easter landed on April 11, 1501, [...] while the estimated departure date of the Third Armada from Lisbon ranges from March 5 to April 15, not leaving enough time to reach those environs within Lent.|$|E

50|$|Daniel G. Calder {{argues that}} the poem is an allegory for the {{representation}} of the mind, where the elements of the voyages are objective symbols of an “exilic” state of mind. Contrasted to the setting of the sea is the setting of the land, a state of mind that contains former joys. When the sea and land are joined through the wintry symbols, Calder argues the speaker’s psychological mindset changes. He explains that is when “something informs him that all life on earth is like death. The land the seafarer seeks on this new and <b>outward</b> ocean <b>voyage</b> is one that will not be subject to the mutability of the land and sea as he has known”. John F. Vickrey continues Calder’s analysis of The Seafarer as a psychological allegory. Vickrey argued that the poem is an allegory for the life of a sinner through the metaphor of “the boat of the mind,” a metaphor used “to describe, through the imagery of a ship at sea, a person’s state of mind”.|$|R

When she was ready to depart from Marseilles, there were other smaller sundry ships. Their masters of which interested Robert Bradshaw of Limehouse, the master of the Centurion, to stay a day or two for them until they could get in readiness to depart. They agreed that it would be far better for them all to go in company for mutual support and defence, than to run the hazard of falling {{into the hands of the}} Spanish galleys in the Straits as they had done the year before. Bradshaw agreed and set out along with them all engaging mutually to stand by each other, if they chanced to fall in with any of the Spanish galleys. The Spanish meanwhile had sent six galleys from Cartagena, part of a squadron of twelve under Giovanni Andrea Doria, to convey the Spanish ambassador to Rome.|$|R
