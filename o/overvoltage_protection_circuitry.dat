The lack of experience with this still-new technology, together with the inherent complexity of wind farm electrical systems, entails several unresolved issues pertinent {{to the topic of}} <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protection,</b> particularly in relation to lightning-initiated surges. Firstly, several aspects of the wind turbine lightning incidence, along with the issues related to the selection of lightning current parameters (pertinent to the wind farm <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protection),</b> are addressed in this paper. Secondly, several issues in the state-of-art models of the wind farm electrical systems—for the lightning surge analysis—are addressed and discussed.

Microinverters are taking over popularity of string inverters in residential and some commercial areas mainly due to increased energy harvest.

Two wide-area curtailment schemes were proposed for a typical Dutch residential feeder with densely clustered PV. First, a single worst-case scenario was used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed curtailment schemes: the distribution network operators can optimize between various priorities such as total feeder output, economic equality between connected parties, voltage levels, voltage unbalance, and curtailment execution time. Second, a yearly comparison was made against conventional <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protection</b> and the results show 62 %– 100 % reduction in overvoltage losses...|$|R

The work presented here is based on real-life power system substation design and data and initiated by Danish TSO Energinet. dk {{as a consequence of}} a serious transformer overvoltage damage. A simulation model for the entire system consisting of overhead line, transformer, surge arrester and earth grid has been created in PSCAD/EMTDC. Main focus has been put on the earth grid, which has been submodeled in details in MATLAB using an electromagnetic transient approach based on the thin-wire program made by J. H. Richmond in 1974 for NASA. The earth grid model is verified with excellent agreement compared to already published results.
