5|$|No.82 Wing {{accepted}} {{its first}} F-111Cs in June 1973. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Charles Read, ordered {{that the new}} aircraft be flown with great caution initially, well within <b>operational</b> <b>limits,</b> to minimise the possibility of further damage to its reputation through early attrition. No.1 Squadron was assigned 12 of the initial 24 aircraft delivered. It was No.82 Wing's lead strike force, while No.6 Squadron was primarily tasked with crew conversion training. The wing employed a centralised servicing regime, whereby all aircraft and maintenance personnel were held by No.482 Squadron, which released the F-111s in line with Nos.1 and 6Squadrons' joint flying program. In February 1981, responsibility for operating-level servicing of the F-111s {{was transferred to the}} flying squadrons, which for the first time took direct control of their F-111s. No.482 Squadron continued to provide intermediate-level servicing, while major upgrades and complex maintenance were carried out by No.3 Aircraft Depot. These two organisations merged in 1992 to form No.501 Wing, which handed over heavy maintenance of the F-111 to Boeing Australia in 2001. Between 1977 and 1993, the RAAF lost seven F-111Cs in crashes. Three of the accidents involved aircraft flown by No.1 Squadron: in August 1979, January 1986 and September 1993, the last two killing both crew members. In July 1996, No.1 Squadron took responsibility for aerial reconnaissance using specially modified RF-111Cs previously operated by No.6 Squadron. This gave No.1 Squadron five mission types: land strike, maritime strike, close air support, long-range air defence, and reconnaissance. In May 1999 the unit was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency.|$|E

25|$|Any real {{amplifier}} is {{an imperfect}} realization {{of an ideal}} amplifier. An important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it generates is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. An amplifier saturates and clips the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or exceeds <b>operational</b> <b>limits</b> for the device. The power supply may influence the output, so {{must be considered in}} the design. The power output from an amplifier cannot exceed its input power.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of a large {{photovoltaic}} (PV) penetration on power system small signal oscillation stability. A comprehensive model of a single-machine infinite-bus power system integrated with a PV power generation power plant is established. Numerical computation of damping torque contribution from the PV power plant is carried out, which is confirmed by the results of calculation of system oscillation model and non-linear simulation. Those results indicate that power system oscillation stability can be affected either positively or negatively. There exists an <b>operational</b> <b>limit</b> of the PV power plant as far as system oscillation stability is concerned. Beyond the <b>operational</b> <b>limit,</b> the PV generation supplies negative damping torque, thus damaging system oscillation stability. Hence for the safe penetration of PV generation into power systems, the <b>operational</b> <b>limit</b> of oscillation stability of the PV power plant must be considered...|$|R
500|$|On Friday, 24 June 1994, a United States Air Force (USAF) Boeing B-52 Stratofortress crashed at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, United States, {{after the}} pilot, Lt Col Arthur [...] "Bud" [...] Holland, maneuvered the bomber beyond its <b>operational</b> <b>limits</b> and lost control. The {{aircraft}} stalled, {{fell to the}} ground and exploded, killing Holland and the other three USAF officers aboard. The crash was captured on video and was shown repeatedly on news broadcasts throughout the world.|$|E
500|$|Several subway {{lines have}} reached their <b>operational</b> <b>limits</b> {{in terms of}} train {{frequency}} and passengers, according to data released by the Transit Authority. , all of the A Division services except the 42nd Street Shuttle, {{as well as the}} E and L trains, were beyond capacity, as well as portions of the [...] train. In April 2013, New York magazine reported that the system was more crowded {{than it had been in}} the previous 66 years. The subway reached a daily ridership of 6 million for 29 days in 2014, and was expected to record a similar ridership level for 55 days in 2015; by comparison, in 2013, daily ridership never reached 6 million. In particular, the express tracks of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line are noted for operating at full capacity during peak hours. The Long Island Rail Road East Side Access project is expected to bring many more commuters to the Lexington Avenue Line when it opens around the year 2022, further overwhelming its capacity.|$|E

50|$|The main {{factor that}} distinguishes a Sacred Mechamaster from a regular human is {{their ability to}} endure {{proximity}} to Aho energy, {{which is used to}} power the Sacred Mechanoid. Ulyte explains that, while fighting skill can be enhanced through training, a Sacred Mechamasters' level of endurance is something they are born with, and therefore cannot be changed. Sacred Mechamasters are limited by the amount of time they can endure an Aho field, called the <b>operational</b> <b>limit.</b> Sacred Mechamasters cannot pilot a Sacred Mechanoid for longer than their <b>operational</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|R

2500|$|After graduation, Korolev {{worked with}} some of the best Soviet {{designers}} at the 4th Experimental Section aircraft design bureau OPO-4 headed by [...] who emigrated to the USSR from France in the 1920s. He did not stand out in this group, but while so employed he also worked independently to design a glider capable of performing aerobatics. In 1930 he became interested in the possibilities of liquid-fueled rocket engines to propel airplanes while working as a lead engineer on the Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber. Korolev earned his pilot's license in 1930 and explored the <b>operational</b> <b>limits</b> of the aircraft he piloted, wondering what was beyond his plane's altitude limit and how he could get there. Many believe this was the start of his interest in space.|$|E
2500|$|During the 20th century, {{limits in}} dealing with {{randomness}} were better understood. The best-known example of both theoretical and <b>operational</b> <b>limits</b> on predictability is weather forecasting, simply because models {{have been used in}} the field since the 1950s. Predictions of weather and climate are necessarily uncertain. Observations of weather and climate are uncertain and incomplete, and the models into which the data are fed are uncertain. In 1961, Edward Lorenz noticed that a very small change to the initial data submitted to a computer program for weather simulation could result in a completely different weather scenario. This later became known as the butterfly effect, often paraphrased as the question: [...] "Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?". A key example of serious practical limits on predictability is in geology, where the ability to predict earthquakes either on an individual or on a statistical basis remains a remote prospect.|$|E

40|$|The {{forecast}} verification problemof precipitations is {{a complex}} task. Within the European project “INTERREG II C” it has been applied a method designed to discriminate statistically significative differences between skill scores.

40|$|A complex marine project {{consist of}} series of {{operation}}s, with each operation {{subject to a}} predefined <b>operational</b> <b>limit</b> and duration, depending on the equipment being used. If actual weather conditions exceed the <b>operational</b> <b>limit,</b> then the operation cannot be executed and hence downtime occurs. It is up to contractors, such as Boskalis, to accurately estimate the expected downtime {{in order to determine}} the project costs. Recently, anew tool has been developed to make downtime assessments by using the Markov theory: the so-called `Downtime-Modular-Markov model' (DMM-model). It abstracts the actual metocean conditions by stochastically producing binary `workability sequences' for each operation, where a distinction has been made between workable and non-workable states given an <b>operational</b> <b>limit.</b> The Markov statistics of the model are based on the characteristics of the observed metocean conditions. Complex marine project simulations are realizable based on these statistics. The purpose of this thesis is to develop the DMM-model for which a software-testing process is applied. In the verification phase the concept and the code of the model are checked on correctness, consistency and completeness. Subsequently, the validation phase addresses to the quality of the model. Three different metocean datasets are used to test the model and its individual modules whether they perform sufficiently accurate. The most important findings of both phases are tackled in the improvement & extension phase. Adjustments made during this last phase bring the DMM-model to a new state-of-the-art. It is recommended for further study to conduct an uncertainty analysis (quantify the model and parametric uncertainty) ...|$|R

30|$|The {{stability}} of power systems is constantly increasing {{with the development}} of power system control technologies. However, the electricity market makes the operating condition of power systems closer to the <b>operational</b> <b>limit.</b> Consequently, power systems have a heightened risk of large-scale blackouts [1], which have happened several times in the past few years, such as the North American blackout in 2003 [2], the Japanese blackout in 2010 [3] and the Indian blackout in 2012 [4].|$|R

5000|$|While the First World War saw the {{introduction}} of large scale mechanization in modern warfare, the lack of tactical experience of the commanders and the technical limitations of the weapon systems greatly limited their usefulness. For example, the Mark V tank employed by the allies boasted a maximum speed of five miles per hour and an <b>operational</b> <b>limit</b> of 10 hours under ideal circumstances. In {{the reality of the}} battlefield, this could be greatly reduced, and many tanks were greatly slowed or dead-lined by adverse terrain.|$|R
30|$|The {{percolation}} threshold naturally acts as {{a network}} reliability indicator, quantifying the <b>operational</b> <b>limit</b> of network traffic. Specifically, percolation theory focuses on connected clusters, which fills up the gap of other indices that rarely consider the macroscopic network congestion behaviors from a network view [21]. We find that q_c can reflect the transition of dynamical traffic network, faced with possible extreme local conditions. These features of q_c make it a useful tool under the variation and absence of complete traffic information, and provide supports for the congestion prediction and mitigation research.|$|R
