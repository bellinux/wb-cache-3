5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use {{frustrating}} and impractical since it took away use of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E
25|$|A {{locomotive}} cut {{the car in}} half, killing {{my father}} instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, {{as if trying to}} discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E

In 1928 Codona married aerialist Lillian Leitzel, who died in 1931, aged 39, in Copenhagen, Denmark when <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> rings snapped and she fell to a concrete floor. Both were tempestuous, star performers whose personalities were well matched. Alfredo was famed for his triple somersault, which he regularly incorporated in his act.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Colfax laughed musically. She put <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white <b>hands</b> on each <b>of</b> <b>her</b> niece's cheeks, kissed her, {{and then}} gazed {{into her face}} until Virginia reddened.|$|R
2500|$|Upset {{at getting}} the raw {{end of the}} deal, the Robot Devil decides {{he has to get}} his own hands back. He begs Fry, but Fry refuses {{reminding}} him they made a deal. The Robot Devil tries to make a deal with Bender for his hands. When Bender refuses the Robot Devil then makes another deal, in which he trades Bender a stadium air horn for his [...] "crotch-plate" [...] so that he can annoy people. When Bender uses the air horn on Leela, he causes her to go deaf. Leela refuses to tell Fry that she is deaf because she is afraid that Fry will stop writing the opera, so she attends the premiere pretending she can still hear the performance. During the intermission, the Robot Devil offers Leela robotic ears in exchange for <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> at a time of his choosing. Desperate to hear the opera, Leela accepts the offer.|$|E

6000|$|He took <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> wasted <b>hands</b> {{in his own}} {{and carried}} it to his lips. [...] "Not on the hand," [...] she said faintly. [...] "Just once, on the lips, before I die." ...|$|R

60|$|Presently {{they reached}} the temple, a single room, {{surrounded}} by a spacious paved area; in front was an immense building capable of seating hundreds of people. Before the image there were pools of blood, where victims had lately been slaughtered. In the sanctum was Devi, a large black figure with ten arms. With a spear in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right <b>hands</b> she pierced the giant Mahisha; and with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left <b>hands</b> she held {{the tail of a}} serpent, and the hair of the giant, whose breast the serpent was biting.

[...] "Come," [...] she cried, [...] "and make mamma as happy as I am!" ...|$|R
