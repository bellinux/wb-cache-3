40|$|Three diets {{containing}} 8 % olive <b>oil,</b> fresh <b>sardine</b> (Clupea pilchardus) <b>oil</b> and <b>oil</b> from <b>sardines</b> fried {{in olive}} oil were prepared. After in vitro digestion, soluble (dialysed and non-dialysed) and insoluble zinc fractions were determined. Fresh <b>sardine</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>oil</b> from <b>sardines</b> fried {{in olive oil}} provided more dialysed zinc and less insoluble zinc than 8 % olive oil. Three groups of growing rats consumed the diets for 28 days. Food intake and body weight values of rats fed 8 % olive oil {{were significantly higher than}} those fed fresh <b>sardine</b> <b>oil</b> and slightly lower than those fed <b>oil</b> from <b>sardines</b> fried in olive oil. Animals fed fresh <b>sardine</b> <b>oil</b> exhibited the lowest apparent zinc retention during days 5 - 12, but absorption efficiency increased during days 21 - 28 and all groups had similar final zinc absorption and retention values. Animals fed <b>oil</b> from <b>sardines</b> fried in olive oil displayed higher (days 5 - 12) or similar (days 21 - 28) apparent zinc absorption and retention values than rats fed 8 % olive <b>oil</b> and fresh <b>sardine</b> <b>oil.</b> Hepatic zinc concentrations were higher in rats fed <b>oil</b> from <b>sardines</b> fried in olive oil than fed fresh <b>sardine</b> <b>oil,</b> while all groups showed similar spleenic concentrations. Zinc accumulation in skin was significantly higher in animals fed fresh <b>sardine</b> <b>oil</b> than in those fed <b>oil</b> from <b>sardines</b> fried in olive oil, and their total erythrocyte zinc concentrations were also higher than in rats fed <b>oil</b> from <b>sardines</b> fried in olive oil or on 8 % olive oil. In conclusion, a diet high in raw sardine fatty acids can cause excessive zinc accumulation in skin and erythrocytes.

After in vitro digestion, soluble (dialyzed and nondialyzed) and insoluble Ca and P fractions were determined. In vitro Ca availability tended to be higher with SO, {{and even more so}} with FSO, than with OO, while that of P increased only slightly with FSO. Growing rats consumed the diets for 28 days. Food intake and body weight increased with FSO more than with OO, but decreased markedly with SO, due to an imbalance in the n- 3 /n- 6 fatty acid ratio. Absorption efficiencies of Ca and P were higher with SO than with the other diets during days 5 - 12. Because urinary Ca excretion was also greater with SO, apparent retention of both Ca and P was lower with this diet. With SO, carcass content of Ca and P was low but their concentrations were high. Apparent retention of these minerals and their carcass content were similar or higher with FSO than with OO. Therefore, although availability of Ca and P from raw and fried <b>sardine</b> <b>oil</b> diets was sufficient in vitro, consumption of raw <b>sardine</b> <b>oil</b> as the only dietary fat produced changes in calcium and phosphorus bioavailability, an effect of <b>sardine</b> <b>oil</b> which disappeared after frying in olive oil.

40|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>sardine,</b> Sardinella longiceps Val., fishery {{has been}} the subject of several {{investigations}} ever since the starting of fisheries research in India. Great attention is concentrated on the fish and its biology mainly because of the tremendous variations in the yield.

Along the Calicut coast the <b>oil</b> <b>sardine</b> fishery has a special position, the economy of the coastal people is completely dependent upon it.
