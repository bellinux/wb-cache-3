5|$|U.S. <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} CIA {{conducted}} {{a review of}} intelligence supplied by al-Balawi, examining whether he supplied false information about U.S. successes amid valid data used to establish his credibility. The investigation included a review of a list of senior al Qaeda and Taliban operatives reported killed in U.S. drone strikes since January 2009. The National Counterterrorism Center conducted its own review of the intelligence al-Balawi provided, two <b>officials</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the Pakistani foreign ministry, the {{operation}} was conducted entirely by the U.S. forces. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> they were present at {{what they called a}} joint operation; President Asif Ali Zardari flatly denied this. Pakistan's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that Pakistani military had scrambled F-16s after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{officials}} learned al-Kuwaiti's real name, {{though they}} said they would disclose neither the name nor how they learned it. Pakistani officials in 2011 stated the courier's name was Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed, from Pakistan's Swat Valley. He and his brother Abrar and their families were living at bin Laden's compound, the <b>officials</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Air Force {{decided to}} bring the {{aircraft}} back to the U.S. ahead of schedule because the maintenance contract with L-3 will expire this summer, the service <b>official</b> <b>said.</b> Keeping the aircraft in theater would mean spending an additional $20 million to $25 million in maintenance costs, the <b>official</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
50|$|On August 25, gunmen on {{motorcycles}} {{attacked a}} military patrol in Yemen's restive south on Wednesday, killing four soldiers and wounding one, a security <b>official</b> <b>said.</b> The <b>official</b> <b>said</b> an early investigation indicated the attackers {{were members of}} al-Qaida, which lately appears to have stepped up high-profile attacks {{in the south of}} this impoverished country. He did not provide details. The attack occurred in the Abyan provincial capital of Zinjibar and brought to 53 the number of soldiers killed by al-Qaida since May, the <b>official</b> <b>said.</b> He {{spoke on condition of anonymity}} because he was not authorized to talk to the media.|$|R
5|$|Russian planes bombed Gori on 12 August, {{killing a}} seven people and {{wounding}} over thirty. Dutch television journalist Stan Storimans {{was among those}} killed and another foreign correspondent was injured. Georgian <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> that the Russians targeted the city's administrative buildings. The air raids set {{the post office and}} the Gori University on fire. The Gori Military Hospital was struck by a missile, {{in spite of the fact}} that it was flying a Red Cross flag, killing one doctor.|$|E
5|$|The three Qatari {{men were}} booked to fly from Los Angeles to Washington on September 10, 2001, {{on the same}} plane that was hijacked and piloted into the Pentagon on the {{following}} day. Instead, they flew from Los Angeles to Qatar, via Washington and London. While the cable said that Mansoori was currently under investigation, U.S. law enforcement <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> {{that there was no}} active investigation of him or of the Qatari citizens mentioned in the cable.|$|E
5|$|After her death, President S R Nathan sent {{a wreath}} of roses, {{chrysanthemums}} and orchids. Several government ministers attended her wake, including Senior Minister of State for Health Balaji Sadasivan, Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Minister of State for Education and Trade and Industry Chan Soo Sen, and Northwest Community Development Council mayor Teo Ho Pin. Temple <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> she left instructions for S$100,000 {{to be distributed}} equally to 10charities.

5|$|Angle {{was arrested}} at his home by police in Moon, Pennsylvania on September 28, 2007, {{on a charge of}} driving under the {{influence}} after being reported by a woman who claimed that he almost hit her while leaving a local restaurant. <b>Officials</b> <b>said</b> Angle failed a field sobriety test, but he refused a blood test. He was charged with driving under the influence and careless driving, but he denied the charges. On September 9, 2008, Angle was cleared of all charges.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> they had done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E
5|$|Company {{officials}} in Bakersfield who {{were responsible for}} notifying the National Response Center {{did not do so}} until 2:56pm. The Center, staffed by United States Coast Guard officers and marine science technicians, is the sole federal point of contact for reporting all hazardous substances releases and oil spills. An oil spill triggers mandatory federal notification requirements in a timely manner but company <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> they were unable to contact employees on site as the employees were busy dealing with the immediate demands and distractions of the situation.|$|E
50|$|Noting {{that the}} growing {{gap between rich}} and poor is a general world trend, a DGBAS <b>official</b> <b>said</b> Taiwan was no exception. When Taiwan’s 7.41 million {{households}} were divided into 10 tiers based on annual income in 2007, the richest 740,000 households had disposable income of about NT$1.67 million, roughly 5.2 times the NT$320,000 average disposable income of the bottom 740,000 households, the <b>official</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R

5|$|In an {{interview}} Lidle gave {{about a month}} earlier, he stated {{he had been a}} pilot for seven months and had flown about 95 solo hours. The crash garnered extra attention because of superficial similarities to the September 11 attacks in New York City, which had occurred five years and one month earlier. U.S. <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George W. Bush was informed about the situation, but that these were precautionary measures only. The FBI quickly announced {{there was no reason to}} suspect that the crash was an act of terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{military}} <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> the Palestinians {{intended to}} build a mosque on {{the ruins of the}} site. The statement came after workers repairing the tomb painted the site's dome green, the colour of Islam. A Palestinian Authority spokesman denied the allegations and said that Arafat had ordered the renovations and for the synagogue to be rebuilt. Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor, claimed that city officials simply wanted to return the building to the way it looked before it came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war. Under intense U.S. and international pressure the dome was repainted white.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1956, the Republican National Committee {{announced}} that Chotiner {{would have no}} role in the upcoming campaign. On June 6, a House subcommittee disclosed that the California attorney had written to President Eisenhower asking the President to intercede on behalf of Stanley Weiss's low-cost charter line North American Airlines (NAA) before the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The attorney admitted inquiring of White House aides concerning the case, but denied using any influence on behalf of any client. White House <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> that they had done no more than ask the CAB when a decision might be expected in NAA's case, and that NAA had lost before the CAB anyway.|$|E

5000|$|On 27 November 2006, {{a senior}} American {{intelligence}} official {{told reporters that}} the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah had been training members of the Mahdi Army. The <b>official</b> <b>said</b> that 1,000 to 2,000 fighters from the Mahdi Army and other Shia militias had been trained by Hezbollah in Lebanon, and {{a small number of}} Hezbollah operatives have also visited Iraq to help with training. Iran has facilitated the link between Hezbollah and the Shia militias in Iraq, the <b>official</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "There {{seems to have been a}} strategic decision taken sometime over late winter or early spring by Damascus, Tehran, along with their partners in ait Lebanese Hezbollah, to provide more support to Sadr to increase pressure on the U.S.," [...] the American intelligence <b>official</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and {{it was probably the}} first time anyone had been tested for the presence of 210Po in their body. The poison was in Litvinenko's cup of tea. Those who had contact with Litvinenko may also have been exposed to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} of Vilankulo attempted {{to flee the}} area carrying belongings and children as the government urged residents to seek shelter on higher ground further inland before the storm hit. They evacuated {{many of the people}} who remained, taking them to tent camps. <b>Officials</b> <b>said</b> that Favio could also bring heavy rains to Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Authorities in the latter issued a flood warning. Because of the topography of the region, meteorologists noted the potential for flooding in Zimabawe.|$|E
5|$|U.S. <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> {{there were}} 22 {{people in the}} compound. Five were killed, {{including}} Osama bin Laden. Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors. The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents. The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound. Because {{of a lack of}} verifiable information, some of what follows is thinly sourced.|$|E

5|$|Citi Bike {{finally began}} {{operations}} on May 27, 2013, with 332 stations. The stations {{were located in}} Manhattan south of 59th Street and in Brooklyn north of Atlantic Avenue and west of Nostrand Avenue. <b>Officials</b> <b>said</b> the system opened with 6,000 bikes. At the time of implementation, {{it was the largest}} bikesharing program in the United States. When launched, the system was slated to expand to 10,000 bicycles and 600 stations in Manhattan south of 79th Street, plus stations in several Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Greenpoint, Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens as well as parts of Queens. At first, the timeline for the expansion was not made publicly available, but it was later announced that the expansion would be complete by the end of 2016. There has been increasing interest in further expansion across New York City; for example, in June 2013 a Brooklyn politician opened a petition drive to accelerate deployment in Greenpoint. In contrast, the May 2013 installation deliberately bypassed South Williamsburg.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{counter-terrorism}} agency NCTb {{said that}} it had started a probe into where the suspect originated. Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from privacy advocates. Dutch <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> that security must take priority over {{the privacy of the}} individuals being scanned, but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual's privacy, as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts flooded {{villages and}} disrupted transport networks. It was estimated by 18 November {{that at least}} 500km of roads had been damaged by flooding, with the Chennai-Kolkata highway damaged the previous day and stranding hundreds of vehicles and motorists; <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> it would take days to restore the link. As in Tamil Nadu, the Southern Railway diverted or cancelled numerous trains. Over 10,000 lorry drivers were stranded on the Tada-Kavali national highway in Nellore district; district officers established 61 relief camps in the flood-affected areas and deputed senior IAS officers to oversee the relief operations in Gudur, Naidupet and Atmakur divisions, respectively. Up to 500 tanks were breached as rivers overflowed, forcing the administration to suspend rescue operations in marooned villages, though administrators supplied 10,000 food and water packets through the rail network, which managed to operate some trains, while the APSRTC continued to run bus services to less-flooded areas such as Atmakuru, Udayagiri, Marripadu and Seetharampuram.|$|E
