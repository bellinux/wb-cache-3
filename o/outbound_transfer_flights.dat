With this judgement the Court increased the scope for corporate mobility in two respects. First, in the situation where there is an <b>outbound</b> <b>transfer</b> of the central place of administration with a simultaneous change of the applicable national law one can rely on the treaty freedom. Second, in the same situation such a transfer may no longer result in companies being killed off at the border. Moreover, the effect of this judgement is not to outlaw the real seat doctrine but, similar to Überseering, to limit the potential effects of the application of the real seat doctrine. Interestingly the application of this judgement to the situation in which a company transfers its central place of administration from a MS adhering to the incorporation doctrine results in a potentially discriminatory effect...|$|R

40|$|Many current manned Mars mission {{studies are}} using low {{lift-to-drag}} ratio (L/D) vehicles to aerobrake at both Mars and Earth. The {{use of these}} low L/D vehicles could limit the allowable velocity at the atmospheric interface. This paper will demonstrate that if entry velocity constraints are incorporated into the interplanetary analysis of aerobraking Mars missions, many opportunities can be achieved for a small increase in initial mass in low-Earth orbit (IMLEO). These opportunities result from varying the initial launch date and the encounter dates and possibly using a powered Venus swingby on either the inbound or <b>outbound</b> <b>transfer.</b> This paper demonstrates this technique by using three atmospheric entry velocity ranges at Mars arrival (6. 0 - 8. 5, 6. 4 - 8. 1, and 7. 2 - 7. 3 km/s), unconstrained Mars entry velocities, and an Earth return entry velocity below 14 km/s.

This paper will demonstrate that if entry velocity constraints {{are incorporated into}} the interplanetary analysis of aerobraking Mars missions, more opportunities can be achieved for only a small increase in initial mass in low-Earth orbit (IMLEO).

The results indicate that, regardless of the Mars entry velocity range selected, an Earth entry velocity below 14 km/s is easily attainable for a minimal IMLEO increase. Although there are fewer 12. 5 km/s Earth entry velocity missions possible, both Mars entry velocity constraint cases have over 50 percent of their missions requiring a negligible IMLEO increase...|$|R

40|$|The new {{remote sensing}} {{experiment}} CRISTA-NF (Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere - New Frontiers) successfully {{participated in the}} SCOUT-O 3 Tropical Aircraft Campaign in November and December 2005. CRISTA-NF operated aboard the high-altitude research aircraft M- 55 Geophysica. Mid-infrared spectra (4 - 15 mu m) were measured in the limb sounding geometry with high spatial resolution (250 m vertical sampling, 5 - 15 km along track sampling). Measurements were carried out during <b>transfer</b> <b>flights</b> between Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, and Darwin, Australia, as well as during several local flights near Darwin. Water vapor volume mixing ratios in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere were derived from the CRISTA-NF radiance measurements by utilizing a rapid radiative transfer forward model and the optimal estimation retrieval approach. CRISTA-NF water vapor measurements below the hygropause have a total retrieval error of 15 - 40 % (i. e. root mean square of accuracy and precision). The systematic terms are dominating in the retrieval error budget. The contributions of a priori information to the retrieval results are less than 5 - 10 %. The vertical resolution of the observations is about 250 - 500 in when permitted by instrument sampling. In this paper we present first results for three <b>transfer</b> <b>flights</b> of the campaign. Being generally in good agreement with corresponding ECMWF operational analyzes, the CRISTA-NF measurements show significantly higher variability and local structures in the upper tropospheric water vapor distributions.
