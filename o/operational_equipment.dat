5|$|The nine {{aircraft}} {{were ordered}} as the Kestrel FGA.1, which was essentially an improved {{version of the}} P.1127. On 7 March 1964, XS688 became the first Kestrel to conduct its maiden flight, flown by Bill Bedford. The Kestrel had fully swept wings and a larger tail than the early P.1127s, and the fuselage was modified to take the larger 15,000lbf (85kN) Pegasus 5 engine as in the P.1127/Kestrel prototype XP984, in addition to some other changes, such as addition of ultra high frequency (UHF) radio and assorted <b>operational</b> <b>equipment</b> in a bay house within the rear fuselage. Prior to {{the availability of the}} Kestrel for testing, a pair of NASA pilots visited Dunsfold to perform a complete set of handling trials using the earlier P.1127 in its place.|$|E

The first production variant was Mi-1, quickly replaced by improved Mi-1T, that carried extra <b>operational</b> <b>equipment</b> including full radio and blind-flying instruments, and had more reliable engine AI-26V. The next basic variant was the Mi-1A of 1957, with further increased reliability and provisions for one 160 l external fuel tank.|$|E

Current rehabilitation work on the railway is however being handled jointly by SSR along with KTMB, the corporatised (but wholly federal government owned) railway operator for the railway network in Peninsular Malaysia.

25|$|The third {{prototype}} (WT827), and {{the first}} to be fitted with <b>operational</b> <b>equipment</b> including radar, first flew on 7 March 1953. The fourth WT827 was passed to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) for trials and the fifth prototype, WT836, made its first flight in July 1954. On 4 July 1954, a prototype Javelin accidentally achieved supersonic speed during a test flight, the pilot having been distracted by an oxygen supply failure.|$|E

In 2001, the baseball cap was introduced along with akubra and a woollen jumper.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn investigation {{was made into}} the characteristics of program elements and removals of Weapon Replaceable Assemblies aggregated at the system level {{for the purpose of}} developing a method to predict removals during initial provisioning periods. From examination of nine avionic systems over a 28 month period a binomial model was developed using a removal rate based on aircraft-months as a program element. The model is to be used before Fleet data are generated by obtaining aircraft-month estimates from the contractor and removal rate estimates from similar <b>operational</b> <b>equipments.</b> A probability distribution reflecting the degree of certainty is selected as a prior estimate. Then, as Fleet experience is accumulated the distribution is updated using Bayesian techniques and maturity growth curves. This distribution is used to give an estimate of current removal rate and to extrapolate to future removal rates. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

500|$|The YB-52, {{the second}} XB-52 {{modified}} with more <b>operational</b> <b>equipment,</b> first flew on 15 April 1952 with [...] "Tex" [...] Johnston as pilot. During ground testing on 29 November 1951, the XB-52's pneumatic system failed during a full-pressure test; the resulting explosion severely damaged the trailing {{edge of the}} wing, necessitating considerable repairs. A two-hour, 21-minute proving flight from Boeing Field, King County, in Seattle, Washington to Larson AFB was undertaken with Boeing test pilot Johnston and air force Lieutenant Colonel Guy M. Townsend. The XB-52 followed on 2 October 1952. The thorough development, including 670 days in the wind tunnel and 130 days of aerodynamic and aeroelastic testing, paid off with smooth flight testing. Encouraged, the air force increased its order to 282 B-52s.|$|E
500|$|On 2 November 1960, the Ministry of Supply {{issued a}} {{contract}} for a further four prototypes to be produced, which were intended to develop the aircraft further towards being a realistic combat design, such as the refinement of the wing, engine improvements, and of accompanying <b>operational</b> <b>equipment.</b> Throughout this period, improved models of the Pegasus engine were rapidly developed, such as the Pegasus 3 being capable of 15,000lbf (67kN) of thrust. Apart from the improved powerplants, the first four P.1127 prototypes were quite similar; the fifth prototype, XP980, introduced the taller fin and tailplane anhedral which were later used on the production Harrier. The fourth machine was partially used to provide Hawker production test pilots with type familiarisation. [...] The first carrier vertical landing was performed by the first prototype on [...] in 1963. The last P.1127, XP984, introduced the swept wing. It was eventually fitted with the 15,000lbf (66.7kN) Pegasus 5 and functioned as the prototype Kestrel.|$|E
