25|$|LFSRs {{have long}} been used as {{pseudo-random}} number generators for use in stream ciphers (especially in military cryptography), due to the ease of construction from simple electromechanical or electronic circuits, long periods, and very uniformly distributed output streams. However, an LFSR is a linear system, leading to fairly easy cryptanalysis. For example, given a stretch of known plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, an attacker can intercept and recover a stretch of LFSR <b>output</b> <b>stream</b> used in the system described, and from that stretch of the <b>output</b> <b>stream</b> can construct an LFSR of minimal size that simulates the intended receiver by using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. This LFSR can then be fed the intercepted stretch of <b>output</b> <b>stream</b> to recover the remaining plaintext.|$|E
25|$|To {{generate}} the same <b>output</b> <b>stream,</b> {{the order of}} the taps is the counterpart (see above) of the order for the conventional LFSR, otherwise the stream will be in reverse. Note that the internal state of the LFSR is not necessarily the same. The Galois register shown has the same <b>output</b> <b>stream</b> as the Fibonacci register in the first section. A time offset exists between the streams, so a different startpoint will be needed to get the same output each cycle.|$|E

40|$|An {{extensible}} {{file system}} raises {{the level of}} file abstraction which provides benefits to both the end-user and programmer. The Modify-on-Access file system provides safe and simple user-defined extensibility through transformations, which are modular operations on input and <b>output</b> <b>streams.</b> A user inserts transformations into input and <b>output</b> <b>streams,</b> which modify the data accessed. Untrusted transformations execute in user space for safety. Performance of user-level transformations, although much slower than that of in-kernel transformations, is comparable to other user-level approaches, such as pipes...|$|R
25|$|In the <b>output</b> <b>stream</b> 0 and 1 {{are equally}} likely, as 10 and 01 are equally {{likely in the}} original, both having {{probability}} pqnbsp&=nbsp&qp. This extraction of uniform randomness {{does not require the}} input trials to be independent, only uncorrelated. More generally, it works for any exchangeable sequence of bits: all sequences that are finite rearrangements are equally likely.|$|E
25|$|Named {{after the}} French {{mathematician}} Évariste Galois, an LFSR in Galois configuration, {{which is also}} known as modular, internal XORs, or one-to-many LFSR, is an alternate structure that can generate the same <b>output</b> <b>stream</b> as a conventional LFSR (but offset in time). In the Galois configuration, when the system is clocked, bits that are not taps are shifted one position to the right unchanged. The taps, on the other hand, are XORed with the output bit before they are stored in the next position. The new output bit is the next input bit. The effect of this is that when the output bit is zero, all the bits in the register shift to the right unchanged, and the input bit becomes zero. When the output bit is one, the bits in the tap positions all flip (if they are 0, they become 1, and if they are 1, they become 0), and then the entire register is shifted to the right and the input bit becomes 1.|$|E

Since then, there has been much work on similar problems of sorting data streams by more general systems of stacks and queues. In the system considered by , each element from an input data stream must be pushed onto one of several stacks. Then, once all of the data has been pushed in this way, the items are popped from these stacks (in an appropriate order) onto an <b>output</b> <b>stream.</b> As Chung et al. observe, a given permutation can be sorted by this system if and only if a certain graph, derived from the permutation, has a book embedding with the vertices in a certain fixed order along the spine and with a number of pages that is at most equal to the number of stacks.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{application}} {{programs on}} IBM mainframe operating systems have no standard input and <b>output</b> <b>streams</b> to allow redirection or piping. Instead of spawning processes with external programs, CMS Pipelines features a lightweight dispatcher to concurrently execute instances of built-in programs {{to run the}} pipeline. More than 200 built-in programs that implement typical UNIX utilities and interface to devices and operating system services.

40|$|In this paper, {{an initial}} {{condition}} of a sigma-delta modulator is estimated based on quantizer <b>output</b> bit <b>streams</b> and an input signal. The set of initial conditions that generate a stable trajectory is characterized. It is {{found that this}} set, {{as well as the}} set of initial conditions corresponding to the quantizer <b>output</b> bit <b>streams,</b> are convex. Also, it is found that the mapping from the set of initial conditions to the stable admissible set of quantizer <b>output</b> bit <b>streams</b> is invertible if the loop filter is unstable. Hence, the initial condition corresponding to given stable admissible quantizer <b>output</b> <b>streams</b> and an input signal is uniquely defined when the loop filter is unstable, and a projection onto convex set approach is employed for approximating the initial condition...|$|R
500|$|In a {{continuous}} distillation, {{the system is}} kept in a steady state or approximate steady state. [...] Steady state means that quantities related to the process do not change as time passes during operation. [...] Such constant quantities include feed input rate, <b>output</b> <b>stream</b> rates, heating and cooling rates, reflux ratio, and temperatures, pressures, and compositions at every point (location). [...] Unless the process is disturbed due to changes in feed, heating, ambient temperature, or condensing, steady state is normally maintained. [...] This is also the main attraction of continuous distillation, apart from the minimum amount of (easily instrumentable) surveillance; if the feed rate and feed composition are kept constant, product rate and quality are also constant. [...] Even when a variation in conditions occurs, modern process control methods are commonly able to gradually return the continuous process to another steady state again.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the most}} important weakness of RC4 comes from the insufficient key schedule; the first bytes of output reveal information about the key. [...] This can be corrected by simply discarding some initial portion of the <b>output</b> <b>stream.</b> This is known as RC4-dropN, where N is typically a multiple of 256, such as 768 or 1024.|$|E
2500|$|The bit {{positions}} {{that affect the}} next state are called the taps. In the diagram the taps are [...] The rightmost bit of the LFSR is called the output bit.

2500|$|The {{pipeline}} {{structure of}} the bind operator ensures that the [...] and [...] operations get evaluated only once and in the given order, so that the side-effects of extracting text from the input stream and writing to the <b>output</b> <b>stream</b> are correctly handled in the functional pipeline.

2500|$|Stream ciphers, in {{contrast}} to the 'block' type, create an arbitrarily long stream of key material, which is combined with the plaintext bit-by-bit or character-by-character, somewhat like the one-time pad. In a stream cipher, the <b>output</b> <b>stream</b> is created based on a hidden internal state that changes as the cipher operates.

Exactly half of these runs are one bit long, a quarter are two bits long, up to a single run of zeroes n−1 bits long, and a single run of ones n bits long.
