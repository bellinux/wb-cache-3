2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bibles</b> moralisées {{were created}} on high quality {{parchment}} paper. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bibles</b> was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most expensive books {{that had been}} created within medieval Europe. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bibles</b> were created on large sheets of high- quality parchment in which the work was only done {{on one side of}} each parchment. [...] Expensive paint and ink was used in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bibles</b> moralisées as well, for example the blue that was used for the borders, backgrounds, and clothes was lapis lazuli. Few held the resources to commission these works other than royalty. [...] In each page <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bibles</b> moralisées there are eight images arranged within four columns. Each is a biblical and moralizing image that is accompanied by a text. Unlike most illuminated manuscripts where the images are secondary to the text, in these manuscripts the images are the dominant aspect, this is evident in that the manuscripts contain more than 24, 000 illustrations.|$|R

5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E
