40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a Bayesian {{framework}} for multilabel classification using compressed sensing. The key idea in compressed sensing for multilabel classification is to first project the label vector to a lower dimensional space using a random transformation and then learn regression functions over these projections. Our approach considers both of these components in a single probabilistic model, thereby jointly optimizing <b>over</b> <b>compression</b> as well as learning tasks. We then derive an efficient variational inference scheme that provides joint posterior distribution over all the unobserved labels. The two key benefits of the model are that a) it can naturally handle datasets that have missing labels and b) it can also measure uncertainty in prediction. The uncertainty estimate provided by the model allows for active learning paradigms where an oracle provides information about labels that promise to be maximally informative for the prediction task. Our experiments show significant boost over prior methods in terms of prediction performance over benchmark datasets, both in the fully labeled and the missing labels case. Finally, we also highlight various useful active learning scenarios that are enabled by the probabilistic model. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Anisotropic {{diffusion}} filters with a diffusion tensor are suc-cessfully {{used in many}} {{image processing}} and computer vision applica-tions, ranging from image denoising <b>over</b> <b>compression</b> to optic flow com-putation. However, finding adequate numerical schemes is difficult: Im-plementations may suffer from dissipative artifacts, poor approximation of rotation invariance, and they may lack provable stability guarantees. In our {{paper we propose a}} general framework for finite difference dis-cretisations of anisotropic diffusion filters on a 3 × 3 stencil. It is based on a gradient descent of a discrete quadratic energy where the occurring derivatives are replaced by classical as well as the widely unknown non-standard finite differences in the sense of Mickens. This allows a large class of space discretisations with two free parameters. Combining it with an explicit or semi-implicit time discretisation, we establish a general and easily applicable stability theory in terms of a decreasing Euclidean norm. Our framework comprises as many as seven existing space discretisations from the literature. However, we show that also novel schemes are possi-ble that offer a better performance than existing ones. Our experimental evaluation confirms that the space discretisation can have a very sub-stantial and often underestimated impact on the quality of anisotropic diffusion filters...|$|E

Due to highly absorbent nature, the bentonite obviously demonstrates creep, swelling, and strain rate effects. This paper focuses on the influence of sand content on the one-dimensional strain rate dependent stress-strain behavior of a Silicon Sand Mixed Bentonite (SMB) based on the CRS test data. To study the strain rate effects and the influence of sand content on the one-dimensional stress-strain behavior, a total of five CRS tests with five different sand contents (50, 60, 70, 80 and 90) were conducted. The stress-strain behavior of the SMB exhibits considerable strain rate effects. Results and related analysis are presented in this paper. The results also show that the stress-strain behavior of the SMB can be significantly affected by the sand content. A specimen with higher sand proportion has higher stiffness but lower creep ability.

40|$|BackgroundVenous leg ulcers are a {{major cause}} of morbidity, {{economic}} loss, and decreased quality of life in affected patients. Recently, biomaterials derived from natural tissue sources have been used to stimulate wound closure. One such biomaterial obtained from porcine small-intestine submucosa (SIS) has shown promise as an effective treatment to manage full-thickness wounds. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of SIS wound matrix with compression vs compression alone in healing chronic leg ulcers within 12 weeks. MethodsThis was a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial. Patients were 120 patients with at least 1 chronic leg ulcer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either weekly topical treatment of SIS plus compression therapy (n = 62) or compression therapy alone (n = 58). Ulcer size was determined at enrollment and weekly throughout the treatment. Healing was assessed weekly for up to 12 weeks. Recurrence after 6 months was recorded. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of ulcers healed in each group at 12 weeks. ResultsAfter 12 weeks of treatment, 55 % of the wounds in the SIS group were healed, as compared with 34 % in the standard-care group (P =. 0196). None of the healed patients treated with SIS wound matrix and seen for the 6 -month follow-up experienced ulcer recurrence.

Unfortunately, the endeavor to understand becomes more complicated when the material of interest is actually a heterogeneous mixture of individual components rather than a single distended solid. The mixture may inherently have components with widely disparate densities, moduli, and strengths, thus adding to the challenge.
