5|$|Outside the temple, Nadir waits {{beside the}} funeral pyre as the crowd, singing and dancing, anticipates the dawn {{and the coming}} double {{execution}} (""). He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals {{that he is the}} man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee. As the couple depart, singing of the life of love that awaits them, Zurga is left alone, to await the fishermen's return ("!").|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system files. The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.|$|E

It is no wonder, then, that music was omnipresent at the Pythian Games, the Olympic Games, religious ceremonies, leisure activities, and even the beginnings of drama as an outgrowth of the dithyrambs performed in honor of Dionysus.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} mind (ToM) {{impairment}} describes a difficulty {{someone would have}} with perspective-taking. This is also {{sometimes referred to as}} mind-blindness. This means that individuals with a ToM impairment would have a difficult time seeing phenomena from any other perspective than their own. Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> behavior affects others, and have a difficult time with social reciprocity. ToM deficits have been observed in people with autism spectrum disorders, people with schizophrenia, people with nonverbal learning disorder, people with attention deficit disorder, persons {{under the influence of alcohol}} and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain.|$|E
25|$|On the balcony, Belle assures the Beast he'll live {{but they}} both know she is {{helpless}} to save him. She begs him not to leave her because she has found home in his company ("End Duet"), but despite this, he dies; Belle sobs on his body and says she loves him just before the last rose petal falls. A transformation takes place ("Transformation") and the Beast is alive and human once more. Though Belle doesn't recognize {{him for the first}} time, she looks into his eyes and sees the Beast within and they kiss. The two of them sing <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> lives have changed because of love and they dance once more as the company, now changed back to their human form, gathers in the ballroom ("Beauty and the Beast (Reprise)").|$|E
25|$|Leviathan and its {{subsequent}} sequels stand out notably to other young adult novels that are published {{in recent years}} for featuring illustrations in-between its pages. The idea of incorporating illustrations into them began back in 2007 when author Westerfeld had discovered illustrations for the Japanese translation of his earlier work Uglies, {{to which he had}} shared them on his blog. He was met with feedback from English-speaking fans who complained <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> novels were lacking in such features; until one reader pointed out how they are a norm in Japanese novels, particularly light novels. Further research by Westerfeld also found it to be a commonality in old Western novels prior to the invention of the camera. Inspiration also came from adventure novels that were around during the World War I era, which became one basis of research for the series' settings.|$|E

25|$|Between 700,000 and 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were {{expelled}} from the area that became Israel and became what is known today as the Palestinian refugees. The Palestinian refugees {{were not allowed to}} return to Israel and most of the neighboring Arab states, with the exception of Transjordan, denied granting them – or their descendants – citizenship. In 1949, Israel offered to allow some members of families that had been separated during the war to return, to release refugee accounts frozen in Israeli banks, and to repatriate 100,000 refugees. The Arab states rejected this compromise, at least in part because they were unwilling to take any action that might be construed as recognition of Israel. As of today, most of them still live in refugee camps and the question <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> situation should be resolved remains one of the main issues of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{matching}} hedge funds to investors {{has traditionally been}} fairly opaque, with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers. Many funds disclose their holdings, strategy, and historic performance relative to market indices, giving investors some idea <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> money is being allocated, although individual holdings are often not disclosed. Investors are often drawn to hedge funds {{by the possibility of}} realizing significant returns, or hedging against volatility in the market. The complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – Calpers, the largest pension fund in the US, announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in 2014. Some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors: HedgeZ is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds; iMatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investor's goals and behavioral profile, in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions.|$|E

500|$|In later chapters, Stratton {{covered the}} topics of the {{unconscious}} mind, the mind–body connection, and spiritual aspects of psychology. He attacked the standard dualist view of a separate homuncular entity driving the biology of mental processes. Still he concluded, from observations that people were not always aware <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> own perception differed from sensory reality, that a diluted form of the dualist theory was tenable. In his final chapter, the author posited experimental psychology neither needed nor ruled out {{the idea of a}} soul. Myers critiqued the book's treatment of illusions, memory, and relationship of psychology to body and soul, as not addressing the broader aspect of [...] "culture". Myers saw the work as appealing more to the educated reader than the specialist, the many deviations from experimental topics into subjective arenas a distraction.|$|E

500|$|London Calling {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} {{when it was}} first released in 1979. In a contemporary review for The New York Times, John Rockwell said the album finally validated the acclaim received by the Clash up to that point because <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> serious political themes and vital playing were retained in music with innovative features and broad appeal: [...] "This is an album that captures all the Clash's primal energy, combines it with a brilliant production job by Guy Stevens and reveals depths of invention and creativity barely suggested by the band's previous work." [...] Charles Shaar Murray wrote in NME that it was the first record to be on-par with the band's hype, while Melody Maker critic James Truman said the Clash had [...] "discovered themselves" [...] by embracing American music styles. Rolling Stone magazine's Tom Carson claimed the music celebrated [...] "the romance of rock & roll rebellion" [...] and was vast, engaging, and enduring enough to leave listeners [...] "not just exhilarated but exalted and triumphantly alive". In the opinion of Down Beat journalist Michael Goldberg, the Clash had produced [...] "a classic rock album which, literally, defines the state of rock and roll and against which the very best of [...] will have to be judged." [...] Charlie Gillett was less impressed, believing some of the songs sounded like poor imitations of Bob Dylan backed by a horn section. In Sounds, Garry Bushell was more critical and gave the record two out of five stars, claiming the Clash had [...] "retrogressed" [...] to Rolling Stones-style [...] "outlaw imagery" [...] and [...] "tired old rock clichés".|$|E

2500|$|It is essential, {{according}} to Dewey, that {{the classroom teacher}} has the mental propensity to overcome the demands and stressors placed on her because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] Such negative demeanors, {{according to}} Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. [...] It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers must be aware <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.|$|E

2500|$|The current {{majority}} {{view of the}} Supreme Court supports substantive due process rights {{in a number of}} areas.
