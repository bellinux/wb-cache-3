5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of appropriation bills into the Parliament, the expenditure proposed in those bills is referred to Senate legislation committees for inquiry.

5|$|A typical year in {{the life}} of a Senate {{legislation}} committee will see it conduct eight days <b>of</b> <b>hearings</b> around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates). In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into pieces of legislation being considered by the parliament. A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate. Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations). A consolidated list of the reports prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the Department of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|On September 25, 1989, several Republicans from Ohio {{filed an}} ethics {{complaint}} against Glenn, charging {{that he had}} improperly intervened on Keating's behalf. The initial charges against the five Senators were made on October 13, 1989, by Common Cause, a public interest group, who asked for the U.S. Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate {{the actions of the}} senators relative to Lincoln and the contributions received from Keating and whether they violated the rules of the Senate or federal election laws. But the most public attention came from the House Banking Committee, whose new chair Henry B. Gonzalez held 50hours <b>of</b> <b>hearings</b> into the Lincoln failure and associated events.|$|E

5|$|The inquiry was {{launched}} on 31 May 2001, and was {{split into two}} phases: phase one and phase two. Phase one investigated the involvement of people and agencies in Climbié's death, in the form <b>of</b> <b>hearings.</b> Two hundred and seventy witnesses were involved. The phase one hearings began on 26 September 2001 and finished on 31 July 2002; it was originally supposed to end on 4 February 2002 but late documents caused delays. Phase two of the inquiry, taking place between 15 March 2002 and 26 April 2002, {{took the form of}} five seminars, which looked at the child protection system in general. It was chaired by Garnham and brought together experts in all aspects of child protection.|$|E
5|$|Britain's key {{argument}} was that (prior to Venezuela's independence) Spain {{had not taken}} effective possession of the disputed territory, and said that in fact the local Indians had had alliances with the Dutchs, giving the Dutch a sphere of influence which the British acquired in 1814. After fifty-five days <b>of</b> <b>hearings,</b> the arbitrators retired for six days. The American arbitrators found the British argument preposterous, since American Indians had never been considered to have any sovereignty. However the British had the advantage that Martens wanted a unanimous decision, and the British threatened to ignore the award if it didn't suit them. They were also able to argue a loss of equity, since {{under the terms of}} the treaty lands occupied for fifty years would receive title – and a number of British gold mines would be narrowly lost to this cutoff if their lands were awarded to Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met in a number <b>of</b> <b>hearings,</b> finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account.

Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 {{to settle for a}} much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced railwayman and already on the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E

5|$|Starting in March 1984, Congress chaired {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>hearings</b> into FX. William Schneider, Jr., the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, testified that FX policy might {{not result in}} any sales, in spite of any {{government}} support. He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy, secondarily a commercial venture. Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's CEO, argued {{that there was little}} point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them. He suggested the FX concept be dropped, and F-20 allowed to be sold by the vendor. Additionally, Brigadier General Thomas Baker, USAF Director of International Programs, testified that the Air Force was not actively marketing FX. He observed that over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries, none were FX. He also compared France's aircraft exports, showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed. In the Committee's concluding remarks, the State Department and DOD were accused of rhetoric, and lacking support, on FX.|$|E
5|$|The United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also {{known as}} the McClellan Committee) was a select {{committee}} created by the United States Senate on January 30, 1957, and dissolved on March 31, 1960. The select committee was directed to study the extent of criminal or other improper practices {{in the field of}} labor-management relations or in groups of employees or employers, and to suggest changes in the laws of the United States that would provide protection against such practices or activities. It conducted 253 active investigations, served 8,000 subpoenas for witnesses and documents, held 270 days <b>of</b> <b>hearings,</b> took testimony from 1,526 witnesses (343 of whom invoked the Fifth Amendment), and compiled almost 150,000 pages of testimony. At the peak of its activity in 1958, 104 persons worked for the committee.|$|E
5|$|A belt route around Salt Lake City {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1955, with the Utah Highway Department (the predecessor to the present-day Utah Department of Transportation) holding hearings concerning construction beginning in early 1958. The southeast quadrant {{of the route}} was originally placed from a junction at proposed I-15 in Murray northeasterly through Murray and Holladay, eventually reaching the east bench at 3900 South. From there, it would have run north toward the mouth of Parley's Canyon at proposed I-80 (at the time US-40). Almost immediately, this plan was met with opposition among local residents in the area. The proposed route would have bisected the primarily residential Holladay suburb, {{as well as the}} southern portion of Murray. After more than two years <b>of</b> <b>hearings</b> and widespread opposition from residents, the Highway Department released their proposed routing in June 1960, which placed the southeast quadrant where it runs today. While quelling criticism from some, others remained in opposition, saying the route was still too intrusive along residential areas. The western quadrant was also admonished for being placed to close to other major arterials. In November 1963, a small, two-lane portion of the northwest quadrant of the belt route opened from Redwood Road (SR-68) in Davis County west and south to 2100 North, north of the Salt Lake City International Airport. This portion of road was extended east to I-15 in North Salt Lake and upgraded to freeway standards by 1969.|$|E

5|$|PBHistory {{documents}} {{were used by}} the officials of various governments. US ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge made use of 21 documents in a speech he made at the United Nations. Information was also funneled to US ambassadors and Congresspeople. The US Congress in 1954 was among the few Republican controlled Congresses in many years. Republicans thus sought to use an anti-communist push to generate support for themselves and to erode the voting base of the Democratic party. Anti-Communist members of the US Congress, such as Charles J. Kersten and Patrick J. Hillings of the Kersten Committee, enthusiastically involved themselves with PBHistory. By August 1954, Kersten was receiving PBHistory documents from Dulles so he could use them in speeches to Congress about the Soviet Union's influence in Guatemala. In September and October 1954, the Kersten Committee held a number <b>of</b> <b>hearings,</b> purportedly investigating the penetration of communist influence. PBHistory {{documents were}} used in this process, and Carlos Castillo Armas became the first head of state to testify before a US Congress committee (although he did so {{through the use of}} a tape recording of his testimony). Although the hearings did little to unearth information about communist presence in Guatemala, they did provide Operation PBHistory with huge publicity within the US.|$|E
5|$|The people {{involved}} in the Oregon track and field program have led changes that benefited professional athletes and coaches, as well as running enthusiasts. Bill Bowerman experimented with many coaching techniques during his time as a head coach at the University of Oregon and instilled many of his principles from his days as a Major in the US Army. For example, Bowerman pioneered in using film as a method of teaching technique to his athletes. With Bowerman's meticulous attention to details, he made other discoveries with regards to coaching track. The training schedules he developed for his athletes ran counter to many other coaches' principles at the time. He believed that each individual athlete was different and tailored different workout routines to different athletes. He also scaled his workouts up and down, giving some of his athletes rest on certain days for recovery time. This attention to detail also led him to become obsessed with experimentation of reducing the weight of his athletes' apparel and increasing the traction of their shoes which eventually {{led to the creation of}} the apparel company Nike. Moreover, Bowerman considered himself more of a teacher than a coach and stressed schoolwork as well as mentoring his athletes with regards to life. Tom Heinonen, the former head coach of the Oregon women's track and field program was a strong advocate of female athletics at a time when female athletics were largely an afterthought. Steve Prefontaine was vehemently outspoken against the Amateur Athletic Union. Kenny Moore, a former University of Oregon student who ran track under Bowerman, was one of the speakers at the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, a series <b>of</b> <b>hearings</b> regarding amateur sports. These efforts along with those from other amateur athletes eventually culminated in the passage of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.|$|E
