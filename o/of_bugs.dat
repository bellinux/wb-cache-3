5|$|Bugfix releases, which {{introduce}} no {{new features}} but fix bugs. The {{third and final}} part of the version number is incremented. These releases are made whenever a sufficient number <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> have been fixed upstream since the last release, or roughly every 3 months. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in bugfix releases.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the {{algorithms}} meant that some calculations, such as arccos0.2, could take up to 15 seconds, whereas the HP-35 was designed to complete calculations in under a second. Accuracy in scientific functions was also limited to around three digits at most, {{and there were a}} number <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> and limitations.|$|E
5|$|The Mysterium Tech (or MysTech) {{system allows}} players to use in-game objects collectively known as MysTech, {{and create new}} MysTech by using a {{configuration}} screen accessed through Elementor Host items. MysTech cannot be used until they are awakened after a certain story event. Eight basic colors of MysTech exist, representing different elements; for example, green represents poison. Players can use MysTech to inflict damage upon enemies, plague them with certain status effects (such as freezing them in place), or heal party members. Casting status effect-MysTech on party members will cure them if afflicted by enemy status spells. MysTech slabs and Elementor Hosts can be found as treasure in the game world or bought from shops. To create MysTech, players place colored bugs (found on small hills in several game locations) in empty slots on an Elementor Host. The color <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> placed in the function slot determines the color of MysTech, while other slots modify the power and/or range of the spell. Players can add special bugs known as Cobalt Crawlers to make a spell target all enemies instead of one; a Host filled with eight Crawlers unlocks a secret spell. The effect <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> can be amplified by feeding them petals from Lifeflowers, {{which can be found}} scattered throughout the world of Anachronox. Special types of Hosts with two or three different functions allow players to pick which MysTech function to use in battle.|$|E

30|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} generalizability, we selected a higher number of projects compared to previous studies. Given the criteria defined in Section 3.3, {{we were able to}} select 20 projects, a considerably higher number of projects compared to other studies on bug localization (5 times more than the BLUiR (Saha et al. 2013), BugLocator (Zhou et al. 2012), and AmaLgam (Wang and Lo 2014) studies). The absence <b>of</b> a standardized <b>bug</b> database, however, greatly reduced the amount <b>of</b> <b>bug</b> reports available for the experiment (Table 1). The relatively low quantity <b>of</b> <b>bug</b> reports and the variation in quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>bug</b> reports observed on each project are threats to the external validity of our study. However, we consider that bug localization techniques must be assessed under realistic project settings, i.e., the quantity <b>of</b> <b>bug</b> projects naturally varies widely from one project to another. The complete list of evaluated projects and the number <b>of</b> <b>bug</b> reports evaluated for each one is available at the study website (Garnier 2016).|$|R

5|$|By {{the release}} of the game's second demo in March 2011, the team's goals for the mod had {{expanded}} to a total overhaul of Brawl to better match Melees gameplay mechanics. A newer build added 11 characters and was first playable at the Genesis 2 tournament. The second demo, released on April 15, 2012, added four new characters as well as more stages and changes in multiple characters' gameplay mechanics. Players of this second demo reported a number <b>of</b> <b>bugs,</b> but these were fixed shortly afterwards in version 2.1. A demo version numbered 2.5 was announced on September 10, 2012; it featured changes such as balance updates, aesthetic improvements, stage updates, and palette swaps for the characters. Version 2.5 was released on December 28.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Who Framed Roger Rabbit rekindled an {{interest}} in the Golden Age of American animation, and sparked the modern animation scene. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey's Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced; Tummy Trouble played in front of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Roller Coaster Rabbit was shown with Dick Tracy and Trail Mix-Up was included with A Far Off Place. The film also inspired a short-lived comic book and video game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle (which features Roger instead <b>of</b> <b>Bugs),</b> a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production was {{originally}} estimated at ten months, but ultimately extended to fourteen months. Each {{time a new}} movement or ability was created for the Prince, it required adjustments to multiple other systems, as leaving them alone would have damaged the game. They also needed to make adjustments to the enemy and partner artificial intelligence, {{and they did not}} have time to polish those systems. All this meant that the debugging started much later than originally scheduled. The Prince had over 780 scripted movements, far more than any other character in the game. This caused problems with creating the movements for other characters. To make the character movements realistic, the team used motion capture to animate their movements. Art director Raphael Lacoste did not join the team until July 2002, well into the game's production, resulting in multiple delays in creating the game's environments. This issue was compounded by the need to produce a demo for the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, then to deliver an entire game at the same if not a higher quality than the demo. Each environment needed to work for the Prince's set of movements and abilities: the work needed involved checking each rewind sequence, and each of the Prince's movement in and effect on the environment worked. These issues were compounded by the late delivery of environmental maps. In hindsight, producer Yannis Mallat lamented the fact {{that they did not have}} enough time to work out the problems caused by these issues. Despite these problems, other parts of production including play-testing, management of creative tools, and the integrated testing system worked smoothly. A cited example was the team discovering a tester that was good at finding severe bugs, so they included her in one of their testing groups, giving her a development kit she could use to sort out those bugs. This was replicated, and managed to greatly increase the amount <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> that could be found and fixed. The development team's enthusiasm was also high, which enabled the problems during development to be overcome. During the aftermath of E3, the team considered release The Sands of Time as two games so they could include all the desired content, but the idea was dropped. Another element that needed to be cut after the demo was a griffin boss that would appear three times during the Prince's journey.|$|E

25|$|Biological {{methods of}} pest control have {{sometimes}} backfired. A parasitoid fly which preys on hemipterans, Trichopoda pennipes {{was introduced to}} Hawaii to control the invasive species Nezara viridula, the southern green stink bug. The fly now threatens native species <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> in Hawaii as well, particularly the Koa bug (Coleotichus blackburniae, a jewel bug species notable for not possessing stink glands) which has now become rare.|$|E

Vertebrates {{are represented by}} about 200 species, of which 130 are protected. Forty species of mammals include the bear, fox, wolf, wildcat, deer, boar, and marten. The National Park is home to 65 endangered species, including the saker falcon, European otter and European ground squirrel.|$|E
40|$|Large {{open source}} {{software}} projects receive abundant rates <b>of</b> submitted <b>bug</b> reports. Triaging these incoming reports manually is error-prone and time consuming. The goal <b>of</b> <b>bug</b> triaging is to assign potentially experienced developers to new-coming bug reports. To reduce time and cost <b>of</b> <b>bug</b> triaging, we present an automatic approach to predict a developer with relevant experience to solve the new coming report. In this paper, we investigate the use of five term selection methods on the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>bug</b> assignment. In addition, we re-balance the load between developers based on their experience. We conduct experiments on four real datasets. The experimental results show that by selecting {{a small number of}} discriminating terms, the F-score can be significantly improved. </p...|$|R

25|$|The Indians {{began their}} playoff run by {{defeating}} the Yankees in the ALDS three games to one. This series {{will be most}} remembered for the swarm <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> that overtook {{the field in the}} later innings of Game Two. They also jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead over the Red Sox in the ALCS. The season ended in disappointment when Boston swept the final three games to advance to the 2007 World Series.|$|E
25|$|Some classes <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> {{have nothing}} to do with the code. Faulty {{documentation}} or hardware may lead to problems in system use, even though the code matches the documentation. In some cases, changes to the code eliminate the problem even though the code then no longer matches the documentation. Embedded systems frequently work around hardware bugs, since to make a new version of a ROM is much cheaper than remanufacturing the hardware, especially if they are commodity items.|$|E

25|$|DMOZ data is made {{available}} through an RDF-like dump that is published on a download server, older versions are also archived there. New versions are usually generated weekly. An DMOZ editor has catalogued a number <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> that are {{encountered in the}} DMOZ RDF dump, most importantly that the file format isn't RDF. So while today the so-called RDF dump is valid XML, it is not valid RDF and as such, software to process the DMOZ RDF dump needs to be specifically written for DMOZ data.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} {{need to apply}} costly techniques such as formal verification or manual review, {{the size of the}} TCB has immediate consequences on the economics of the TCB assurance process, and the trustworthiness of the resulting product (in terms of the mathematical expectation of the number <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> not found during the verification or review). In order to reduce costs and security risks, the TCB should therefore be kept as small as possible. This is a key argument in the debate preferring microkernels to monolithic kernels.|$|E
25|$|Assassin's Creed Syndicate debuted {{at number}} one in the UK {{according}} to Chart-Track. However, in its first week it was the second worst selling game of the franchise in the UK, only outselling Assassin's Creed Rogue. According to reports from Ubisoft these lower sales in the first week were due to the release of Assassin's Creed Unity (2014) having a negative impact on the sales due to its notorious amount <b>of</b> <b>bugs</b> and glitches at launch. Syndicates second week sales beat those of Unitys. The game was the ninth best-selling retail game in the UK.|$|E
