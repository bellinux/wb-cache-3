5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of boron is nonmetallic in nature. Unlike its heavier congeners, {{it is not known}} to form a simple B3+ or hydrated 3+ cation. The small size of the boron atom enables the preparation of many interstitial alloy-type borides. Analogies between boron and transition metals have been noted in the formation of complexes, and adducts (for example, BH3 + CO →BH3CO and, similarly, Fe(CO)4 + CO →Fe(CO)5), {{as well as in the}} geometric and electronic structures of cluster species such as 2− and 2−. The aqueous chemistry of boron is characterised by the formation of many different polyborate anions. Given its high charge-to-size ratio, boron bonds covalently in nearly all of its compounds; the exceptions are the borides as these include, depending on their composition, covalent, ionic and metallic bonding components. Simple binary compounds, such as boron trichloride are Lewis acids as the formation of three covalent bonds leaves a hole in the octet which can be filled by an electron-pair donated by a Lewis base. Boron has a strong affinity for oxygen and a duly extensive borate chemistry. The oxide B2O3 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Organometallic compounds of boron have been known since the 19th century (see <b>organoboron</b> chemistry).|$|E

40|$|Metal-catalyzed {{catalytic}} asymmetric reactions {{have gained}} enormous attentions and the utilities of such reactions have facilitated natural products syntheses to afford highly bioactive molecules. While these reactions have provided reliable methodologies to transform basic reactants into product(s) with highly enantio- and regioselective manners, the incompatibility with a many functional {{groups and the}} associated need to employ protecting groups increases the number of synthetic steps required. Herein, a solution to such an issue has been proposed in catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of styrene derivatives where supramolecular catalysts developed by Takacs et al. were used to achieve highly regio- and stereoselective reaction on functionalized alkenes without the usage of protection chemistry.

Thus, studies of catalytic asymmetric hydroboration have shown exponential growth over the past decade. Despite many successful advancements in catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of various substrates, not much attention has been paid to a formation of hydrogenation by-product which is a common observation from various research groups around the world. In this thesis, mechanism of hydrogenation by-product was investigated by both experimentally and computationally and a boron assisted hydrogenation mechanism is proposed to account for the hydrogenation by-product. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Organoborons</b> are {{normally}} regarded as relatively sensitive compounds {{that are used}} immediately upon preparation for synthetic transformations in which the carbon-boron bond is exploited as the key reactive functional group in the desired conversion. Synthetic sequences can be envisioned, however, in which it would be desirable to carry the boron moiety through several routine transformations on remotely embedded functional groups before taking advantage of its unique properties in new bond-forming events. Organotrifluoroborates provide an ideal platform to explore these possibilities as the boron moiety of these species is effectively immunized against a number of routine chemical operations. In this work the elaboration of alkene- and aldehyde-containing organotrifluoroborates through ozonolysis and reductive amination, respectively, is explored. ^ I. Ozonolysis of Unsaturated Organotrifluoroborates. Organotrifluoroborates are robust reagents capable of withstanding ozonolysis of remote alkenes, thus providing a new route to oxo-substituted organotrifluoroborates. The ozonides initially generated upon ozonolysis can be reduced with Zn/AcOH to afford the carbonyl compounds. Alternatively, capture of the carbonyl oxides with either an appropriate N-oxide or H 2 O easily gives the desired oxo-substituted organotrifluoroborates. Both unsaturated alkyltrifluoroborates and -aryltrifluoroborates effectively participate in the reaction. The process provides oxo-functionalized organotrifluoroborates that cannot be prepared directly via either transmetalation or hydroboration protocols. *^ II. Reductive Amination of Aldehyde-Containing Organotrifluoroborates. Herein is reported the conversion of aldehyde-containing potassium and tetrabutylammonium organotrifluoroborates to the corresponding amines through reductive amination protocols. Potassium formate facilitated by catalytic palladium acetate, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, and pyridine borane have all served as effective reducing agents with the initially formed imines or iminium ions to provide the corresponding amines. *^ *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams. ...|$|R
40|$|Organotrifluoroborates {{have emerged}} {{in the past decade}} as {{suitable}} nucleophilic partners for the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, acting as masked boronic acids. These compounds are deprotected under conditions required for cross-coupling. Their tetracoordinate nature renders them inert to a myriad of chemical transformations and allows them to undergo the transmetalation step of the catalytic cycle with limited interference from competitive protodeboronation. The main focus of the research done has been to utilize organotrifluoroborates to: 1) Generate a new class of organometallic reagents for the development of novel disconnections in molecular structures, 2) Use their enhanced stability during transmetalation to effect new strategies for the incorporation of primary and secondary alkyl groups onto aryl electrophiles, and 3) Develop a new bidirectional functionalization strategy through the use of boryl-substituted organotrifluoroborates. ^ Owing to the prevalence and importance of aminomethyl alkenyl- or aryl linkages in bioactive molecules, the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of N,N-dialkyl- and monoalkylaminomethyltrifluoroborates with aryl electrophiles was explored. A variety of these aminomethyltrifluoroborate substrates were prepared and shown to cross-couple with a variety of aryl electrophiles, generating the corresponding benzylamines in moderate to excellent yields. This serves as a powerful alternative to the more traditional reductive amination route to the same compounds. * ^ The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of primary and secondary (including secondary β-trifluoroboratoamides) organotrifluoroborates has been achieved with aryl electrophiles. This represents the first body of work devoted to developing a strategy devoted to accomplishing alkylation with limited interference from β-hydride elimination. * ^ The concept of bidirectional functionalization was investigated through the use of orthogonally reactive dibora species. Given the vast reactivity differences between tetracoordinate organotrifluoroborates and virtually all tricoordinate <b>organoborons,</b> boryl-substituted organotrifluoroborate permitted selective reactivity at one boron center, leaving the second intact for subsequent transformation. * ^ *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{known since}} the 1930 s, organogold {{chemistry}} has been dormant until recently, {{primarily due to}} preconceptions about the inertness of gold in transformations. However, this last decade has witnessed {{the emergence of a}} Golden Age with the development of a wealth of reports on gold in a plethora of reactions. In recent years, the drive for more atom- and step-economical and environmentally friendly reactions has become a field of intense research. In our on-going research on well-defined transition metal complexes bearing NHC ligands, our group recently discovered a new gold(I) hydroxide complex [Au(OH) (IPr) ] (1 a) that can be easily synthesised from the chloride precursor [AuCl(IPr) ] (1 b). A preliminary survey of the reactivity of this gold synthon has demonstrated interesting reactivity that holds great potential in bond activation reactions and the development of useful synthetic methods. Simplistically, this gold hydroxide complex {{can be seen as a}} strong Brønsted base. This thesis is dedicated to an in-depth examination of the reactivity of this complex in base-free bond activation reactions. Two themes predominate in the following chapters: the first part demonstrates the activity of gold(I) hydroxide as a bond activation agent to readily and efficiently access organogold complexes while the second part studies the reactivity of this compound in decarboxylation processes with carboxylic acids. Chapter 2 and 3 were dedicated to the development of new synthetic routes to access organogold complexes via base-free transmetalation reactions with <b>organoborons</b> and silanes using 1 a. The combination of experimental and computational studies allowed identification and isolation of key intermediates in these reactions. Chapter 4 can be seen as a transition between the development of novel methodologies to synthesise aryl and heteroarylgold complexes and the first steps of gold hydroxide 1 a as mediator in decarboxylation reaction. As a result, a novel mode of reactivity for gold was discovered and the synthetic route developed constitutes one of the greenest procedures to prepare organogold complexes with the generation of water and CO₂ as only side products.

25|$|Metal-catalyzed C–H borylation {{reactions}} are transition metal catalyzed organic reactions that produce an <b>organoboron</b> compound through functionalization of aliphatic and aromatic C–H bonds {{and are therefore}} useful reactions for carbon–hydrogen bond activation. Metal-catalyzed C–H borylation reactions utilize transition metals to directly convert a C–H bond into a C–B bond. This route can be advantageous compared to traditional borylation reactions by making use of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon starting material, limiting prefunctionalized organic compounds, reducing toxic byproducts, and streamlining the synthesis of biologically important molecules. Boronic acids, and boronic esters are common boryl groups incorporated into organic molecules through borylation reactions. Boronic acids are trivalent boron-containing organic compounds that possess one alkyl substituent and two hydroxyl groups. Similarly, boronic esters possess one alkyl substituent and two ester groups. Boronic acids and esters are classified {{depending on the type}} of carbon group (R) directly bonded to boron, for example alkyl-, alkenyl-, alkynyl-, and aryl-boronic esters. The most common type of starting materials that incorporate boronic esters into organic compounds for transition metal catalyzed borylation reactions have the general formula (RO)2B-B(OR)2. For example, Bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2Pin2), and bis(catecholato)diborane (B2Cat2) are common boron sources of this general formula.|$|E
40|$|Boron-carbon {{thin films}} enriched with 10 B are {{potential}} neutron converting layers for 10 B-based solid state neutron detectors given the good neutron {{absorption cross section}} of 10 B atoms in thin films. The common neutron-transparent base material, Al (melting point 660 °C), limits the deposition temperature {{and the use of}} chlorinated precursors forming corrosive by-products such as HCl. Therefore, the <b>organoborons</b> triethylboron B(C 2 H 5) 3 (TEB) and trimethylboron B(CH 3) 3 (TMB) are evaluated as precursors for CVD of BxC films. In order to get a complete understanding of the CVD behaviour of these precursors for deposition of boron containing films, both thermal CVD and plasma CVD of BxC films have been demonstrated. A gas phase chemical mechanism at the corresponding thermal CVD conditions was proposed by quantum chemical calculations while chemical mechanism in the plasma was suggested based on plasma composition obtained from Optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The behaviours of TEB and TMB in thermal CVD are investigated by depositing BxC films in both H 2 and Ar atmospheres, respectively. Films deposited using TEB within a temperature window of 600 – 1000 °C are X-ray amorphous with 2. 5 ≤ x ≤ 4. 5. The impurity level of H is less than 1 at. % above 600 °C. Calculations predict that the gas phase reactions are dominated by β-hydride eliminations of C 2 H 4 to yield BH 3. In addition, a complementary bimolecular reaction path based on H 2 assisted C 2 H 6 elimination to BH 3 is also present at lower temperatures in the presence of hydrogen molecules. As for films deposited with TMB, dense, amorphous, boron rich (B/C = 1. 5 - 3) films are obtained at 1000 °C in both H 2 and Ar atmosphere.   The quantum chemical calculations suggest that the TMB molecule is mainly decomposed by unimolecular α- elimination of CH 4 complemented by H 2 assisted elimination of CH 4. Plasma CVD of BxC thin films has been studied using both TMB and TEB as single-source precursors in an Ar plasma at temperatures lower than that allowed by thermal CVD. The effect of plasma power, TMB/TEB and Ar gas flow on film composition and morphology are investigated. The highest B/C ratio of 1. 9 is found for films deposited at highest plasma power (2400 W) and high TMB flow (7 sccm). The H content in the films stays almost constant at 15 ± 5 at. %. The B-C bonding is dominant in the films while small amounts of C-C and B-O exist, likely due to formation of amorphous carbon and surface oxidation. Film density is determined as 2. 16 ± 0. 01 g/cm 3 and the internal compressive stresses are measured to be less than 400 MPa. OES shows that TMB is decomposed to mainly atomic H, C 2, BH, and CH. A plasma chemical model for decomposition of the TMB is constructed using a combination of film and plasma composition. It is suggested that the decomposition of TMB starts with dehydrogenation of the methyl groups followed by breakage of the B-C bonds to form the CH radicals. This bond breaking is at least partly assisted by hydrogen in forming the BH radicals. When films are deposited using TEB flow of 5 and 7 sccm, the B/C ratio is found to be plasma power dependent while the carbon content is almost not affected. The highest B/C ratio of 1. 7 is obtained at the highest power applied (2400 W) and attributed to better dissociation of TEB at higher plasma power. The H content in the films is within 14 - 20 at. %. The density of films is increased to 2. 20 g/cm 3 with increasing plasma power and attributed to a higher energetic surface bombardment during deposition. The oxygen content in the film is reduced to less than 1 at. % with increasing plasma power due to the densification of  the films preventing surface oxidation upon air exposure. Plasma composition from OES shows that the TEB molecules are also dissociated mainly to BH, CH, C 2 and H. A plasma chemical model where the first ethyl group is split off by β-hydrogen elimination to form C 2 H 4, which is further dehydrogenated to C 2 H 2 and  forms C 2 and CH is suggested. The BH species is assumed to be formed by the dehydrogenation of remaining ethyl groups and breakage of the remaining B-C bonds to form BH...|$|R
