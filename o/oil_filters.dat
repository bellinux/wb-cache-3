5|$|Marine {{transport}} {{can also}} be impacted by volcanic ash. Ash fall will block air and <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> and abrade any moving parts if ingested into engines. Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during ash fall. Vesiculated ash (pumice and scoria) will float on the water surface in ‘pumice rafts’ which can clog water intakes quickly, leading to over heating of machinery.|$|E
5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E

The <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> {{materials are}} frequently subjected to abrading {{and all kinds}} of friction and making the materials suffered from damage,consequently,the property and service life of the filter materials is reduced. So the purpose of this thesis is to research the tensile performance of the automobile <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> material and according to constant speed tensile test to measure the macro fracture characteristics,tensile property in the process of before and after tensile testing,tensile fracture form and the math expression. Then compared the breaking strength,breaking elongation,elongation at break and breaking work of these ten <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> materials. Hope that through the study on the tensile performance of the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> materials and summarizes the damage mechanism and tensile fracture form,in order to provides a new way to develop the new material...|$|R

25|$|When introduced, the block-mounted {{oil filter}} check valve was {{eliminated}} on the 4.0 (along with the 2.5 and 4.2s manufactured after September 1986) when AMC engineers standardized their <b>oil</b> <b>filters.</b> The pre-1987 engines had an oil filter adapter with 3/4 (cylinder block end) and 13/16 threads (which used a GM oil filter common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac V8 engines) while the 1987-06 engines were originally {{fitted with a}} 20mm metric thread filter (later revised in 1991 for the common 3/4 threaded Mopar and Ford V8 oil filter; the oil filter adapter was redesigned where the oil filter is positioned 90 degrees offset adjacent to the starter motor - a Ford V8 oil filter {{can be used in}} place of the short filter increasing oiling capacity).|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} to design a new diesel engine family that could be {{produced}} in various capacities and states of tune suitable for all of Rover's needs. The development was codenamed Project Storm and design responsibility was given to Land Rover who were to build the engines. The result was a range of engines using the L-Series as a base—the bore/stroke dimensions were the same and the Storm engine used the same piston and connecting rod assemblies. The Storm utilised Electronic Unit Injection by Lucas (at the time this technology was rare on small-capacity engine, being used only on large commercial vehicles) and a cross-flow aluminium alloy cylinder head on a cast-iron block. The designers had aimed at increasing servicing intervals so the engine incorporated both conventional and centrifugal <b>oil</b> <b>filters.</b> The electronic systems included an 'anti-stall' system to allow heavy loads to be started from rest at idle speed and two programmed operating modes for road and off-road use. The overhead camshaft (operating both valves and the unit injectors) was chain-driven. The Storm design encompassed 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder engines (of 2, 2.5 and 3 litres respectively).|$|E
