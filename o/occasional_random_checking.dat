30|$|The {{mutation}} {{operation is}} the <b>occasional</b> <b>random</b> alteration {{of the genes}} in a chromosome. By performing <b>occasional</b> <b>random</b> changes in the chromosomes, GAs ensure that new parts of the search space are reached, which reproduction and crossover cannot fully guarantee. In doing so, mutation ensures that no important features are prematurely lost, thus maintaining the mating pool diversity. For this investigation, we have considered the reciprocal exchange mutation, which selects two genes randomly and swaps them.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tests for}} the {{presence}} of nonlinear dynamics in selected Asian short rates and employs a regime varying unit root test to detect non-stationarity for distinct regimes. Nonlinearities in the form of Markov-switching dynamics are found in all short rates sample.

The <b>occasional</b> <b>random</b> walk and mean-reverting dynamics of short rates are attributed to the macroeconomic fundamentals, exchange rate regimes and monetary policy objectives in these economies. ...|$|R
