5|$|A {{field study}} {{carried out at}} Jandakot Airport south of Perth and {{published}} in 1988 found that birds and insects overwhelmingly preferred visiting yellow-coloured flowerheads. The species recorded include several species of honeyeater, including the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), western wattlebird (A. lunulata), western spinebill, brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), white-cheeked honeyeater (P. nigra), singing honeyeater, (Lichenostomus virescens), {{as well as the}} twenty-eight parrot (Barnardius zonarius semitorquatus) two species of native bee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Leioproctus, a beetle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Liparetrus, and ant species Iridomyrmex conifer.

5|$|Bee-eaters may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice {{of the genera}} Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means that they tend to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Photuris revealed they emit {{the same light}} signals that females <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E
