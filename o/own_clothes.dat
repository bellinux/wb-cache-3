5|$|Under Louis, {{only between}} 20 and 50 prisoners were usually {{held at the}} Bastille at any one time, {{although}} as many as 111 were held {{for a short period}} in 1703. These prisoners were mainly from the upper classes, and those who could afford to pay for additional luxuries lived in good conditions, wearing their <b>own</b> <b>clothes,</b> living in rooms decorated with tapestries and carpets or taking exercise around the castle garden and along the walls. By the late 17th century, there was a rather disorganised library for the use of inmates in the Bastille, although its origins remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|Prince Christian {{was given}} the title Prince of Denmark and his family {{moved into a new}} {{official}} residence, Bernstorff Palace. Although the family's status had risen, there was little or no increase in their income and they did not participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick's third wife and former mistress, Louise Rasmussen, because she had an illegitimate child by a previous lover. Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, Dagmar (later Empress of Russia), made her <b>own</b> <b>clothes</b> and waited at table along with her sisters. Alexandra and Dagmar were given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of women's swimming, Nancy Edberg. At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was confirmed in Christiansborg Palace. She was devout throughout her life, and followed High Church practice.|$|E

25|$|Cross {{at first}} was the typical {{hard-working}} wife of a country clergyman, taking part in all {{the activities of the}} parish and incidentally making her <b>own</b> children's <b>clothes.</b> Her health, however, broke down, {{for a number of reasons}} including a near-fatal miscarriage and a serious carriage accident, and her activities had to be reduced, but she continued to write.|$|R
25|$|It {{is evident}} {{how much he}} learned from Arcangelo Corelli about writing for instruments, and from Alessandro Scarlatti about writing for the solo voice; {{but there is no}} single {{composer}} who taught him how to write for chorus. Handel tended more and more to replace Italian soloists by English ones. The most significant reason for this change was the dwindling financial returns from his operas. Thus a tradition was created for oratorios which was to govern their future performance. The performances were given without costumes and action; the singers appeared in their <b>own</b> <b>clothes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Manser {{spent three}} months in Lucerne prison when he was 19 years old because, as an ardent {{follower}} of non-violent ideologies espoused by Mahatma Gandhi (Satyagraha) he refused to participate in Switzerland's compulsory military service. After leaving prison in 1973, {{he worked as a}} sheep and cow herder at various Swiss Alpine pastures for 12 years. During this time, he became interested in handicrafts, therapeutics, and speleology. He laid bricks, carved leather, kept bees, and wove, dyed, and cut his <b>own</b> <b>clothes</b> and shoes. He also regularly pursued mountaineering and technical climbing.|$|E
25|$|As {{a fitness}} instructor, Smith found {{a lack of}} {{appealing}} clothes in which to work and started to sew her own. She had no formal training in garment production, but had been interested in fashion since a teenager, crocheting bikinis from age 16, customising her clothes from age 18, and from age 21 starting to design and make her <b>own</b> <b>clothes.</b> She began by unpicking a favourite swimsuit {{and used it to}} make a pattern out of newspaper, providing the basis for her first leotard design. Her students liked her outfits, and started requesting that Smith make clothes for them too.|$|E

25|$|In 1802 {{she left}} Drury Lane and {{subsequently}} appeared {{from time to}} time on the stage of the rival establishment, Covent Garden. It was there, on 29 June 1812, that she gave perhaps the most extraordinary farewell performance in theatre history. She was playing her most famous role, Lady Macbeth, and the audience refused to allow the play to continue {{after the end of the}} sleepwalking scene. Eventually, after tumultuous applause from the pit, the curtain reopened and Siddons was discovered sitting in her <b>own</b> <b>clothes</b> and character â€” whereupon she made an emotional farewell speech to the audience lasting eight minutes.|$|E
25|$|In this {{interview}} he also expressed {{his belief that}} currently, the global market is the largest force shaping {{the lives of people}} throughout the world. For this reason, he believes that {{the most effective way to}} solve social problems in individual countries is to address them at a global level by changing the policies dictating the global market. He explained that since most people are not given the power to directly change these policies, the most effective way to bring about change would be to make a statement to those running the economy by becoming self-sufficient through boycotting corporations, growing one's own vegetables, and making one's <b>own</b> <b>clothes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} <b>own</b> <b>clothes,</b> including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{occupation}} for women was weaving {{clothes for the}} family, sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women.

50|$|Although she sewed her <b>own</b> stage <b>clothes</b> {{during her}} early career, {{she has said}} that she {{no longer has the}} time. In the early 1990s, she was one of three pop stars who were portrayed on stamps in Sweden; the others were Roxette and Jerry Williams. In the 1980s, she sang a duet on TV with American singer Michael Bolton.|$|R
25|$|This period {{marked a}} {{transformation}} in Azad's own life. Along with fellow Khilafat leaders Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, Hakim Ajmal Khan and others, Azad grew personally close to Gandhi and his philosophy. The three men founded the Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi {{as an institution}} of higher education managed entirely by Indians without any British support or control. Both Azad and Gandhi shared a deep passion for religion and Azad developed a close friendship with him. He adopted the Prophet Muhammad's ideas by living simply, rejecting material possessions and pleasures. He began to spin his <b>own</b> <b>clothes</b> using khadi on the charkha, and began frequently living and participating in the ashrams organised by Gandhi. Becoming deeply committed to ahimsa (non-violence) himself, Azad grew close to fellow nationalists like Jawaharlal Nehru, Chittaranjan Das and Subhas Chandra Bose. He strongly criticised the continuing suspicion of the Congress amongst the Muslim intellectuals from the Aligarh Muslim University and the Muslim League.|$|E
25|$|The first {{transport}} of Jews arrived at Poniatowa in October 1942 from Opole where the ghetto liquidation to Sobibor extermination camp was under way. The new barracks were built. By January 1943 there were 1,500 Jews in the camp. In April 1943, during the Nazi eradication of the Warsaw Ghetto, about 15,000 more Polish Jews were delivered. For {{the next six}} months, they all produced fresh garments for the Wehrmacht. Due {{to the nature of}} the work performed, the prisoners were not maltreated like in most other camps. They were allowed to keep children through daycare, wear their <b>own</b> <b>clothes,</b> and retain their personal effects, because the new uniforms made by them, were great morale boosters at the Front. The Jewish tailors and seamstresses of Warsaw worked practically free of charge for the German war profiteer Walter Caspar TÃ¶bbens (Toebbens) who was making a fortune. He was later described as the anti-Schindler. The Jews of Poland were augmented by around 3,000 Slovakian and Austrian Jews (the camp elite) housed separately from the rest.|$|E
500|$|The {{strike was}} called off at 3:15pm on 3 October.

The only one of the [...] "Five Demands" [...] still outstanding was the right not to do prison work. Following sabotage by the prisoners and the Maze Prison escape in 1983, the prison workshops were closed, effectively granting all of the [...] "Five Demands" [...] but without any formal recognition of political status from the government.|$|E
