25|$|NGC 4650A is a polar-ring galaxy {{located at}} a {{distance}} of 136 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.01). It has a central core made of older stars that resembles an elliptical galaxy, and an outer ring of young stars that orbits around the core. The plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> is distorted, which suggests that NGC 4650A {{is the result of a}} galaxy collision about a billion years ago. This galaxy has also been cited in studies of dark matter, because the stars in the outer ring orbit too quickly for their collective mass. This suggests that the galaxy is surrounded by a dark matter halo, which provides the necessary mass.|$|E
25|$|Spinal disc herniation, {{also known}} as a slipped disc, is a medical {{condition}} affecting the spine in which a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an intervertebral disc allows the soft, central portion to bulge out beyond the damaged outer rings. Disc herniation is usually due to age-related degeneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring,</b> known as the anulus fibrosus, although trauma, lifting injuries, or straining have been implicated as well. Tears are almost always postero-lateral (on the back of the sides) owing to the presence of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the spinal canal. This tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing inflammation, which may directly cause severe pain {{even in the absence of}} nerve root compression.|$|E

40|$|The 1 -D magic-angle {{spinning}} (MAS) nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} polarization transfer method, time-reverse one-dimensional exchange spectroscopy by side-band alternation (tr-ODESSA), {{was applied to the}} carbon- 13 signals (at natural abundance) of a powder sample of 4, 4 ′-diphenoxydiphenyl ether. The T 1 ’s <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various carbons in <b>the</b> sample are <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> several thousands of seconds, allowing dynamic measurements to be carried out over long time periods. The carbon- 13 MAS spectrum of 4, 4 ′-diphenoxydiphenyl ether is only partially resolved, but there are enough well-defined peaks to allow a complete analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamic processes in this compound. In the tr-ODESSA experiments, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carbon peaks showed a dispersion (sigmoidal reduction in the peak intensity) at a characteristic time of about 20 s, which is identified with a spin diffusion process. This sets an upper limit to the time range over which chemical (physical) processes can be measured by the tr-ODESSA method. The peaks associated with <b>the</b> ortho/meta positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>rings</b> indeed exhibit, in addition, a dispersion at 10 to 100 ms, depending on temperature, which we associate with <b>the</b> π-flips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> rate constant for this process at 25 °C is 6. 5 s− 1 and its activation energy is estimated at 62 kJ/mol. No dispersion that could be related to π-flips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner rings was observed in the tr-ODESSA results. An upper limit to <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> this process can be set on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measured rate for spin diffusion.

40|$|The narrow {{width and}} the high density {{contrast}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed <b>outer</b> <b>rings</b> around SN 1987 A pose an outstanding problem (Burrows et al. 1995) not explainable by standard models of blue and red supergiant wind interaction.

40|$|I {{propose a}} model for <b>the</b> {{formation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>outer</b> <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> SN 1987 A. The main new ingredient is a short-lived, few times 10 years, intermediate wind, of velocity of about 100 km/s and total mass of about 10 ^- 3 Mo - few times 10 ^- 2 Mo which is concentrated near the equatorial plane. This intermediate wind was formed during the few orbital periods when a binary companion entered <b>the</b> envelope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progenitor <b>of</b> SN 1987 a, when the latter was a red supergiant. The intermediate wind formed a hollowed torus with a horseshoe-shaped cross section. The inner regions at <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horseshoe torus are <b>the</b> two <b>outer</b> <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> SN 1987 A. <b>The</b> other regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torus were cleaned by the fast wind blown after the progenitor turns into a blue giant.
