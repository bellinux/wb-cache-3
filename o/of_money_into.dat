5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E
5|$|The CIP was {{a scheme}} whereby US dollars {{were given to}} the South Vietnamese {{government}} treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses that allowed them to purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value. The importers then used their American currency to buy US goods, while the Saigon government kept the South Vietnamese currency paid by the businessmen to fund the military and public service. The objective of the mechanism was to inject large amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the economy in an indirect way, through material goods, so that inflation would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders spent most of their funds on consumer goods.|$|E
5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a great}} scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E

Tribes invested record amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> Oregon politics in this race, including $40,000 supporting Kulongoski. Kulongoski did not take a position on the issue during the campaign, but later became a supporter of the plan.|$|E
25|$|A {{biomaterial}} is any matter, surface, or construct that {{interacts with}} living systems. As a science, biomaterials is about fifty years old. The study of biomaterials is called biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering.

Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering and materials science.|$|E
25|$|Political {{commentators}} {{speculated that}} Huckabee might {{be ready for}} another presidential run in 2016.

Huckabee has in addition earned personal wealth since 2008 on the lecture circuit and his TV and radio shows. He ended his daily radio show in December 2013, which strengthened speculations about a presidential bid.|$|E

25|$|When the Civil War ended, {{a boom in}} {{railroad}} construction ensued, with roughly 55,000 kilometers (35,000 miles) of new track {{being laid}} from coast-to-coast between 1866 and 1873. The railroads, then the second largest employer outside of agriculture, required large amounts of capital investment, and thus entailed massive financial risk. Speculators fed large amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the industry, causing abnormal growth and over-expansion. Jay Cooke's firm, like many other banking firms, invested {{a disproportionate share of}} depositors' funds in the railroads, thus paving the way for the ensuing collapse.|$|E
25|$|On its own, Samarra {{had little}} to incentivize {{residents}} to stay; the water supply was problematic and the city {{seems to have been}} heavily dependent on supplies from elsewhere. As long as the caliphs were willing to pour vast sums <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the city, it continued to survive; with the return of the caliphs to Baghdad, this investment dried up and soon much of the city was abandoned. In the following centuries, a few isolated settlements survived within the ruins, but the vast portion of the city soon became uninhabited.|$|E
25|$|Goldwater seriously {{considered}} retirement in 1980 {{before deciding to}} run for reelection. Peggy Goldwater reportedly hoped that her husband's Senate term, due to end in January 1981, would be his last. Goldwater decided to run, planning to make the term his last in the Senate. Goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons; most importantly, because {{he had planned to}} retire in 1981, Goldwater had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. He was also challenged by a formidable opponent, Bill Schulz, a former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy real estate developer. Schulz was able to infuse massive amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the campaign from his own fortune.|$|E

25|$|Ajith did {{not speak}} Tamil as a child, and {{mastered}} it only after becoming an actor. He dropped out of Asan Memorial Senior Secondary School in 1986 before completing his higher secondary. During his childhood, {{he had been a}} fan of M. G. Ramachandran, Amitabh Bachchan and Rajesh Khanna. In his teenage years, he became a fan of Tamil acting icons Rajnikanth and Kamal Haasan. At 18, Ajith had to take up a job to support his career in racing. Joining as an apprentice, he rose to be a merchandiser with a garment export company, doing small-time press ads and TV commercials occasionally. He had put a lot <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> racing and would borrow tyres from his friends who used to help when the treads wore out, as there was no money in racing at that time. Following an accident, several business agencies pushed him into modelling for advertisements in print media. He had to make a choice between films and racing, and as the films were happening and generating him some money, he began concentrating on it. He debuted in En Veedu En Kanavar (1990) in a minor role as a school student.|$|E

500|$|In 1896, in {{response}} to the establishment of an Irish-Australian unit in the New South Wales citizen army, Neild raised a volunteer regiment that became St George's English Rifles. He was promoted major of the regiment in July 1896 and lieutenant-colonel in April 1898, and frequently led his men, dressed as British soldiers, around Circular Quay to the tune of [...] "The British Grenadiers" [...] or [...] "The English Gentleman". Despite his promotions, Neild had no previous military experience, and in 1899 Lord Beauchamp, the Governor, wrote that his organisation was [...] "in a state of ridiculous insubordination". He was suspended around Easter of that year for publicly criticising a staff officer and encouraging insubordination; following unfavourable findings by a military inquiry, Neild avoided dismissal only by investing considerable amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the regiment.|$|E

However, we need to focus more on strategic markets {{in other parts of the}} world, where a sustained annual program versus a two-week event can better leverage the DuPont brand equity for profitable growth". Race organizer Mike Plant explained that [...] "I talked to them a couple of months ago, and they had to make a hard decision. They don't have hundreds of millions of dollars to put into worldwide advertising. They put a ton <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> this event and they built up a valuable franchise, but, like Motorola, corporations change the way they do business". Plant reported that polling had showed that public recognition of the event had grown significantly, but also that awareness of who sponsored it had declined.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Dylan {{embarked}} on a year-long world tour, performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million. Dylan assembled an eight-piece band and three backing singers. Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were released as the live double album, Bob Dylan At Budokan. Reviews were mixed. Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating, giving the album a derisory review, while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone, writing: [...] "These latest live versions of his old songs {{have the effect of}} liberating Bob Dylan from the originals." [...] When Dylan brought the tour to the U.S. in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a 'Las Vegas Tour'.

[...] By threatening to break away, the top clubs from Division One managed to increase their voting power, and took 50% share all television and sponsorship income in 1986. Revenue from television also became more important: the Football League received £6.3million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44million over four years with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash. The 1988 negotiations was conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a [...] "super league", but were eventually persuaded to stay with the top clubs taking the lion share of the deal.
