5000|$|Insect {{conservation}} {{has been}} labelled {{in the past}} as a concern only for the affluent. The developing country of Papua New Guinea has a [...] "happily ever after" [...] ending in their attempts to preserve the world's largest butterfly, Queen <b>Alexandra's</b> birdwing (<b>Ornithoptera</b> <b>alexandrae).</b> This species is restricted to a very small range of habitat due to specificity in their diet. In the international market of insect collecting, the butterfly can retrieve up to US$2000. In 1978, the government of Papua New Guinea set up the Insect Farming and Trading Agency (IFTA) to regulate the exploitation and conservation of Queen Alexandra's birdwing and other valuable butterflies.|$|R

But, {{due to the}} horrible reputation of the islanders as cannibals, he was protected by an armed escort to bring the skins to his vessel. On an expedition in New Guinea in 1906 he discovered and shot the first specimen of the Queen <b>Alexandra's</b> birdwing (<b>Ornithoptera</b> <b>alexandrae),</b> the largest butterfly in the world. While {{on a visit to}} New Guinea he estimated that the headdress of a chief needed the feathers of more than 23 killed birds (e.g., birds of paradise), just to create the middle part.|$|R
50|$|Butterfly {{ranching}} in Papua New Guinea is {{a method}} for sustainable use of insect biodiversity endorsed {{and supported by the}} national government. The trade is controlled by the Insect Farming and Trading Agency, an organ of the Papua New Guinea government. Papua New Guinea has a spectacular butterfly fauna, including the world's largest butterflies, the Queen <b>Alexandra's</b> birdwing (<b>Ornithoptera</b> <b>alexandrae)</b> and the Goliath birdwing (Ornithoptera goliath). A mosaic gynandromorphic specimen of the Goliath birdwing was sold by a Taiwanese dealer for US$28,000 in July 2006, which is possibly the world record for the highest price paid for a butterfly. Prior to the establishment of the government legislation, the butterfly trade depended upon expatriate dealers who traded in wild-caught specimens.

50|$|The Hercules moth (Coscinocera hercules), in {{the family}} Saturniidae, is endemic to New Guinea and {{northern}} Australia, and its wings have the largest documented surface area (300 square centimeters) of any living insect, and a maximum wingspan which is confirmed to 28 cm while unconfirmed specimens have spanned up to 35.5 cm. The largest species overall is often claimed to be either the Queen <b>Alexandra's</b> birdwing (<b>Ornithoptera</b> <b>alexandrae),</b> a butterfly from Papua New Guinea, or the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas), a moth from Southeast Asia. Both of these species can reach a length of 8 cm, a wingspan of 28 cm and a weight of 12 g. One Atlas moth allegedly had a wingspan of 30 cm but this measurement was not verified. The larvae in the previous species can weigh up to 58 and 54 g, respectively. However, there are no reported measurements of surface area that would exceed the Hercules moth, and the white witch (Thysania agrippina) of Central and South America, has the largest recorded wingspan of the order, and indeed of any living insect, though the white witch is exceeded in surface area by the Hercules moth. The verified record-sized Thysania spanned 30.8 cm across the wings, although specimens {{have been reported to}} 36 cm. The heaviest mature moths have been cited in the giant carpenter moth (Xyleutes boisduvali) of Australia, which has weighed up to 20 g although the species does not surpass 25.5 cm in wingspan.|$|R

Iontophoresis is a therapeutic alternative used in the treatment of injury during the inflammatory phase. In recent years, gold nanoparticles (GNP) have been studied due to their therapeutic anti-inflammatory capacity and {{as an alternative to the}} transport of several proteins. Purpose: This study evaluates the therapeutic effects of iontophoresis using GNPs and diclofenac diethylammonium on inflammatory parameters in rats challenged with traumatic tendinitis. Methods: Wistar rats were divided in three treatment groups (n = 15) : (1) iontophoresis + diclofenac diethylammonium; (2) iontophoresis + GNP; and (3) iontophoresis + diclofenac diethylammonium + GNP. External control was formed by challenged tendons without treatment (n = 15). Iontophoresis was administered using 0. 3 mA direct current on 1. 5 cm&sup 2; electrodes. Results: The levels of both inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in untreated challenged rats, when compared with the control (5. 398 &plusmn; 234 for interleukin 1 beta and 6. 411 &plusmn; 432 for tumor necrosis factor alpha), which confirms the occurrence of an inflammatory stage in injury (P &lt; 0. 05). A significant decrease was observed in expression of cytokines interleukin 1 beta in the three treatment groups, in comparison with untreated challenged tendons, although, in the group treated with diclofenac and GNP, results were similar to the control (1. 732 &plusmn; 239) (P &lt; 0. 05). Concerning tumor necrosis factor alpha, only the group treated with the association diclofenac and GNPs presented decreased levels, compared with the control (3. 221 &plusmn; 369) (P &lt; 0. 05). Conclusion: The results show the efficacy of drug administration using direct current to treat tendinitis in an animal model, and the potential anti-inflammatory, carrier, and enhancing effects of GNPs in iontophoresis.

40|$|In late October 2012, {{after the}} {{completion}} of this dossier, Superstorm Sandy wrecked much of the East Coast, including the greater New York City area. Now, nearly two months since the storm hit ground, thousands of New Yorkers still suffer from its effects. In the storm’s wake, Occupy Wall Street rapidly mobilized to form Occupy Sandy—the People’s Recovery Effort. Occupy Sandy drew upon the organizing and activist networks that crystallized in Zuccotti Park to offer on-the-ground support for devastated New York area communities. What follows is drawn from observations of Occupy Sandy activities and discussions with two Occupy members in late November, Alexandra (Aleks) Perisic and Amin Husain, who are dedicated to assisting Red Hook, Staten Island, the Rockaways, and other areas hard hit and still struggling in Sandy’s aftermath. While <b>Alexandra</b> and <b>I</b> spoke under fairly sedate circumstances, in a somewhat antiseptic student office at New York University’s Department of Social and Cultural Analysis, Amin cheerfully answered questions from {{the back seat of a}} sixteen-passenger van over a bumpy half-hour ride from Occupy Sandy’s hub at the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew, in Brooklyn’s Fort Greene neighborhood, to a distribution center in storm-ravaged Staten Island. ...|$|R
