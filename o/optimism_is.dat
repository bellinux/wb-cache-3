25|$|Predictors of poor {{mental health}} after a trauma, such as mental health status {{prior to a}} trauma and {{individual}} characteristics, can help determine those who will be more vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Those that exhibit lower mental health prior to an earthquake {{will be more likely}} to experience negative life changes than positive life changes with regard to personal strength. Depressive symptoms before a disaster can predict higher chances of developing PTSD following a trauma. People who exhibit lower mental health prior to the trauma don't adapt as well following trauma, and show higher levels of PTSD. Personality traits, such as neuroticism and low self-control are associated with a lower sense of normalcy following an earthquake, however <b>optimism</b> <b>is</b> predictive of lower and less severe PTSD symptoms.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Strachan {{wrote that}} it is a cliché that the armies marched in 1914 expecting a short war, because many {{professional}} soldiers anticipated a long war. <b>Optimism</b> <b>is</b> a requirement of command and expressing a belief that wars can be quick and lead to a triumphant victory, can be an essential aspect of a career as a peacetime soldier. Moltke (the Younger) was realistic about the nature of a great European war but this conformed to professional wisdom. Moltke (the Elder) was proved right in his 1890 prognostication to the Reichstag, that European alliances made a repeat of the successes of 1866 and 1871 impossible and anticipated a war of seven or thirty years' duration. Universal military service enabled a state to exploit its human and productive resources to the full but also limited the causes for which a war could be fought and Social Darwinist rhetoric made the likelihood of surrender remote. Having mobilised and motivated the nation, states would fight until they had exhausted their means to continue.|$|E

PopSugar gave a positive {{review of the}} episode, writing: [...] "Derek and Mark {{seem to be the}} only ones who are keeping their cool." [...] However, they also felt that Meredith was [...] "out of chararacter", commenting: [...] "Though Meredith also kept it together, her <b>optimism</b> <b>is</b> so out of character that it can only be chalked up to the crisis, and even she recognizes it."

500|$|A {{number of}} {{historical}} events inspired Voltaire to write Candide, {{most notably the}} publication of Leibniz's [...] "Monadology", a short metaphysical treatise, the Seven Years' War, and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. [...] Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in Candide and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, tsunami, and resulting fires of All Saints' Day, had a strong influence on theologians {{of the day and}} on Voltaire, who was himself disillusioned by them. The earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism, a philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur. <b>Optimism</b> <b>is</b> founded on the theodicy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz that says all is for the best because God is a benevolent deity. This concept is often put into the form, [...] "all is for the best in {{the best of all possible}} worlds" [...] (Fr. Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles). Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into the optimist world view.|$|E

Kesselring gave an optimistic {{assessment}} {{of the situation in}} Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Winter Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies reaching the Northern Apennines for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the Atlantic Wall and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of Army Group C, a ground command. [...] "I had always blamed Kesselring", Hitler later explained, [...] "for looking at things too optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, and I have been justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, whom I have seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, and it is my opinion that military leadership without <b>optimism</b> <b>is</b> not possible." ...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of child}} {{optimism}} {{as a mediator}} and moderator {{in the relationship between}} interparental conflict and child adjustment was examined for 36 {{children between the ages of}} 9 and 12 years who resided in a two adult home.

Mothers of child participants completed measures of child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Multiple regression analyses found that dispositional optimism mediated the relationship between interparental conflict and both child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Attributional <b>optimism</b> <b>was</b> found to mediate the relationship between interparental conflict and child internalizing symptoms.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Although higher <b>optimism</b> has <b>been</b> {{linked to}} an array of {{positive}} health outcomes, the association between optimism and incidence of stroke remains unclear, especially among older adults. We examined whether higher <b>optimism</b> <b>was</b> associated with a lower incidence of stroke. Method—Prospective data from the Health and Retirement Study—a nationally representative panel study of American adults aged 50 years—were used. Analyses were conducted for a 2 -year follow-up on the subset of 6044 adults (2542 men, 3502 women) who were stroke-free at baseline. Analyses adjusted for chronic illnesses, self-rated health, and relevant sociodemographic, behavioral, biological, and psychological factors. Results—Higher <b>optimism</b> <b>was</b> associated with a lower risk of stroke. On an optimism measure ranging from 3 to 18, each unit increase in <b>optimism</b> <b>was</b> associated with an age-adjusted OR of 0. 90 for stroke (95 % CI, 0. 84 to 0. 97; P 0. 01). The effect of optimism remained significant even after fully adjusting for a comprehensive set of sociodemographic, behavioral, biological, and psychological stroke risk factors. Conclusions—Optimism may {{play an important role}} in protecting against stroke among older adults. (Stroke. 2011; 42...|$|R

Ignore the maimed lives, the stricken heads and seared hearts, the reddened fangs and ravening claws of nature all round thee." [...] Pessimism is sympathy. <b>Optimism</b> <b>is</b> selfishness. The optimist folds his smug hands on his ample knees, and murmurs contentedly, [...] "The Lord has willed it;" [...] "There must always be rich and poor;" [...] "Nature has, after all, her great law of compensation."

60|$|But the {{important}} matter was this, that it entirely reversed {{the reason for}} optimism. And the instant the reversal was made {{it felt like the}} abrupt ease when a bone is put back in the socket. I had often called myself an optimist, to avoid the too evident blasphemy of pessimism. But all the optimism of the age had been false and disheartening for this reason, that it had always been trying to prove that we fit in to the world. The Christian <b>optimism</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the fact that}} we do NOT fit in to the world. I had tried to be happy by telling myself that man is an animal, like any other which sought its meat from God. But now I really was happy, for I had learnt that man is a monstrosity. I had been right in feeling all things as odd, for I myself was at once worse and better than all things. The optimist's pleasure was prosaic, for it dwelt on the naturalness of everything; the Christian pleasure was poetic, for it dwelt on the unnaturalness of everything in the light of the supernatural. The modern philosopher had told me again and again that I was in the right place, and I had still felt depressed even in acquiescence. But I had heard that I was in the WRONG place, and my soul sang for joy, like a bird in spring. The knowledge found out and illuminated forgotten chambers in the dark house of infancy. I knew now why grass had always seemed to me as queer as the green beard of a giant, and why I could feel homesick at home.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the very}} few critics who seem to have got near to the actual secret of Browning's <b>optimism</b> <b>is</b> Mr. Santayana in his most {{interesting}} book Interpretations of Poetry and Religion. He, in contradistinction to the vast mass of Browning's admirers, had discovered what was the real root virtue of Browning's poetry; and the curious thing is, that having discovered that root virtue, he thinks it is a vice. He describes the poetry of Browning most truly as the poetry of barbarism, by which he means the poetry which utters the primeval and indivisible emotions. [...] "For the barbarian is the man who regards his passions as their own excuse for being, who does not domesticate them either by understanding their cause, or by conceiving their ideal goal." [...] Whether this be or be not a good definition of the barbarian, it is an excellent and perfect definition of the poet. It might, perhaps, be suggested that barbarians, as a matter of fact, are generally highly traditional and respectable persons who would not put a feather wrong in their head-gear, and who generally have very few feelings and think very little about those they have. It is when we have grown to a greater and more civilised stature that we begin to realise and put to ourselves intellectually the great feelings that sleep in the depths of us. Thus it is that the literature of our day has steadily advanced towards a passionate simplicity, and we become more primeval as the world grows older, until Whitman writes huge and chaotic psalms to express the sensations of a schoolboy out fishing, and Maeterlinck embodies in symbolic dramas the feelings of a child in the dark.|$|E
