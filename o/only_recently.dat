By relying exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime, the court appeared to have finally resolved a lingering issue in its previous decisions on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Leicester {{also built}} a loggia, or open gallery, beside the great keep {{to lead to}} the new formal gardens.

5|$|Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, {{and both}} nations {{came close to}} declaring war on each other, {{although}} neither could afford a direct military conflict. Argentina had <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> emerged from a long civil war, and was still struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of La Rioja. Uruguay was too weak militarily {{to engage in a}} fight unaided.|$|E

5|$|Telopea speciosissima, {{commonly}} known as the New South Wales waratah or simply waratah, is a large shrub in the plant family Proteaceae.

5|$|The {{practice}} of hare coursing has <b>only</b> <b>recently,</b> in historical terms, been debated in Parliament, although Parliament created an exemption in 1921 from the cruelty legislation, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, for animals released for coursing. Eric Heffer, MP for Liverpool Walton, {{was a major}} opponent of coursing in the late 1960s, and Prime Minister Harold Wilson joined in the criticism.|$|E
5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to {{her ideas}} about the role of a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E

Meanwhile, Mace is debating the anti-Inhuman Senator Ellen Nadeer on live television, who brings up the prison situation which he is not aware of. Faced with further questions from Nadeer, Mace reveals that he is an Inhuman himself.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{currency}} is the CFA franc. In the 1960s, the Mining industry of Chad produced sodium carbonate, or natron. There {{have also been}} reports of gold-bearing quartz in the Biltine Prefecture. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{published}} his music in France, England and the German states {{due to the}} copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of ‘first editions’. Each edition {{is different from the}} other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. <b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> have these differences gained greater recognition.|$|E

5|$|Christianity had <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> {{arrived in}} some of these kingdoms. Some had been {{converted}} by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism <b>only</b> <b>recently.</b>|$|E
5|$|Harta Berdarah starred Soelastri and Zonder, and {{featured}} Moesa, Oedjang, Oesman, Haroen, and Abdullah. Many {{of these}} actors, including Soelastri and Fatimah, had had roles in Kedok Ketawa, and Moesa, though <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> signed, had previously acted for another company. Zonder, {{who made his}} film debut in Harta Berdarah, was well-versed in the traditional martial art of silat, while Soelastri was {{also known as a}} keroncong singer under the stage name Miss Ning; both made use of these skills for the film, which was scored by Hugo Dumas' musical troupe Lief Java. Cinematography for the production was handled by KH Tjit.|$|E

5|$|Historian Timothy Bolton has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure, a brother of Thorgil Sprakling. Siward would then have been first cousin to Earl Ulf, the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister Estrith and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's. Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.|$|E
5|$|In July, Spears {{announced}} her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, {{whom she had}} met three months before. As Federline had <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> ended his relationship with actress Shar Jackson, who was pregnant with their second child, this engagement {{was the subject of}} extensive media coverage. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement. In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, John {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Ireland in 1185, which was not a success. Ireland had <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry's representatives, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John offended the local Irish rulers, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish, and finally returned to England within the year. In 1186 Henry was about to return John to Ireland once again, when news came that Geoffrey {{had died in a}} tournament at Paris, leaving two young children; this event once again changed the balance of power between Henry and his remaining sons.|$|E

Brock Mealer—the brother of Michigan guard Elliot Mealer—led the team onto the field by walking to the banner and touching it, which sparked a standing ovation from the crowd. Elliot Mealer had <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> regained the ability to walk following injuries in a car crash.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{woodland}} was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds. A {{significant part of the}} exposed woodland to the north-east of Wormshill was felled and, after replanting, has <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> shown signs of maturing. An ancient yew tree believed to have stood for several hundred years in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long-standing trees. However, some 25years later, the village displays few obvious signs of the damage.|$|E
5|$|Mufarrij {{also tried}} to win support among the Christians, and {{possibly}} curry the favour of the Byzantine Empire as well, by sponsoring works to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which had <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been demolished on the orders of al-Hakim, and by arranging the re-appointment of a Patriarch to the vacant see.
