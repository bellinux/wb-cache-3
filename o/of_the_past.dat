The article explores how <b>the</b> Belgian Revolution <b>of</b> 1830 and <b>the</b> closely intertwined rise {{of contemporary}} British sympathy for Belgium {{led to a}} reinterpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ???Belgian??? <b>past.</b> After 1830, <b>the</b> British interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian <b>past</b> was increasingly centred on the sixteenth century and the ???true??? Belgian national identity was {{believed to have been}} oppressed by a chain of foreign oppressors. Furthermore, the travellers saw <b>the</b> Belgian <b>past</b> and national identity as very similar to <b>the</b> British <b>past</b> and national identity. <b>The</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian <b>past</b> was an integral part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian future; a future that, so it was believed, would justify British claims that Belgium was a ???little Britain on the Continent??? and that the Belgian and British national identities were highly similar. Finally, the article also explains why <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian <b>past</b> did not change once more after 1850, when the British increasingly lost their sympathy and interest in Belgium and the Belgian...|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> idea <b>of</b> {{changing}} <b>the</b> <b>past</b> is logically contradictory, {{and results}} in a grandfather paradox. Paul J. Nahin, {{who has written extensively}} on <b>the</b> topic <b>of</b> time travel in fiction, states that [...] "even though the consensus today is that <b>the</b> <b>past</b> cannot be changed, science fiction writers have used <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> changing <b>the</b> <b>past</b> for good story effect". Time travel to <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and precognition without the ability to change events may result in causal loops.|$|R

Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E

Makoto was the test subject of the experiment, which was meant to involve him having the delusion that he could have premonitions; unexpectedly, he turned out to have real premonitions.|$|E
