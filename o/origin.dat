5|$|The <b>origin</b> of the endomembrane {{system is}} linked to the <b>origin</b> of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the <b>origin</b> of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic <b>origin</b> of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain the <b>origin</b> of the endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for the <b>origin</b> of the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote <b>origin</b> and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E

5|$|After his Test debut, Hunt was {{expected}} to be the Queensland fullback in the first match of the three game State of <b>Origin</b> series. However, Queensland selectors decided to stay with incumbent <b>Origin</b> fullback Matt Bowen. The selectors reconsidered after Queensland lost the first game, selecting Hunt for the second match. In his State of <b>Origin</b> debut, Hunt ran with the ball seventeen times, making 196 metres. He missed the third <b>Origin</b> game because of a foot injury, sustained in the Broncos' Round 15 match, and was replaced by Clinton Schifcofske.|$|E

40|$|Chromosomes are {{replicated}} in characteristic, temporal patterns during S phase. We have compared {{the timing of}} association of replication proteins at early- and late-replicating <b>origins</b> of replication. Minichromosome maintenance proteins assemble simultaneously at early- and late-replicating <b>origins.</b> In contrast, Cdc 45 p association with late <b>origins</b> is delayed relative to early <b>origins.</b> DNA polymerase α association is similarly delayed at late <b>origins</b> and requires Cdc 45 p function. Activation of the S phase checkpoint inhibits association of Cdc 45 p with late-firing <b>origins.</b> These studies suggest that Cdc 45 p is poised {{to serve as a}} key regulatory target for both the temporal and checkpoint-mediated regulation of replication <b>origins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic genomes often {{contain more}} {{potential}} replication <b>origins</b> than are actually used during S phase. The molecular mechanisms that prevent some <b>origins</b> from firing are unknown. Here {{we show that}} dormant replication <b>origins</b> on the left arm of budding yeast chromosome III become activated when both passive replication through them is prevented and the Mec 1 /Rad 53 checkpoint that blocks late-origin firing is inactivated. Under these conditions, dormant <b>origins</b> fire very late relative to other active <b>origins.</b> These experiments show that some dormant replication <b>origins</b> are competent to fire during S phase and that passage of a replication fork through such <b>origins</b> can inactivate them...|$|R
