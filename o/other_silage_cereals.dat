40|$|International audiencePhosphorus {{absorption}} in ruminants was analysed from {{a database}} {{described in a}} previous article. For common values of ingested phosphorus (2. 5 - 5. 0 g·kg^- 1 of DM), 0. 73 of dietary phosphorus is absorbed. The remaining variability is probably due to phosphorus quality. Phosphorus absorbed from <b>silage,</b> <b>cereal,</b> cereal by-products and hay differs greatly. The current true absorption coefficient used to calculate daily phosphorus supply is a constant value in the current systems and often it underestimates the true absorption resulting in an excess of phosphorus being supplied in the diets. Adjusting the true absorption coefficient values requires better characterisation of the phosphorus supplied by each feedstuff. Dietary influences (phytate phosphorus, crude fibre, etc.) were investigated but trials assessing the ration effect on phosphorus absorption are lacking. Since rumen microbes have specific phosphorus requirements, particularly for cell-wall degradation, the feedstuff phosphorus availability for the rumen ecosystem is discussed...|$|R

The additives were: (1) propionic acid (2) propionic acid (85 %) + formic acid (15 %) (3) calcium propionate and (4) propionic acid (80 %) + formic acid (15 %) + ammonia (5 %). Ten gram per kilogram dry matter of each additives were mixed with chopped corn forage in 2 different times (0, 24 h). Silages were assessed and evaluated for appearance; DM and pH. CP, NDF, ADF, TVFA, WSC, aerobic stability and DM degradation each of treatments were determined after 60 days. Silages that was exposed to air for 24 h, before ensiling had better appearance quality in Filg’s method and whole additives had good effect on appearance quality compared with control group. In the method of DM and pH evaluation, all silages contained buffered propionic acid-based additive, were good and very good. These silages had lower pH than control ones (p< 0. 05). There was a significant interaction was between silages for concentration of dry matter (p< 0. 05).

Acacia mangium Willd, Persea americana Mill and Psidium guajava as tannin source to signal grass (Brachiaria brizantha) silage. The silages were made from the first cut of signal grass harvested at 50 days. Four treatment silages were TA: grass ensiled without tannin as control, AM: grass ensiled with A. mangium (6 g tannin /kg fresh weight), PA: grass ensiled with P. americana (6 g tannin /kg fresh weight), and PG: grass ensiled with P. guajava (6 g tannin/kg fresh weight). After mixing, the materials were packed into glass bottle silos (225 g capacity), in triplicate, which were ensiled for 30 days. The results showed that dry matter, organic matter and crude protein concentrations in signal grass silage mixed with tannin of A. mangium were higher (P< 0. 01) compared to <b>other</b> <b>silages.</b> Degradations of dry matter, organic matter and crude protein during ensiling were the lowest in silage with A. mangium tannin additive. This data was supported by good fermentation quality of that silage e. g. low pH value, NH 3 -N and VFA concentrations, and high lactic acid concentration and Fleigh point as compared to <b>other</b> <b>silages.</b> It is concluded that addition of tannin from A. mangium leaf at rate of 6 g/kg fresh weight improved fermentation quality and has potential as protein protection agents during the ensilage of signal grass. ...|$|R

40|$|Silage as {{an animal}} feed is made over 3000 year around the world. For ruminants, silage {{is the major}} part of feed during the winter time. The {{production}} of silage is permanently growing in the EU. Hazard to animals health associated with silage could be divided into three categories: 1) Presence of udesirable and/or pathogenic microorganisms; 2) Presence of undesirable chemical compounds; 3) excess acidity and presence of undesirable microbial metabolites. Clostridia are most frequently presented undesirable bacteria, beiing harmfull for the milk and cheese production. Listeria monocytogenes in aerobically spoiled silage form a serious risk to animal and human health. Pathogenic E. coli can also be presented. On the <b>other</b> hand, the <b>silage</b> {{is a source of}} potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria (e. g. Lactobacillus plantarum). Undesirable chemicals in silage include mainly mycotoxins like deoxynivalenol, zearalenon, ochratoxin and fumonisins. Also, corn silage sometimes contains aflatoxins.

40|$|This thesis defines {{digestion}} kinetics for {{perennial ryegrass}} (Lolium perenne L.), {{which is the}} main component of diets fed to dairy cows in New Zealand. Chemical composition and digestion kinetics were measured in fresh minced ryegrass as it matured and leaf, stem and inflorescence of several grass species. In sacco and in vitro incubations were used to define rates of degradation and nutrient release. Two short-term grazing trials were used to evaluate contrasting silages as supplements for cows fed restricted amounts of summer pasture. The minced preparation of ryegrass resulted in a similar distribution of dry matter (DM) between particle size fraction and rumen digesta from cows fed pasture. Mincing released 0. 46 – 0. 80 of crude protein into the soluble fraction, with highest proportions for mature grasses which had low CP concentrations (about 8 g CP/ 100 g DM). In contrast, the majority of fibre remained in the insoluble fraction but rates of degradation (k) approximately halved as grass matured. In vitro yield of VFA was similar for immature and mature minced ryegrass (after 12 hours VFA was equivalent to about 30 % of DM), even though ammonia concentration declined to very low values for stem and mature grass. This suggests the rapid initial microbial growth was able to sustain a high level of DM degradation to VFA with mature grass. The summer pasture used for silage supplementation was of uncharacteristically good quality so the expected contrasts between maize, pasture, sulla (Hedysarum coronarium), lotus (Lotus corniculatus) and sulla/maize silage mixtures were less than expected. Milk responses to lotus silage supplements were greater than <b>other</b> <b>silages</b> (e. g. : 290 g milksolids from 54 MJ ME by lotus versus 110 g milksolids from about 50 MJ ME supplied by <b>other</b> <b>silages).</b> Pasture substitution was low (0. 06 – 0. 33). The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) was chosen for evaluation of cow trial data because it uses feed degradation parameters as input variables to estimate nutrient supply. Model prediction of milk yield matched observed values when cows maintained liveweight. Milk yield was underestimated at low intakes and overestimated at high intakes because no allowance is made for nutrient partitioning between milk production and liveweight change...|$|R

This release of methane represents {{not only an}} energetic loss for the animal but also contributes to the global warming because methane is released to the atmosphere. To mitigate the methane production from ruminants, and in particular from cows, feeding strategies need to be studied. The objective of the thesis was to evaluate the quantity of methane produced in diets with or without protein concentrate combined with two silages differing in protein content (17 % vs. 13 %). An experiment using a Latin squares design with six Swedish Red cows in two orthogonal blocks was performed to study three different treatments: treatment AC with silage A (2 / 3 early harvested silage + 1 / 3 red clover) and cereal, treatment AP with <b>silage</b> A, <b>cereal</b> and protein supplement and treatment BC with <b>silage</b> B and <b>cereal.</b> Each period lasted three weeks with two weeks adaptation to the diet and last week as a measurement period. There were no differences in methane production in absolute terms between treatments, and the average methane production of the cows was 473 g/d. Milk production and methane production per kg milk did not differ between treatments. Significant differences were found only between treatments AP and BC in methane production per kg of protein intake (104. 7 g/kg vs. 203. 3), per kg of MJ intake (1. 6 g/kg vs. 2. 0) and per kg of starch intake (492. 1 g/kg vs. 228. 5) ...|$|R

The results taken from 48 silos showed on average for all investigated crops 9 – 12 % of DM losses. Density and feed out rate showed a negative correlation to DM losses in maize silages.

Treatments consisted of 4 experimental silages: a mix of the first and third cut of organically managed short-term grassland with timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.; 2 yr old; ORG-SG); organically managed long-term grassland with a high proportion of unsown species (6 yr old; ORG-LG); conventionally managed ley with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.; CON-PR); and conventionally managed ley with timothy (CON-TI). The herbages were cut, wilted, and preserved with additive in round bales and fed at 0. 90 of ad libitum intake. A barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) concentrate constituted 300 g/kg of dry matter of the total feed offered. A Latin square design (4 × 4) with 3 -wk periods and the last week in each period used for sampling was implemented. Omasal flows of FA were measured using Yb acetate, Cr-EDTA, and the indigestible neutral detergent fiber fraction as indigestible markers. The composition of FA was analyzed in feed, omasal digesta, and milk. Compared with ORG-LG, ORG-SG had a higher herbage proportion of red clover (0. 36 vs. 0. 01) and lower proportions of timothy (0. 42 vs. 0. 18), smooth meadowgrass (Poa pratensis L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), dandelion (Taraxacum spp.), and creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens L.). The silages were well preserved. The concentration of neutral detergent fiber was higher and the concentration of Kjeldahl-N was lower for CON-TI than for the <b>other</b> <b>silages.</b> Silage type had no effect on dry matter intake, but milk yield was lower for CON-TI than for the <b>other</b> <b>silages.</b> Apparent biohydrogenation of C 18 : 3 n- 3 was lower for ORG-SG (932 g/kg) than for ORG-LG (956 g/kg), CON-PR (959 g/kg), and CON-TI (958 g/kg). Compared with the grass-based silages, ORG-SG and ORG-LG resulted in higher omasal flows of C 18 : 1 trans FA and higher milk fat proportions of C 18 : 1 trans FA and C 18 : 2 cis- 9,trans- 11. Apparent recovery of C 18 : 3 n- 3 in milk was higher for ORG-SG (61 g/kg) than for ORG-LG (33 g/kg), CON-PR (34 g/kg), and CON-TI (38 g/kg), and milk fat proportion of C 18 : 3 n- 3 was higher for ORG-SG than for CON-TI. Milk fat proportions of C 16 : 0 were lower for ORG-SG and ORG-LG compared with those for CON-PR and CON-TI.

The benefits of low input barley systems were also investigated; barley fields were subjected to two separate herbicide sub-treatments on a split-field design (high input broad-spectrum or low input narrow spectrum herbicides). The abundance of plant resources and invertebrates was assessed for three growing seasons during summer and winter for each crop type. The study clearly demonstrated the value of spring barley {{for the provision of}} plant resources when compared to the <b>other</b> <b>silage</b> cropping systems, whilst invertebrate responses were variable. No differences in plant and invertebrate resources were found between the barley treatments. Throughout the year, forage maize afforded the lowest provision of resources for farmland birds, and because it is likely that maize will continue to be grown in pastoral areas, the value of this habitat needs to be improved if farmland birds are to benefit. To provide plant and invertebrate resources for farmland birds in pastoral landscapes we strongly advocate the growing of spring sown barley whole-crop silage followed by over-wintering stubbles. © 2011 Elsevier B.

For ensiling, whole-crop aruana grass (75 d of growth) was chopped (275 g kg- 1 dry matter - DM) and ensiled alone or associated with gliricidia (270 g kg- 1 DM; 150 d of growth). For gliricidia, we used only the leaves and stalks to ensile. The evaluated treatments were different ratios of aruana grass to gliricidia (100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100), with four replicates (mini-silos). The silage composed only of gliricidia exhibited a lower pH than the <b>other</b> <b>silages.</b> Dry matter recovery was not affected by the treatments, although effluent losses were affected. The replacement of aruana grass by gliricidia 50 % at ensiling resulted in a higher lactic acid bacteria count.

Supplementation with 12 g of calcium and of phosphorus daily, and provision of <b>cereal</b> <b>silage</b> seemingly improved {{conception rate}}s. It would appear that phosphorus {{may have been the}} first limiting nutrient and that a portion of the improved pregnancy rate was due to phosphorus supplementation. The low energy content of the forage, especially in years when it was badly weathered, was also judged to be a factor in conception rate in the subsequent year. It was also noted that there is a potential widespread phosphorus problem for beef cattle in Saskatchewan based on Feed Testing Service analyses of feeds...|$|R
40|$|This {{survey was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the characteristics of dairy farms in the North- Eastern part of Po valley in terms of ration composition, milk yield and N and P excretions. Eightynine farms, with Italian Holstein Friesian cows, were selected in order to cover different situations in term of farm size and milk yield (MY). MY and quality {{were obtained from the}} national database of functional controls. Each farm was visited in order to collect information about ingredients and chemical composition of rations used. Farms were classified in four groups differing for dietary crude protein density (LCP 15. 3 % DM) and for MY (LMY 30 kg/d). N and P excretions were quantified by following a mass balance approach. Dietary crude protein content (CP) was not correlated to milk yield (MY) and quality. The estimated amounts of N excreted, discounted for 28 % of N losses in atmosphere, were 78. 5, 78. 2, 87. 2 and 89. 1 kg/cow/year, and P excreted were 20. 2, 18. 6, 18. 7 and 19. 8 kg/cow/year for the LCPLMY, LCPHMY, HCPLMY, HCPHMY groups, respectively. On corn <b>silage</b> and <b>cereals</b> based rations, a dietary CP of 14. 3 % DM can support 31 kg MY/cow/day...|$|R
40|$|Silage is the {{feedstuff}} {{resulted from}} the preservation of forages through lactic acid fermentation. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate nutritive value, fermentation characteristics and nutrients digestibility of rice crop residue based silage ensiled with epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The mixture of rice crop residue (RC), soybean curd residue (SC) and cassava waste (CW) in a 90 : 5 : 5 (on dry matter basis) ratio was used as silage material. Three treatments silage were (A) RC + SC + CW as a control; (B) RC + SC + CW + LAB inoculums from rice crop residue; (C) RC + SC + CW + LAB inoculums from king grass. Silage materials were packed into plastic silo (1. 5 kg capacity) and stored for 30 days. The results showed that crude protein content in B and C silage was higher than that of silage A, but NDF content in silages B and C was lower than that of silage A. Lactic acid concentration was higher (P < 0. 01) in silage C compared to silage B and A, thus pH value of silage C was lower (P < 0. 01) than silage B and A. Silage C had the highest Fleigh point than that of <b>other</b> <b>silages.</b> Dry matter and organic matter digestibilities were higher in silages B and C (P < 0. 01) than that of control silage. It was concluded that the addition of LAB inoculums from king grass to rice crop residue based silage resulted a better fermentation quality compared to LAB inoculums from rice crop residue...|$|R
40|$|This article review {{started with}} some {{techniques}} which can indicate {{the quality of}} silage such as sensory evaluations (contour of bunker face, color and odor), chemical compositions (moisture, crude protein, soluble protein, ammonia nitrogen, acid detergent insoluble nitrogen, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, fermentation profiles and mould counts and mycotoxin concentrations) and physical characteristics (pH, temperature and particle size). But, most effective indicator is the nutritions quality. It was a key factor to reduce the production cost of feeding of ruminants. There are a lots of nutrients losses especially protein content of forage during fermentations. Lots of losses have been occured during aerobic phase and feedout. Most {{of the value of}} protein degradation rate is around 0. 5 - 1. 0 % per day which gives bad performance especially at the end of fermentation result. There are two chemical process occurs which are Maillard reaction and acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose which both can effect silage quality especially the nutrient loss through degradation and utilization. Lactic acid is preferred to be dominant over <b>other</b> <b>silage</b> fermentation acids because it has a lower dissociation constant (Ka= 3. 86) which can be major organic acid responsible for decreasing silage pH. Lactic acid bacteria application so-called as green application will give 20 gram of lactic acid production per kilogram compare to control that resulted almost neal lactic acid. This acidic condition will help to stabilize the silage through green low pH condition instead of apply chemical like strong acid which give negative impact and in the same time can reduce the nutrient loss along fermentation and storage...|$|R
40|$|Limited {{information}} on nutrient composition and in vitro digestibility of corn-soybean intercropped silage is available. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare corn (Zea mays L.) or soybean (Glycine max L. Yesilsoy) monocrop silage with corn-soybean intercropped silages in term of yield, nutritive value, and in vitro digestibility. Intercropping was as follows: 1 row corn to 1 row soybean (1 M 1 S), 1 row corn to 2 rows soybean (1 M 2 S) and 2 rows corn to 1 row soybean (2 M 1 S). The crops were harvested when the corn reached 3 / 5 or 1 / 4 milk line. The silage samples were analysed for pH, dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF), calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus. Also, in vitro true (IVTD) and in vitro NDF (IVNFD) digestibilities were determined in the silages samples. The DM, EE, calculated non structural carbohydrate values were higher in silage harvested at 1 / 4 than 3 / 5 milk line. All intercropped silages had higher CP values (1 M 1 S, 8. 3 %; 1 M 2 S, 10. 1 %; 2 M 1 S, 8. 0 %) than the monocrop corn (SM, 6. 8 %) silage. The NDF and ADF levels were higher for 1 M 1 S, 2 M 1 S and SM compared with 1 M 2 S and monocrop soybean (SS) silage. In vitro true DM digestibility of all silages increased with maturity stage; it was higher for the 1 M 2 S than <b>other</b> <b>silages.</b> It is concluded that corn-soybean intercropped silage has better nutrient composition and digestibility than SM or SS silage...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the fermentation characteristics and chemical composition of Tanzania grass silage containing additives. The following treatments were applied: silage without additive (SWA); silage treated with 2. 17 % limestones (SLS); silage treated with 2. 17 % urea (SUR), and silage treated with a combination of additives: 7. 5 % corn meal, 5. 3 % molasses powder, 1. 1 % urea and 1. 1 % limestone (SA 1), and 10 % corn meal, 2. 93 % molasses powder, 1. 1 % urea and 0. 97 % limestone (SA 2). All silages containing additives exhibited a higher mean pH than SWA, but this did not negatively affect their fermentation quality. The titratable acidity of SWA (7. 84) was higher than that of SUR (3. 28), SLS (4. 80), SA 1 (3. 30) and SA 2 (3. 80). The mean ammoniacal nitrogen was 10 % lower in relation to total nitrogen in all silages, except for SUR, indicating a good fermentation profile. Effluent loss was lower for silages containing additives (P< 0. 005), with losses of 22. 5, 12. 1, 12. 3 and 7. 85 kg/t for SLS, SUR, SA 1 and SA 2, respectively, compared to SWA (46. 1 kg/t). Dry matter content, total digestible nutrients and non-fibrous carbohydrates increased with inclusion of the additives, while neutral detergent fiber and hemicellulose content decreased. Dry matter digestibility was higher in SA 1 and SA 2 (45. 8 % and 44. 4 %, respectively) compared to the <b>other</b> <b>silages,</b> while SA 2 did not differ from SWA (43. 4 %). The combination of chemical and organic additives had a positive synergistic effect to reduce effluent losses, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber and to increase dry matter digestibility, thus increasing nutrient availability. These silages therefore represent a good-quality final product...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the voluntary intake and digestibility of three sorghum (Sorghum bicolor, L. Moench) hybrid silages in sheep. The hybrids used were H 1 - BRS 655 (CMSXS 222 A × CMSXS 235 R), with tannin; H 2 - (ATF 54 A × CMSXS 235 R), without tannin; and H 3 - BRS 610 (CMSXS 232 A × CMSXS 234 R), without tannin. The intake and digestibility of dry matter (DM), gross energy (GE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and crude protein (CP) were measured. Eighteen crossbred sheep weighing 59. 4 kg (± 8. 3) were used in the trial. A completely randomized design with three treatments (hybrids) and six repetitions (sheep) was used. There were no differences in the DM intake or apparent digestibility among the hybrids. Silage of hybrid BRS 610 displayed higher digestibility coefficients for CP, NDF, ADF, and GE compared with the <b>other</b> <b>silages,</b> which did not differ from each other. The neutral detergent fiber, ADF and digestible energy (DE) intakes were similar among the hybrids silages. All of the hybrids resulted in a positive N balance in sheep. The levels of DE were superior in hybrid silage BRS 610 in comparison with the other hybrids. Sorghum hybrid BRS 610 silage exhibited superior nutritional value compared with the other hybrids, which is most likely in part due to the absence of tannins. Sorghum silage made with hybrid BRS 610 (CMSXS 232 A × CMSXS 234 R) presents superior gross energy, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber digestibility coefficients, as well as greater digestible energy levels than BRS 655 (CMSXS 222 A × CMSXS 235 R) and (ATF 54 A × CMSXS 235 R). 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} the routine analyses, applied until present, of whole blood, serum and urine for bioelements is limited. The blood mineral level does not often {{correspond}} {{to the content of}} minerals in the whole body because the composition of plasma results from supplementation of deficiencies by different homeostatic mechanisms. Moreover, the blood concentration of bioelements is relatively low and depends on a current diet, therefore the diagnostic value of such analytical results may be fairly small. Studies have shown that the analysis of hair and nails are an appropriate alternative for blood and urine tests or for biopsy. Chemical treatments in agriculture, animal production and food processing in-troduce many food contaminants into the food chain. Organic methods in agriculture are safer and therefore very important.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the vitamin A content of soybean silage, and of A. l. V., molasses, and common corn silage. The silages were fed to groups of cows and the vitamin A content of their milk determined. The vitamin A {{determinations}} were made by feeding the silage or the milk to groups of rats whose body stores of this vitamin had been depleted by being fed a vitamin-A-deficient ration. Approximately 780 rats were used in these experiments. There were no apparent ill effects of feeding as much as 3. 2 grams of the A. l. V. silage per rat per day for eight weeks. This was 20 to 30 per cent of the food consumed. The A. l. V. silage contained only slightly more vitamin A than did the molasses silage. The ordinary corn silage contained less vitamin A than either the A. I. V. or molasses silage. The soybean silage was inferior to any of the <b>other</b> <b>silages</b> as a source of vitamin A. Milk produced by cows receiving these silages as the only source of roughage ranked in the same order of vitamin A potency as did the silages, namely A. I.

The hay was fed ad libitum and the group which received the molasses silage consumed the most hay. In this instance the milk produced by the group receiving the molasses silage contained more vitamin A than did the milk produced by the A. l.

Veli) {{were used to}} estimate metabolisable energy yields (MEY) by using the feeds metabolisable energy concentration values (MJ/kg DM) from ruminant feed tables. Harvest index (HI) of barley and oat was set to 50 %, and straw yields and whole crop <b>cereal</b> <b>silage</b> (WCCS) yields were generated from grain yields accordingly. The MEY {{in the third year}} of perennial grass (81. 4 GJ/ha) was significantly lower than that in the first (90. 0 GJ/ha) and second years (90. 7 GJ/ha). However, on average, the one to three year old perennial grass-swards had significantly higher MEY than the annual grass swards (87. 7 vs. 83. 3 GJ/ha, respectively). The MEYs of perennial and annual grass swards were substantially higher than the MEY of barley grain (52. 7 GJ/ha) and oat grain (47. 8 GJ/ha). When the total herbage of cereals, i. e. straw and grain, was used in the calculations, at a ME value of 6. 0 MJ/ kg dry matter (DM) for straw, the MEY of barley rose to 75. 8 GJ/ha and that of oat to 72. 6 GJ/ha. Additionally, the MEY of barley was estimated in the WCCS production situation by converting total herbage to MEY by using ME value 9. 9 MJ/kg DM. The MEY of barley in the WCCS calculations was 77. 4 GJ/ha, which was significantly lower than the MEY of annual and perennial grass swards. The MEY of barley was a) 60 %, b) 86 %, and c) 88 % of the average MEY of one to three year old perennial grass sward when the MEY of barley was calculated according to a) grain, b) grain + straw, and c) whole crop <b>cereal</b> <b>silage.</b> Perennial grass sward was the most productive of the studied crops in metabolisable energy production for ruminants...|$|R
