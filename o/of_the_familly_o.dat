40|$|Chaperonins are a {{specific}} class of barrel-shaped chaperones, present {{in almost all}} organisms. Newly synthesized proteins encapsulated by the chaperonin can attain their native structure unimpaired by aggregation during repeated cycles of ATP-dependent binding and release. Chaperonins are generally divided into two groups. Group I chaperonins, such as the barrel-shaped GroEL oligomer, are found predominantly in bacteria and cooperate with cofactors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hsp 10 <b>familly</b> (i. e. GroES). The Group II chaperonins, on the other hand, do not require a Hsp 10 - cofactor and {{are found in the}} eukaryotic cytosol and in archaea. <b>The</b> function <b>of</b> GroEL is understood in great detail and the substrate interaction proteome has been recently identified. In contrast, our knowledge about <b>the</b> natural substrates <b>of</b> Group II chaperonins is deficient and as a consequence, mechanistical studies on Group II chaperonins have been limited to using the eukaryotic model substrates actin and tubulin as well as heterologous model substrates. In the present study, the complete substrate spectrum of a Group II chaperonin, <b>the</b> thermosome (Ths) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mesophilic archaeon Methanosarcina mazei (M. mazei), was analysed for the first time. In addition, <b>the</b> unique coexistence <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> goup I and the group II chaperonins in M. mazei, which was confirmed in <b>the</b> initial part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study, provided the opportunity to obtain new insights into how the substrate selection differs between the two chaperonin groups. For these purposes, the chaperonin substrates were isolated by immunoprecipitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chaperonin-substrate complexes and identified by liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using three different approaches: LC-MS after separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proteins (i) by classical 2 D-PAGE, (ii) by difference gel electrophoresis (Ettan DIGE) and (iii) by 1 D-PAGE.

The theme ot this thesis is ?How parents manage to bring up the child with special needs [...] ?It should bring authentic information about <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> parents with {{a disabled}} child, statements about their problems and needs. It is based on the qualitative research. I collected data and information through semi-structured interviews with parents who have a child with such a special need.

In the introductory chapters I deal with <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> stress and burden coping. The next issue is the family, its function, families with disabled children and last but not least inappropriate educational approaches. The chapter about burden coping {{is an integral part of}} this thesis. Here I describe individual phases of accepting a disabled child and mention <b>the</b> topic <b>of</b> a social stigma as well. The fourth chapter is about the possibility how to support such affected families not only from <b>the</b> <b>familly</b> members but also from other friends. The last but one chapter describes the burnout, its symptoms and risk factors. A mother usually stays at home with this child and takes care <b>of</b> him. <b>The</b> disabled child might require full-time care which is very demanding and grueling. That is why the mother could be compromised by the burnout. In the last part I tried to specify problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> families I interviewed.

40|$|Esta tesis comienza con el seguimiento de la {{historia de}} Argelia desde su independencia, el 5 de julio de 1962, empezando por la construcción de un Estado libre e independiente. Este Estado tendrá como fundamento una identidad nacional árabe y musulmana en todos sus aspectos (etnológico, político, económico, social y religioso) que adoptará la forma de un sistema político basado en el socialismo. Dicha opción política influirá directamente en la forma de vida y la organización social, en {{particular}} sobre el núcleo esencial, es decir, la familia. Al llegar a este punto, la tesis analiza el papel asignado a la mujer por los textos constitucionales de 1963 y 1976, así como su desarrollo legislativo mediante el "Code de Famille". Los fundamentos políticos y religiosos tuvieron un impacto directo sobre la vida social y particularmente su núcleo, la familia. Según el artículo 65 de la Constitución Argerlina de 1976 « La famille est la cellule de base de la société. Elle bénéficie de la protection de l'Etat et de la société. » La familia es el núcleo de la sociedad. En Argelia, el tipo de familia ¿se distinguiría evolutivo de patriarcal a moderna? ¿o siempre patriarcal? La familia patriarcal obedece a valores tradicionales y religiosos. La mujer es el miembro de la familia quien desempeña un papel y un estatuto doble. El papel de la mujer en la sociedad argelina es primordial. Es doble: al exterior y al interior del domicilio familiar. Primero, la mujer en el espacio público le permite una igualdad en todos los dominios jurídicos. Los textos Constitucionales de 1963 y de 1976 no mencionan ninguna diferencia entre hombre y mujer y al contrario expresan una igualdad entre los sexos para la construcción de un Estado argelino, la participación de todos es decir el pueblo incluyendo hombre y mujer. Segundo, la mujer argelina en el espacio privado desempeña un papel de esposa, madre y hija. Su estatuto de persona en el seno de la familia es de una menor durante toda su vida. Los derechos de las mujeres se determinan en un texto de ley, El Código de la Familia. Este comporta artículos de ley inspirados en la ley islámica « La Shari'a Islamiya » a fin de inscribir la mujer dentro de una dinámica reduciendo sus elecciones personales sobre el noviazgo, el matrimonio, el divorcio, la custodia y el testamento. El derecho femenino en su vida privada está relacionada directamente a la interpretación del texto musulmán en el Código de la Familia. BETWEEN RELIGION AND POLITICS IN ALGERIA SOCIALIST (1962 / 1989) : <b>THE</b> JURIDICAL STATUS <b>OF</b> WOMEN IN <b>THE</b> <b>FAMILLY.</b> TEXT: At <b>the</b> independance <b>of</b> Algeria, on 5 th July 1962, <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algerian state {{was the first}} step in this country. This thesis talks about <b>the</b> followed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> this country starting with <b>the</b> contruction <b>of</b> a free and independent state. This Algerian state will have of foundation an identities : etnologic, political, economical, social and religious established by the algerian law inclusive in the Constitution. <b>The</b> elaboration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constrution <b>of</b> a state will start with <b>the</b> first president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic Ahmed Ben Bella and followed by his successor Houari Boumédiène. <b>The</b> foundations <b>of</b> this establishment express itself for a national algerian identity in all Constitutions (Constitution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Algerian Republic <b>of</b> 1963 and Constitution of Algerian Republic of 1976) underlined an arabic and muslim identity <b>of</b> State. <b>The</b> identity arabic and muslim will be determining for an union with arabics States and a no integration of those for common projects permit diplomatic and solidarity relations. More than relation of all Arabics States, it's more about a way to be : a consideration of a fraternal relation. The etnologic and religious similarities between all countries offered a sufficient reason for an union and a long relation. <b>The</b> option <b>of</b> an arabic and muslim identity will be too nessary pillar for <b>the</b> aplication <b>of</b> a political system socialist. The socialism in Algeria will determine a way of life of people with always an evocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct and immediate implication of this in all properties for realizing this constitutionnal project of a country with strong foundations. This algerian politics according to Ahmed Ben Bella will be made up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nacionalization <b>of</b> a lot of properties like banks, mines, petroleum, agriculture. But other problems will appear in the new State like unemployment, shortage produced an instability. <b>The</b> decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gestion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country will stop the overthrow the 19 th june 1965. <b>The</b> second president <b>of</b> Algerian Republic, Houari Boumédiène will take <b>the</b> mandate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country for his country for its funtioning under the same political system but with a new personality at the government. Chadli Bendjedid, the third algerian president will succeed to Boumédiène after his death in December 1978. <b>The</b> presidence <b>of</b> this third government will face dificulties in a lot of properties political, economic and social. <b>The</b> accumulation <b>of</b> problems was expressed by a popular and violent reaction the 05 th october 1988. Chadli Bendjedid reacted immediatly when he decided to celebrate a referendum for an adoption of a new Constitution the 23 rd February 1989 for giving a different orientation to <b>the</b> functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. The socialism will stand out the Algerian politics between 1962 and 1989 and it will be presented in both Constitutions (Constitution of 1963 and Constitution of 1976) so that the State gets closer to the people with <b>the</b> device <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political party, FLN, «The revolution by the people and for the people» and put last at <b>the</b> explotation <b>of</b> man by <b>the</b> man. This new identity will be situated in an official writing and put on practice. <b>The</b> respect <b>of</b> this norms and <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> orientations will depende on their leaders because the first Algerian Constitution return to 1963 signed by Ahmed Ben Bella and the second Constitution signed by Houari Boumédiène and will be in vigour until 1989 to give place to another orientation political, economic and social. The foundation, political and religious had a direct impact on the society and in particular his nucleus, the family. <b>The</b> article 65 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Algerian Constitution <b>of</b> 1976 «La famille est la cellule de base de la société.

In Algeria, <b>the</b> kind <b>of</b> family could distinguish an evolution to patriarchal to modern? or always patriarchal? The patriarchal family respects traditionals and religious values. The woman is <b>the</b> member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family who has a role and a double status. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman in the algerian society is vital. It's double: outside and inside the family's home.

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo Ã analisar as mudanÃas nas estratÃgias ocupacionais entre geraÃÃes dos agricultores familiares do Projeto Irrigado Curu Paraipaba, um dos espaÃos rurais do Nordeste brasileiro, desapropriado pelo DNOCS, nos anos de 1970, para assentamento de famÃlias de agricultores sem terra. A tese revela que, do ponto vista do objetivo de retirar as famÃlias do grau de extrema pobreza, o DNOCS pode {{considerar}} que cumpriu sua meta primordial, pois as famÃlias que ali permaneceram asseguraram a moradia, a Ãrea de plantio e uma renda proveniente, atualmente, da venda do coco. Revela, por outro lado, que fatores como tamanho dos lotes agrÃcolas, os sistemas de produÃÃo dominados por monoculturas que nÃo absorvem a mÃo-de-obra familiar, a presenÃa de intermediadores nas negociaÃÃes dos produtos das safras, a contiguidade entre os espaÃos rural e o urbano e mudanÃas nos desejos de que os filhos sucedam aos pais como agricultores familiares tiveram fortes repercussÃes nas relaÃÃes entre trabalho e famÃlia, ocasionando mudanÃas entre os membros das famÃlias no processo de sucessÃo para o trabalho como agricultores familiares. Os procedimentos metodolÃgicos utilizados inserem-se, predominantemente, na abordagem qualitativa, por meio da anÃlise de trajetÃrias, histÃrias de vida e observaÃÃo de situaÃÃes de trabalho e do dia-a-dia nos povoados. A pesquisa foi realizada no perÃodo de 2007 a 2009. Os dados foram abordados Ã luz da compreensÃo de que nÃo se pode entender a dinÃmica da produÃÃo camponesa sem que se analise a sua integraÃÃo subordinada Ã lÃgica econÃmica do capital, que por sua vez, opera transformaÃÃes qualitativas nos sujeitos das unidades de produÃÃo familiar. As conclusÃes confirmam o quanto fatores externos influenciam as dinÃmicas internas de funcionamento das unidades familiares, provocando desmontes que debilitam a forÃa das relaÃÃes familiares que fazem parte da reproduÃÃo social dos agricultores familiares, destacando o papel indutor de um Estado desenvolvimentista que opera por meio de programas e projetos que, desde a concepÃÃo, escamoteiam a importÃncia da relaÃÃo entre cultura e desenvolvimento. A relevÃncia do estudo Ã incorporar Ã pauta dos debates sobre os perÃmetros irrigados do DNOCS, uma linha de estudo que, fugindo dos mÃtodos que analisam as unidades produtivas dos agricultores familiares por meio dos retornos econÃmicos de cada ciclo produtivo, analisa as mudanÃas culturais entre sucessivas geraÃÃes, colocando, portanto, no centro do debate. Analisada nessa perspectiva, o estudo vai apontar que as propostas para inclusÃo dos agricultores familiares nÃo passam de um discurso ilusÃrio. <b>The</b> {{main purpose}} <b>of</b> {{this work is}} to analyze {{the change in the}} occupational strategy between generations of family farmers of Projeto Irrigado Curu Paraipaba, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rural spaces in the Brazilian Northeast to have been disapropriated by DNOCS, in the 1970 âs to settle families <b>of</b> landless workers. <b>The</b> thesis reaveal that, from <b>the</b> persepctive <b>of</b> releaving families from extreme poverty, DNOCS can take for granted that it has fulfilled its main goal, for the families that stayed there were able to guarantee home ownership, area for planting, and income which is nowadays obtained from selling coconuts.
