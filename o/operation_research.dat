40|$|<b>Operations</b> <b>research</b> {{methods have}} been applied to the {{modeling}} and the solution of numerous problems in insurance and actuarial science. This paper reviews the applications of these <b>operations</b> <b>research</b> methods in the insur-ance industry. The paper is organized according to the categorization of <b>operations</b> <b>research</b> methods. Specifically, various mathematical program-ming models and their applications are first introduced. Game theory and some new <b>operations</b> <b>research</b> approaches are discussed, along with their applications in insurance and actuarial science. The paper concludes with a general discussion of developments and trends in <b>operations</b> <b>research</b> and insurance. For the student who has studied specific <b>operations</b> <b>research</b> techniques mandated by the SOA examination system, this paper provides a set of examples of techniques pertinent to actuaries and shows how the expanding field of general quantitative reasoning in risk management can have a pos-itive impact on the insurance industry. For research actuaries, we finally present an updated bibliography of <b>operations</b> <b>research</b> applications in in-surance cross-classified by authors, <b>operations</b> <b>research</b> methodologies, and insurance areas of application. 1...|$|R
