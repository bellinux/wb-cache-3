Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E

Randazza wrote that Beck was attempting to evade the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by filing the legal process with an agency of the United Nations instead <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> U.S. court. In the legal brief, Randazza pointed out that Beck's action of going to the WIPO in an attempt to get the website taken down was in contradiction to his prior statements saying he preferred United States law over international law.|$|E

According {{to the original}} formula, the appearances of pronouns, verbs, adverbs and interjections in the text will decrease the score of the F-Measure. This means that if the above four kinds of words are used excessively in one text, {{the context of the}} text will be obscured. However, if the adjectives, prepositions, nouns and articles are used more often, the user’s emotional inclination in the textual expression is more direct. When Δf=F−σ, a greater value of Δf indicates a lower degree of implicitness, which indicates that the expression of the text is more direct. The formula shows that when there are no words <b>in</b> <b>a</b> text, the value of F is 50, and thus σ= 50. The women’s overall F-Measure score is lower than that <b>of</b> men <b>in</b> the large data set, indicating that women are more circumstantial and men tend to be more direct.|$|R

5|$|The Palace of Westminster, {{the medieval}} royal palace {{used as the}} home of the British parliament, was largely {{destroyed}} by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> careless manner in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.|$|E

Before the accordion experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the accordion feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control.

5|$|Two high-powered {{parliamentary}} commissions in 1852 issued {{recommendations for}} Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, {{was a key}} member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to {{all members of the}} University. It recommended that Fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> college.|$|E

Small accumulations of ash can reduce visibility, create slippery runways and taxiways, infiltrate communication and electrical systems, interrupt ground services, damage buildings and parked aircraft.

5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{cladistic}} analyses, Iguanodontidae as traditionally construed was shown to be paraphyletic, and these animals are recognised to fall {{at different points in}} relation to hadrosaurs on a cladogram, instead <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single distinct clade. Essentially, the modern concept of Iguanodontidae currently includes only Iguanodon. Groups like Iguanodontoidea are still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional iguanodontids are now included in the superfamily Hadrosauroidea. Iguanodon lies between Camptosaurus and Ouranosaurus in cladograms, and is probably descended from a camptosaur-like animal. At one point, Jack Horner suggested, based mostly on skull features, that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups, with Iguanodon on the line to the flat-headed hadrosaurines, and Ouranosaurus on the line to the crested lambeosaurines, but his proposal has been rejected.|$|E
5|$|Roland {{was born}} on 26 January 1899 and {{initially}} followed {{a career in the}} army. He married Sonia Rosemary Keppel on 16 November 1920 and they had three children: two sons, Henry and Jeremy (1927–1958); and a daughter, Rosalind. Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate: staffing was a problem, and maintenance and general repair costs were unsustainable. The Home Guard requisitioned a section of the mansion as its headquarters and based a training school there. Hugh Pollock, husband of the author Enid Blyton, re-ignited his adulterous affair with Ida Crowe after arranging work there for her as a civilian secretary. Roland transformed the buildings that had previously been used as housing for the garden and stable staff into a Regency-style house. Flooring and doors were stripped from the old mansion to be incorporated in the new house, leaving just the basic structure of Cubitt's original mansion, which had been empty since 1947. Furniture was disposed <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clearance sale at Dorking in mid-July 1952. Cubitt's mansion was within a designated preservation area, causing the local council to refuse any suggestions that were put forward for the old mansion to be used for commercial purposes. Contractors were brought in to demolish the mansion in 1953; the company may have encountered financial problems, as the basement was not fully destroyed and was left filled with rubble from the higher levels.|$|E

This parallels a priori expectations and conforms to Afolabi’s (2010) results, which reveal that the length <b>of</b> stay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> community/experience positively relates to loan repayment. The author further stresses that, the length <b>of</b> stay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> community determines social cohesion and group membership trust, which is vital for loan repayment. This also mirrors work by Olagunju and Adeyemo (2007), and Eyo (2008).|$|R

25|$|In 1997 the lithium polymer battery was {{released}} by Sony and Asahi Kasei. These batteries hold their electrolyte in a solid polymer composite instead <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> liquid solvent, and the electrodes and separators are laminated to each other. The latter difference allows the battery to be encased in a flexible wrapping instead <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rigid metal casing, which means such batteries can be specifically shaped to fit a particular device. This advantage has favored lithium polymer batteries {{in the design of}} portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, and of radio-controlled aircraft, as such batteries allow for more flexible and compact design. They generally have a lower energy density than normal lithium-ion batteries.|$|E
