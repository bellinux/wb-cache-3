5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E

5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 2010, Juventus {{considered}} challenging the stripping of their scudetti from 2005 and 2006, {{dependent on the}} results <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> connected to the 2006 scandal.

5|$|In the mid-1940s, Chaplin was {{involved}} in a series <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image.

Barry, who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated, reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplin's child. As Chaplin denied the claim, Barry filed a paternity suit against him.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> in July and August 1612 accounts for more than two per cent of that total. Court records show that Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but there only 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.|$|E
