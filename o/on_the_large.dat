5|$|As {{noted by}} a {{historical}} marker <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> hill in Central Campus, the site {{occupied by the}} school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. The surrender of the city {{took place on the}} southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864. The next twenty years were a time of rapid industrial expansion; during this period, Georgia's manufacturing capital, railroad track mileage, and property values would each increase by a factor of three to four.|$|E
5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of his card, '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an empty room in the club, sporting only a white man's suit jacket and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's main room dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on a nearby table for the man to find. As Carey once again {{is shown in the}} yellow latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a small table, while Carey sits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> pink sofa, and Ealy is seen on the other side gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> sofa, as she winks and smiles to the camera.|$|E
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E

5|$|Following {{accusations of}} forced labour <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> American-owned Firestone rubber {{plantation}} and American accusations of slave trading, the Liberian government asked the League {{to launch an}} investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice-president. The Liberian government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 {{the light}} cruisers Melbourne and Sydney were {{deployed}} to the Atlantic where they worked alongside the Royal Navy's North American and West Indies Squadrons, which {{were engaged in}} surveillance operations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number of German ships that had taken refuge in neutral American ports when the war had broken out. This continued until September 1916 when both cruisers were moved to the North Sea where they joined Australia, which had been assisting the Royal Navy in its blockade of the German High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented the eggs {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> size of the eggs and the largely overlapping distribution. However, the discovery of an oviraptorid embryo inside an elongatoolithid egg cast doubt on this hypothesis. With the discovery of multiple oviraptorosaur-elongatoolithid associations in the late 1990s, the eggs of elongatoolithids came to be accepted as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs. Oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{the venue}} was {{upgraded}} for €1 million by installing a K60 inrun between the normal and large hill. This allowed the medium inrun {{to use the}} same outrun as the normal hill. In 2008, a small K25 hill, named Ninoufbakken, was installed slightly away from the main hills. The venue's certificate was due to expire in 2011, after which the venue would have to meet the International Ski Federation's (FIS) latest regulations. A €1.5 million upgrade program was initiated, which saw the inruns renovated, including installation of the Ski-Line track system and new Porsgrund ceramic tracks. The outruns saw new plastic mats and a new sprinkler system. The Nordic House, a sports centre, was also built. Construction started on the normal hill in May 2011 and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> hill in August 2011, with completion scheduled for early 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Navy {{withdrew from the}} project. Stormfury began to refocus its efforts on understanding, rather than modifying, {{tropical}} cyclones. At the same time, the Project's aircraft were {{nearing the end of}} their operational lifetimes. At the cost of $30million (year unknown) two Lockheed P-3's were acquired. Due to the rarity of Atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements, plans were made to move Stormfury to the Pacific and experiment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number of typhoons there. This action required many of the same safety requirements as in the Atlantic, but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential subjects.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the tawny {{nurse shark}} tends {{to spend the day}} resting in piles of two dozen or more {{individuals}} inside caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The litter size may be as small as one or two, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> size of near-term embryos.|$|E

5|$|Steamboats {{operated}} briefly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> lakes of {{the upper}} basin, contributing {{to the growth of}} towns such as Klamath Falls, Oregon, before they were replaced by railroads in the late 19thcentury. In the 19th and 20thcenturies, the upper basin became a productive agricultural region, and many dams were built to provide irrigation and hydroelectricity. In the 1960s, the Klamath River was targeted by much larger, but ultimately unsuccessful schemes to augment water supplies in other parts of California. One of these projects, the Klamath Diversion, would have reversed the entire flow of the Klamath River to supply farms and urban areas in central and southern California.|$|E
5|$|The Melbourne Storm has {{a strong}} rivalry with Brisbane, built in large part <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number of finals games played between the teams, {{including}} one final in each year from 2004 to 2009; the Storm winning {{all but one of}} them. The move of Brisbane assistant coach Craig Bellamy to Melbourne has also been attributed to fueling the rivalry, as well as the wide spread of Queensland Origin players across their squads in {{the better part of the}} past decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{locality}} where Batrachotomus lived was a swampy {{region and}} the name comes from the Greek batrachos/βάτραχος (frog) and tome/τομή (cutting, slicing), which refers to its preying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> amphibian Mastodonsaurus. In contrast with sprawling reptiles, like crocodiles, this large carnivore was very agile with locomotor superiority due to its erect stance. A remarkable feature seen on its back was a row of paired, flattened bony plates. Batrachotomus was possibly an early relative of Postosuchus, which lived during {{the dawn of the}} dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
5|$|The {{very first}} {{computer}} games {{began to appear}} in the 1950s, starting with Bertie the Brain, a computer-based game of tic-tac-toe built by Dr. Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. While the status of these games as video games depends on the definition used, the games developed during this time period ran <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> antecedents of mainframe computers and were primarily developed for the purposes of academic research or to showcase the technological development of the computers on which they ran. Access to these computers, located almost exclusively in universities and research institutions, was restricted to academics and researchers, preventing any development of entertainment programs. Over the course of the decade, computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches, and computers themselves spread to more locations.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the {{southeast}} {{coast of the}} United States on September 1. Gradually decaying, the front degenerated into an area of cloudiness and showers {{just east of the}} Georgia coast on September 2. Tracking eastward, a weak low-pressure area developed the next day. It slowly became better organized as its motion became erratic, and by late on September 4 the convection had become concentrated to the east of the center. On September 5, a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated the system had not acquired the characteristics of a tropical or subtropical cyclone. Interaction with an upper-level trough resulted in moderate wind shear which suppressed further development, and by September 6 the thunderstorm activity lost much organization. Upper-level winds became increasingly favorable, allowing the convection to concentrate about halfway between North Carolina and Bermuda. With a deep-layer ridge to its north, the system turned to a steady west-northwest track. A reconnaissance aircraft flight late on September 7 reported a very elongated center, with peak flight winds of 55mph (90km/h) about 100miles (160km) northeast of the center. Subsequent to the flight, the center became slightly better organized, and based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> wind field and the presence of an upper-level low to its west-southwest, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Subtropical Storm Gabrielle early on September 8 while located about 385miles (625km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.|$|E
