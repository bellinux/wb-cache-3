5|$|The <b>Okapi</b> Conservation Project, {{established}} in 1987, works towards {{the conservation of}} the <b>okapi</b> {{as well as the}} growth of the indigenous Mbuti people. In November 2011, the White Oak Conservation center and Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens hosted an international meeting of the <b>Okapi</b> Species Survival Plan (SSP) and the <b>Okapi</b> European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) at Jacksonville, which was attended by representatives from zoos from the USA, Europe and Japan. The aim was to discuss the management of captive okapis and arrange support for <b>okapi</b> conservation. Many zoos in North America and Europe currently have okapis in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>okapi</b> can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the <b>okapi.</b> The <b>okapi</b> has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the <b>okapi</b> include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg {{on the same side}} of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body - and a long black tongue (longer in the <b>okapi)</b> useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe genome {{is around}} 2.9 billion base pairs in length {{compared}} to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the <b>okapi.</b> Of the proteins in giraffe and <b>okapi</b> genes, 19.4% are identical. The two species are equally distantly related to cattle, suggesting the giraffe's unique characteristics are not because of faster evolution. The divergence of giraffe and <b>okapi</b> lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in the giraffe appear {{to be responsible for}} the animal's stature and associated circulatory adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Though Johnston {{did not see}} an <b>okapi</b> himself, he {{did manage}} to obtain pieces of striped skin and {{eventually}} a skull. From this skull, the <b>okapi</b> was correctly classified as a relative of the giraffe; in 1901, the species was formally recognized as Okapia johnstoni.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in 2016 found that the common ancestor of giraffe and <b>okapi</b> lived about 11.5 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an animal that they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the <b>okapi.</b> Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the <b>okapi</b> {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E
5|$|On July 28, 2017 Dunham {{signed with}} <b>Okapi</b> Aalstar of the Belgian Basketball League.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the <b>okapi</b> as Endangered. It {{is fully}} {{protected}} under Congolese law. The <b>Okapi</b> Wildlife Reserve and Maiko National Park support significant {{populations of the}} <b>okapi,</b> though {{there has been a}} steady decline in numbers due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve and the Abumombanzi Reserve. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A threat that has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the Virunga National Park, but is bereft of protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity. In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the <b>Okapi</b> Wildlife Reserve, killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center.|$|E
5|$|The <b>okapi</b> is {{sometimes}} referred to {{as an example of a}} living fossil.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{members of}} Giraffidae {{first appeared in}} the Early Miocene in Africa, having diverged from the superficially deer-like climacoceratids. Giraffids spread into Europe and Asia by the middle Miocene in a first radiation. Another radiation began in the Pliocene but was terminated by a decline in diversity in the Pleistocene. Several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in the Miocene (23-10 million years ago), including Canthumeryx, Giraffokeryx, Palaeotragus and Samotherium. According to palaeontologist and author Kathleen Hunt, Samotherium split into Okapia (18 million years ago) and Giraffa (12 million years ago). However, another author J. D. Skinner argued that Canthumeryx gave rise to the <b>okapi</b> and giraffe through the latter three genera and that the <b>okapi</b> is the extant form of Palaeotragus. The <b>okapi</b> is sometimes referred to {{as an example of a}} living fossil, as it has existed as a species over a long geological time period, and morphologically resembles more primitive forms (e.g. Samotherium).|$|E
5|$|The <b>okapi</b> occurs across central, {{northern}} and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and {{north and east}} of the Congo river. The species ranges from the Maiko forest northward to the Ituri forest, then through the river basins of the Rubi, Lake Tele and Ebola {{to the west and}} the Ubangi river further north. Smaller populations exist west and south of the Congo river. They are also common in the Wamba and Epulu areas. The <b>okapi</b> is extinct in Uganda.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>okapi</b> {{was unknown}} to the Western world until the 20th century, {{it may have been}} {{depicted}} since the early fifth century BCE on the façade of the Apadana at Persepolis, a gift from the Ethiopian procession to the Achaemenid kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>okapi</b> is Okapia johnstoni. It was first described as Equus johnstoni by English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater in 1901. The generic name Okapia derives from the Lese Karo name o'api, while the specific name (johnstoni) is {{in recognition of the}} British Governor of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, who first acquired an <b>okapi</b> specimen for science from the Ituri Forest while repatriating a group of Pygmies to the Belgian Congo. The animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found in press reports covering Henry Morton Stanley's journeys in 1887. Remains of a carcass were later sent to London by the English adventurer and colonial administrator Harry Johnston and became a media event in 1901.|$|E
5|$|There {{are around}} 100 okapis in {{accredited}} AZA zoos, however, not many zoos house these elusive creatures. The <b>okapi</b> population is {{managed by the}} AZA's Species Survival Plan, a breeding program that works to ensure genetic diversity in the captive population of endangered animals.|$|E
5|$|Okapis are herbivores, {{feeding on}} tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They prefer {{to feed in}} treefall gaps. Staple foods {{comprise}} shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the <b>okapi</b> feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae and Violaceae.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe {{is one of}} {{only two}} living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the <b>okapi.</b> The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. Their closest known {{relatives}} are the extinct deer-like climacocerids. They, together with the family Antilocapridae (whose only extant species is the pronghorn), belong to the superfamily Giraffoidea. These animals may have evolved from the extinct family Palaeomerycidae which might also have been the ancestor of deer.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{governor}} of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy {{inhabitants of the}} Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was puzzled by the <b>okapi</b> tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected {{to be on the}} trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.|$|E
5|$|Kellen Dunham (born June 18, 1993) is an American {{professional}} basketball player for the <b>Okapi</b> Aalstar of the Basketball League Belgium. He played college basketball for the Butler Bulldogs. At Pendleton Heights High School in Pendleton, Indiana, Dunham led {{the state of}} Indiana in scoring as a senior with 29.5 points per game and was named Herald Bulletin Player of the Year. Dunham committed to Butler on July 7, 2010 and was highly regarded by recruiting services. As a freshman, he was a 2012–13 Atlantic 10 All-Rookie Team selection. He scored 16.4 points per game as a sophomore and {{was named to the}} 2013–14 All-Big East Second-team. He was a 2014–15 All-Big East First-team selection as a junior.|$|E
5|$|The {{elongation}} of {{the neck}} appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest that vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down. One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25–20 million years ago (mya), 17–15mya or 18–14.3mya and whose deposits {{have been found in}} Libya. This animal was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like. Giraffokeryx appeared 15mya in the Indian subcontinent and resembled an <b>okapi</b> or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar ossicones. Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium.|$|E
5|$|Granger and Gregory {{argued that}} the large incisors were used for defence or for {{loosening}} shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. Tapirs use their proboscis to wrap around branches while stripping off bark with the front teeth; this ability would have been helpful to Paraceratherium. Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, stripping bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now {{known to have been}} contemporaneous, and that the differences in tusks are perhaps sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of Paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees, which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been {{similar to that of the}} high-browsing giraffe and <b>okapi,</b> rather than to modern rhinoceroses, whose heads are carried close to the ground.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>okapi</b> {{that arrived}} in Basel on June 16, 1949, was the bull Bambe. However, after only 66 days, he died due to liver parasites. Nanouk (1955) and Bibi (1956) {{followed}} him {{and laid the}} foundation of Basel's successful <b>okapi</b> breeding program.|$|E
25|$|All <b>okapi</b> zoos (including Basel) in Europe and North America are {{supporting}} the <b>Okapi</b> Wildlife Reserve {{managed by the}} Gilman International Conservation Organization, in the Ituri Rainforest (Democratic Republic of the Congo). In 2008, Zoo Basel donated $5,000 to the Gilman Conservation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Okapi</b> and Grevy's zebras {{are located}} farther along the boardwalk.|$|E
25|$|The 2005 robbing and {{attempted}} killing of Radio <b>Okapi</b> journalist Jean Ngandu by uniformed soldiers remained under investigation at year's end.|$|E
25|$|Bongos require salt {{in their}} diets, and {{are known to}} {{regularly}} visit natural salt licks. Examination of bongo feces revealed that charcoal from trees burnt by lightning is consumed. This behavior {{is believed to be}} a means of getting salts and minerals into their diets. This behavior has also been reported in the <b>okapi.</b> Another similarity to the <b>okapi,</b> though the bongo is unrelated, is that the bongo has a long prehensile tongue which it uses to grasp grasses and leaves.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Basel's Ahadi fathered {{the first}} <b>okapi</b> birth in the Czech Republic and Slovakia at Zoo Dvur Kralove. A video of this birth is posted on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{breeding}} programs for endangered species that Zoo Basel participates in are the pygmy hippopotamus, Indian rhinoceros, <b>okapi,</b> snow leopard, South African cheetah, squirrel monkeys, and the European otter programs.|$|E
25|$|The Endangered Species Carousel {{features}} hand-carved wooden {{replicas of}} some of Denver's most popular residents including a polar bear mom and cubs, giraffes, <b>okapi</b> and baby gorilla, {{along with many other}} endangered animals.|$|E
25|$|Hoofed mammals are {{generally}} {{housed in the}} center of the zoo. Hoofed mammals at the Denver zoo (counter-clockwise from the entrance) include Grevy's zebras, reticulated giraffes, Bactrian and dromedary camels, <b>okapi,</b> Somali wild ass, many species of antelope including bongo and gerenuk as well as Cape buffalo. Denver Zoo is also one of only a few zoos in the world to house a breeding herd of Przewalski's horses. Other species exhibited in the hoofed mammal yards include red kangaroos and emus in an Australian habitat, abyssinian ground hornbills with the gerenuk and secretary birds exhibited with the <b>okapi.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} visible {{depletion}} of resources, deforestation of the DRC also {{leads to a}} lost habit for the mountain gorilla among other rare species like the <b>okapi,</b> resulting in decreased biodiversity, soil erosion, and contribute to climate change.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding the ban, another Antonov (this one an An-12 {{registered}} as ER-AXI) {{was reported by}} Radio <b>Okapi</b> {{to have had a}} minor motor fire at Bangoka International Airport at Kisangani early in the afternoon of 1 November 2007. No injuries and minor damage were reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{other half}} of the zoo is the Wilds of Africa. Opened in 1990, it was the first exhibit to feature all of the major {{habitats}} of Africa. Visitors can visit the rain forests, mountains, woodlands, rivers, deserts, and bush of Africa. The Nature Trail takes visitors through the rain forest past two large, naturalistic gorilla habitats. Nile crocodiles, wattled cranes, and a few other animals are seen before the Forest Aviary. In the middle of the forest is the Kopje, home to rock hyraxes, klipspringers, and meerkats. The rain forest/watering hole is also home to hippopotamus and <b>okapi,</b> which, {{in the case of the}} latter,zoo is famous for in both its breeding and research. About 20 percent of <b>okapi</b> in zoos in the U.S. and Japan can trace their lineage back to it.|$|E
25|$|The Congo's {{formation}} {{may have}} led to the allopatric speciation of the bonobo and the common chimpanzee from their most recent common ancestor. The bonobo is endemic to the humid forests in the region, as are other iconic species like the Allen's swamp monkey, dryas monkey, aquatic genet, <b>okapi</b> and Congo peafowl.|$|E
25|$|The GR in Kisangani {{assaulted}} {{and beat}} Anselme Masua of MONUC's Radio <b>Okapi</b> after he entered an army camp on April 24, {{although he had}} clearly identified himself as a journalist before doing so. By year's end there were no reports of authorities taking action against the GR soldiers responsible for the beating.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{the camel}} house, this {{enclosure}} adjoining the giraffe house was remodelled in 2006 to house <b>okapi.</b> Initially two males were kept: Dicky arrived from Marwell Wildlife in 2005 and Mbuti came from Bristol Zoo {{in the same}} year. In 2006 Dicky left for London Zoo {{to make way for}} a female named Stuma from Germany. In 2009 Mbuti and Dicky were swapped back, with Mbuti going to London Zoo and Dicky coming back to Chester. Other animals that can be seen here include Red forest duikers, Gambian pouched rats, butterfly barbs, Gaboon vipers and short-eared elephant shrews. Mount Kulal spiny mice and Mesic four-striped grass mice have also been kept here in the past along with various other small species. The <b>Okapi</b> bred for the first time in 2012, producing a female calf named Tafari. The success was repeated in 2014 with the birth of a new male calf.|$|E
25|$|The zoo had {{the first}} Indian {{rhinoceros}} birth in a zoo, {{as well as the}} first greater flamingo hatch. It has had repeated breeding success with animals including cheetahs (18 births), <b>okapi</b> (22), pygmy hippopotamuses (53), and flamingos (over 400 hatches). Every Somali wild ass (a donkey) in zoos worldwide is related to the population in Basel, where this species' zoological breeding program was started.|$|E
