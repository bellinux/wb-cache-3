25|$|The first {{trickle of}} Scotch-Irish {{settlers}} arrived in New England. Valued for their fighting prowess {{as well as}} for their Protestant dogma, they were invited by Cotton Mather and other leaders to come <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> settle and secure the frontier. In this capacity, many of the first permanent settlements in Maine and New Hampshire, especially after 1718, were Scotch-Irish and many place names as well as the character of Northern New Englanders reflect this fact. The Scotch-Irish brought the potato with them from Ireland (although the potato originated in South America, it was not known in North America until brought over from Europe). In Maine it became a staple crop as well as an economic base.|$|E

She then took 2/33 and 1/25 against Victoria as the matches were shared. Having taken 3/23 from ten <b>overs</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> bowl out Western Australia for 99 and set up a ten-wicket win, she then took 2/38 in a 76-run win over South Australia before New South Wales against met Victoria in the final.

25|$|André Nel and Danish Kaneria conceded runs at {{less than}} four runs an <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Essex Eagles to victory over Hampshire Hawks at Chelmsford, and the four points for the win {{increased}} their lead in the National League to an unassailable 14 points and secured the National League title for Essex. After an opening stand of 70 between William Jefferson and Ronnie Irani, Hampshire got four wickets for 31 as three Essex batsmen were dismissed in single figures before James Middlebrook put on 68 with Jefferson. However, three wickets fell for three runs and the score was 172 for 7, with Jefferson caught for 88, but Hampshire could only take two more wickets in the last half-hour as contributions from Ryan ten Doeschate, Graham Napier and Kaneria propelled Essex to 222 for 9 {{at the end of}} their 45 overs. Hampshire and England fast bowler Chris Tremlett got Napier, ten Doeschate and James Middlebrook out to end with three wickets for 48. Despite John Crawley and Nic Pothas recording a first-wicket partnership of 95, Kaneria dismissed Pothas and went on to concede 26 in nine overs – well short of the required run rate at five an over, and boundaries were rare after Pothas and Crawley were dismissed. In the end, Hampshire finished on 210 for 8, 13 runs short of victory – with their overseas players Shane Watson and Andy Bichel contributing four runs off 18 deliveries, for a run rate of 1.33 an over.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Kent, Somerset did {{feature in}} the first round, in which they faced Leicestershire. Mervyn Kitchen and Graham Burgess each batted well to propel Somerset to a score of 251 for 9. Leicestershire were then bowled out for 160 runs after just 46.3 overs, giving Somerset a 91-run victory. Somerset's second round match against Warwickshire, in Birmingham, took three days to complete. Somerset batted first again, and scored 206 for 8. No batsmen {{particularly}} stood out; Roy Virgin, Bill Alley and Colin Atkinson all made scores in the forties, while Kitchen scored 35, and no other batsman reached double figures. Warwickshire then reached 84 for 4 just short of halfway through their overs when the game was postponed due to bad weather. Cricket {{at the time was}} not played on Sundays, and no further play was possible on Monday, so the game continued on Tuesday, when economical bowling from Fred Rumsey, along with the wickets taken by Alley on the first day, helped to restrict Warwickshire to 181 runs. Somerset batted first again in their quarter final match against Northamptonshire, but only managed to score 184 runs. No Somerset player managed to score more than 40 runs during the innings. The Somerset bowlers played well in comparison; Rumsey took four wickets, while Alley conceded only eight runs from his twelve overs, and Northamptonshire were bowled out for 148. Somerset once again had no stand-out batting performance in their semi-final; Kitchen was their highest scorer with 40 runs, as they posted 210 for seven in a rain-interrupted innings which continued into {{the second day of the}} match. Three of the Somerset bowlers, Ken Palmer, Rumsey and Alley all conceded less than two runs per <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> their side limit Lancashire to 110 runs, and give Somerset a 100-run victory.|$|E
500|$|O'Malley dies in {{the premiere}} of the sixth season, due to {{injuries}} sustained from {{being hit by a}} bus, and Stevens later departs Seattle after being diagnosed with cancer and following a lack of communication between her then husband Karev following the Seattle Grace merger with Mercy West. Several new characters are introduced as Seattle Grace Hospital merges with Mercy West. Residents April Kepner and Jackson Avery both transfer to Seattle Grace Hospital from Mercy West, and the latter entertains a brief relationship with Lexie Grey, until she reunites with Mark Sloan. Subsequently, [...] Teddy Altman is introduced as the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery. In the season six finale, a deceased patient's grieving husband embarks on a shooting spree at the hospital, injuring Karev, Shepherd, and Hunt, and killing residents Charles Percy and Reed Adamson. In the shooting's emotional reverberations, Hunt and Yang abruptly marry, not wanting to risk separation. Torres and Robbins eventually wed, officiated by Bailey. In season eight, Webber steps down and allocates his job to Hunt. As the final year of residency for Meredith, Yang, Karev, Avery, and Kepner is coming to a close, the doctors are all planning to relocate to different hospitals to pursue their specialty careers. However, all plans are put on hold when several doctors from Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital are engaged in a plane crash, which kills Lexie [...] and endangers Meredith, Shepherd, Yang, Robbins, and Sloan. At the conclusion of the eighth season, Altman is courteously fired by Hunt as she struggles {{to decide whether or not}} to take the job as Chief at the United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM). In the season nine premiere, Sloan dies due to sustained injuries from the plane crash following a brief relapse of temporary health (the surge) and the remaining characters work through their post traumatic stress and Arizona Robbins' loss of limb by way of suing Seattle Grace Mercy West as the hospital was responsible for putting the surgeons on the plane. The season continues with the struggle of the lawsuit and the animosity that it creates within the hospital, Yang and Hunt eventually divorce in order to help the lawsuit. The doctors who were on the plane won the lawsuit, but the pay out bankrupts the hospital. They all club together and buy Seattle Grace Mercy West, with the help of the Harper Avery Foundation, and they become the Board of Directors, once being called the [...] "Grey-Sloan 7". One of the changes they implement is renaming the hospital to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Robbins cheats on Torres with a visiting facial reconstruction surgeon. Grey's Anatomy then concluded its 10th season on ABC and saw the departure of one of its major players, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh. [...] Towards the end of the eleventh season, Derek Shepherd witnesses a car accident and pulls <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the injured, but his car is hit by a truck with him inside as he attempts to leave the scene. He later dies at another hospital following the doctors' mishandling of his injuries. The season 12 finale saw the departure of one of the show's longest running characters, Callie Torres, played by Sara Ramirez.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, it was {{believed}} that in order to create dreadlocks, an individual had to refrain from brushing, combing or cutting. This lack of hair grooming results in what is called [...] "free form" [...] or [...] "neglect" [...] dreads, where the hair matts together slowly of its own accord. Such dreads tend to vary greatly in size, width, shape, length, and texture. If the wearer is interested in any uniformity of their dreads, they must pull the matted strands of hair apart to ensure large clumps don't form. In addition, if the wearer wishes for their dreads to be neat and tight, they must continue to separate the matted sections of hair and palm roll them regularly for a period of between [...] 6 to 12 months before their hair is well locked. Generally with this free form dread style, the dreads will remain loose and fluffy until the process of long term rolling has tightened them and they have reached a mature status. Until they reach this mature status, they are at risk of coming open especially with lots of water immersion (showers, swimming or washing). [...] Many people use products or wax to assist in the locking process. More <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> with the locking process people turn to using sea salt spray or natural sea salt to dry the hair and accelerate the matting process.|$|E
