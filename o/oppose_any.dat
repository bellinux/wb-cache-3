5|$|Criminal {{trials for}} the accused {{commenced}} in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Three {{of the four}} arrested at the Melasti Bungalows, Nguyen, Chen and Norman, were tried together, with the remaining six defendants tried separately. All defendants faced a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty. The trials were often delayed due to the defendants complaining of illness, headaches and nausea. Australia's prime minister, John Howard, said the Australian government would <b>oppose</b> <b>any</b> death sentences imposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{thirteen}} are Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, Abdulhadi al-Mukhodher, Abduljalil al-Miqdad, Abduljalil al-Singace, Abdulla al-Mahroos, Abdulwahab Hussain, Hasan Mushaima, Ibrahim Sharif, Mohamed Habib al-Miqdad, Mohamed Hasan Jawad, Mohamed Ismail, Sa’eed al-Nuri and Salah al-Khawaja. They {{were originally}} twenty-one, but seven were tried in absentia {{and one was}} released in April 2012. The thirteen became popular heroes in Bahrain, and analysts speculated {{that the government was}} concerned that their release might re-energize the protest movement and frustrate government supporters who <b>oppose</b> <b>any</b> royal pardons.|$|E

5|$|After the {{purchase}} was approved, Jefferson drafted {{a system of}} governing the newly acquired territory. Fearing that the Federalists would <b>oppose</b> <b>any</b> system he had devised, he delivered his draft to Breckinridge {{and asked him to}} introduce it in the Senate as his own. To maintain the ruse, Breckinridge moved that a committee be formed to recommend a plan for governing Louisiana Territory. Working through the committee, he brought Jefferson's plan to the Senate floor with its essentials intact. Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress, Federalists and some Democratic-Republicans opposed it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 26–6.|$|E
5|$|Despite Grey Worm and Missandei's objections, Tyrion Lannister {{arranges}} {{a diplomatic}} {{meeting with the}} masters of Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis. He proposes a deal allowing the cities seven years to transition away from slavery, while compensating the masters for any losses. In return, the masters will cease their support of the Sons of the Harpy. As the masters deliberate, Tyrion is confronted by the former slaves of Meereen, who <b>oppose</b> <b>any</b> kind of negotiation with the masters. Grey Worm and Missandei reluctantly support Tyrion, but in private they warn him that the masters, whom they are both familiar with, will use him if he tries to use them.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the ACLU {{filed an}} amicus brief in Citizens United v. FEC, {{arguing that the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 {{violated}} the First Amendment {{right to free speech}} by curtailing political speech. This stance on the landmark Citizens United case caused considerable disagreement within the organization, resulting in a discussion about its future stance during a quarterly board meeting in 2010. On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, at the same time voicing support for expanded public financing of election campaigns and stating the organization would firmly <b>oppose</b> <b>any</b> future constitutional amendment limiting free speech.|$|E

5|$|As St. Albyn had warned, Shiffner was not {{returned}} as a Member; instead, Lord Egremont, a local landowner, offered considerable {{financial support to}} his own candidate, Daniel Boone, while one of the incumbent MPs, Charles Whitworth, offered to sell parts of his estate to loyal supporters. An intervention from the Duke of Newcastle, at Egremont's request, led to Boone and Whitworth forming an alliance against Fownes Luttrell. Shiffner petitioned Parliament and was supported by an angered Fownes Luttrell, but Egremont and Fownes Luttrell eventually agreed a truce and by 1757 had agreed to return a member each and <b>oppose</b> <b>any</b> third candidates. Reluctant to stand himself, Fownes Luttrell supported Shiffner again. The pair would spend seven years dealing with the estate and consolidating his interest there; this, coupled with his arrangement with Egremont, meant that Shiffner was duly returned in 1761, alongside the first Earl of Thomond, brother of Egremont, beating an outsider, the Earl of Clanbrassill. During this Parliament, Fownes Luttrell entertained voters at Dunster Castle and in the village, where he laid on expensive feasts.|$|E
5|$|British and Canadian patrols {{began to}} {{infiltrate}} {{the city at}} dawn on 9 July. The airfield at Carpiquet finally fell into Allied hands during the early morning, when the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division discovered that the 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment had withdrawn during the night. With the German situation north of the river becoming increasingly precarious, 21st Panzer Division battle groups and the remaining regiments of the 12th SS Panzer Division conducted a slow withdrawal across the Orne, making for the Verrières and Bourguébus Ridges. By noon the 3rd British Infantry Division had reached the Orne's north bank, virtually destroying {{the elements of the}} 16th Luftwaffe Field Division, positioned west of the Orne, in the process. A few hours later the British and Canadians met in the centre of the city and by 18:00 the northern half of Caen was firmly under Allied control; all I Corps's objectives had been achieved. A few of Caen's bridges were intact but these were either blocked by rubble or defended by German troops on the south bank and the 1st SS Panzer Division had by now positioned itself to <b>oppose</b> <b>any</b> further advance.|$|E
5|$|Hinkley Point C {{nuclear power}} station is a project to {{construct}} a 3,200 MW two reactor {{nuclear power station}}. On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Hinkley Point– already {{the site of the}} disused Hinkley Point A and the still operational Hinkley Point B power stations– was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. NNB Generation Company, a subsidiary of EDF, submitted an application for development consent to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 31 October 2011. A protest group, Stop Hinkley, was formed to campaign for the closure of Hinkley Point B and <b>oppose</b> <b>any</b> expansion at the Hinkley Point site. In December 2013, the European Commission opened an investigation to assess whether the project breaks state-aid rules. On 8 October 2014 it was announced that the European Commission has approved the project, with an overwhelming majority and only four commissioners voting against the decision.|$|E

5|$|With the fissure, the Congressional Union began a {{reorganization}} to {{push for}} campaigns against Democratic candidates because they had not supported suffrage {{while they were in}} control of the legislature. Paul established an all-woman advisory council of suffrage workers and prominent women which included Bertha Fowler, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Helen Keller, Belle Case La Follette, May Wright Sewall and educators such as Emma Gillett, Maria Montessori, and Clara Louise Thompson, a Latin Professor at Rockford College, among others, to lend credibility to the new organization. Stevens became the national organizer, charged with organizing women in states in which they were able to vote to use their ballots and <b>oppose</b> <b>any</b> candidate not in favor of full enfranchisement of women. One of the first places Stevens traveled to was Colorado, where CUWS was successful in attaining commitment from one congressman to support the women's cause. Returning from that success in January 1915, she went to New York City and Newport, Rhode Island to campaign before heading west. She campaigned in Kansas, hoping to secure delegates for a convention planned in San Francisco for September.|$|E
