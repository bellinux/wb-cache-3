5|$|The Senate's control <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman provinces helped {{maintain}} a republican façade for the autocratic Principate. Also, Octavian's control of entire provinces followed Republican-era precedents for {{the objective of}} securing peace and creating stability, in which such prominent Romans as Pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} {{spent too much}} time in political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce the influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E

Chapter One gives a brief introduction, {{statements of}} definitions, and statements of theorems without proof. In Chapter Two theorems about {{greatest common divisor}} domains and characterizations of Bezout domains, valuation rings, and Prüfer domains are proved. Also included are characterizations <b>of</b> a flat <b>overring.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results are that an integral domain is a Prüfer domain {{if and only if}} every overring is flat and that every overring of a Prüfer domain is a Prüfer domain...|$|R

5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E

5|$|The Turkic-speaking Bulgars {{arrived in}} the territories west of the river Dniester around 670. At the Battle of Ongal they {{defeated}} the Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) Emperor Constantine IV in 680 or 681 and occupied Dobruja. They soon imposed their authority <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighboring tribes. The great variety in burial rites evidences the multi-ethnic character of the Bulgarian Empire. Even the Bulgars were divided in this respect; some of them practiced inhumation and others cremation. Initially, a sharp distinction existed between the Bulgars and their subjects, but the Slavicization of the Bulgars soon began.|$|E

5|$|Aside from Æthelberht's {{granting}} {{of freedom of}} worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated {{by a number of}} other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium (overlordship) south of the River Humber. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting {{as a representative of the}} Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Burnet {{scaled back}} his {{laboratory}} work, taking one day off per week {{to concentrate on}} writing. In 1963, Autoimmune Diseases: Pathogenesis, Chemistry and Therapy, which he authored with Ian Mackay, was published. He also oversaw {{an expansion of the}} Hall Institute and secured funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space taken up by pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} noted {{that the loss of}} the ability to {{synthesize}} ascorbate strikingly parallels the inability to break down uric acid, also a characteristic of primates.
