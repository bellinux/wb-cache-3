It includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes. Feed grains {{are the most important}} source of animal feed globally. The amount of grain used to produce the same unit of meat varies substantially. According to an estimate reported by the BBC in 2008, [...] "Cows and sheep need 8kg of grain for every 1kg of meat they produce, pigs about 4kg. The most efficient poultry units need a mere 1.6kg of feed to produce 1kg of chicken." [...] Farmed fish can also be fed on grain, and use even less than poultry. The two most important feed grains are maize and soyabean, and the United States is by far the largest exporter of both, averaging about half of the global maize trade and 40% of the global soya trade in the years leading up the 2012 drought. [...] <b>Other</b> <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> include wheat, oats, barley, and rice, among many others.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} named settlement near {{what would}} later become Purdon was a community called Belle Point. It was originally settled by Captain J.A. Harrison. In the early 1880s, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway (also known as the [...] "Cotton Belt") was built two miles south of Belle Point and lots were soon platted around the rail stop. The new community was named Purdon. Credit for the name is given to a railroad man named Harris, who was attracted to a cashier where he brought supplies - Miss Ada Purdom. By an inadvertent spelling mistake at the general office, the town became Purdon. A post office was established in 1881. Purdon became a thriving community {{with most of the}} black land in the area used to raise cotton, corn, and <b>other</b> <b>feed</b> <b>grains.</b> By 1896, approximately 80 people lived in the community. In 1912, a new two-story brick school was completed. According to 1920 Census figures, Purdon had a population of 346. With the coming of school buses in 1928, Belle Point, Jester, and Silver City schools were consolidated with Purdon. The population began to steadily decline, falling to 30 in 1930, and 262 by 1940. The decline accelerated after World War II, when many residents left he area in search of greater job opportunities in larger cities. Purdon's school was consolidated with nearby Dawson in the fall of 1959. As of 1960, Purdon recorded 151 inhabitants, {{less than half of the}} population at its peak in 1920. During the remainder of the twentieth century, the population hovered around 133. Today, most residents travel to either Corsicana or Dawson for groceries, banking, doctors, and employment.|$|E

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the USDA stabilization program on corn year-end carryover stocks and corn utilization. It also presents data on the cost of the program to the USDA. The objectives of the program were to stabilize corn and <b>other</b> <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> utilization and prices and to raise the long-run level of those prices. In pursuit of these objectives, a program of non-recourse loans to farmers on corn sealed in cribs on their farms was undertaken, supplemented later by provisions for purchase agreements and loans stored in commercial warehouses. This stabilization program was backed up in some years by acreage control programs designed to reduce corn production. The 2 ̆ 2 total realized cost 2 ̆ 2 of the corn price and production programs to the USDA from 1932 to 1955 was 1. 3 billion. Most of this consisted of payments under the acreage control program; the cost of the CCC price-support storage operations was only 227 million. Most of this cost was incurred in fiscal 1954 and 1955, when storage stocks were larger than in earlier years. On the basis of the 1955 - 56 program, {{it is likely that the}} cost of CCC corn storage operations in the future will run at about 100 million per year.

40|$|Thirteen {{extensively}} characterised {{grain sorghum}} varieties were evaluated {{in a series}} of 7 broiler bioassays. The efficiency of energy utilisation of broiler chickens offered sorghum-based diets is problematic and the bulk of dietary energy is derived from sorghum starch. For this reason, rapid visco-analysis (RVA) starch pasting profiles were determined as they may have the potential to assess the quality of sorghum as a feed grain for chicken-meat production. In review, it was found that concentrations of kafirin and total phenolic compounds were negatively correlated with peak and holding RVA viscosities to significant extents across 13 sorghums. In a meta-analysis of 5 broiler bioassays it was found that peak, holding, breakdown and final RVA viscosities were positively correlated with ME:GE ratios and peak and breakdown RVA viscosities with apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (AMEn) to significant extents. In a sixth study involving 10 sorghum-based diets peak, holding and breakdown RVA viscosities were positively correlated with ME:GE ratios and AMEn. Therefore, it emerged that RVA starch pasting profiles do hold promise as a relatively rapid means to assess sorghum quality as a feed grain for chicken-meat production. This potential appears to be linked to quantities of kafirin and total phenolic compounds present in sorghum and it would seem that both factors depress RVA starch viscosities in vitro and, in turn, also depress energy utilisation in birds offered sorghum-based diets. Given that <b>other</b> <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> do not contain kafirin and possess considerably lower concentrations of phenolic compounds, their RVA starch pasting profiles may not be equally indicative...|$|E

Prior to 1995, a futures market {{did not exist}} for this commodity. To meet industry demand for a hedging and forward pricing mechanism, the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange (WCE) introduced a feed pea futures contract in November 1995. This study investigates the Canadian feed pea market prior to and during the startup of this first WCE feed pea futures contract. In particular, the study explores whether the WCE could have conducted an analysis using then-existing data that would have assisted {{in the design and}} establishment of the futures contract. The primary research objective was to determine the ability of the Winnipeg feed pea futures contract, as first specified in November 1995, to provide a price discovery mechanism and to reduce pricing risk. Historical feed pea price data and key concepts related to successful futures contracts were evaluated. Feed pea price data available to the WCE before and just after introduction of the futures contract were analyzed to compare pea prices in Canada to pea prices in Europe. This analysis evaluated the potential for success of the WCE feed pea futures contract. The analysis included (1) measuring absolute and relative price risk in feed peas and other North American crops; (2) comparing the basis (costs to move the product between one market and another) of feed peas to the basis for other crops traded between North America and Europe; (3) carrying out Granger causality tests to compare price determination in North America and Europe; and (4) conducting cointegration tests to assess the relationship between the Canadian and European feed pea markets. We argue that this is the analysis the WCE could have conducted to assist in designing and establishing the 1995 feed pea futures contract. International Relations/Trade, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|E

40|$|Edullinen ostoväkirehu ja rehuntuotannossa saavutettavat mittakaavaedut ovat keskittäneet kasvavien maitotilojen rehuntuotantoa entistä enemmän nurmeen. Samalla ostorehujen käyttö nautojen ruokinnassa on lisääntynyt. Maitotilojen pellon käyttö on kuitenkin ollut 1990 -luvulla melko joustamatonta suhteessa viljelyaloilta maksetuissa tuissa tapahtuneisiin muutoksiin. EU-jäsenyyden myötä viljan ja väkirehujen hinnat alenivat suhteessa kotoisten karkearehujen tuotantokustannuksiin. Voimakkaat muutokset karkea- ja väkirehujen hintasuhteissa voivat aiheuttaa suorien tulovaikutuksien lisäksi muutoksia nautakarjatilojen pellon käyttöön sekä eläinten ruokintaan. Maatalouden taloudellisessa tutkimuslaitoksessa tehdyn selvityksen mukaan väkirehujen käyttö nautojen ruokinnassa on lisääntynyt ensisijaisesti EU-jäsenyyden aiheuttaman rehuviljan hinnan alenemisen vuoksi, ei niinkään tukipolitiikan takia. Varsinkin tuotantoaan laajentaneilla maitotiloilla on hyödynnetty edullista rehuviljaa ja rehuntuotannon mittakaavaetuja keskittymällä aikaisempaa enemmän nurmen viljelyyn ja lisäämällä ostorehujen käyttöä. Tutkimus on tehty kannattavuuskirjanpitoon osallistuneilla maitotiloilla. Pinta-alaperusteiset tuet eivät näytä vaikuttavan lyhyellä aikavälillä merkitsevästi maitotilojen pellon käyttöön, joka on melko joustamatonta suhteessa rehuvilja- ja nurmialoille maksettaviin tukiin. Esimerkiksi 10 %:n korotus nurmituessa kannusti viljelijöitä lisäämään tilansa nurmialaa keskimäärin noin yhdellä prosentilla ja vähentämään rehuviljan viljelyä 4, 2 prosentilla. Tutkimustulosten mukaan myös tilakoolla on merkittäviä vaikutuksia maitotilalla viljeltyjen kasvien pinta-aloihin ja ostorehujen käyttöön. Tilan peltoalan kasvu lisää rehuviljan viljelyä, sillä markkinattomia karkearehuja ei kannata tuottaa eläinten rehuntarvetta enempää. Sitä vastoin jos lehmien määrää lisätään peltoalan pysyessä ennallaan, nurmikasvien viljelyalat kasvavat ja ostorehujen käyttö lisääntyy. Agenda 2000 -uudistus ei merkitsevästi vaikuttane maitotilojen pellon käyttöön. Uudistus kuitenkin lisää väkirehujen edullisuutta nautojen ruokinnassa, jos teollisesti jalostettujen rehujen hinnat laskevat samaan tahtiin niiden raaka-aineena käytettävän rehuviljan hinnan kanssa. During {{the past}} 20 years Finnish {{agricultural}} {{policy has been}} reformed significantly. Agricultural product prices have been lowered {{and the use of}} direct income support has increased. The greatest change happened in 1995 when Finland joined European Union and national agricultural policy was integrated to Common Agricultural Policy. In Finland forage price is based on high production cost, which has risen together with other farm production costs. On the other hand one of the main goals in recent policy reforms has been to reduce <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> prices. Together with subsidy changes this has given a reason to suspect, that in ruminants diet <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> and concentrates are substituted for forage. As a result welfare of milk cows and other ruminants may have decreased. In this paper land allocation on Finnish bookkeeping dairy farms in 1989 - 1997 was studied with an econometric model. Farm level models were estimated for forage acreage, <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> acreage and for concentrated feed demand. In 1993 milk quota exchange was allowed between farms and maximum milk output might be endogenous. Therefore milk supply was modelled simultaneously with land use. Models were estimated by Two-Stage Least Squares and endogeneity of milk output was tested by Hausmann Specification Test. Elasticity of forage allocation was 0, 11 with respect to forage land subsidy and - 0, 11 with respect to <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> subsidy. For <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> acreage the corresponding elasticities were - 0, 42 and 0, 29. Changes in acreage based subsidies seem to have no effect on dairy farm land use in the short run. Increased use of acreage based subsidies has not encouraged dairy farms to increase land allocation to <b>feed</b> <b>grains.</b> Acreage based subsidies are also an inefficient way to increase the use of forages in ruminants diet. Forage and <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> acreage demand and concentrates demand on Finnish bookkeeping dairy farms was quite inelastic with respect to changes in concentrated feed and fertiliser price. On the <b>other</b> hand <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> acreage has clearly decreased and concentrates demand has increased while <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> and concentrate prices have decreased. It seems that in ruminants' diet <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> and concentrates are substituted for forage. The results suggest that the use of fodder in milk cows' diet has increased mainly due to decreased <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> price. Especially farmers who have expanded milk production, have specialised on forage production and increased use of concentrated feed in cows' diet by purchasing more feed concentrates. This has allowed farmers to feed more animals with the same acreage as before, and utilise economies of size in forage production. The results indicate, that farm size has an important effect on dairy farm land use and on the demand of concentrated feed. The elasticity of forage land with respect to milk price varied between 0, 12 - 0, 15, for <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> area between - 0, 38 - - 0, 3 and for concentrated feed use between 0, 62 - 0, 76. <b>Feed</b> <b>grain</b> acreage demand was elastic but forage acreage and concentrated feed demand was inelastic with respect to farm total acreage. <b>Feed</b> <b>grain</b> acreage was greater in large farms than in small farms. Also when farmer acquired more land, the <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> share of total farm acreage increased. Milk output on Finnish bookkeeping farms turned out endogenous in 1994 - 1997. Therefore current milk production quota system significantly allocates production rights to dairy farmers willing to expand milk production. Possibility to increase milk output has significant effects on farm land use and feed self-sufficiency too. vo...|$|R

The study was initiated by using some traditional methods for evaluating the nutritional quality of <b>feed</b> <b>grains.</b> The true metabolizable energy (TME) method (a refinement of the commonly used apparent metabolizable energy method) was found to be a rapid and economical method for determining the energy values for new <b>feed</b> <b>grains.</b> Another commonly used method- the Protein Efficiency Ratio - was tested using Japanese quail and turkey poults. While the method was fairly accurate in rank comparisons for grains fed to quail and poults, the method was found to be inadequate for the type of information required for the evaluation of <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> for use under practical formulation procedures.

Differences of up to 3. 7 MJ/kg dry matter (DM) in digestible energy (DE) content were observed following a review of data for more than 70 cultivars of wheat. Similarly, analysis of data for more than 125 cultivars of barley revealed a range in DE estimates from 11. 7 to 16. 0 MJ/kg DM. Differences of this magnitude are economically significant to pig producers. Cultivar has a minimal effect on the availability of energy and amino acids in cereals, although this variation is larger in legumes, particularly lupins. The cultural conditions and agronomic practices (e. g. fertiliser rate) have a greater influence on amino acid and energy availability than the growing region or the growing year.

Wheat bran had higher soluble CP (a) (33. 3 %), corn grain had higher insoluble potentially degradable CP (b) (54. 5 %) and soybean meal had higher degradation rate (9. 78 % h- 1 ) than <b>other</b> <b>feeds,</b> inverses soybean meal (5. 7 %), alfalfa (43. 9 %) and alfalfa (3. 75 % h- 1 ) had lower soluble CP, insoluble potentially degradable CP and degradation rate than <b>other</b> <b>feeds,</b> respectively. There were differences (pin situ dry matter and crude protein degradation and in vitro dry matter and crude protein disappearance. The key protein parameters in the proposed Metabolizable protein system, quick digestible protein, slowly digestible protein and digestible undegradable protein are derived from measurements of the rates of degradation of feed proteins suspended in a dacron bag in the rumen. The Metabolizable protein of soybean meal (381 g kg- 1 ) was numerically rather than the <b>other</b> <b>feeds</b> and for corn grain (86 g kg- 1 ) was numerically less than the <b>other</b> <b>feeds...</b>|$|R

In general, site, extent and rate of starch digestion are affected by intrinsic and external factors that can be interrelated and are thus not easily defined. As a consequence, research to obtain a deeper knowledge on how starch chemical and structural compositions may affect starch digestion potential of <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> and therefore their nutritional value has progressed recently. The objectives of this review are: (1) to give an overview on inherent starch primary structures and interactions with <b>other</b> compounds within <b>feed</b> grains; (2) to discuss factors affecting starch digestion potential in feed grains; (3) to explore starch digestion mechanism, and linkages with animal performances, both for swine and ruminants. The criticism of methods commonly used to estimate starch digestibility from <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> for swine and ruminants are also discussed...|$|R

The cost-reducing impacts of the different options were analysed using a linear-programming model that determined the least-cost feed rations for the different livestock industries. Economic welfare analysis was then used to estimate the size and distribution {{of the benefits of}} research from the <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> quality-improving research. The analysis revealed that there are only limited opportunities to improve the productivity and competitiveness of Australia’s livestock industries by improving the nutritional characteristics of <b>feed</b> <b>grains.</b> Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{contains a}} wide range of reported values for the content of most chemical constituents of <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> and meals. It is not possible to assess accurately how much of this variation is due to genotypic and environmental factors and how much to differences in methodologies between laboratories. We have reviewed the literature for the preparation and analysis of <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> (cereals, legumes, and oilseeds) and made recommendations for procedures considered to give the most accurate and reliable results. Recommendations are also made for a quality assurance scheme, an inter-laboratory evaluation program, and the use of reference materials. Australia-wide adoption of these practices should ensure that any future variations observed can be ascribed to genotype and/or environment.

In {{an investigation of the}} forthcoming changes, linear programming models were used to estimate production, trade, and resource use in 1970 for the major <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> and wheat producing and trading nations of the world. Comparison of the estimates with the 1959 - 60 to 1961 - 62 base period indicates that EEC <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> import requirements will increase substan-tially. Under the assumed conditions of the analysis, the United States will be the major beneficiary of the increased demand for <b>feed</b> <b>grain.</b> The prospects for wheat trade with the EEC, however, are less:favorable. Except for quality hard wheat and durum wheat, United States and Canadian wheat exports to the EEC will be virtually eliminated by 1970. Nevertheless, the results indicate that gross revenue from United States wheat and <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> exports to the EEC will be substantially greater in 1970 than during the base period. These results are considerably more optimistic than those reached by other researchers. Recent trends in production and trade tend t...|$|R
