50|$|DNA glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes are {{involved}} in base excision repair of DNA damaged by oxidation or by mutagenic agents. These enzymes have both DNA glycosylase activity (EC) and AP lyase activity (EC). Examples include formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylases (Fpg; MutM) and endonuclease VIII (Nei). Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylases (Fpg, MutM) is a trifunctional DNA base excision repair enzyme that removes {{a wide range of}} oxidation-damaged bases (N-glycosylase activity; EC) and cleaves both the 3'- and 5'-phosphodiester bonds of the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP lyase activity; EC). Fpg has a preference for oxidised purines, excising oxidized purine bases such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). ITs AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity introduces nicks in the DNA strand, cleaving the DNA backbone by beta-delta elimination to generate a single-strand break {{at the site of the}} removed base with both 3'- and 5'-phosphates. Fpg is a monomer composed of 2 domains connected by a flexible hinge. The two DNA-binding motifs (a zinc finger and the helix-two-turns-helix motifs) suggest that the <b>oxidized</b> <b>base</b> is flipped out from double-stranded DNA in the binding mode and excised by a catalytic mechanism similar to that of bifunctional base excision repair enzymes. Fpg binds one ion of zinc at the C terminus, which contains four conserved and essential cysteines. Endonuclease VIII (Nei) has the same enzyme activities as Fpg above, but with a preference for oxidized pyrimidines, such as thymine glycol, 5,6-dihydrouracil and 5,6-dihydrothymine.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{reprogramming}} {{of parental}} methylomes is essential for embryonic development. In mammals, paternal 5 -methylcytosines (5 mCs) {{have been proposed}} to be actively converted to <b>oxidized</b> <b>bases.</b> These paternal <b>oxidized</b> <b>bases</b> and maternal 5 mCs {{are believed to be}} passively diluted by cell divisions. By generating single-base resolution, allele-specific DNA methylomes from mouse gametes, early embryos, and primordial germ cell (PGC), as well as single-base-resolution maps of <b>oxidized</b> cytosine <b>bases</b> for early embryos, we report the existence of 5 hmC and 5 fC in both maternal and paternal genomes and find that 5 mC or its oxidized derivatives, at the majority of demethylated CpGs, are converted to unmodified cytosines independent of passive dilution from gametes to four-cell embryos. Therefore, we conclude that paternal methylome and at least a significant proportion of maternal methylome go through active demethylation during embryonic development.

In 8 -oxo-G:A mispairs generated by the incorporation of A opposite unrepaired 8 -oxo-G, A is removed by MutYH (MYH) for post-replicative repair, and other <b>oxidized</b> <b>base</b> lesions must be repaired prior to replication {{in order to prevent}} mutation fixation. Our earlier studies documented S phase-specific overexpression of endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL 1) DNA glycosylase (DG), one of five <b>oxidized</b> <b>base</b> excision repair (BER) -initiating enzymes in mammalian cells, and its high affinity for replication fork-mimicking single-stranded (ss) DNA substrates. We recently provided experimental evidence for the role of NEIL 1 in replicating-strand repair, and proposed the “cowcatcher” model of pre-replicative BER, where NEIL 1 ’s nonproductive binding to the lesion base in ssDNA template blocks DNA chain elongation, causing fork regression. Repair of the lesion in the then re-annealed duplex is carried out by NEIL 1 in association with the DNA replication proteins.

The comet assay allowed us to identify different senescent phenotypes and to investigate changes in nuclear features and/or DNA damage irrespective of time elapsed in culture.

40|$|Chemical {{pollution}} by pesticides {{has been}} identified as a possible contributing factor to the massive mortality outbreaks observed in Crassostrea gigas for several years. A previous study demonstrated the vertical transmission of DNA damage by subjecting oyster genitors to the herbicide diuron at environmental concentrations during gametogenesis. This trans-generational effect occurs through damage to genitor-exposed gametes, as measured by the comet-assay. The presence of DNA damage in gametes could be linked to the formation of DNA damage in other germ cells. In order to explore this question, the levels and cell distribution of the <b>oxidized</b> <b>base</b> lesion 8 -oxodGuo were studied in the gonads of exposed genitors. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV and electrochemical detection analysis showed an increase in 8 -oxodGuo levels in both male and female gonads after exposure to diuron. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the presence of 8 -oxodGuo at all stages of male germ cells, from early to mature stages. Conversely, the <b>oxidized</b> <b>base</b> was only present in early germ cell stages in female gonads. These results indicate that male and female genitors underwent oxidative stress following exposure to diuron, resulting in DNA oxidation in both early germ cells and gametes, such as spermatozoa, which could explain the transmission of diuron-induced DNA damage to offspring. Furthermore, immunostaining of early germ cells seems indicates that damages caused by exposure to diuron on germ line not only affect the current sexual cycle but also could affect future gametogenesis...|$|E

In the present study, we provide an unambiguous demonstration that absorption of UVC and UVB radiation by the nucleobases induces DNA oxidation via a direct process (one-electron oxidation) and not singlet oxygen.

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a biologically active {{industrial}} chemical used {{in production}} of consumer products. BPA {{has become a}} target of intense public scrutiny following concerns about its association with human diseases such as obesity, diabetes, reproductive disorders, and cancer. Recent studies link BPA with the generation of reactive oxygen species, and base excision repair (BER) is responsible for removing oxidatively induced DNA lesions. Yet, the relationship between BPA and BER {{has yet to be}} examined. Further, the ubiquitous nature of BPA allows continuous exposure of the human genome concurrent with the normal endogenous and exogenous insults to the genome, and this co-exposure may impact the DNA damage response and repair. To determine the effect of BPA exposure on base excision repair of oxidatively induced DNA damage, cells compromised in double-strand break repair were treated with BPA alone or co-exposed with either potassium bromate (KBrO 3) or laser irradiation as oxidative damaging agents. In experiments with KBrO 3, co-treatment with BPA partially reversed the KBrO 3 -induced cytotoxicity observed in these cells, and this was coincident with an increase in guanine base lesions in genomic DNA. The improvement in cell survival and the increase in oxidatively induced DNA base lesions were reminiscent of previous results with alkyl adenine DNA glycosylase-deficient cells, suggesting that BPA may prevent initiation of repair of <b>oxidized</b> <b>base</b> lesions. With laser irradiation-induced DNA damage, treatment with BPA suppressed DNA repair as revealed by several indicators. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that BPA can induce a suppression of <b>oxidized</b> <b>base</b> lesion DNA repair by the base excision repair pathway...|$|E

In a reconstituted system, we also observed NEIL 2 -initiated transcription-dependent base excision repair of 5 -hydroxyuracil in the transcribed strand, with hnRNP-U playing a critical role. Chromatin immunoprecipitation/reimmunoprecipitation studies showed association of NEIL 2, RNA polymerase II, and hnRNP-U on transcribed but not on transcriptionally silent genes.

Here we show by using both local and global induction of oxidative DNA base damage that XRCC 1 participation in BER complexes can be distinguished from that in SSBR by several criteria. We show first that XRCC 1 recruitment to BER is independent of PARP. Second, unlike SSBR complexes that are assembled within minutes after global damage induction, XRCC 1 is detected later in BER patches, with kinetics consistent with the repair of <b>oxidized</b> <b>bases.</b> Third, while XRCC 1 -containing foci associated with SSBR are formed both in eu- and heterochromatin domains, BER complexes are assembled in patches that are essentially excluded from heterochromatin and where the <b>oxidized</b> <b>bases</b> are detected...|$|R

Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG 1) initiates BER of <b>oxidized</b> purine <b>bases.</b> A small number of protein interactions have been identified for OGG 1, while very few appear to have functional consequences. We report here that OGG 1 interacts with the recombination protein RAD 52 in vitro and in vivo. This interaction has reciprocal functional consequences as OGG 1 inhibits RAD 52 catalytic activities and RAD 52 stimulates OGG 1 incision activity, likely increasing its turnover rate. RAD 52 colocalizes with OGG 1 after oxidative stress to cultured cells, but not after the direct induction of double-strand breaks by ionizing radiation. Human cells depleted of RAD 52 via small interfering RNA knockdown, and mouse cells lacking the protein via gene knockout showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Moreover, cells depleted of RAD 52 show higher accumulation of <b>oxidized</b> <b>bases</b> in their genome than cells with normal levels of RAD 52.

Secondly, the presence of <b>oxidized</b> <b>bases</b> employing FPG and EndoIII were detected for lymphocytes and sperm in the negative control and after 24 h recovery in lymphocytes but not immediately after treatment for both cell types. The successful detection of <b>oxidized</b> <b>bases</b> in the negative control (untreated) of sperm provides an opportunity for its application in biomonitoring studies. DNA repair at 24 h after exposure was also studied. A nearly complete recovery to negative control levels was shown in lymphocytes 24 h recovery after oestrogenic exposure and this was statistically significant in all cases. Rapid rejoining of DNA, in a matter of hours, is a characteristic of DNA damaged by ROS...|$|R
40|$|During {{activation}} of B cells to undergo class switching, B cell metabolism is increased, {{and levels of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS) are increased. ROS can <b>oxidize</b> DNA <b>bases</b> resulting in substrates for the DNA glycosylases Ogg 1 and Nth 1. Ogg 1 and Nth 1 excise <b>oxidized</b> <b>bases,</b> and nick the resulting abasic sites, forming single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) as intermediates during the repair process. In this study, we asked whether splenic B cells from mice deficient in these two enzymes would show altered class switching and decreased DNA breaks in comparison with wild-type mice. As the c-myc gene frequently recombines with the IgH S region in B cells induced to undergo class switching, we also analyzed the effect of deletion of these two glycosylases on DSBs in the c-myc gene. We did not detect a reduction in S region or c-myc DSBs or in class switching in splenic B cells from Ogg 1 - or Nth 1 -deficient mice or from mice deficient in both enzymes...|$|R
40|$|The {{sunscreen}} agent 2 -phenylbenzimidazole- 5 -sulfonic acid (PBSA) {{is water}} soluble and {{is widely used}} in the cosmetic industry because it absorbs strongly at UV-B wavelengths. Previous {{studies have shown that}} PBSA, photoexcited by UV-B, <b>oxidizes</b> guanine <b>bases</b> in vitro. Because of its potential phototoxic effect, it is important to determine whether PBSA photosensitizes in cellulo the formation of oxidatively generated DNA damage on UV exposure. For this purpose, we investigated, in vitro and in cellulo, the effect of PBSA on DNA bases after UV-A or UV-B irradiation. To monitor the formation of <b>oxidized</b> <b>bases</b> and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), DNA was digested either with FaPy-DNA glycosylase and endonuclease III or with T 4 endonuclease V and photolyase, then analyzed by means of neutral- and glyoxal-agarose gel electrophoresis and ligation-mediated PCR. In cellulo, we found that PBSA provided good protection against CPD formation after UV-B exposure. However, PBSA also photosensitized oxidized guanines on UV-A and UV-B irradiation. Our results indicate that PBSA has the potential to function as a double-edged sword toward DNA and question its suitability for sunscreen applications...|$|R
