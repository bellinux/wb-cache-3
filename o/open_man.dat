5|$|James' playmaking {{ability is}} {{generally}} considered to be one of his premier skills, with some analysts ranking him among the greatest passers in NBA history. He is the only frontcourt player in league history to register over 7,000 career assists. Using his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses to his advantage, James is able to create easy points for his teammates with accurate assists, manufacturing a league leading 2.6 three-pointers per game by way of his passing alone in 2013. He will often execute passes that would normally be considered unconventional, including passes after leaving his feet and passes through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the <b>open</b> <b>man</b> {{played a significant role in}} the evolution of modern NBA defenses, forcing teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.|$|E
25|$|Although {{not a very}} <b>open</b> <b>man</b> and {{a rather}} secluded personality, he already {{achieved}} cult status during his life.

His art often portrayed a recurring theme found in symbolist art: the dualistic vision of woman as either 'femme fatale' or angelic woman.|$|E
500|$|Russell's first Celtics game came on December 22, 1956, {{against the}} St. Louis Hawks, led by star forward Bob Pettit, who held several all-time scoring records. Auerbach {{assigned}} Russell {{to shut down}} St. Louis's main scorer, and the rookie impressed the Boston crowd with his man-to-man defense and shot-blocking. In previous years, the Celtics had been a high-scoring team, but lacked the defensive presence needed to close out tight games. However, with the added defensive presence of Russell, the Celtics had {{laid the foundation for}} a dynasty. The team utilized a strong defensive approach to the game, forcing opposing teams to commit many turnovers, which led to many easy fast break points. Russell was an elite help defender who allowed the Celtics to play the so-called [...] "Hey, Bill" [...] defense: whenever a Celtic requested additional defensive help, he would shout [...] "Hey, Bill!" [...] Russell was so quick that he could run over for a quick double team and make it back in time if the opponents tried to find the <b>open</b> <b>man.</b> He also became famous for his shot-blocking skills: pundits called his blocks [...] "Wilsonburgers", referring to the Wilson NBA basketballs he [...] "shoved back into the faces of opposing shooters". This skill also allowed the other Celtics to play their men aggressively: if they were beaten, they knew that Russell was guarding the basket. This approach allowed the Celtics to finish with a 44–28 regular season record, the team's second-best record since beginning play in the 1946–47 season, and guaranteed a post-season appearance.|$|E

[...] UCLA was unable to generate {{any kind of a}} pass rush against the Notre Dame offensive line, allowing the masterful Quinn to pick apart the Bruin defense with surgical precision.

It seems as abominable an {{operation}} as the other, the shutting up with its mental suggestions of bang, snap, crash and the empty silence outside-- where an instant before you were--you were--and now no longer are. Perfectly devilish. And the release! I don't know which is worse. How do they do it? Pull the string, door flies <b>open,</b> <b>man</b> flies through: Out you go! Adios! And in the space where a second before you were not, in the silent space there is a figure going away, limping. Why limping? I don't know. That's how I see it. One has a notion of a maiming, crippling process; of the individual coming back damaged in some subtle way. I admit it is a fantastic hallucination, but I can't help it. Of course I know that {{the proceedings of the}} best machine-made humanity are employed with judicious care and so on. I am absurd, no doubt, but still... Oh yes it's idiotic. When I pass one of these places ... did you notice that there is something infernal about the aspect of every individual stone or brick of them, something malicious as if matter were enjoying its revenge of the contemptuous spirit of man. Did you notice? You didn't? Eh? Well I am perhaps a little mad on that point. When I pass one of these places I must avert my eyes. I couldn't have gone to meet de Barral. I should have shrunk from the ordeal. You'll notice that it looks as if Anthony (a brave man indubitably) had shirked it too. Little Fyne's flight of fancy picturing three people in the fatal four-wheeler--you remember?--went wide of the truth. There were only two people in the four-wheeler. Flora did not shrink. Women can stand anything. The dear creatures have no imagination when it comes to solid facts of life. In sentimental regions--I won't say. It's another thing altogether. There they shrink from or rush to embrace ghosts of their own creation just the same as any fool-man would.|$|E

5000|$|Fernandez {{is perhaps}} the most ambidextrous player to have played the game since Carlos Loyzaga a {{generation}} before him. Almost always, whenever he would get the defensive rebound he would assume the role of [...] "point-center", leading the fast-break (a throwback to his point-guard days), which he admitted was a habit he could not break in the pros. Fernandez would dribble the ball running the middle of the court, either hitting the <b>open</b> <b>man</b> on either wing or finishing a lay-up with either hand. There were many instances when he would switch the ball from right hand to left hand, often drawing a foul or setting up a three-point play. One of his more famous moves was driving {{down the middle of the}} lane coming from the right side of the court, faking a right-handed shot and then, at the last second when the defender has committed himself, switching the ball to his left hand for an up-and-under scoop shot that almost always drew a foul. He had an ambidextrous hook shot that was almost impossible to stop and a weird-looking variation of a lay-up that was executed while [...] "fading away" [...] from the basket which made it equally intriguing. His [...] "elegant shot" [...] often came after a right-handed cross-over dribble and moving away from a defender. He used pivot moves, pump fakes, lookaway or no-look passes, looping shots, fadeaways and an array of what seemed to be trick shots from near or under the basket that he executed to perfection. He was doing this before Kevin McHale was doing his moves worthy of a chapter in an NBA playbook. Fernandez owned what was perhaps the craziest no-look pass that was executed on Philippine hardwood: an assist initiated as a fake behind-the-back pass going to one direction only to go the opposite direction at the precise moment when the recipient is ready to receive the pass. His pinpoint passing ability was so devastating to opponents because he often executed them at critical junctures of the game, either coming from his right or left hand. It didn't matter to Fernandez whether he was hitting the <b>open</b> <b>man</b> through a crowd of defenders or hitting the same <b>open</b> <b>man</b> via a Hail Mary pass from outside the backcourt. Philip Cezar and Abe King, two premier defenders of local players and imports alike, in television interviews, always said that Fernandez was the toughest assignment they ever had to handle.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the neutral}} zone, the defence hangs back towards {{his or her}} own blue line, usually playing the puck up to other teammates. According to Jay Leach, who writes for NHL.com's [...] "learn to play hockey" [...] section, the defence must [...] "Move the puck hard and quick to the <b>open</b> <b>man.</b> Join the rush, [...] do not lead it." [...] Because of this responsibility, defencemen must read the other team's {{defensive}} strategy effectively in order to make an effective first pass that furthers the offensive momentum without leaving the defenceman out of position should his team lose control of the puck. In certain situations the best option could be to skate the puck into the zone to maintain offensive speed as well as preventing an offside.|$|E
5000|$|Theorists {{interested}} {{in the role of}} animals in literature, culture, and Continental philosophy also consider the late work of Jacques Derrida a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities. [...] Derrida's final lecture series, The Animal That Therefore I Am, examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define mankind and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, Cary Wolfe published Animal Rites in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as Peter Singer and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben published a book {{on the question of the}} animal: The <b>Open.</b> <b>Man</b> and Animal.|$|E
