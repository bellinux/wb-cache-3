25|$|Multiple causes {{exist for}} AI {{in the setting}} of {{ascending}} aortic dissection. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the aortic valve, so that the leaflets of the valve cannot coapt. Another mechanism is that the dissection may extend into the aortic root and detach the aortic valve leaflets. The third mechanism is that if there was an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the LV <b>outflow</b> <b>tract,</b> causing intimal intussusception into the aortic valve preventing proper valve closure.|$|E
25|$|The vaginal {{plate is}} the {{precursor}} to the vagina. During development, the vaginal plate begins to grow where the solid ends of the paramesonephric ducts (Müllerian ducts) enter {{the back wall of}} the urogenital sinus. As the plate grows, it separates the sinus into the urethra and the vagina and extends the vagina by pushing the cervix deeper. Originally full of cells, as the central cells of the plate break down, the lumen of the vagina is formed. This usually occurs by the twenty to twenty-fourth week of development. If the lumen does not form, or is incomplete, membranes across or around the tract called septae can form, which may cause obstruction of the <b>outflow</b> <b>tract</b> later in life.|$|E
25|$|In situ {{hybridization}} and conditional {{gene knockout}} studies {{have helped to}} demonstrate the role JAG1 plays in development {{and its effects on}} different organ systems. In humans, JAG1 has broad expression in many tissue types including the pancreas, heart, placenta, prostate, lung, kidney, thymus, testis, and leucocytes in the adult. In a developing embryo JAG1 expression is concentrated around the pulmonary artery, mesocardium, distal cardic <b>outflow</b> <b>tract,</b> major arteries, metanephros, branchial arches, pancreas, the portal vein, and otocyst. Generally, JAG1 expression patterns correlate with organ systems affected in ALGS, although {{it is important to note}} that not all tissues where JAG1 is expressed are affected in ALGS. More recently JAG1 expression has been found to be altered in breast cancer and adrenocortical carcinoma patients.|$|E
40|$|Blood {{flow across}} the {{atrioventricular}} valves and <b>outflow</b> <b>tracts</b> {{was measured in}} 55 normal fetuses and 32 fetuses with haemoglobin (Hb) Bart's disease between 18 and 26 weeks of gestation. The mean velocities remained unchanged in both normal and affected fetuses over the gestations studied. The volume flow across both atrioventricular valves and <b>outflow</b> <b>tracts</b> increased as the gestation advanced in both normal and affected fetuses, but was significantly higher in affected than in normal fetuses. The same magnitude of increased flow was found in both hydropic and non-hydropic fetuses with Hb Bart's disease. These findings suggest that fetuses with severe and long-standing anaemia have a remarkable cardiac compensatory mechanism {{for the maintenance of}} tissue oxygenation. In response to anaemia and circulatory loading, the cardiac chambers and <b>outflow</b> <b>tracts</b> enlarge proportionately up to twice the normal values. Because of this response and the operation of the Frank-Starling mechanism, the heart is able to maintain a normal mean velocity of propulsion and the net output is increased to two to three times that in normal fetuses. Hydropic changes in these anaemic fetuses appear unrelated to cardiac failure as cardiac failure is not observed at the time that hydropic changes develop. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|A {{pacemaker}} {{is typically}} {{inserted into the}} patient through a simple surgery using either local anesthetic or a general anesthetic. The patient may be given a drug for relaxation before the surgery as well. An antibiotic is typically administered to prevent infection. In most cases the pacemaker is inserted in the left shoulder area where an incision is made below the collar bone creating a small pocket where the pacemaker is actually housed in the patient's body. The lead or leads (the number of leads varies {{depending on the type}} of pacemaker) are fed into the heart through a large vein using a fluoroscope to monitor the progress of lead insertion. The Right Ventricular lead would be positioned away from the apex (tip) of the right ventricle and up on the interventricular septum, below the <b>outflow</b> <b>tract,</b> to prevent deterioration of the strength of the heart.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{describe}} a normal heart left bundle branch block, inferior axis ventricular tachycardia (VT), {{that could not}} be ablated from the right or left ventricular <b>outflow</b> <b>tracts.</b> BACKGROUNDWhether these VTs are epicardial and can be identified by a specific electrocardiographic pattern is unclear. METHODSTwelve patients with normal heart left bundle branch block, inferior axis VT and previously failed ablation were included in this study. Together with mapping in the right and left ventricular <b>outflow</b> <b>tracts,</b> we obtained percutaneous epicardial mapping in the first five patients and performed aortic sinus of Valsalva mapping in all patients. RESULTSNo adequate pace mapping was observed in the right and left ventricular <b>outflow</b> <b>tracts.</b> Earliest ventricular activation was noted in the epicardium and the aortic cusps. All patients were successfully ablated from the aortic sinuses of Valsalva (95 % CI 0 % to 18 %). The electrocardiographic pattern associated with this VT was left bundle branch block, inferior axis and early precordial transition with Rs or R in V 2 or V 3. Ventricular tachycardia from the left sinus had rS pattern in lead I, and VT from the noncoronary sinus had a notched R wave in lead I. None of the patients had complications and all remained arrhythmia-free at a mean follow-up of 8 ± 2. 6 months. CONCLUSIONSNormal heart VT with left bundle branch block, inferior axis and early precordial transition can be ablated in the majority of patients from either the left or the noncoronary aortic sinus of Valsalva...|$|R

2500|$|Heart murmurs are sounds {{generated}} by blood {{flowing through the}} structures of the heart.

[...] There has been conjecture that the vibratory or musical quality of the murmur is caused by vibration of “false chordae” of the left ventricle, which are a common finding in normal individuals, but no relationship between the two has been proven. [...] There is some evidence that a smaller aorta with higher peak flow velocities are associated with Still’s murmur, which certainly fits in well with the concept that the murmur is a musical phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of visualizing standard cardiac views from 4 -dimensional (4 D) cardiac volumes obtained at ultrasound facilities with no specific experience in fetal echocardiography. Five sonographers prospectively recorded 4 D cardiac volumes starting from the 4 -chamber view on 500 consecutive pregnancies at 19 to 24 weeks' gestation undergoing routine ultrasound examinations (100 pregnancies for each sonographer). Volumes were sent to the referral center, and 2 independent reviewers with experience in 4 D fetal echocardiography assessed their quality in the display of the abdominal view, 4 -chamber view, left and right ventricular <b>outflow</b> <b>tracts,</b> and 3 -vessel and trachea view. Cardiac volumes were acquired in 474 of 500 pregnancies (94. 8 %). The 2 reviewers respectively acknowledged the presence of satisfactory images in 92. 4 % and 93. 6 % of abdominal views, 91. 5 % and 93. 0 % of 4 -chamber views, in 85. 0 % and 86. 2 % of left ventricular <b>outflow</b> <b>tracts,</b> 83. 9 % and 84. 5 % of right ventricular <b>outflow</b> <b>tracts,</b> and 85. 2 % and 84. 5 % of 3 -vessel and trachea views.
