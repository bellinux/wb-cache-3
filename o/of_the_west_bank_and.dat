The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E

25|$|Following the June 1967 Six-Day War, Hebron {{came under}} Israeli control.

25|$|The internationally {{recognized}} border between Egypt and Israel was eventually demarcated {{as part of}} the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty.

25|$|Based on the Israeli {{definition}} of the West Bank, Barak offered to form a Palestinian state initially on 73% of the West Bank (that is, 27% less than the Green Line borders) and 100% of the Gaza Strip.

25|$|Proposed in the Fall of 2000 {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the Camp David talks, The Clinton Parameters included a plan on which the Palestinian State was to include 94-96% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank,</b> <b>and</b> around 80% of the settlers were to become under Israeli sovereignty, and in exchange for that, Israel would concede some territory (so called 'Territory Exchange' or 'Land Swap') within the Green Line (1967 borders).

25|$|Ze'evi later {{advocated}} the population transfer by agreement of 3.3 million residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza to Arab nations.

In July 1987, Ze'evi presented his ideas at a forum in Tel Aviv, describing the plan as a voluntary transfer {{and the only way to}} make peace with the Arabs. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Ze'evi proposed transferring Palestinians to the east side of the Jordan River to serve as a buffer zone against any Iraqi attempt to attack Israel.|$|E
