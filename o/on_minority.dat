5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

25|$|A {{small number}} of {{communities}} in the United States and Israel that consider themselves Orthodox (including one Hartman-Halbertal helped to found) have implemented more egalitarian practices in the synagogue. These include the practice of calling women up to the Torah and allowing them to lead those portions of the service that are not halakhically defined as prayer, such as the set of hymns welcoming {{the advent of the}} Sabbath. They rely <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> opinions that halakhic problems with men hearing women sing do not apply to synagogue worship.|$|E
25|$|In 1916 under Premier T.C. Norris {{the prior}} {{compromise}} was rescinded and the Franco-Manitoban minority lost {{their right to}} receive instruction in French in Manitoba's public schools. Section 93 of the BNA act(1867) in the Province's opinion had been contravened with the Laurier-Greenway Compromise and no longer had legal standing. Moreover, in section 93 of the BNA the province had ultimate authority to decide <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> language instruction. The latter remained status-quo until two changes were made to Manitoba's Public School Act (PSA) in 1966 and 1970 when French language instruction was once again recognized as an official language of instruction.|$|E
25|$|Racially {{segregated}} neighborhoods {{have strong}} social networks. These networks {{have been shown}} to create social capital, which has been linked to having positive effects <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> residents. First, Portes argues that an individual will gain access to power and political positions through the direct and indirect employment of social connections. He continues by stating that this access to power and political positions, allows for social mobility. Second, Portes states that social capital is generated by social networks of relationships and without the reciprocity, trust, and social norms that come with these networks, a resident who is in need would not be given an opportunity to succeed.|$|E

25|$|Executive Order 12898 (1994) states “... each Federal agency {{shall make}} {{achieving}} environmental justice {{part of its}} mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities <b>on</b> <b>minority,</b> low-income, and indigenous populations.” The order is also intended to advocate nondiscrimination in federal programs that influence the environment and public health, and aims to provide low-income, minority, and indigenous communities access to public information and participation. However, {{as one of the}} primary federal law in the United States, the Clean Water Act presents income and racial disparities in not only drinking water quality but also water infrastructure, and has significantly affected public health.|$|E
25|$|Butler's protagonists are disenfranchised {{individuals}} who endure, compromise, and embrace {{radical change in}} order to survive. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, her stories focus <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> characters whose historical background makes them already intimate with brutal violation and exploitation, and therefore the need to compromise to survive. Even when endowed with extra abilities, these characters are forced to experience unprecedented physical, mental, and emotional distress and exclusion to ensure a minimal degree of agency and to prevent humanity from achieving self-destruction. In many stories, their acts of courage become acts of understanding, and in some cases, love, as they reach a crucial compromise with those in power. Ultimately, Butler's focus on disenfranchised characters serves to illustrate both the historical exploitation of minorities and how the resolve of one such exploited individual may bring on critical change.|$|E
500|$|Over the 20th century, Virginia {{shifted from}} a largely rural, {{politically}} Southern and conservative state {{to a more}} urbanized, pluralistic, and politically moderate environment. Up until the 1970s, Virginia was a racially divided one-party state dominated by the Byrd Organization. The legacy of slavery in the state effectively disfranchised African Americans until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s. Enfranchisement and immigration of other groups, especially Hispanics, have placed growing importance <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> voting, while voters that identify as [...] "white working-class" [...] declined by three percent between 2008 and 2012. Regional differences play a large part in Virginia politics. Rural southern and western areas moved to support the Republican Party in response to its [...] "southern strategy", while urban and growing suburban areas, including much of Northern Virginia, form the Democratic Party base. Democratic support also persists in union-influenced Roanoke in Southwest Virginia, college towns such as Charlottesville and Blacksburg, and the southeastern Black Belt Region.|$|E

500|$|In 1931, the Indian National Congress, at its Karachi session, {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} committing {{itself to the}} defence of civil rights and economic freedom, with the stated objectives of {{putting an end to}} exploitation, providing social security and implementing land reforms. Other new rights proposed by the resolution were the prohibition of State titles, universal adult franchise, abolition of capital punishment and freedom of movement. Drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru, the resolution, which later formed the basis for some of the Directive Principles, placed the primary responsibility of carrying out social reform on the State, and marked the increasing influence of socialism and Gandhian philosophy on the independence movement. The final phase of the Independence movement saw a reiteration of the socialist principles of the 1930s, along with an increased focus <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> rights– which had become an issue of major political concern by then– which were published in the Sapru Report in 1945. The report, apart from stressing on protecting the rights of minorities, also sought to prescribe a [...] "standard of conduct for the legislatures, government and the courts".|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor was {{involved}} in the high-profile case Ricci v. DeStefano [...] that initially upheld the right of the City of New Haven to throw out its test for firefighters and start over with a new test, because the City believed the test had a [...] "disparate impact" [...] <b>on</b> <b>minority</b> firefighters. (No black firefighters qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under tests used in previous years.) The City was concerned that minority firefighters might sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The City chose not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld the City's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has dyslexia and had put much extra effort into studying, sued the City of New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned summary order (not written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling. Sotomayor's former mentor José A. Cabranes, by now a fellow judge on the court, objected to this handling and requested that the court hear it en banc. Sotomayor voted with a 7–6 majority not to rehear it and a slightly expanded ruling was issued, but a strong dissent by Cabranes led to the case reaching the Supreme Court in 2009. [...] There it was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the white firefighters had been victims of racial discrimination when they were denied promotion.|$|E
