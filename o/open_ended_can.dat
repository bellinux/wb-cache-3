40|$|Covariant field {{equations}} of M-fivebrane in eleven dimensional curved superspace {{are obtained}} from the requirement of κ-symmetry of an <b>open</b> supermembrane <b>ending</b> on a fivebrane. The worldvolume of {{the latter is a}} (6 | 16) dimensional supermanifold embedded in the (11 | 32) dimensional target superspace. The κ-symmetry of the system imposes a constraint on this embedding, and a constraint on a modified super 3 -form field strength on the fivebrane worldvolume.

40|$|Both {{banks and}} <b>open</b> <b>end</b> real estate funds eﬀectuate {{liquidity}} transformation in large amounts and high scales. Because of this similarity the latter should be analyzed {{using the same}} methodologies as usually applied for banks. We show that {{the work in the}} tradition of Diamond and Dybvig (1983), especially Allen and Gale (1998) and Diamond and Rajan (2001), provides an applicable theoretical framework. We used this as the basis for our model for <b>open</b> <b>end</b> real estate funds. We then examined the usefulness of the modeling structure in analyzing <b>open</b> <b>end</b> real estate funds. First, we could show that withdrawing of capital resulting in a run is not always ineﬃcient. Instead, withdrawing can as well be referred to the situation where the low return of an <b>open</b> <b>end</b> fund unit in comparison to other opportunities makes, (partial) withdrawal viewed from the risk-sharing perspective optimal. Even with costly liquidation, this result will hold, though we will have deadweight losses in such a situation. Second, introducing a secondary market in our model does, not in general, resolve the problem of deadweight losses associated with foreclosure. If assets are sold during a run, we do not only have a transfer of value but it can also create an economic cost. Because funds are forced to liquidate the illiquid asset in order to fulﬁll their obligations, the price of the real estate asset is forced down making the crisis worse. Rather than providing insurance, such that investors receive a transfer in negative outcomes, the secondary market does the opposite. It provides a negative insurance instead. Third, our model proves that the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> structure provides a monitoring function which serves as an eﬃcient instrument to discipline the funds management. Therefore, we argue that an <b>open</b> <b>end</b> structure <b>can</b> represent a more adequate solution to securitize real estate or other illiquid assets. Instead of transforming <b>open</b> <b>end</b> in closed end structures, fund runs should be accepted as a normal phenomenon to clear the market from funds with mismanagement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Microstrip parallel-coupled filters with {{generalized}} Chebyshev {{responses are}} presented. The basic {{structure of the}} proposed filter is a conventional parallel-coupled filter of which the physical dimensions can be easily obtained by the well-known analytical method. With {{the aid of the}} equivalent circuit corre-sponding to a conventional parallel-coupled filter, the relative insertion phase from source or load to each <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of resonators <b>can</b> be easily obtained by observing the two-port admittance ma-trix. Applying the cross coupling from source or load to a proper nonadjacent resonator, a trisection or a quadruplet coupling scheme can be realized with prescribed transmission zeros. More importantly, the proposed trisection can be designed to have a transmission zero on the lower or upper stopband by just ad-justing the length of the cross-coupling strip. Using the proposed structure, the conventional time-consuming adjusting procedure to obtain initial physical dimensions of filters is no longer required. In this paper, a fourth-order parallel-coupled filter is used as the basic structure to demonstrate various combinations of transmis-sion zeros. Simulated and measured results are well matched.
