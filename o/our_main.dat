2500|$|The {{earliest}} Talmud commentaries {{were written}} by the Geonim ( [...] 800 - 1000, CE) in Babylonia. Although some direct commentaries on particular treatises are extant, <b>our</b> <b>main</b> knowledge of Gaonic era Talmud scholarship comes from statements embedded in Geonic responsa that shed light on Talmudic passages: these are arranged {{in the order of}} the Talmud in Levin's Otzar ha-Geonim. Also important are practical abridgments of Jewish law such as Yehudai Gaon's Halachot Pesukot, Achai Gaon's Sheeltot and Simeon Kayyara's Halachot Gedolot. After the death of Hai Gaon, however, the center of Talmud scholarship shifts to Europe and North Africa.|$|E
