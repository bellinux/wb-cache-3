40|$|In this study, a {{nonlinear}} blind channel equalization {{is implemented}} {{by using a}} Modified Fuzzy C-Means (MFCM) algorithm. The proposed MFCM searches the optimal channel <b>output</b> <b>states</b> of a nonlinear channel from the received symbols, based on the Bayesian likelihood fitness function instead of a conventional Euclidean distance measure. In its searching procedure, all of the possible desired channel states are constructed by the combinations of estimated channel <b>output</b> <b>states.</b> The desired state with the maximum Bayesian fitness is selected and placed {{at the center of}} a Radial Basis Function (RBF) equalizer to reconstruct transmitted symbols. In the simulations, binary signals are generated at random with Gaussian noise.

40|$|Potential {{features}} of quantum computation could explain enigmatic aspects of con-sciousness. The Penrose{Hamero model (orchestrated objective reduction: ‘Orch OR’) suggests that quantum superposition and {{a form of}} quantum computation occur in microtubules|cylindrical protein lattices of the cell cytoskeleton within the brain’s neurons. Microtubules couple to and regulate neural-level synaptic functions, {{and they may be}} ideal quantum computers because of dynamical lattice structure, quantum-level subunit states and intermittent isolation from environmental inter-actions. In addition to its biological setting, the Orch OR proposal diers in an essential way from technologically envisioned quantum computers in which collapse, or reduction to classical <b>output</b> <b>states,</b> is caused by environmental decoherence (hence introducing randomness). In the Orch OR proposal, reduction of microtubule quan-tum superposition to classical <b>output</b> <b>states</b> occurs by an objective factor|Roger Penrose’s quantum gravity threshold stemming from instability in Planck-scale sep-arations (superpositions) in spacetime geometry. <b>Output</b> <b>states</b> following Penrose’s objective reduction are neither totally deterministic nor random, but influenced by a non-computable factor ingrained in fundamental spacetime.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of general nonclassical two-mode Gaussian states at {{a beam splitter}} is investigated. Single-mode nonclassicality as well as two-mode entanglement of both input and <b>output</b> <b>states</b> are analyzed suggesting their suitable quantifiers. These quantifiers are derived from local and global invariants of linear unitary two-mode transformations such that the sum of input (or output) local nonclassicality measures and entanglement measure gives a global invariant. This invariant quantifies the global nonclassicality resource. Mutual transformations of local nonclassicalities and entanglement induced by the beam splitter are analyzed considering incident noisy twin beams, single-mode noisy squeezed vacuum states, and states encompassing both squeezed states and twin beams. A rich tapestry of interesting nonclassical <b>output</b> <b>states</b> is predicted. Comment: 16 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
