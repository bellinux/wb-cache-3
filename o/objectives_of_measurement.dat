40|$|Financial {{turbulence}} is {{a phenomenon}} occurring in anti - persistent markets. In contrast, financial crises occur in persistent markets. A relationship can be established between these two extreme phenomena of long term market dependence and the older financial concept of financial (il-) liquidity. The measurement {{of the degree of}} market persistence and the measurement of the degree of market liquidity are related. To accomplish the two research <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and simulation of different degrees of financial liquidity, I propose to boldly reformulate and reinterpret the classical laws of fluid mechanics into cash flow mechanics. At first this approach may appear contrived and artificial, but the end results of these reformulations and reinterpretations are useful quantifiable financial quantities, which will assist us with the measurement, analysis and proper characterization of modern dynamic financial markets in ways that classical comparative static financial - economic analyses do not allow.

40|$|In broad terms, {{effective}} probability {{modeling of}} modern measurement requires {{the development of}} (usually parametric) distributions for increasingly complex multivariate outcomes driven by the physical realities of particular measurement technologies. “Differences” between measures of distribution center and truth function as “bias. ” Model features that allow hierarchical compounding of variation function to describe “variance components” like “repeatability,” “reproducibility,” “batch-to-batch variation,” etc. Mixture features in models allow for description (and subsequent downweighting) of outliers. For {{a variety of reasons}} (including high-dimensionality of parameter spaces relative to typical sample sizes, the ability to directly include “Type B” considerations in assessing uncertainty, and the relatively direct path to uncertainty quantification for the real <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement),</b> Bayesian methods of inference in these models are increasingly natural and arguably almost essential. We illustrate the above points first in an overly simple but instructive example. We then provide a set of formalisms for expressing these notions. Then we illustrate them with real modern measurement applications including (1) determination of cubic crystal orientation via electron backscatter diffraction, (2) determination of particle size distribution through sieving, and (3) analysis of theoretically monotone functional responses from thermogravimetric analysis in a materials study...|$|E
40|$|This study emphasises {{the fact}} that the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the {{financial}} statements are not compatible with the principles that establish measurement in the social sciences, and that they therefore cannot be considered to be <b>measurement</b> <b>objectives.</b> The concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> presupposes the comprehension of the principal state and consequently the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> a <b>measurement</b> discipline only make measurement sense {{in the presence of a}} theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in which they are contained. Currently, accounting is considered to be a measurement discipline with complete measurement objectives, even in the absence <b>of</b> a <b>measurement</b> theory that incorporates the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the <b>measurement</b> process. In this study the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> (a theory that establishes measurement in the social sciences) are used to emphasise that the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the financial statements are not measurement objectives unless they are supported by a theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> Hence the financial statements cannot contain measurement information until a theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is established that incorporates the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the accounting <b>measurement</b> processes.

40|$|Information {{generated}} using {{outcome measures}} {{to measure the}} effectiveness of palliative care interventions is potentially invaluable. Depending on the measurement tool employed {{the results can be}} used to monitor clinical care, carry out comparative research, provide audit data or inform purchas-ing decisions. However, the data collected can only ever be as good as the method used to obtain them. This review aimed to systematically identify and examine outcome measures that have been used, or proposed for use in the clinical audit of palliative care of patients with advanced cancer. Database searches were performed using MEDLINE (1991 - 1995), CANCERLIT (1991 - 1995), Healthplan (1985 - 1995), and 'Onco-link ' on the Internet. Further measures were located with the assistance of other professionals working in palliative care. The criteria for the inclusion and assessment of measures were a measure assessing more than one domain and a target population of advanced disease or palliative care. Forty-one measures were identified, 12 of which satisfied the inclusion criteria. These contained between five and 56 items and covered aspects of physical, psychological and spiritual domains. Each measure meets some but not all of the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in palliative care, and fulfils some but not all of our criteria for validity, reliability, responsiveness and appropriateness...|$|E
40|$|To {{anticipate}} the likely market demand better {{and identify the}} best customers to target with potential new products early in their development, concept tests need to provide adequate data quality for the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> Generalisability theory provides a framework where a generalisability study can be conducted to identify each possible aspect of a measurement as a factor {{that may be a}} potential source of variability. When a limited budget is available, optimising measurement designs involves a trade-off between the accuracy of the data (i. e. generalisability coefficients) and cost considerations. Building on previous and ongoing research, this study presents a multivariate optimisation procedure to achieve the most cost-efficient measurement design under the pre-specified generalisability coefficient constraint. We used the available online concept testing data to illustrate how to optimise the measurement cost by sampling along the facets that contribute to the total error variance in different iso-generalisability designs. The findings may help to facilitate decision making for the sampling of respondents, concepts, items, and occasions in the design of concept test. However, the optimisation framework may be applied more generally to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of other customer tests in marketing. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd...|$|E
