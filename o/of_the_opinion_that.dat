40|$|ABSTRACT: Prediction {{markets have}} {{captured}} the public’s imagination with their ability {{to predict the future}} by pooling <b>the</b> guesswork <b>of</b> many. This paper summarizes the evidence and examines the economic, mathematical, and neurological foundations of this form of collective wisdom. Rather than the particular trading mechanism used, <b>the</b> ultimate driver <b>of</b> accuracy seems to be the betting proposition itself: on the one hand, a wager attracts contrarians, which enhances <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> <b>opinions</b> <b>that</b> can be aggregated. On the other hand, <b>the</b> mere prospect <b>of</b> reward or loss promotes more objective, less passionate thinking, thereby enhancing <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinions</b> <b>that</b> can be aggregated. ...|$|R
5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ron Chernow is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> his frustrations {{in dealing}} with {{government}} officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results; other historians tend to ascribe Washington's position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service. He developed a very negative idea {{of the value of}} militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars. On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1,000 men and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations that he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton, and Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A.

Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and family ties would suggest.

Instead, {{it is most}} likely that he moved to that country {{with the belief that}} Serbia's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities.

5|$|The three recent {{treatments}} (Henderson and coauthors, Glassman, and Govaerts and Dransfield) recognised a {{total of}} 73 species, but only 20 species are accepted by all of them.

For example, what Andrew Henderson considered a single species, Attalea attaleoides, other authors have considered a species complex consisting {{of four or five}} species. Glassman doubted the validity of A.attaleoides as a species, and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A.attaleoides—A.camopiensis, A.degranvillei, A.guianensis and A.maripensis. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted both Glassman's four species and A.attaleoides. However, Jean-Christophe Pintaud was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> A.guianensis, A.maripensis and A.attaleoides were all very similar, and thought it likely that they all represented the same species.|$|E

Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns.

There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.
