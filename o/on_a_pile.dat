5|$|Despite {{the shock}} of the Western public, the {{practice}} of Vietnamese monks self-immolating was not unprecedented. Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The French colonial authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Huế in the 1920s, but he managed to starve himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of Harbin in 1948 when a monk seated down in the lotus position <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of sawdust and soybean oil and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the communists of Mao Zedong. His heart remained intact, as did that of Đức.|$|E

500|$|In {{choosing}} an [...] "English" [...] over a Classical setting, Gray provided {{a model for}} later poets wishing to describe England and the English countryside {{during the second half}} of the 18th century. [...] Once Gray had set the example, any occasion would do to give a sense of the effects of time in a landscape, as for instance in the passage of the seasons as described in John Scott’s Four Elegies, descriptive and moral (1757). Other imitations, though avoiding overt verbal parallels, chose similar backgrounds to signal their parentage. One favourite theme was a meditation among ruins, such as John Langhorne's “Written among the ruins of Pontefract Castle” (1756), Edward Moore’s “An elegy, written among the ruins of a nobleman's seat in Cornwall” (1756) and John Cunningham’s “An elegy <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of ruins" [...] (1761). Gray’s friend William Mason chose an actual churchyard in South Wales for his “Elegy VI” (1787), adding a reference to the poet in the text. He also provided a final note explaining that the poem was written “to make it appear a day scene, and as such to contrast it with the twilight scene of my excellent Friend’s Elegy”.|$|E

2500|$|Russell's {{measurements}} were 38D-24-36, {{and she stood}} 5ft 7 in (97-61-91cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most of her contemporaries.

[...] Physician Constantin Dimitrescu-Severeanu, who visited his home, records that Bonifaciu and wife slept <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of hay, and that Florescu looked like [...] "he never washed his face more than thrice a year." [...] Florescu was a heavy drinker and smoker, and, according to another one-time student, Constantin Kirițescu, only seemed at ease in coffeehouses and bars; he despised Saint Sava and, with time, only showed up for that work because it paid a salary. According to Dr. Severeanu, he borrowed money from both friends and students, promising that they were for him to write a new book. Longinescu additionally claims that Florescu was [...] "unusually cultured, but lacked common sense", and so the victim of [...] "countless student pranks". Among the students who remained loyal to Florescu was the poet Iuliu Cezar Săvescu, who, in 1886, also {{became a member of}} Macedonski's circle.|$|E
