In her debut match against reigning champions New South Wales, Nitschke made a solitary run before being run out as South Australia lost by seven wickets. At this stage of her career, Nitschke was effectively a specialist batsman, and she took her only wicket of the season on the following day, taking 1/9 from three overs—the only time she bowled during the season—and scoring five as New South Wales won again. Nitschke did not pass 15 until the sixth match of the season, scoring 43 to help guide South Australia to a six-wicket win over Queensland. She ended the season with 79 runs at 9.87.|$|E

According to Frederick Burwick, during its sixteen-year operation, the Gallery reflected the transition from Neoclassicism to Romanticism. Works by artists such as James Northcote represent the conservative, neoclassical elements of the gallery, while those of Henry Fuseli represent the newly emerging Romantic movement. William Hazlitt praised Northcote in an essay entitled [...] "On the <b>Old</b> <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Artists", writing [...] "I conceive any person would be more struck with Mr. Fuseli at first sight, but would wish to visit Mr. Northcote oftener." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{regional}} economic conditions changed. The Delaware and Hudson Canal Company had closed, as had local logging and mining companies. Shohola and Barryville had become summer resorts and the now-aging antique bridge had become a local picturesque attraction for out-of-town visitors. On June 26, 1920, the suspension bridge was bought by the Joint Bridge Commission of Pennsylvania and New York for $22,600.00 (1923 USD ($ in [...] )). Half of the $22,600.00 was to be paid for by the state of New York, the other by Pennsylvania. The toll that was used on the span was removed. The single-lane, aging structure, now owned by the commission, served the local residents well into the new century. However, the <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the bridge showed on the bridge itself. In 1939, the commission closed off the structurally deficient bridge to traffic, and began looking into ways to build a new bridge in the area. In 1940, the bridge was reopened for light, local car traffic. but demolished in 1941, when the fourth and then-newest span of the bridge was opened.|$|E

They left Bethel, and before {{they had come to}} Ephrath, Rachel went into a difficult labor. The midwife told her not to fear not, for this child would also be a son for her. And just before Rachel died, she named her son Ben-oni, but Jacob called him Benjamin. They buried Rachel on the road to Ephrath at Bethlehem, and Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. And Israel journeyed beyond Migdal-eder. While Israel dwelt in that land, Reuben lay with Jacob's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it.

[...] A last minute visit to a doctor has tired him {{so much that it}} is decided that he should not go back to the villa outside Palermo, but shall stay in a hotel inside the city itself.

He was initially included in the team as a wicket-keeper, coming in either sixth or seventh in the batting order, but later in his career was sometimes used as a specialist batsman, with either McChesney Simon or Ridley Jacobs taking the gloves. Harris began his first-class career with scores of 49 on debut against Trinidad and Tobago, and 52 runs in the next match against the Windward Islands. [...] During the 1989–90 Red Stripe Cup, he scored 250 runs from five matches, placing him eighth in the competition for runs and behind only Richie Richardson for the Leewards. Harris did lead the Leewards' run-scoring during the 1991–92 season, scoring 291 runs including a career-best 98 against Guyana. His career, which concluded after the 1992–93 season, included eleven first-class half-centuries and a single limited-overs half-century, an innings of 62 against Jamaica. Harris played as a wicket-keeper in all but eight of his first-class matches, and all but six of his List A matches.|$|E
2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85.

I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist.

Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but I do remember we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it. Yeah the flexi disc for white dwarf was an odd one, John Blanche, the art editor painted our first cover so it all came about quite easy, it does sound shockingly bad though." ...|$|E
