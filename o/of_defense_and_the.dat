5|$|No African American {{was awarded}} a Medal of Honor either during World War II or {{immediately}} afterwards {{with respect to their}} actions during that conflict. This changed in 1992 when a study conducted by Shaw University and commissioned by the U.S. Dept. <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States Army asserted that systematic racial discrimination had been present in the criteria for awarding medals during the war. After an exhaustive review of files the study recommended that several of the Distinguished Service Crosses awarded to African Americans be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, more than fifty {{years after the end of}} the war, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans. Vernon Baker was the only living recipient—the other six men had been killed in action or died in the intervening years.|$|E
