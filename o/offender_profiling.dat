25|$|David G. Meirhofer (June 8, 1949 – September 29, 1974) was an American {{serial killer}} who {{committed}} four murders in rural Montana between 1967 and 1974 — {{three of them}} children. At the time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was developing a new method of tracking killers called <b>offender</b> <b>profiling,</b> and Meirhofer was the first serial killer to be investigated using the technique. <b>Offender</b> <b>profiling</b> is a method used to learn clues about the characteristics of an unknown killer from evidence {{at the scene of}} the crime and establish their behavioural patterns before they reach the height of their criminality.|$|E

For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to eyewitness testimony and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of Law and Human Behavior, the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research {{and move on to}} other areas.|$|E
25|$|Red Dragon is Thomas Harris's second novel, after Black Sunday. As {{part of his}} {{research}} for the book he attended classes and talked to agents at the FBI Behavioral Science Unit in Quantico, Virginia, during the late 1970s.

After his father became terminally ill, Harris stayed for eighteen months at an isolated shotgun-style house where he worked on the book. The rural setting helped him visualize both the character of Hannibal Lecter and the Leeds murder house depicted in the story. The book is dedicated to his father.|$|E

Central Television challenged the ruling by the Home Office to ban the interview from public screening; citing sections of the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, and that full permission to conduct an interview with Nilsen had been granted in advance. The decision not to ban the interview from public screening was made on 26 January 1993, and the interview was screened in full that evening.|$|E

50|$|<b>Offender</b> <b>profiling,</b> {{also known}} as {{criminal}} profiling, is an investigative tool used by law enforcement agencies to identify likely suspects (descriptive <b>offender</b> <b>profiling)</b> and analyze patterns that may predict future offenses and/or victims (predictive <b>offender</b> <b>profiling).</b> <b>Offender</b> <b>profiling</b> dates back to 1888 and the spree of Jack the Ripper, and the profiling theory describes how profiling will ideally work. Current applications include predictive profiling, sexual assault <b>offender</b> <b>profiling,</b> and case linkage (using profiling to identify common factors in offenses and to help with suspect identification).|$|E

40|$|Objectives:This article {{analyzes}} the criminal development and sociodemographic and criminal {{profile of a}} sample of prosecuted white-collar offenders. It identifies trajectory groups and describes their profiles based on crime, sociodemographic, and selection offence characteristics. Methods:The criminal development of 644 prosecuted white-collar offenders in the Netherlands was examined using all registered offences from age 12 onward. In addition, sociodemographic background information was gathered from the Netherlands Internal Revenue Service and Municipal Personal Records Office. Trajectory analysis was conducted to approximate the underlying continuous distribution in criminal development by a discrete number of groups. Results:The criminal career characteristics and sociodemographic profile show a heterogeneous sample of white-collar offenders. Trajectory analysis distinguished four trajectory groups. Two low-frequency offender groups, totaling 78 percent, are characterized by their adult onset. The two high-frequency offender groups, totaling 22 percent, are characterized by their adolescent onset. Distinct and internally consistent <b>offender</b> <b>profiles</b> emerged for the four trajectory groups {{on the basis of}} crime, sociodemographic, and selection offence characteristics. Conclusions:The diversity in offence patterns and <b>offender</b> <b>profiles</b> points to different (developmental) causes for white-collar crime and underlines the importance of further longitudinal research on white-collar offending from an integrated white-collar and life-course perspective...|$|R
