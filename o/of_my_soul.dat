25|$|The Ashanti Akrafena (Sword <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>Soul)</b> was {{generally}} {{held in the}} hand by Ashanti Asafos. There was no real reason to hold it on their sides. However, they did strap it to their back at times when they were traveling through the rain-forest regions of Ashanti City-State or using other weapons such as spears and bows. The Ashanti sword was first and foremost one-handed, though for more powerful strikes, two hands were used. The Ashanti techniques were generally hand and a half.|$|E

The text is intensified by several melismas, a marking [...] "adagio" [...] on the words [...] "" [...] (most holy Lamb of God), and by melodic parts for the instruments.

[...] He believed that his actions were justifiable because he had undertaken them in his duty as schoolteacher. He portrayed himself as a victim of public opinion, claiming that [...] "a mournful accident was swelled up into a bloody midnight murder, and how it has been brought about that my unfortunate name has been branded, not simply through the United Kingdom, but through the civilised world, {{as one of the most}} execrable monsters or of madmen." [...] He published a pamphlet arguing that Locock had perjured himself and had conspired with Fowler to influence the outcome of the trial.|$|E

He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process Time Team had been [...] "dumbed down", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained [...] "a lot of faffing about."

500|$|Now on foot, {{the knights}} drew swords and {{returned}} to battle, Le Gris again proving stronger than his opponent and slowly gaining the upper hand. After several minutes of engagement, Carrouges slipped and Le Gris was able to stab his rival through the right thigh. As the crowd gasped and murmured, Le Gris stepped back to view his opponent's injury and Carrouges desperately counter-attacked, wrestling Le Gris to the ground. Le Gris' heavy armour prevented him from regaining his feet and Carrouges repeatedly stabbed at his floored opponent, his blows denting but not puncturing the thick plate steel. Realising that his sword was inadequate, Carrouges straddled Le Gris and used the handle of his dagger to smash the lock holding Le Gris' faceplate in position. Even as his opponent struggled beneath him, Carrouges tore the plate off and demanded that Le Gris admit his guilt. Le Gris refused and cried out [...] "In the name of God and on the peril and damnation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>soul,</b> I am innocent". Infuriated, Carrouges drove his dagger through Le Gris' neck, killing him instantly.|$|E

[...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{composition}} began accumulating cover versions {{almost immediately}} {{after the release of}} Abbey Road. In addition to Joe Cocker, Peggy Lee and Tony Bennett each issued recordings of the song at the end of 1969. Lena Horne recorded [...] "Something" [...] in the jazz style for her 1970 album with guitarist Gabor Szabo, titled Lena & Gabor. An instrumental version by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, from their Abbey Road tribute album McLemore Avenue, peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1970. Other artists who released covers of the song that year include Della Reese, Perry Como, Duane Eddy, the Ray Conniff Singers, Jerry Butler, Johnny Mathis, Engelbert Humperdinck, Isaac Hayes, King Curtis, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas and the Shadows. Ray Charles issued his version on the album Volcanic Action <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Soul</b> in 1971, the same year that recordings appeared by Andy Williams and Junior Walker & the All Stars, while Buddy Rich, Blue Mink and Ike & Tina Turner were among the acts who covered it in 1972. Referring to the song's popularity among easy-listening artists, Harrison later said: [...] "When even Liberace covered it , you know that it's one of them that ends up in an elevator..." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{his horse}} faltered and collapsed, Le Gris was thrown off {{and lost his}} axe. Undaunted, he rose and drew his longsword, turning to meet Carrouges who was already {{advancing}} on him, sword also drawn. Again the combatants traded blows, their weapons the only sounds heard in the silent battleground. Again, Le Gris' superior strength gave him an advantage, pushing Carrouges back before thrusting his blade through his opponent's thigh. As the crowd murmured, Le Gris made a fatal mistake; withdrawing his weapon, he stepped back to watch his wounded enemy and was thus off balance when the desperate Carrouges threw himself forwards, wrestling Le Gris {{to the ground and}} hacking at him with his own longsword. Although Le Gris' plate armour was too thick to allow Carrouges' weapon to penetrate, it was also so heavy that he could not regain his feet with Carrouges on top of him. Stranded on the ground, Le Gris struggled as Carrouges straddled him and used his sword to smash open the lock on Le Gris' faceplate. As the crowd watched in silence, Carrouges shouted in Le Gris' exposed face for him to confess his crime before death or face hell. Le Gris replied so all could hear, [...] "In the name of God, and on the peril and damnation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>soul,</b> I am innocent of the crime". Enraged, Carrouges drew his misericordia and thrust it through Le Gris' throat, killing him instantly.|$|E
