5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through the top <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E
5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses offer many {{possibilities}} in biological research, including {{their ability to}} regenerate limbs, change the colour <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> behave intelligently with a distributed nervous system, and make use of 168 kinds of protocadherins (humans have 58), the proteins that guide the connections neurons make with each other. The California two-spot octopus has had its genome sequenced, allowing exploration of its molecular adaptations. Having independently evolved mammal-like intelligence, octopuses have been compared to hypothetical intelligent extraterrestrials. Their problem-solving skills, along with their mobility and lack of rigid structure enable them to escape from supposedly secure tanks in laboratories and public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|The line Ashes, Ashes {{in colonial}} {{versions}} of the rhyme is claimed to refer variously to cremation of the bodies, the burning of victims' houses, or blackening <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> and the theory has been adapted {{to be applied to}} other {{versions of the}} rhyme. In its various forms, the interpretation has entered into popular culture and has been used elsewhere to make oblique reference to the plague.|$|E
5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E

25|$|The serpent {{was a very}} {{important}} social and religious symbol, revered by the Maya. Maya mythology describes serpents as being the vehicles by which celestial bodies, such as the sun and stars, cross the heavens. The shedding <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> made them a symbol of rebirth and renewal.|$|E
25|$|Melatonin {{was first}} {{discovered}} in {{connection to the}} mechanism by which some amphibians and reptiles change the color <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> As early as 1917, Carey Pratt McCord and Floyd P. Allen discovered that feeding extract of the pineal glands of cows lightened tadpole skin by contracting the dark epidermal melanophores.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the Great Depression until the {{formation}} of the New Zealand Rabbit Board in 1954, rabbits became a major pest in the area, and rabbiters were employed to keep the creatures under control. The trapping of rabbits and auctioning <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> in Dunedin became a minor but important part of the Catlins area's economy during this time.|$|R
50|$|Mantella is a genus {{of frogs}} {{in the family}} Mantellidae, endemic to Madagascar. These are small frogs {{typically}} reaching 2 - 3 cm, with iridescent colors with combinations of black, blue, orange, yellow, and green which reflect the toxic nature <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skins.</b> Several species in the genus are threatened because of habitat loss and over-collection for the international pet trade.|$|R
60|$|The Inquisitors {{remained}} firm a while, but {{the danger}} was increasing hourly. In {{the end they}} submitted, for the sake <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skins,</b> and considering, no doubt, a later vengeance for this outrage upon their holy authority. But it was not done until faggots had been stacked against the Holy House, and the exasperated mob had threatened to burn them out of it.|$|R
25|$|The {{disease was}} first {{described}} in 1865 by Armand Trousseau {{in a report}} on diabetes in patients presenting with a bronze pigmentation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> Trousseau did not associate diabetes with iron accumulation; the recognition that infiltration of the pancreas with iron might disrupt endocrine function resulting in diabetes was made by Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1890.|$|E
25|$|Cuttlefish {{are also}} able to change the texture <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> The skin {{contains}} bands of circular muscle which as they contract, push fluid up. These {{can be seen as}} little spikes, bumps or flat blades. This can help with camouflage when the cuttlefish becomes visually similar to objects in its environment such as kelp or rocks.|$|E
25|$|Although melanin {{is found}} in the skin of many species, in the reptiles, the amphibians, and fish, the {{epidermis}} is often relatively colourless. Instead, the colour of the skin is largely due to chromatophores in the dermis, which, in addition to melanin, may contain guanine or carotenoid pigments. Many species, such as chameleons and flounders may be able to change the colour <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> by adjusting the relative size of their chromatophores.|$|E
50|$|The book {{is about}} a {{scientist}} who becomes genetically modified, allowing her to live among a species of intelligent alien that lives in the treetops and communicates by changing the color and pattern <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skins.</b> Over {{the course of the}} book she comes to see herself as one of them. The book focuses on the biology of the planet and the life cycle of the aliens and contains environmentalist themes.|$|R
50|$|Other {{instances}} of ancient roots in taxidermy date {{as far back}} as five centuries B.C. in the record of the African explorations of Hanno the Carthaginian. Within the past five centuries, an account is given of the discovery of what were evidently gorillas and the subsequent preservation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skins,</b> which were hung in the temple of Astarte where they remained until the taking of Carthage in the year 146 B.C.|$|R

25|$|In his Baseball Hall of Fame {{induction}} {{speech in}} 1966, Ted Williams {{made a strong}} plea for inclusion of Negro league stars in the Hall. After the publication of Robert Peterson's landmark book Only the Ball was White in 1970, the Hall of Fame found itself under renewed pressure {{to find a way}} to honor Negro league players who would have been in the Hall had they not been barred from the major leagues due to the color <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stereotypes can be {{a source}} of {{heuristic}} attributes. In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> So if the subject has a stereotype about the relative intelligence of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Some populations who had diets rich in vitamin D {{were less}} {{affected}} by the evolutionary selection for light skin. Vitamin D3 is available in low quantities in fish and liver. Populations who lived in coastal areas or areas with access to abundant sources to seafood could get their proportion of vitamin D from food. Some Arctic populations, such as the Inuit, could retain some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> pigmentation in areas of low UV radiation. In the winter they receive high levels of UV radiation as reflection from the snow, and their relatively darker skin protects them from the sunlight.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{presence}} of β-carbolines in the cuticle <b>of</b> scorpions, <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> is known to fluoresce when exposed to certain wavelengths of ultraviolet light such as that produced by a blacklight.|$|R
50|$|Of {{these three}} cats, the tiger {{is the only}} {{endangered}} species. The primary reason for the steady population decline of the tiger is human activity. Tigers are threatened by illegal trade <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> {{and the destruction of}} forests. For years, it has been claimed that there are about 500 wild tigers in Thailand. Recent studies, however, indicate that the number is closer to 150. To make things worse, in Burma, hunting tigers in the wild is still legal.|$|R

25|$|The skin of {{children}} becomes darker {{as they go}} through puberty and experience the effects of sex hormones. This darkening is especially noticeable in {{the skin of the}} nipples, the areola of the nipples, the labia majora in females, and the scrotum in males. In some people, the armpits become slightly darker during puberty. The interaction of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors on skin coloration with age is still not adequately understood, but it is known that men are at their darkest baseline skin color around the age of 30, without considering the effects of tanning. Around the same age, women experience darkening of some areas <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{the removal}} of the flag, the NAACP {{announced}} the end of its boycott of South Carolina. This action marks the end of a fifteen year long boycott of the state. The initiation of the boycott began in 2000, when the Confederate Flag was moved from atop the State House to a Confederate memorial {{on the grounds of the}} Capitol. A motion to remove the boycott by the NAACP was called shortly after state legislation voted to remove the flag from the Capitol grounds. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks celebrated the state's decision, commenting that the action would make South Carolina more welcoming for all people regardless <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> color.|$|E
25|$|The {{style in}} which Bouguereau chooses {{to paint the}} {{children}} is articulated and meaningful. Their white flesh is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love {{through the use of}} pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story. By not using pink and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> The painting doesn’t strike the viewer but is a rest for the eyes.|$|E

60|$|Turkeys abounded. These they {{generally}} obtained by shooting them at night, as they roosted in the trees; but they sometimes hunted them by day, Bathalda imitating their call so accurately {{that they came}} up within easy shot of them, without the least suspicion of danger. They killed several small bears, which were useful, not only for their flesh, but for the warmth <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> at night. Once or twice they shot deer, and obtained other game in abundance.|$|R
