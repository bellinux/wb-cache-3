500|$|In {{addition}} to providing security, Zahir and his local deputies adopted a policy of aiding the peasants cultivate and harvest their farmlands to further guarantee the steady supply of agricultural products for export. These benefits included loans to peasants {{and the distribution of}} free seeds. Financial burdens on the peasants were also reduced as Zahir offered tax relief during drought seasons or when the harvest seasons were poor. This same tax relief was extended to newcomers who sought to begin cultivating new farmlands. Moreover, Zahir assumed responsibility for <b>outstanding</b> <b>payments</b> the peasants owed to merchants from credit-based transactions if the merchants could provide proof of unsatisfactory payment. According to historian Thomas Philipp, Zahir [...] "had the good business sense not to exploit peasants to the point of destruction, but kept his financial demands to a more moderate level." [...] He regularly paid the Ottoman authorities their financial dues, ensuring a degree of stability in his relationship with the sultanate.|$|E

2500|$|While, by 1765, it {{was able}} to take in 324$861 réis in receipts, while {{expending}} 302$000 réis (a meager profit), by 1804 the situation had turned grave. The brotherhood of the Misericórdia {{sent a letter to the}} Crown, informing it of [...] "grave financial situation" [...] that existed in the Santa Casa, referring to corruption of the previous board. In their communique, the former brotherhood of not paying the expenses; of taking monies belonging to the Santa Casa; of embezzling moneys destined to it from a benefactor (José de Araújo Pereira, who had died in Rio de Janeiro in 1787, leaving behind 4000 cruzados); and of pocketing accumulated interest from these receipts. Upon receiving these charges, the Prince Regent ordered an inspection of the state of the finances of Santa Casa, sending in an administrator/auditor from the comarca of Viana do Castelo. It was only in 1807 when the review was officially begun into the accounts of the Misericórdia. The 1787 auditor, Bento Manuel Machado de Araújo, explained that he had taken 1200$000 from the benefactor, but had made all the necessary provisions. Regardless, the analysis by auditors between 1774 and 1804 revealed a debit of 1789$869 réis, but that the Misericórdia had not received 11553$949 in <b>outstanding</b> <b>payments.</b> This analysis only helped to confirm the decision of the Administrator General of the district of Viana do Castelo in 1838: a majority of the Misericórdias were badly administrated, resulting in the loss of funds, that was treated by their administration with little zeal. In 1839, the same administrator sent a financial commissioner to reform the bureaucracy, examine the errors and clean up the sloppiness in the Misericórdia of Valadares.|$|E

However the plans were put on hold after an Australian national, Santhanam, successfully appealed for a court injunction to stop the films release in September 2013. He claimed that Gemini Film Circuit had agreed to pay him a sum of six million rupees for his services of providing production facilities during the teams schedule in Australia, but had failed to make the payment. Under financial restraints, Gemini Film Circuits had also sold on the film to Vishals newly launched production studio, Vishal Film Factory, but failed to inform Vishal of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>payment</b> which had to be made to Santhanam.

5000|$|This {{represents}} a disadvantage for the selling party, which must wait to receive its money {{after it has}} {{lost control of the}} company. It is also dependent, if an earn-out is used, on the returned profits being increased significantly following the acquisition, in order for the deal to represent a gain to the seller in comparison to the situation pre-sale. This will usually only happen in very particular circumstances. The optimum structure would be to convert the earn-out to contracted deferred consideration which has compelling benefits for the seller as it legally fixes the total future amount paid to them. It's paid like a quarterly annuity, and then the seller needs to secure the annuity by taking out a deferred consideration surety guarantee from an independent surety institution. The direct beneficiary of the surety is the seller and should the sold firm become insolvent, following its sale, with any <b>outstanding</b> deferred <b>payments</b> due the seller, then the surety will pay the money to the vendor on the purchaser's behalf.|$|R
