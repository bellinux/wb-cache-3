5|$|A near-contemporary {{account of}} Æthelwig's life, or Vita, is {{included}} in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, the monastic chronicle for Evesham Abbey. This was a 13th-century work by Thomas of Marlborough, which was written to bolster the Evesham's case for exemption from the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Worcester, in whose diocese Evensham was. In order to do this, Thomas incorporated earlier works dealing with Evesham's history, including the work on Æthelwig. However, because of Thomas' purpose in composing the Chronicon, he probably altered some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> he included, and it appears that the life of Æthelwig was first incorporated into a complete history of the abbey and then that composit work was adapted by Thomas into his Chronicon. The main evidence for this is internal stylistic evidence, where the Æthelwig material is stylistic uniform with other material dating to prior to 1077, with information after 1077 forming a separate writing style.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost a}} century only a few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> were published. In 1875, the {{director}} of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, Rudolf Philippi, published the Santiago Staff, and Carroll (1892) published part of the Oar. Most texts remained beyond the reach of would-be decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published line drawings of almost all the known corpus in his Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift ("Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script") which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the CEIPP estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel's line drawings were not produced free-hand but copied from rubbings, which helped ensure their faithfulness to the originals.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} {{was reported in}} September in Courrier de l'Égypte, the official newspaper of the French expedition. The anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone might one day {{be the key to}} deciphering hieroglyphs. In 1800, three of the Commission's technical experts devised ways to make copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> on the stone. One of these experts was Jean-Joseph Marcel, a printer and gifted linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian Demotic script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than Syriac as had originally been thought. It was artist and inventor Nicolas-Jacques Conté who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription. A slightly different method was adopted by Antoine Galland. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General Charles Dugua. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them.|$|E
40|$|In some {{critical}} application areas, {{it is not}} allowed to modify <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> like military, legal and literature fields. Therefore, restoring <b>the</b> original contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> becomes a practical and important issue for text watermarking. This study aims to deal with this problem. We firstly present <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> reversible <b>text</b> watermarking and then bring forth an effective scheme to achieve reversible text watermarking. Based on the synonym substitution method, the proposed algorithm applies an invertible transform to embed watermark, extract watermark and recover <b>the</b> original contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> By using <b>the</b> reversible watermarking scheme, one can not only protect <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> but also get <b>the</b> original contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> if <b>the</b> receiver has the wish and right to revert <b>the</b> original contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> scheme improves the payload capacity via using high embedding level, compressing the watermark or repeating the algorithm more than one time...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined selecting text using {{a movement}} sequence of pointing and dragging. Experiment 1 showed that, in the Point-Drag sequence, the pointing time {{was related to}} the pointing distance but not to <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> to be selected; in contrast, pointing time was related to both the pointing distance and <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> in <b>the</b> Point-Click sequence. Experiment 2 demonstrated that both the pointing and dragging times for the Point-Drag sequence were sensitive to <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> that was selected. <b>The</b> discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results centers around <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> Fitts' Law to pointing and dragging in a point-drag sequence, proposing that the target for pointing is <b>the</b> leftmost edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> to be selected, and the target for dragging is <b>the</b> rightmost edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text...</b>|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts to decipher the rongorongo script of Easter Island since its discovery {{in the late nineteenth}} century. As with most undeciphered scripts, many of the proposals have been fanciful. Apart from a portion of one tablet which has been shown to deal with a lunar calendar, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> are understood, and even the calendar cannot actually be read. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment: the small number of remaining texts, comprising only 15,000 legible glyphs; the lack of context in which to interpret the texts, such as illustrations or parallels to texts which can be read; {{and the fact that the}} modern Rapanui language is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets—especially if they record a specialized register such as incantations—while the few remaining examples of the old language are heavily restricted in genre and may not correspond well to the tablets either.|$|E
5|$|How {{and when}} the Libellus {{eventually}} reached England is not clear. It is not known if the original letter ever reached Augustine, its intended recipient. Bede assumed that it had, though he is rather vague on specifics at this point. On the strength of Bede's word alone many later historians have claimed that the Libellus reached Augustine in a timely fashion; however, as mentioned above, recent scholarship has brought this assumption into serious question. In any event, some version of the letter {{seems to have been}} available in England by the late seventh century, for it was then that it was quoted by Theodore of Tarsus, Archbishop of Canterbury, in a series of judgments known today as the Paenitentiale Theodori. It is possible that Theodore found a copy of the Libellus already at Canterbury; however, given that no one in England previous to Theodore's archiepiscopacy seems to have known of the Libellus, it is equally plausible that the Libellus was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> that Theodore brought with him from Italy when he arrived in Canterbury in 669. It is known that Theodore brought numerous books with him from Italy, and {{that at least one of}} these books was a canon law collection very much like the one prepared at Bobbio some decades earlier (i.e. the Bobiensis). Elliot has speculated that Theodore introduced a Bobiensis-type collection to Canterbury in the second half of the seventh century, and thereby finally delivered the Libellus (as part of the Bobbiensis) to its originally intended destination. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that it was only shortly after Theodore's tenure at Canterbury that Anglo-Saxons begin to demonstrate knowledge of the Libellus.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either the language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> was not Polynesian, or that {{it was written in}} a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E
