[...] On the other, Chicago is more significant <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>haul,</b> to show the game's progression from the 1870s to 1900.

40|$|A {{very large}} segment of <b>the</b> <b>over</b> water, <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> {{passenger}} market, 31 % of the passengers who provide 42 % of the passenger revenue, offers a significant market for an advanced supersonic transport. This is for both the first class and full-fare economy passenger markets. The supersonic transport may be more competitive here in spite of lower costs of subsonic transports, as passenger preference is a more powerful variable than DOC. This latter fact was amply demonstrated in the late fifties when the jets completely replaced the reciprocating engine transports on most world routes, in spite of slightly higher fares...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{validity}} of uncovered interest-rate parity by constructing ultra-long time series that span two centuries. The forward-premium regressions yield positive slope estimates <b>over</b> <b>the</b> whole sample. The estimates become negative only when the sample {{is dominated by the}} period of 1980 s. We also find that large interest-rate differentials have significantly stronger forecasting powers for currency movements than small interest-rate differentials. Furthermore, when we regress domestic currency returns on foreign bonds against returns on domestic bonds as an alternative test of the parity condition, the null hypotheses of zero intercept and unit slope cannot be rejected in most cases. These results are consistent with a world in which expectations formation is highly imperfect and characterized on the one hand by slow adjustment of expectations to actual regime changes and on the other by anticipations for extended periods of regime changes or other big events that never materialize. An historical account of expected and realized regime changes adds credence to this explanation and illustrates how uncovered interest-rate parity holds <b>over</b> <b>the</b> very <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> but nevertheless can be deviated from {{over long periods of time}} due to ex post-expectation errors.

40|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity (UIP) {{is one of}} three key theoretical relations used in analytical work in both international finance and international monetary economics. The problem, however, is that UIP does not seem to hold up well empirically. In this paper, we argue that the failures of UIP that have been so widely documented are a coincidence of two empirical artifacts: (1) the unique sample period of the 1980 s and (2) the noise induced by small UIP deviations. We control for these empirical artifacts by constructing an ultra long time series that spans two centuries and by running regressions conditional on large deviations from UIP. We find that traditional regressions yield positive slope estimates <b>over</b> <b>the</b> whole sample period and become negative only when the sample is dominated by the period of 1980 s. We argue that the negative estimates during this sample period are mainly the result of a failure of expectations to adjust quickly to the regime changes in monetary policy that took place in both the United Kingdom and the United States. We also find that large {{interest rate}} differentials have significantly stronger forecasting powers for currency movements than small interest rate differentials. Finally, a historical account of expected and realized regime changes further illustrates how the expectation hypothesis holds <b>over</b> <b>the</b> very <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> but can b...|$|R

As Infocom began seeking out venture capital firms to invest in the company, the board decided that an actual CEO would be an asset in attracting investment and that an experienced project leader like Vezza would attract more confidence from firms than the younger game designers. As a result, Vezza was named CEO of the company and took on that role beginning in January 1984.|$|E
