5|$|At the {{entrance}} to the south transept is the <b>organ.</b> This is by Forster and Andrews, of Hull. This <b>organ</b> building company was formed by James Alderson Forster (1818–1886) and Joseph King Andrews (1820–1896). The business developed and {{became one of the most}} successful of the North of England <b>organ</b> builder. The business was taken over by John Christie in 1924 and finally wound up in 1956. As well as their Hull headquarters, the company had branches in London and York. The <b>organ</b> dates from 1885. It was a gift from Sir Pryse Pryse, Bt DL JP, of Gogerddan. The <b>organ</b> has a pine case, and painted pipes.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, <b>organ</b> {{builders}} {{began to}} build instruments in concert halls and other large secular venues, allowing the <b>organ</b> {{to be used as}} part of an orchestra, as in Saint-Saëns' Symphony No. 3. Frequently the <b>organ</b> is given a soloistic part, such as in Joseph Jongen's Symphonie Concertante for <b>Organ</b> & Orchestra, Francis Poulenc's Concerto for <b>Organ,</b> Strings and Tympani, and Frigyes Hidas' <b>Organ</b> Concerto.|$|E
5|$|<b>Organ</b> {{music was}} seldom {{written in the}} Classical era, as composers {{preferred}} the piano with its ability to create dynamics. In Germany, the six sonatas op. 65 of Felix Mendelssohn (published 1845) {{marked the beginning of}} a renewed interest in composing for the <b>organ.</b> Inspired by the newly built Cavaillé-Coll organs, the French organist-composers César Franck, Alexandre Guilmant and Charles-Marie Widor led <b>organ</b> music into the symphonic realm. The development of symphonic <b>organ</b> music continued with Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire. Widor and Vierne wrote large-scale, multi-movement works called <b>organ</b> symphonies that exploited the full possibilities of the symphonic <b>organ.</b> Max Reger and Sigfrid Karg-Elert's symphonic works made use of the abilities of the large Romantic organs being built in Germany at the time.|$|E

5|$|The chapel's <b>organ</b> has 7,897 {{pipes in}} 135 ranks and 109 stops. It was {{designed}} by Ernest M. Skinner and installed in 1928. Skinner invented the contra fagotto stop for the Princeton chapel <b>organ</b> {{in response to a}} request by Princeton's director of music. In 1990 the <b>organ</b> was dismantled and shipped to England for a major restoration by Mander Organs. Thomas Trotter gave the re-opening recital on the restored <b>organ</b> in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The <b>organ</b> {{that was}} {{installed}} in 1620 was destroyed by parliamentary soldiers in 1643. An <b>organ</b> built in 1662 was enlarged in 1786 and again in 1855. In 1909–10 an <b>organ</b> was built by Harrison & Harrison of Durham, with {{the best parts of}} the old <b>organ</b> retained. It has been serviced by the same company ever since.|$|E
5|$|The <b>organ</b> was {{originally}} marketed and {{sold by the}} Hammond <b>Organ</b> Company to churches as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven pipe <b>organ,</b> or instead of a piano. It quickly became popular with professional jazz musicians in <b>organ</b> trios, a small group centered on the Hammond <b>organ.</b> <b>Organ</b> trios were hired by jazz club owners, who found that <b>organ</b> trios were a much cheaper alternative to hiring a big band. Jimmy Smith's use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation of <b>organ</b> players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in rhythm and blues, rock, and reggae, {{as well as being}} an important instrument in progressive rock.|$|E

50|$|However, perennating <b>organs</b> {{need not}} be storage <b>organs.</b> After losing their leaves, {{deciduous}} trees grow them again from 'resting buds', which are the perennating <b>organs</b> of phanerophytes in the Raunkiær classification, but which do not specifically act as storage <b>organs.</b> Equally, storage <b>organs</b> {{need not be}} perennating <b>organs.</b> Many succulents have leaves adapted for water storage, which they retain in adverse conditions.|$|R

5|$|There is thus {{a causal}} chain which transmits {{information}} from a sense <b>organ</b> to an <b>organ</b> capable of making decisions, and onwards to a motor <b>organ.</b> In this respect, the model is analogous to a modern understanding of information processing such as in sensory-motor coupling.|$|E
5|$|A four-stop continuo <b>organ</b> {{was built}} for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based <b>organ</b> builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, {{contained}} {{in a case of}} dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415Hz and A=465Hz. Iit is also possible to tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the <b>organ</b> to the registration in use before it was depressed.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 A {{comparative}} study {{was made of}} the morphology and histology of three major groups of light <b>organs</b> in the genus Lampanyctus of the family Myctophidae for the species, L. leucopsarus, L. ritteri, L. nannochir, and L. regalis. The species can be divided according to their ranges in depth, the first two named above coming to surface waters at night, the other pair remaining at greater depths. The <b>organs</b> studied included complex <b>organs</b> on the trunk ("Schusselformigie" <b>organs)</b> and in the lower jaw (branchiostegal <b>organs),</b> and less specialized <b>organs</b> on the caudal peduncle (infra- and supracaudal <b>organs).</b> The morphology of the three groups was found to vary with species and depth, in size and form of the constituent elements, but otherwise supported and supplemented previous observations made for other genera of the family. The elements of the most complex <b>organs</b> ("Schusselformigie" <b>organs)</b> consisted of a lens, photogenic gland, vascular and connective tissue, and an inner scale and reflector backed by pigment. The lens and inner scale were lacking in the branchiostegal <b>organs.</b> The less specialized caudal <b>organs</b> consisted mainly of glandular tissue interspersed with blood vessels and connective tissue. Changes in morphology of the trunk <b>organs</b> of the deeper animals were found. Included were a marked decrease {{in the size of the}} <b>organs</b> in L. regalis and a lessening in amount of glandular tissue in L. nannochir. The most significant histological difference was the unusually large capillary bed found in the trunk <b>organs</b> and branchiostegal <b>organs</b> of L. nannochir which contrasts with a very sparse blood supply to these <b>organs</b> in L. regalis. However, the caudal <b>organs</b> of these species did not manifest this divergence in structure, suggesting a difference in function between the two groups of <b>organs.</b> This interpretation was supported somewhat by the observed difference in luminescence of the two groups. The branchiostegal and trunk <b>organs</b> produced a continuous low intensity luminescence while the caudal <b>organs</b> displayed a more brilliant intermittent flashing. An additional histological difference was the prolific supply of nerves to the caudal <b>organs</b> and the conspicuous lack of nerves to the complex trunk <b>organs.</b> Large nerve branches to the branchiostegal <b>organs,</b> however, did not support a correlation between intensity and character of light produced and the degree of innervation. A further study of physiological mechanisms controlling luminescence in these species is needed...|$|R

50|$|Tömösváry <b>organs,</b> {{also known}} as {{temporal}} <b>organs</b> or postanntennal <b>organs</b> are specialized paired sensory <b>organs</b> found in certain groups of myriapods (e.g. centipedes and millipedes) and hexapods (e.g. springtails), located on the head near {{the base of the}} antennae. Various function of Tömösváry <b>organs</b> have been proposed, including sensing vibration, humidity, or light, although evidence for their true function is conflicting, and in groups such as millipedes its true function is unknown.

50|$|The abdomen {{contains}} {{most of the}} tubelike <b>organs</b> of {{the digestive}} tract, {{as well as several}} solid <b>organs.</b> Hollow abdominal <b>organs</b> include the stomach, the small intestine, and the colon with its attached appendix. <b>Organs</b> such as the liver, its attached gallbladder, and the pancreas function in close association with the digestive tract and communicate with it via ducts. The spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands also lie within the abdomen, along with many blood vessels including the aorta and inferior vena cava. Anatomists may consider the urinary bladder, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries as either abdominal <b>organs</b> or as pelvic <b>organs.</b> Finally, the abdomen contains an extensive membrane called the peritoneum. A fold of peritoneum may completely cover certain <b>organs,</b> whereas it may cover only one side of <b>organs</b> that usually lie closer to the abdominal wall. Anatomists call the latter type of <b>organs</b> retroperitoneal.|$|R
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory <b>organ</b> occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory <b>organ</b> analogous to the pit <b>organ</b> of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this <b>organ</b> functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit <b>organ</b> does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory <b>organ</b> would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E
5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, the <b>organ</b> was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the <b>organ.</b> Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the <b>organ.</b>|$|E

Involuntary <b>organ</b> harvesting is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that he had taken part in <b>organ</b> extraction operations.|$|E

Unlike other combo <b>organs,</b> such as the Vox Continental, Farfisa <b>organs</b> have integrated legs, which can be folded up and stored inside its base. The first models to be produced were the Compact series of <b>organs</b> between 1964 and 1968. The range of FAST (Farfisa All-Silicon Transistorized) <b>organs</b> was launched at the 1968 NAMM show, and production of the Professional series appeared around the same time.

5|$|Different {{national}} {{styles of}} <b>organ</b> building began to develop, often due to changing political climates. In the Netherlands, the <b>organ</b> became a large instrument with several divisions, doubled ranks, and mounted cornets.

5|$|Early Baroque <b>organ</b> {{music in}} Germany was highly contrapuntal. Sacred <b>organ</b> music {{was based on}} chorales: composers such as Samuel Scheidt and Heinrich Scheidemann wrote chorale preludes, chorale fantasias, and chorale motets. Towards {{the end of the}} Baroque era, the chorale prelude and the partita became mixed, forming the chorale partita. This genre was {{developed}} by Georg Böhm, Johann Pachelbel, and Dieterich Buxtehude. The primary type of free-form piece in this period was the praeludium, as exemplified in the works of Matthias Weckmann, Nicolaus Bruhns, Böhm, and Buxtehude. The <b>organ</b> music of Johann Sebastian Bach fused characteristics of every national tradition and historical style in his large-scale preludes and fugues and chorale-based works. Towards the end of the Baroque era, George Frideric Handel composed the first <b>organ</b> concertos.|$|E
