5|$|Girls {{wanted to}} become part of the {{movement}} almost as soon as it began. Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Girl</b> Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds—later renamed Brownies—for younger girls. She stepped down as president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Girl</b> Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife Olave Baden-Powell, who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth groups did exist. By the 1990s, two thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.|$|E

5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Girl</b> in Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E
5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Girl</b> Who Knew Too Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E

While Hayes was raping her {{on the floor of}} the living room, Komisarjevsky entered the room and announced that William Petit had escaped. Hayes then strangled Jennifer, doused her lifeless body and parts of the house, including the daughters' rooms, with gasoline. While tied to their beds, both daughters had been doused with gasoline; each had her head covered with a pillowcase. A fire was started, and Hayes and Komisarjevsky fled the scene. Hayley and Michaela both died of smoke inhalation.|$|E
5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> whose DNA was on record.

Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas {{to create a more}} specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from the bones of the child was later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E

In 1918, Leonard would later direct his wife, Mae Murry, and Lon Chaney in Danger, Go Slow.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was {{evaluation}} of iron status as well as protein and iron intakes in 14 - 18 year old girls in high schools in <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> Tehran. A total of 268 girls were chosen at random for a dietary survey using the 24 -hr dietary recall method and the biochemical tests were made on 109 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that: compared with the WHO standards, hemoglobin in 0. 9 %, hematocrit in 2. 8 % and MCHC in 13. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> were lower than the respective standards, and TJBC in 33. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> was high. Altogether, 86. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> had a low energy intake, 45 % a low protein intake and 52 % a low iron intake. A low intake of iron, mostly of plant origin, with its low bioavailability, {{is the most important}} factors in iron deficiency anemia in these girls...|$|R

5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood in her mouth and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
