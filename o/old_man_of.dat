It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder flagstones of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E
5|$|Skye {{has been}} used as a {{location}} for a number of feature films. The Ashaig aerodrome was used for the opening scenes of the 1980 film Flash Gordon. Stardust, released in 2007 and starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, featured scenes near Uig, Loch Coruisk and the Quiraing. Another 2007 film, , was shot almost entirely in various locations on the island. Some of the opening scenes in Ridley Scott's 2012 feature film Prometheus were shot at the <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> Storr. In 1973 The Highlands and Islands - a Royal Tour, a documentary about Prince Charles's visit to the Highlands and Islands, directed by Oscar Marzaroli, was shot partly on Skye.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> Hoy is a 449-foot (137m) sea stack on {{the island}} of Hoy, part of the Orkney {{archipelago}} off the north coast of Scotland. Formed from Old Red Sandstone, {{it is one of the}} tallest stacks in Britain. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and may soon collapse into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{group of}} islands surrounds Scapa Flow. Hoy {{is the second}} largest of the Orkney Isles and Ward Hill at its northern end is the highest elevation in the archipelago. The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> Hoy is a well-known seastack. Burray lies {{to the east of}} Scapa Flow and is linked by causeway to South Ronaldsay, which hosts the cultural events, the Festival of the Horse and the Boys' Ploughing Match on the third Saturday in August. It is also the location of the Neolithic Tomb of the Eagles. Graemsay and Flotta are both linked by ferry to the Mainland and Hoy, and the latter is known for its large oil terminal. South Walls has a 19th-century Martello tower and is connected to Hoy by the Ayre. South Ronaldsay, Burray, Glims Holm, and Lamb Holm are connected by road to the Mainland by the Churchill Barriers.|$|E

25|$|The higher {{northern}} part of the Coniston range can be likened to an inverted 'Y' with Brim Fell at the connecting point of the three arms. To the north are Swirl How, Great Carrs and Grey Friar, south east is the short spur terminating at The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> Coniston and to the south west the range continues over Dow Crag to the lower hills beyond.|$|E
25|$|From Coniston a {{path and}} an unsurfaced road lead into the Coppermines Valley, {{the site of}} a number of disused mines; this is also the start of a popular path up the <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> Coniston. There are two {{possible}} routes to Wetherlam's summit from the Coppermines: either up the south ridge, called Lad Stones, or up the Red Dell valley {{to the west of the}} ridge.|$|E

25|$|The ridge {{north from}} Brim Fell narrows to the {{depression}} at Levers Hawse (2,250ft) before climbing again over the rougher ground of Great How Crags {{to the summit}} of Swirl How. To the south, trending south east across a broad plateau is The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> Coniston, the reascent being negligible. Halfway between Brim Fell and 'The Old Man' a further ridge branches off due west, dropping steeply to Goat's Hawse (2,130ft), before swinging south around Goat's Water to Dow Crag.|$|E
25|$|The Old Man is {{the highest}} point in the {{historic}} county of Lancashire (administratively in Cumbria). This assertion rests upon its being higher than its near northern neighbour, Swirl How. There appears to be some doubt in the current literature over whether the height of Swirl How is 802 or 804m, following resurveying. If modern measurement has not added 2m to its rival then The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> Coniston {{is the highest}} point in the Furness Fells, and the twelfth most prominent mountain in England.|$|E

25|$|Following this incident, {{the poem}} narrates the {{maritime}} journey to India—an aim that Dom João II did not accomplish during his lifetime, but would come true with Dom Manuel, {{to whom the}} rivers Indus and Ganges appeared in dreams foretelling the future glories of the Orient. This canto ends with the sailing of the Armada, the sailors in which are surprised by the prophetically pessimistic words {{of an old man}} who was on the beach among the crowd. This is the episode of the <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> the Restelo.|$|E
25|$|The higher {{northern}} part of the range can be likened to an inverted 'Y' in plan. Brim Fell stands at the junction of the three arms with the northern branch continuing over Swirl How and Great Carrs. The south western branch traverses to Dow Crag and the south eastern to The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> Coniston, with Goat's Water lying in a deep depression between the two. The connecting ridge from Dow Crag to Brim Fell crosses the depression of Goat's Hawse above the head of the tarn, the Dow Crag side in particular being steep and rough.|$|E
