5|$|Russian {{persecution}} of Sunni Muslim Circassians and Chechens {{led to their}} immigration into the region in 1867, where today they form {{a small part of}} the country's ethnic fabric. Overall population however declined due to oppression and neglect. Urban settlements with small populations included: Al-Salt, Irbid, Jerash and Al-Karak. The under-development <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>life</b> in Jordan was exacerbated by the settlements being sometimes raided. Ottoman oppression provoked the region's both non-Bedouin and Bedouin tribes to revolt, Bedouin tribes like: Adwan, Bani Hassan, Bani Sakhr and the Howeitat. The most notable revolts were the Shoubak Revolt (1905) and the Karak Revolt (1910), which were brutally suppressed. Jordan's location lies on a pilgrimage route taken by Muslims going to Mecca, which helped the population economically when the Ottomans constructed the Hejaz Railway linking Mecca with Istanbul in 1908. Before the construction of the railway, the Ottomans built fortresses along the Hajj route to secure pilgrims' caravans.|$|E

25|$|Planning and {{architecture}} {{went through a}} paradigm shift {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. The industrialised cities of the 19th century had grown at a tremendous rate, with the pace and style of building largely dictated by private business concerns. The evils <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>life</b> for the working poor were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The laissez-faire style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the Victorian era, was starting to give way to a New Liberalism that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age, by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments.|$|E
25|$|The depopulation, {{defended by}} Claudio Sanchez-Albornoz, is doubted today, at least {{concerning}} its magnitude. Two main arguments {{are used to}} refute it. First, the minor toponymy was preserved in multiple districts. Second, there are biological and cultural differences between {{the inhabitants of the}} Cantabrian zone and those of the central Plateau. What is true is that {{in the first half of}} the eighth century there was a process of rural growth that led to the abandonment <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>life</b> and the organization of the population in small communities of shepherds. Several causes explain this process: The definitive breakdown of the production system based on slavery in existence from the time of the late Roman Empire, the continuous propagation of epidemics in the area, and the abandonment of al-Andalus by the Berber regiments after the revolt of 740-741. All this made possible the emergence of a sparsely populated and ill-organized area that isolated the Asturian kingdom from the Moorish assaults and allowed its progressive strengthening.|$|E

25|$|As a {{so-called}} provinciano ("provincial person", that is, an implication of backwardness regarding the social graces <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>life),</b> Chávez was prima facie regarded by his peers as both polite and shy. However, {{by the time}} he had graduated, Chávez had emceed a beauty contest as well as taken charge of his own obscure radio program. As a young man, Chávez had two girlfriends, who were considered by other students as unattractive. Chávez too was widely considered unattractive, and these girlfriends were more interested in two of Chávez's best friends, the Ruiz brothers, than in Chávez himself. Chávez also had his share of social upsets; for example, when a young woman whom he considered attractive refused to pay any attention to him, Chávez found a rotting donkey head on the side of the road and left it in front of her door. Later, Chávez found another girlfriend, Herma Marksman, who helped draft a capstone thesis required of him prior to graduation. Chávez would—after his marriage at age 23. to Nancy Colmenares— later commit adultery with Marksman. His relationship with Marksman lasted nine years.|$|E

This paper examines such tensions, by focuss ing on how public spaces in Melbourne, Australia frame possibilities for play. Play includes unplatmed, non-instrwnental interactions between strangers, and explorations of the physical and symbolic texture <b>of</b> the <b>urban</b> landscape. The paper focuses on three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> social <b>life</b> where spatial design has a critical influence: perfonnance, representation, and control. These dimensions highlight how the meanings, desires, behaviours, and even the built forms <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> public spaces are shaped by a constant dialectical interplay between instrumentality, normativity, and play...|$|R
