40|$|A {{visualization}} {{method of}} aerodynamic noise source based on momentum in {{wake of a}} centrifugal impeller is proposed. The characteristics of the fan noise operated at the design point and the <b>off</b> <b>design</b> point are discussed by the visualization. When the flow rate changed from the design point to the <b>off</b> <b>design</b> point, the overall noise level of the fan has increased by 3 dB (A) because of the broadband noise. According to the visualization of aerodynamic noise source proposed by this study, it clarified that {{the domain of the}} flow related to the fan noise exists at the vicinity of the volute tongue. Since the flow almost flows out to the exit of the fan at the off-design, the large difference of the momentum in the wake occurred at the vicinity of the volute tongue. It is shown that the flow pattern at the vicinity of the volute tongue {{is one of the reasons}} for increasing of the fan noise...|$|E

40|$|Propeller {{design has}} evolved {{significantly}} in last years, {{with the introduction}} of numerical methods which can provide a very reliable assessment of propeller characteristics, not only in correspondence to the usual design conditions, but also to off-design conditions. Nevertheless, problems still exist if “very off-design conditions” are considered, and if interest is posed on cavitation related problems such as radiated noise. Interest in radiated noise phenomenon is constantly increasing, not involving anymore only naval vessels, but affecting also design of other “high added value ships”, such as cruise ships and megayachts, for which comfort problem and environmental impact are a key element. One of the most significant problems related to radiated noise, is the rather low amount of experimental data available, and this is particularly significant for CPP propellers at <b>off</b> <b>design</b> conditions. In present paper, the experimental characterization of two alternative designs of a CP propeller in terms of usual mechanical characteristic, cavitation and radiated noise is presented. Experimental campaign has been conducted considering two very different pitch settings, allowing to analyse propeller behaviour also in correspondence to very <b>off</b> <b>design</b> conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{conversion}} of hydraulic energy into mechanical energy {{takes place in}} hydraulic turbines. Further this energy is converted to electrical energy {{with the help of}} generators and then supplied to consumer. With increasing demand, efficiency of every machine plays vital role. When water is stored at very high head, hydraulic energy can be converted efficiently into mechanical energy with the help of Pelton turbine. The performance of Pelton turbine at designed and off-design points is important. Performance of turbo-machines is generally evaluated before installation with the help of model testing at designed and <b>off</b> <b>design</b> regimes. Now-a-days with advanced computers and numerical techniques, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has emerged as boon for optimisation of turbo-machines. In present work, performance analysis of existing six jet Pelton turbine at design and <b>off</b> <b>design</b> discharge has been numerically carried out using Ansys-CFX. The efficiency results are compared with available model test result and found to have close comparison. The variation in pressure distribution, water velocity and water distribution have also been obtained and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{computational}} time {{to develop}} high speed propulsion systems {{is the number one}} challenge facing future development of thrust producing scramjets over a wide operational envelope. Current designs times are substantial due to the need to solve the Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics. The computational time for one point can lead to only a few design choices being run before a decision is required. In order to develop robust design a level of understanding of <b>off</b> <b>design</b> performance is also required. If a single design point requires significant resources in computational time, solving the same geometry over a number of design parameters creates a cost too great for design. To mitigate this cost, Surrogate surface modelling can be used to generate a statistical function for the design space with a sparse data set to capture the optima points as well as how the system behaves during <b>off</b> <b>design</b> performance. This paper focuses on generating surrogate surfaces using the Kriging method, employing results for both the supersonic flow and the reaction mechanisms required to accurately predict the combustion performance which requires chemical kinetics to accurately capture the low residence time inherent in supersonic combustion...|$|E
