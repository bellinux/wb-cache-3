[...] "There isn't a well-established understanding about what is private and what isn't private.

After Katyal agreed that these things were [...] "in flux" [...] and thus the Court should avoid making any broadly applicable rules on the first hearing, Chief Justice John Roberts speculated that that principle cut both ways and that perhaps the Court should at least say the Constitution applied in this case and make rules later.|$|E

2500|$|Lock {{screen is}} the {{simplest}} way to prevent unauthorized access your computer. [...] Since it is standard on most computers, it costs no extra memory or financial expense, but secures your computer so securely the FBI finds it difficult to gain access, let alone ordinary people. [...] Trying to control privacy and maintain parental controls within the computer without screen lock is like leaving the exterior doors <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>house</b> unlocked or wide open, relying on small locks on cabinets, drawers, closets, interior doors, (etc.), which your teenager or other intruder can lock-pick open at leisure away from the public view. Lock screen is actually more secure than common safeguards in life, such as locking your car so your child won't have a car accident which won't do any good if the child finds your keys, or a house-key while there are windows that can be smashed or pushed open for entry. If you do discover that the lock screen is not effective, then it is a certainty that you need to change your password to something less predictable, which is easily done, far easier than re-keying a car key or changing the combination of a physical lock.|$|E
