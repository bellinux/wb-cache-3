40|$|BACKGROUND: Use of {{effective}} scolicidal agents during puncture, aspiration or injection of a scolicidal agent and reaspiration (PAIR) and surgery for hydatid cysts {{are essential to}} reduce the recurrence rate. In this in vitro study, we tried to determine the scolicidal property of a new agent, <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride,</b> and of various agents in different concentrations and exposure times. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces were obtained from six patients with liver (n= 3) and lung (n= 3) hydatid cysts. Various concentrations of <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (0. 1 %, 0. 01 % and 0. 001 % diluted form), povidone iodine (10 %, 1 % and 0. 1 % diluted) and 20 % saline were used in this study. Viability of protoscoleces was determined with dye-uptake (0. 1 % eosin) and flame cell activity. RESULTS: <b>Octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> 0. 1 % had strong scolicidal effect in 15 min and <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> 0. 01 % in 30 min. Sixty percent of protoscoleces lost viability at 5 min with <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> 0. 1 %. Viability ratio decreased to 20 % at 10 min, {{and all of them}} died at 15 min. Povidone iodine 10 % and 1 % had strong scolicidal effects after 15 - and 30 min of exposure, respectively. Saline 20 % killed all the protoscoleces in 30 -min exposure. CONCLUSION: Because of the rapid and strong scolocidal effectiveness of <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> on protoscoleces, it may be used as a scolocidal agent during both perioperative and in the PAIR method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{water based}} {{combination}} of 0. 1 % <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> and 2 % 2 - phenoxyethanol is registered in many European countries as an antiseptic solution (octenisept ®) for topical treatment with high antimicrobial activity for human use, but octenidine based products {{have not been}} registered for veterinary use yet. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> or 2 -phenoxyethanol, the two main components of this disinfectant, permeate through animal skin in vitro. Therefore, permeation studies were conducted using Franz-type diffusion cells. 2 ml of the test compound were applied onto 1. 77 cm 2 split skin of cats, dogs, cows and horses. To simulate wounded skin, cattle skin was treated with adhesive tapes 100 times, as well. Up to an incubation time of 28 hours samples of the acceptor chamber were taken and were analysed by UV-HPLC. Using the method of the external standard, the apparent permeability coefficient, the flux J max, and the recovery were calculated. Furthermore, the residues of both components in the skin samples were determined after completion of the diffusion experiment. Results After 28 hours no <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> was found in the receptor chamber of intact skin samples, while 2. 7 % of the topical applied <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> permeated through barrier disrupted cattle skin. 2 - phenoxyethanol permeated through all skin samples with the highest permeability in equine, followed by bovine, canine to feline skin. Furthermore, both components were found in the stratum corneum and the dermis of all split skin samples with different amounts in the examined species. Conclusion For 2 -phenoxyethanol the systemic impact of the high absorption rate and a potential toxicological risk have to be investigated in further studies. Due to its low absorption rates through the skin, <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> is suitable for superficial skin treatment in the examined species. </p...|$|E

40|$|For chronic {{wounds to}} become {{primarily}} healing wounds, {{not only the}} appropriate surgical procedure - especially wound debridement - but also {{the treatment of the}} causative basic disease must be taken into consideration. In both the prophylaxis of wound infections and the treatment of existing wound infections, wound antiseptics play a crucial role. As long as a clinically manifest infection is confined to the wound and has not spread hematogenically, the indication for application of wound antiseptics is given. Should systemic involvement exist, antimicrobial chemotherapy is additionally required. Antiseptics must only be used following careful determination of indication. Impaired wound healing can otherwise result. For chronically poorly healing wounds and burns, polihexanide is the agent of first choice. However, based on new in-vitro findings, <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> is superior to polihexanide in terms of therapeutic spectrum. These findings enable a broader application of <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> to include use on chronic wounds at lower concentrations than usual. The following agents must be viewed critically in terms of their use as wound antiseptics: chlorhexidine, 8 -chinolinol, nitrofural, phenol derivates, quats, silver nitrate, silver sulphadiazine, tosylchloramide sodium, triclosan, and hydrogen peroxide.

40|$|Purpose: Bacterial vaginosis is a {{recalcitrant}} polymicrobial biofilm {{infection that}} often resists standard antibiotic treatment. We therefore considered repeated treatment with octenidine, a local antiseptic that {{has previously been}} shown to be highly effective in several biofilm-associated infections. Methods: Twenty-four patients with recurrent BV were treated with a 7 -day course of octenidine (<b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> spray application with the commercial product Octenisept). In case of treatment failure or relapse within 6 months, patients were re-treated with a 28 -day course of octenidine. In case of recurrence within 6 months after the second treatment course, patients were treated again with a 28 -day course followed by weekly applications for 2 months. Treatment effect was evaluated by assessment of the presence of the biofilm on voided vaginal epithelial cells through fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Results: The initial cure rate following a 7 -day course of octenidine was as high as 87. 5 %. The 6 -month relapse rate was, however, as high as 66. 6 %. Repeated treatment for 28 days led to an overall cure rate of 75. 0 %; however, it was also associated with emergence of complete resistance to octenidine in a subset of women. The overall cure rate after three treatment courses with 1 -year follow-up was 62. 5 %, with 37. 5 % of the patients showing complete resistance to octenidine. Conclusion: Our preliminary results showed that <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> was initially highly effective, but the efficacy of repeated and prolonged treatment dropped quickly as challenge with the antiseptic rapidly led to bacterial resistance in a considerable subset of women...|$|E

40|$|Background: With {{increasing}} bacterial {{antibiotic resistance}} {{and an increased}} infection risk due to more complicated surgical procedures and patient populations, prevention of surgical infection is of paramount importance. Intraoperative irrigation with an antiseptic solution could provide {{an effective way to}} reduce postoperative infection rates. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the bactericidal or cytotoxic characteristics of antiseptics, the combination of these characteristics for intraoperative application has not been addressed. Methods: Bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis) and human cells were exposed to polyhexanide, hydrogen peroxide, <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride,</b> povidone-iodine, and chlorhexidine digluconate at various dilutions for two minutes. Bactericidal properties were calculated by means of the quantitative suspension method. The cytotoxic effect on human fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells was determined by a WST- 1 metabolic activity assay. Results: All of the antiseptics except for polyhexanide were bactericidal and cytotoxic at the commercially available concentrations. When diluted, only povidone-iodine was bactericidal at a concentration at which some cell viability remained. The other antiseptics tested showed no cellular survival at the minimal bactericidal concentration. Conclusions: Povidone-iodine diluted to a concentration of 1. 3 g/L could be the optimal antiseptic for intraoperative irrigation. This should be established by future clinical studies. ...|$|E

Methods: The antimicrobial effect of tea tree oil (TTO), eucalyptus oil (EO), lemon grass oil (LGO), and a eucalyptus-based oil mixture (MXT) were tested in comparison to chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX), povidone-iodine (BTA), and <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (OCT). Oral bacterial strains and candida species using the agar diffusion test were used for the antimicrobial study. Results: All tested oils showed antimicrobial potency against the tested biological indicators. In comparison of all tested substances the largest effective zones were measured for LGO, followed from MXT and CHX. TTO and EO were less effective against the tested micro-organisms followed from BTA. Conclusions: The results of this study show that some essential oils have better antimicrobial properties than standard oral antiseptics. In a follow-up step, the ideal concentrations, the composition of essential oils, and the mode of application will be evaluated. The antibacterial efficacy of essential oils might be promising for use in clinical and oral hygiene applications.

This study aimed to investigate the bactericidal activity of OCT against international epidemic clones of MRGN. A set of five different species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied to prove OCT efficacy without organic load, under “clean conditions” (0. 3 g/L albumin) and under “dirty conditions” (3 g/L albumin + 3 mL/L defibrinated sheep blood), according to an official test norm (EN 13727). We used five clonally unrelated isolates per species, including a susceptible wild-type strain, and four MRGN isolates, corresponding to either the 3 MRGN or 4 MRGN definition of multidrug resistance. A contact time of 1 min was fully effective for all isolates by using different OCT concentrations (0. 01 % and 0. 05 %), with a bacterial reduction factor of > 5 log 10 systematically observed. Growth kinetics were determined with two different wild-type strains (A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae), proving a time-dependent efficacy of OCT.

40|$|Background. Limiting {{the spread}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) within {{healthcare}} fa-cilities where the organism is highly endemic is a challenge. The use of topical antiseptic agents may help interrupt the transmission of MRSA and {{reduce the risk of}} clinical infection. <b>Octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> is a topical antiseptic that exhibits in vitro efficacy against a wide variety of bacteria, including S aureus. Methods. We conducted a prospective cluster crossover study to compare the use of daily octenidine body wash-es with soap and water in patients identified by active surveillance cultures to be MRSA-colonized, to prevent the acquisition of MRSA in patients with negative screening swabs. Five adult medical and surgical wards and 2 intensive care units were selected. The study involved an initial 6 -month phase using octenidine or soap washes followed by a crossover in each ward to the alternative product. The primary and secondary outcomes were the rates of new MRSA acquisitions and MRSA clinical infections, respectively. Results. A total of 10 936 patients admitted for ≥ 48 hours was included in the analysis. There was a small re-duction in MRSA acquisition in the intervention group compared with controls (3. 0 % vs 3. 3 %), but this reduction was not significant (odds ratio, 0. 89; 95 % confidence interval,. 72 – 1. 11; P =. 31). There were also no significant dif-ferences in clinical MRSA infection or incidence of MRSA bacteremia. Conclusions. This study suggests that the targeted use of routine antiseptic washes may not in itself be adequat...|$|E
40|$|Epidermis-Equivalents (EpiDerm) {{derived from}} human keratinocytes were {{obtained}} after 14 d air-lift-culture. These In-vitro-models {{were used for}} the demonstration of a possible postantiseptic effect against the test microorganisms Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus after 5 min pre-incubation of the surface of the epidermis with equimolar concentrations of the antiseptic agents chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (OCT) of 1. 6 mmol/l. Both antiseptics adhere to the surface of EpiDerm. Each active agent cannot be removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and remains microbiocidal active. EpiDerm-OCT was more effective after 30 min at room temperature against 106 cfu/ml Staphylococcus aureus resulting 3. 2 – 4 log 10 reduction, but not for EpiDerm-CHX producing only 2 – 2. 4 log 10 reduction. A maximum of 0. 6 – 1. 2 log 10 reduction was found against Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 30 min exposure in EpiDerm-OCT, but there was no or a neglectable microbiocidal activity of 0 – 0. 2 log 10 reduction using EpiDerm-CHX. The postantiseptic effect of OCT is superior to EpiDerm-bound CHX comparing equimolar concentrations of active agent used for pre-incubation of EpiDerm. Treatment of EpiDerm with OCT alone or in combination with test organisms resulted in no cytotoxic effect in viable keratinocytes. In contrast to that the test organism Staphylococcus aureus, the active agent CHX alone or in combination with both test organisms demonstrated a cytotoxic activity reducing the viability of basal keratinocytes more than 10 %. Therefore, OCT is more tolerated than CHX by basal keratinocytes of the presented In-vitro-model EpiDerm...|$|E
40|$|The irritative {{effects of}} {{preservatives}} found in ophthalmologic solution, or of antiseptics used for skin disinfec-tion is a consistent {{problem for the}} patients. The reduction of the toxic effects of these compounds is desired. Brilliant Blue G (BBG) has shown to meet the expected effect in presence of benzalkonium chloride (BAK), a well known preservative in ophthalmic solutions, and <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (Oct), used as antiseptic in skin and wound disinfection. BBG shows a significant protective effect on human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells against BAK and Oct toxicity, increasing the cell survival up to 51 % at the highest BAK or Oct concentration tested, which is 0. 01 %, both at 30 min incubation. Although BBG {{is described as a}} P 2 x 7 receptor antagonist, other selective P 2 x 7 receptor antagonists, OxATP (adenosine 5 ’-triphosphate- 2 ’, 3 ’-dialdehyde) and DPPH (N’-(3, 5 -dichloropyridin- 4 -yl) - 3 -phenylpropanehydrazide), did not reduce the cytotoxicity of neither BAK nor Oct. Therefore we assume that the protective effect of BBG is not due to its action on the P 2 x 7 receptor. Brilliant Blue R (BBR), a dye similar to BBG, was also tested for protective effect on BAK and Oct toxicity. In presence of BAK no significant protective effect was observed. Instead, with Oct a comparable protective effect was seen with that of BBG. To assure that the bacteriostatic effect is not affected by the combinations of BAK/BBG, Oct/BBG and Oct/BBR, bacterial growth inhibition was analyzed on different Gram-negative and Gram-positiv...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solutions {{are dependent on}} the levels of free available chlorine (FAC). Mixing these solutions with irrigants can result in significant reductions in FAC. Although the effect of some irrigants on FAC is known, the effect of other commonly used irrigants is not. Thus, the therapeutic ramifications of the concurrent use of these on the efficiency of NaOCl solutions is not known. Methods Aliquots of 5. 2 % (w/v) NaOCl solutions were admixed in proportions of 90 : 10, 80 : 20, and 50 : 50 with the following irrigants: <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> (OCT); SmearOFF (Vista Dental Products, Racine, WI), 17 % EDTA; and 0. 2 %, 2 %, and 5 % chlorhexidine (CHX) solutions. Changes in FAC were measured by iodometric titration. Statistical differences between means were determined using a post hoc Tukey analysis test after an analysis of variance. Results OCT appeared not to affect FAC and was significantly different than all other irrigants, except for 90 : 10 and 80 : 20 mixtures of low concentration (0. 2 %) CHX. CHX solutions showed a marked concentration- and mixture proportion–dependent detrimental effect on FAC. The reduction of FAC between different concentrations of CHX was statistically significant in 80 : 20 and 50 : 50 proportions, with 50 : 50 mixtures of 5 % CHX having the greatest influence. Mixtures containing even small proportions of SmearOFF or EDTA exhibited significant losses in FAC. Conclusions OCT has little effect on FAC {{and can be used}} concurrently with NaOCl solutions. Higher concentrations of CHX significantly affect FAC. Their combined use with NaOCl solutions should be avoided. EDTA and SmearOFF should not be mixed with NaOCl solutions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of two commercially available, alcohol-based antiseptic solutions for preparation and care of central venous catheter (CVC) insertion sites, with and without <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride,</b> a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was undertaken in the haematology units and in one surgical unit of two university hospitals. Adult patients with a non-tunnelled CVC {{were randomly assigned to}} two different skin disinfection regimens at the insertion site: 0. 1 % octenidine with 30 % 1 -propanol and 45 % 2 -propanol, and as control 74 % ethanol with 10 % 2 -propanol. Endpoints were (i) skin colonization at the insertion site; (ii) -positive culture from the catheter tip (≥ 15 CFU); and (iii) occurrence of CVC-associated bloodstream infection (defined according to criteria set by the CDC). Four hundred patients with inserted CVC were enrolled from May 2002 through April 2005. Both groups were similar in respect of patient characteristics and co-morbidities. Skin colonization at the CVC insertion site during the first 10 days was significantly reduced by octenidine treatment (relative difference octenidine vs. control: 0. 21; 95 %CI: 0. 11 – 0. 39, p < 0. 0001). -positive culture of the catheter tip was significantly less frequent in the octenidine group (7. 9 %) than in the control group (17. 8 %) : OR = 0. 39 (95 %CI: 0. 20 – 0. 80, p 0. 009). Patients treated with octenidine had a non-significant reduction in catheter-associated bloodstream infections (4. 1 % vs. 8. 3 %; OR = 0. 44; 95 %CI: 0. 18 – 1. 08, p 0. 081).

V. Grubnik, O. I. Tkachenko, Y. M. Koshel, V. M. Kosovan, E. A. Koychev Odessa National Medical University, Odessa Summary The accumulated clinical experience and analysis of our own results of treatment of patients with severe forms of acute widespread purulent peritonitis, speaks about the growing urgency of this problem. The aim of this study was determination of the most optimal medium sanation during execution programs of the abdominal cavity sanitation in acute diffuse purulent peritonitis. Was studied the treatment results of 79 patients with severe forms of acute widespread purulent peritonitis. After laparotomy and performing a biopsy was conducted qualitative and quantitative morphological study of the inflammatory process in the peritoneum on the background of the landmark of the abdominal cavity sanitation of two groups of patients with acute widespread purulent peritonitis before and after carrying out the programmatic sanitation of the abdominal cavity, using a solution of <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> and saline solution. In the result of study, authors came to the conclusion, that the application, as it seemed different sanation mediums do not affect on the basic morphometric parameters of the studied biopsies of the peritoneum after sanitation of abdominal cavity. This confirms the theory of "mechanical purification" of the abdominal cavity, and sanitation of the abdominal cavity does not depend on the qualitative composition of the sanation medium.

40|$|Peri-implantitis is an {{inflammatory}} process, which is initiated by a biofilm-induced pathway causing a {{reversible inflammatory reaction}} in the soft tissues surrounding the implant; however, it may progress into irreversible damage in the surrounding alveolar bone and result in loss of attachment. Modelling any kind of oral biofilm is challenging as up to 700 species have been identified on various surfaces within the mouth. Thus, also data on bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on dental implant surfaces is limited and mostly based on identification of species. However, knowledge about this process, in particular in its early stages, {{is essential for the}} development of strategies to prevent and control microbial adherence and biofilm formation. The aims of this study were (i) to develop and validate a flow chamber model to assess peri-implantitis related multispecies biofilm formation; (ii) to test antimicrobial susceptibility of this biofilm; (iii) to evaluate the reliability of commonly used methods and novel isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) analyses for vitality testing of adherent microorganisms in vitro. An in vitro flow chamber model was developed to study single- and multispecies adhesion to protein-coated surface in reduced nutrient conditions that mimic the clinical situation of peri-implant disease. Adherent single-species model with S. sanguinis was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Original study 1 in Chapter 4) to answer two questions: firstly, how efficient is disinfectant treatment and secondly, to identify discrepancies between the results revealed by different vitality detection methods (commonly applied: staining by Live/dead Baclight kit, conventional culturing; and a novel approach by IMC). Chlorhexidine has been considered for many years the standard in oral infection control, however, the three other disinfectants (povidone-iodine, <b>octenidine</b> <b>dihydrochloride,</b> polyhexanide) showed comparable efficacy against the adherent microorganism. The interpretation of the results of staining and traditional culturing is difficult as major discrepancies were present. The disagreement between the results of the methods can be attributed to different aspects: (i) staining is based on the destruction or integrity of the cell wall; (ii) conventional culturing requires bacteria to be re-suspended prior to cultivation and subsequent quantification of colony-forming units. However, several factors – such as physical damage to the cells by re-suspension or lack of growth due to suboptimal culture conditions – may cause false negative results; (iii) the population of cells that are viable but not cultivable (VBNC), but are still present by staining and microscopy. The IMC is a very sensitive method, which detects heat-flow from all metabolic processes in any living microorganism. The principle of the method is that all living systems produce heat and heat release can be measured calorimetrically without any interference with the processes. In other words, IMC measures heat production or consumption, which is proportional to the rate at which any given chemical, physical or biological process is taking place (i. e., metabolic heat from bacterial growth). Our results on adherent disinfectant-treated S. sanguinis indicate that IMC is a useful tool to avoid the problem with VBNC cells and provides a novel approach in oral microbiology that detects reliably all the cells that are able to resuscitate after disinfectant treatment and thereby may lead to the expression of virulence factors in the colonized sites. In order to study antimicrobial efficacy on a more complex system, a 72 -hour biofilm model including S. sanguinis, F. nucelatum and P. gingivalis was created (Original study 2 in Chapter 5). After 72 h, the three species were always detected with similar proportions throughout experiments by microscopic methods. Even, when such stability in the proportions and structure was found, the metabolic activity of biofilms in IMC revealed high heterogeneity. Thus, this heterogeneity suggests that bacteria appear to have intra-species variance affecting their behaviour in biofilms, which is dependent on different factors that are hitherto not well understood. IMC analysis of the behaviour of the three-species biofilm provided a novel opportunity to observe how an intact biofilm acts as an entity when exposed to antibiotics (Original study 3 in Chapter 6). The clinical efficacy of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the periimplantitis treatment is unclear; in order to gain better understanding the most frequently used antibiotics: amoxicillin, metronidazole and their combination were tested. Additionally, in order to obtain comparable data to the previously published information (Chapter 4), the vitality of adherent single-species of S. sanguinis and P. gingivalis after antibiotic treatment was assessed by vitality staining, conventional culturing and IMC. The results of staining and culturing correlated poorly. This can be due to reasons mentioned earlier, such as limitations of the methods and VBNC cells, but can also be due to the bacteriostatic effects of antibiotics that cannot be reliably detected by staining. Although amoxicillin and metronidazole are considered bactericidal, IMC results suggest that when applied alone, the antibiotics seem to work primarily through bacteriostatic effects; when combined, the efficacy is increased by their synergistic bactericidal action. Furthermore, this indicates that it might not be possible to strictly divide the effects of antibiotics into bacteriostatic and bactericidal, as the results here imply that the effect seems to be dependent on their concentration and combination plus the nature of targeted cells. In conclusion, this study emphasises the need to critically evaluate the results of live/dead staining and conventional culturing as many aspects can affect the outcome of these methods leading to miscalculations on the proportion of cells that are able to resuscitate and express virulence factors on treated sites. Thus, as a novel alternative in oral biofilm research IMC gives new insights helping to monitor the efficacy and dynamics of biofilms and their antimicrobial susceptibility in vitro...|$|E
