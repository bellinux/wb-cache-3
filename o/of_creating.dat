5|$|Another non-animal {{research}} method is in silico or computer simulation and mathematical modeling {{which seeks to}} investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug affects in humans without using animals.

5|$|In the 1940s and 50s, {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} {{from a variety of}} fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) began to discuss the possibility <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> an artificial brain.

5|$|It was {{announced}} in March 2011 that Franco will teach a fall semester course on modifying poetry into short films to ten to twelve third-year graduate film students at NYU.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} mathematical challenges of chess is the development of algorithms that can play chess. The idea <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a chess-playing machine dates to the 18thcentury; around 1769, the chess-playing automaton called The Turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax. Serious trials based on automata, such as El Ajedrecista, were too complex and limited to be useful.|$|E

5|$|The idea <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a {{heritage}} streetcar system in Astoria, {{as part of}} efforts to redevelop and revitalize the riverfront area, had first been raised in 1980, long after {{the closure of the}} city's streetcar-transit system, which operated from 1892 to 1924. An attempt by city officials to acquire a trolley car in 1986 was dropped in the face of high insurance costs.|$|E
5|$|The opera was {{composed}} under severe pressure of time; the composer later {{said that the}} effort <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> it almost killed him. The initial performance, produced with lavish and innovative special effects, was highly praised, and the work was equally well received in Venice when it was revived under the composer's direction in 1640 as the inaugural work for the Teatro San Moisè.|$|E
5|$|A new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, {{arrived in}} July to replace Liniers, and the independentist {{group did not}} agree on how to react. Castelli {{proposed}} a resumption of Álzaga's idea <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a governing Junta, but not headed by the Spanish. Belgrano insisted on the plan to appoint Charlotte as regent of a constitutional monarchy, and Rodriguez Peña proposed a military coup, with or without Liniers at the head. They finally accepted the perspective of Cornelio Saavedra, and delayed taking action until a better opportunity.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|According to Stratton and Martin, {{movement}} is the game's most important pillar. To help keep movement fast, weapon reloading was excluded and levels {{were designed to}} discourage players from hiding. On January 25, Stratton confirmed the game's feature of non-linear exploration and stated that combat is the game's focus and that {{the difficulty of the}} game was raised with the aim <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> an ultimate first-person shooter. On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created to evoke the game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E
