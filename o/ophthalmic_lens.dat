40|$|Abstract [...] In this {{investigation}} {{the quality of}} two types of optical correction, hydrogel contact <b>lenses</b> and <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lenses,</b> was compared by measuring the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the correcting lens plus visual optics system using an objective method. A merit function was defined {{in order to allow}} the direct comparison between the optical performance with the two corrections. A study on 10 subjects was undertaken, measuring the MTF of both corrections by using the double pass method. The results how that the optical quality of contact lenses was higher than that with <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lenses.</b> The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) and visual acuity (VA) were determined as subjective parameters of visuaI performance.

50|$|It {{is true that}} {{aspheric}} lenses {{are used}} in cameras and binoculars. It {{would be wrong to}} assume that this means aspherics/atorics are a sign of good optics in eyewear. Cameras and telescopes use multiple lens elements and have different design criteria. Spectacles are made of only one <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lens.</b> The best-form spheric lens has been shown to give the best vision. In cases where best-form is not used, such as cosmetic flattening, thinning, or wrap-around sunglasses, an aspheric design can reduce the amount of induced optical distortions.|$|E
5000|$|Lens {{manufacturers}} {{claim that}} aspheric lenses improve vision over traditional spheric lenses. This statement could be misleading {{to individuals who}} do not know that the lenses are being implicitly compared to [...] "a spheric flattened away from best-form for cosmetic reasons". This qualification is necessary since best-form spherics are always better than aspherics for an <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lens</b> application. Aspherics for corrective lenses are only used to attempt to improve the degradation caused by deviating from best-form sphere resulting from making a flatter lens for cosmetic reasons. The same applies for atoric and bi-aspheric.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} ocular drug {{delivery}} systems {{has been one}} of the most covered topics in drug delivery research. One potential drug carrier solution is the use of materials that are already commercially available in <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lenses</b> for the correction of refractive errors. In this study, we present a diffusion-based mathematical model in which the parameters can be adjusted based on experimental results obtained under controlled conditions. The model allows for the design of multi-layered therapeutic <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lenses</b> for controlled drug delivery. We show that the proper combination of materials with adequate drug diffusion coefficients, thicknesses and interfacial transport characteristics allows for the control of the delivery of drugs from multi-layered <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lenses,</b> such that drug bursts can be minimized, and the release time can be maximized. As far as we know, this combination of a mathematical modelling approach with experimental validation of non-constant activity source lamellar structures, made of layers of different materials, accounting for the interface resistance to the drug diffusion, is a novel approach to the design of drug loaded multi-layered contact lenses. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

50|$|Like {{many health}} care providers, opticians are {{regulated}} professionals in certain countries. The profession is often regulated by optician-specific agencies, as in Canada and some {{states of the}} U.S., or jointly with optometry such as the New Zealand Optometrist and Dispensing Opticians Board or the United Kingdom General Optical Council. Opticians may work independently or dependently with an optometrist or ophthalmologist although some opticians may work in an optical laboratory as a laboratory technical optician. Opticians convert a prescription for the correction of a refractive error into an <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lens</b> or some other device, such as reading aids or telescopic lenses.|$|E
50|$|The base curve (usually {{determined}} from {{the profile of}} the front surface of an <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lens)</b> can be changed to result in the best optic and cosmetic characteristics across the entire surface of the lens. Optometrists may choose to specify a particular base curve when prescribing a corrective lens for either of these reasons. A multitude of mathematical formulas and professional clinical experience has allowed optometrists and lens designers to determine standard base curves that are ideal for most people. As a result, the front surface curve is more standardized and the characteristics that generate a person's unique prescription are typically derived from the geometry of the back surface of the lens.|$|E
50|$|Although {{corrective}} lenses {{can be produced}} in many different profiles, the most common is ophthalmic or convex-concave. In an <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lens,</b> both {{the front and back}} surface have a positive radius, resulting in a positive / convergent front surface and a negative / divergent back surface. The difference in curvature between the front and rear surface leads to the corrective power of the lens. In hyperopia a convergent lens is needed, therefore the convergent front surface overpowers the divergent back surface. For myopia the opposite is true: the divergent back surface is greater in magnitude than the convergent front surface. To correct for presbyopia, the lens, or section of the lens, must be more convergent or less divergent than the person's distance lens.|$|E
40|$|Subject of research. Algorithm for {{calculation}} of contact <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lenses</b> for dual application {{has been suggested}} based on unified approach for their calculation. The algorithm has been tested on the composition of Goldmann <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lenses</b> and Panfundoscope lens optical systems. Method. The condition of mutual unambiguous orientation of patient’s eye and instruments is performed at the initial calculation step by face mounting and movement of coordinate table with optical head. Then such type of patient's eye optical system model is selected that the lens would be combined with the front surface of eye cornea optical system. Pupil of patient eye is under anesthesia. At the final calculation step we determine the functions of optical lens image quality and their values based on medical and technical requirements for {{the components of the}} complex system. Main results. The algorithm for <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lenses</b> calculation has been suggested and its correctness has been proved practically on the example of two basic models in the group of such type lenses being applied in practice as a part of complex system with ophthalmic laser coagulators. Optical {{calculation of}} Goldmann <b>ophthalmic</b> contact <b>lenses</b> and Panfundoscope is presented. The method of neutralization is optimal for Goldmann lenses. The first component in Panfundoscope operates the position of object planes whereas the second component operates the position of complex system with ophthalmocoagulator's pupils. Computer modeling of complex system "Computer model of eye-ophthalmic lens" in ZEMAX confirmed the correctness of calculation algorithm in which the criteria of diffraction image quality has been used. Application possibility of simplified computer eye model called "Reduced eye" by Verbitskiy has been demonstrated. Practical relevance. The general scientific approach to the problem of synthesis, calculation and research of complex system with contact <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>lenses</b> for diagnostics and laser intervention on the eyeground has been found and confirmed. The results obtained have practical significance for the further development of optical calculation method and optical ophthalmologic instruments such as the fundus camera, wavefront analysers, opthalmoscopes and systems of vision optical correction. ...|$|R

Steeper and more convergent than the base curve, the add segment combines with the back surface to deliver the person's near correction. Early manufacturing techniques fused a separate lens to the front surface, but modern processes cut all the geometry into a single piece of lens material. There are many locations, profiles, and sizes of add segments, typically referred to as segment type. Some [...] "seg type" [...] examples include Flat top, Kryptok, Orthogon, Tillyer Executive, and Ultex A. Trifocals contain two add segments to achieve a lens that corrects the person's vision for three distinct distances.|$|E

40|$|Peripheral refraction, the {{refractive}} error present outside the main direction of gaze, has lately attracted interest {{due to its}} alleged relationship with the progression of myopia.

We present a methodology {{for the evaluation of}} the peripheral refractive error in ophthalmic lenses, adapting the conventional generalized ray tracing approach to the requirements of the evaluation of peripheral refraction. The nodal point of the eye and a retinal conjugate surface will be used to evaluate the three-dimensional distribution of refractive error around the fovea.
