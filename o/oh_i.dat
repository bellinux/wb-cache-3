500|$|Writing for The Times of India, Deepauk Murugesan praised [...] "Yen Iniya Pon Nilavae" [...] {{for showing}} K. J. Yesudas' {{versatility}} as a singer. In July 2011, D.Karthikeyan of The Hindu singled out the film's re-recording and ranked it alongside the music director's other {{films such as}} Mullum Malarum (1978), Uthiripookkal (1979), Moondram Pirai (1982), Nayakan (1987) and Thalapathi (1991). Indo-Asian News Service described [...] "Yen Iniya Pon Nilavae" [...] as one of Yesudas' [...] "best songs". Jaya Madhavan wrote for The New Indian Express, [...] "Who can forget [...] songs En iniya pon nilave, Raja raja chozhan, Kanchi pattuduthi {{to name just a}} few? <b>Oh!</b> <b>I</b> love his film music." [...] "Yen Iniya Pon Nilavae" [...] was included in Master Pieces, a compilation album featuring 14 songs composed by Ilaiyaraaja, which was released by Saregama in 2008.

He also gave him flip-flops, canvas shoes and T-shirts with slogans such as a [...] "Use A Condom", which the designer considered important. Malhotra and Narula collaborated on the colour palette: [...] "If Manish would give Priyanka yellow, then I would go for a green for John and a pink for Abhishek." [...] Narula also designed for Deol, Irani, Kher and Mukherjee. He chose brands such as Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci for Deol (the Verve editor), giving him sleek suits with short jackets and skinny pants with narrow bottoms. Kirron Kher, who played Bachchan's mother, was styled as a typical Punjabi salwar-kameez-clad woman with gota embroidery. For Sushmita Mukherjee, who played Chopra's aunt, Narula chose animal prints and diamonds, pearls, silver and gold: [...] "When we shopped for her it was like 'oh god, this is so tacky let’s buy it or <b>oh,</b> <b>I</b> hate it.

500|$|Leave Home has various lyrical themes {{throughout}} its track list. The opening song, [...] "Glad to See You Go", is rather uptempo and frenetic. The track was about Dee Dee's then-girlfriend Connie, who {{was well known}} in the punk rock scene as having once dated New York Dolls bassist Arthur Kane and attempting to cut his finger off with a knife. Connie also harmed Dee Dee in several ways, such as slicing his buttocks with a beer bottle. At the time, every other member of the band despised Dee Dee's girlfriend and he eventually broke up with her. Joey recalls: [...] "Dee [...] and I came up with the song 'Glad to See You Go,' about Connie's leaving." [...] In the mid-1980s, Connie died from a drug overdose. [...] "Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment" [...] utilizes Joey's singing abilities with its vocal-demanding melody. Author Scott Schinder called the song a [...] "sing-along mental-illness ode." [...] The next song, [...] "I Remember You" [...] was said by author Greil Marcus to be all about the moment where [...] "Joey's voice turns the single word [...] "you" [...] into pure poetry." [...] "Oh, <b>Oh,</b> <b>I</b> Love Her So" [...] pays homage to the 1950s doo-wop genre, and consists of a three-chord barrage. The song was written solely by Joey, where in the song he humorously tells of how he met a girl at Burger King and they fell in love by a soda machine.|$|E

40|$|Full-bridge {{neutral point}} clamped (NPC) non-isolated {{inverter}} topologies {{are used to}} mitigate leakage current at switching frequency due to non-ideal circuit parameters. Among these topologies, this current is the highest in optimised non-isolated inverter (<b>oH</b> 5 <b>I)</b> despite lowest switch count. This study analyses the limitations of <b>oH</b> 5 <b>I</b> in mitigating the leakage current by considering the junction capacitance of switches into account. This analysis elucidates the dependency of common-mode voltage (CMV) characteristics on circuit topology and dead time requirement. In order to ascertain this fact, a novel non-isolated full-bridge NPC inverter (NIFB-NPCI) is proposed. The CMV characteristics of this inverter are analysed during mode transitions and compared with that in <b>oH</b> 5 <b>I.</b> A 1 kVA unified prototype circuit of these inverters is designed and fabricated for experimental validation. The circuit topology and dead time requirement of <b>oH</b> 5 <b>I</b> cause a spike in CMV during each mode transition. However, these limitations are addressed in the proposed inverter, and CMV is maintained at a constant value. Hence, NIFB-NPCI evinces lower leakage current at switching frequency than <b>oH</b> 5 <b>I.</b> Therefore, the effect of topological limitation of full-bridge NPC non-isolated inverters on leakage current mitigation is validated...|$|R

2500|$|This aspect-marking form of been or BIN is {{stressed}} and semantically {{distinct from}} the unstressed form: She BIN running ('She has been running for a long time') and She been running ('She has been running').

However, when been is used with stative verbs or gerund forms, been shows that the action began in the distant past and that it is continuing now. [...] suggests that a better translation when used with stative verbs is [...] "for a long time".
