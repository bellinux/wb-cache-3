5|$|On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf Air Force Base crashed, {{killing the}} pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were {{restricted}} to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation. The crash {{was attributed to}} a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly and did not engage the emergency <b>oxygen</b> <b>system.</b> Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects. She later reached a settlement. After the ruling, the engagement handle of the emergency <b>oxygen</b> <b>system</b> was redesigned; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure. On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.|$|E
40|$|Special {{considerations}} for <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> engineering {{with respect to}} system design, fabrication, and use are studied. The concerns for <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> include the problems of leakage and erosion, difficulties that arise from dynamic processes, and the sensitivity of <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> to contamination and cleaning requirements...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} in the literature that contamination within <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> can create significant fire hazards. Cleanliness limits for nonvolatile residues, ranging from 10 to 500 mg/sq m, have been established for various industries and types of <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> {{to reduce the risk of}} ignition of flammable organic films. Particulate cleanliness limits used for <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> vary considerably. Maximum allowed particle size, quantity limits, and allocations for fibers or metallic particles are all variables seen in aerospace cleanliness limits. Particles are known to have the potential to ignite within <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> and must be limited to prevent fires. Particulate contamination may also pose risks to the performance of <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> that are unrelated to ignition hazards. An extensive literature search was performed to better understand the relative importance of particle ignition mechanisms versus other deleterious effects of particles on <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> and to identify rationale for derivation of particulate cleanliness limits for specific systems. The identified risks of different types and sizes of particles and fibers were analyzed. This paper summarizes the risks identified and rationale that may be used to derive particulate cleanliness limits for specific <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the promise}} of the design, many {{operational}} officers were opposed to the use of volatile hydrogen peroxide aboard ship. Ultimately, the Mark 16 went into limited production while work on the Mark 17 was suspended in 1941, but resumed in 1944. Admiral Ernest King favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>system</b> was downgraded. As such, the U.S. Navy made no combat use of the oxygen torpedo design during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 1948, with {{fighting}} {{raging in}} Israel and Tel Aviv suffering from Royal Egyptian Air Force (REAF) raids, the three B-17s departed Å½atec for Israel. Still ill-equipped, the bombers were nevertheless tasked with bombing Egyptian targets en route. Flying {{south along the}} Adriatic, near Crete the bombers separated with Bill Katz and Ray Kurtz taking the only Fortress with an <b>oxygen</b> <b>system</b> and a proper sight to bomb the royal palace in Cairo, {{and the other two}} B-17s heading towards the REAF base at El-Arish. While Katz and Kurtz successfully bombed the Abdeen Palace, the other two failed to locate their target and bombed Rafah instead, and all landed that evening at Tel Nof. The three aircraft were back in action at 06:30 on the very next day, hitting the REAF base at El-Arish they had missed the previous night. As Tel-Nof was deemed vulnerable to Egyptian attacks, the aircraft then landed at Ramat David, which was to house the squadron {{for the remainder of the}} war. In following days, until a UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect on July 18, the Fortresses struck across three fronts, attacking Majdal, Damascus and Tulkarm. Raising the average bomb load of an IAF sortie from 100kg per sortie to 743kg per sortie, the B-17s are credited with propelling the Israeli Air Force into the realm of modern aerial warfare.|$|E

25|$|Promoted to {{lieutenant}} colonel on 1 March 1942, Carmichael {{was director of}} bombing at Allied Air Forces, Southwest Pacific Area from 26 March 1942 until 7 July 1942, when he became commander of the 19th Bombardment Group. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for another raid on Rabaul on 7 August 1942. This time {{the commander of the}} Allied Air Forces, Major General George Kenney, wanted a maximum effort to support the landing on Guadalcanal. He was hoping for twenty aircraft, but only 16 were operational. One bomber cracked up on takeoff from Port Moresby at 07:30, and two more had to abort with electrical or mechanical problems. The remaining thirteen bombed the target. They were then jumped by fifteen Japanese fighters. Both Carmichael's side gunners were killed, and his airplane was heavily damaged by hostile fire. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>system</b> was knocked out, forcing him to descend to low level. One bomber, flown by Captain Harl Pease was shot down. Kenney nominated Pease, who was later executed by the Japanese, for the Medal of Honor. Kenney was pleased with the results of the raid; he believed, and wrote in this post-war account, that as many as 120 Japanese aircraft might have been destroyed. In fact, damage to the target airfield was superficial, not a single Japanese plane was lost on the ground, and not one fighter was shot down, although a dozen were damaged.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{above and beyond}} the call of duty. The aircraft of which Sgt. Smith was a gunner was subjected to intense enemy antiaircraft fire and determined fighter aircraft attacks while returning from a mission over enemy-occupied continental Europe on 1 May 1943. The aircraft was hit several times by antiaircraft fire and cannon shells of the fighter aircraft, 2 of the crew were seriously wounded, the aircraft's <b>oxygen</b> <b>system</b> shot out, and several vital control cables severed when intense fires were ignited simultaneously in the radio compartment and waist sections. The situation became so acute that 3 of the crew bailed out into the comparative safety of the sea. Sgt. Smith, then on his first combat mission, elected to fight the fire by himself, administered first aid to the wounded tail gunner, manned the waist guns, and fought the intense flames alternately. The escaping oxygen fanned the fire to such intense heat that the ammunition in the radio compartment began to explode, the radio, gun mount, and camera were melted, and the compartment completely gutted. Sgt. Smith threw the exploding ammunition overboard, fought the fire until all the firefighting aids were exhausted, manned the workable guns until the enemy fighters were driven away, further administered first aid to his wounded comrade, and then by wrapping himself in protecting cloth, completely extinguished the fire by hand. This soldier's gallantry in action, undaunted bravery, and loyalty to his aircraft and fellow crewmembers, without regard for his own personal safety, is an inspiration to the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|E
