Well, {{it was not long}} before he sensed {{something}} was wrong and whipped the scarf off the poor lad's face. He stormed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> cabin and dragged me out, half asleep, on to the track. That was that! He and the other officials kept their eyes on us after that and we had little chance of getting away with any more larks like that.|$|E
500|$|Relating to his {{responsibility}} as a celebrity, PewDiePie has stated [...] "many people {{see me as}} a friend they can chill with for 15 minutes a day", adding, [...] "The loneliness {{in front of the}} computer screens brings us together. But I never set out to be a role model; I just want to invite them to come <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> place." [...] Correlating with this note, his audience has been reported to provide positive remarks about him; some of his viewers created and contributed to a thread expressing that he has made them happier and feel better about themselves. Conversely, during an informal Twitter poll conducted by one Kotaku reporter, respondents described him as [...] "annoying" [...] and an [...] "obnoxious waste of time." [...] Additionally, Rolling Stone has documented the existence of several Reddit threads dedicated to sharing disparaging views of PewDiePie.|$|E
500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to put her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E

500|$|... "Beautiful" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Linda Perry. Aguilera recorded the song at two studios: The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood. Prior to the collaboration with Aguilera, Perry {{had written the}} song and originally wished to keep the [...] "personal" [...] record for her own singing career. Perry initially previewed the song for Pink during the recording sessions of Pink's second studio album Missundaztood (2001), on which Perry is a producer. However, after hearing Aguilera sing the song at Perry's house to [...] "break the ice", Perry was very impressed and allowed Aguilera to include the track on her then upcoming record Stripped, effectively deciding not to pursue a solo career. The choice resulted in a feud between Pink against Aguilera and Perry, with the former commenting that it was [...] "annoying" [...] for the latter to collaborate with artists [...] " [...] didn't like". Perry later revealed to ASCAP, [...] "When Christina came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> house to start working, {{she asked me to}} play some songs to break the ice. [...] I had a long conversation with my manager about it. We both decided to hear Christina sing it. We demoed the song with her singing it, and I was like, 'Wow'. That rough vocal is what is out there on radio. It was that vocal that got her the song". Perry's wife Sara Gilbert confirmed on her show The Talk that the final version was [...] "just a demo." [...] Gilbert also revealed that Aguilera wanted to rerecord the song because she didn't like the initial vocals. Perry denied the request because the song is supposed to be about imperfection and being vulnerable.|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{made his}} sophomore debut on November 7, 2010, in an {{exhibition}} game against East Stroudsburg. He added 10 points, 6 assists, and two steals. Frazier also recorded a team-high 4 turnovers. DeChellis commented, [...] "Offensively we were poor tonight and we had too many turnovers... something we've struggled with in practice." [...] On November 12, 2010, Frazier made his second appearance as a sophomore with 6 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1 steal. He shot 1-of-5 on field goals, while going a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. Frazier was named the game's starting shooting guard and was allowed 30 minutes of playing time. He made his first-ever appearance as Penn State's starting point guard on November 19 vs. Fairfield, and contributed 3 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1 steal. The team's coach commented on Frazier's powerful defensive performance, [...] "thought Tim Frazier did a very nice job defensively on the point guard for Fairfield who {{is a really good}} player.

He made a late miscue guarding Juan Fernández, allowing the opposing guard to close out the game with under one second remaining in regulation. Frazier recalled the moment, [...] "I closed out high end so he wouldn't be able to shoot over me. (He) made a great move, pivoted {{a couple of times and}} then stepped through." [...] Fernández said, [...] "I was thinking about shooting a jump shot but I killed my dribble and (Tim) Frazier was right there. For some reason he jumped <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> right and that gave me the space to go left." [...] By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 6.3 points, 5.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 0.1 blocks per game. He was named to the Academic All-Big Ten following 2010–11.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1896 Hearst {{dispatched}} Bierce to Washington, D.C. to foil this attempt. The {{essence of}} the plot was secrecy; the railroads' advocates hoped to get the bill through Congress without any public notice or hearings. When the angered Huntington confronted Bierce {{on the steps of}} the Capitol and told Bierce to name his price, Bierce's answer ended up in newspapers nationwide: [...] "My price is one hundred thirty million dollars.

2500|$|Kirby {{moved on}} to comic-book {{publisher}} and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate, earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary.

During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon, who {{in addition to his}} staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, [...] "I loved Jack's work and the first time I saw it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together.
