A total of fourteen AGR reactors at six sites were built between 1976 and 1988. All of these are configured with two reactors in a single building. Each reactor has a design thermal power output of 1,500 MWt driving a 660 MWe turbine-alternator set. The various AGR stations produce outputs in the range 555 MWe to 670 MWe though some run at lower than design output due to <b>operational</b> <b>restrictions.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing. WE.177A {{was limited to}} a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1.15 at low level on TSR-2, otherwise the bomb's temperature would rise above its permitted maximum. This would impose a severe <b>operational</b> <b>restriction</b> on TSR-2, as the aircraft was designed for M=1+ cruise at this height.|$|R
500|$|The first bombers {{equipped}} with Project E weapons were English Electric Canberra bombers based in Germany and the United Kingdom that {{were assigned to}} NATO. These were replaced by Vickers Valiant bombers in 1960 and 1961 as the long-range Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor assumed the strategic nuclear weapon delivery role. Project E weapons equipped V-bombers at three bases in the United Kingdom from 1958. Due to <b>operational</b> <b>restrictions</b> imposed by Project E, and the consequential loss of independence of half of the British nuclear deterrent, they were phased out in 1962 when sufficient British megaton weapons became available, but remained in use with the Valiants in the United Kingdom and RAF Germany until 1965.|$|E
500|$|After {{the poor}} {{steaming}} of the Urie batch was addressed, the class proved popular amongst crews, mechanically reliable {{and capable of}} high speeds. However, their heavy hammerblow at speed meant that they were prone to rough riding and instability. The two Maunsell batches with their streamlined steam passages and better draughting arrangements were superior in performance, and were a popular choice when Bulleid’s locomotives were unavailable. Their use of standard parts considerably eased maintenance, and the fitting of different tender and cab sizes meant few <b>operational</b> <b>restrictions</b> for the class on mainline routes. The class gave many years of service, and were noted {{for their ability to}} [...] "do the job". The electrification of the Eastern and Central sections and the increasing number of Bulleid Pacifics in service meant the lack of a suitable role for the class under British Railways ownership. In spite of the reduction in work, high mileages were obtained with No.30745 Tintagel achieving [...] in service.|$|E

They had a yield {{of up to}} [...] The successful British development of the hydrogen bomb, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the sputnik crisis, led to the United States Atomic Energy Act being amended again in 1958, resulting in the long-sought resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between Britain and the United States {{in the form of}} the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement. The United States now agreed to supply the V-bombers with megaton weapons in place of the Mark 5, in the form of Mark 15 and Mark 39 nuclear bombs. The Treasury immediately inquired as to whether this meant that the British megaton bomb programme could be terminated. The answer was no; the <b>operational</b> <b>restrictions</b> imposed by Project E [...] "effectively handed the US government a veto over the use of half of Britain's nuclear deterrent". With sufficient British bombs on hand, operational issues, and the concept of an independent nuclear deterrent came to the fore.|$|E

40|$|In {{repairable}} {{redundant systems}} the failed units {{can either be}} repaired or replaced by identical standby to reduce the system down time. The failed units are inspected for repair/replacement. In this paper, two stochastic models for 2 (k) -out-of- 3 (n) redundant system of identical units with repair and inspection are examined stochastically. The system is considered in up-state only if 2 (k) -out-of- 3 (n) units are operative in both the models. Normally, the server either attends the system promptly or may take some time, after failure. The system is studied under an <b>operational</b> <b>restriction</b> on the inspection i. e. in case when system has only one unit in operational mode the server has to attend the system for inspection. Semi-Markov processes and Regenerative point technique is adopted to obtain the expressions for measures of system effectiveness such as transition probabilities, mean sojourn times, mean time to system failure, steady state availabilities, busy periods, expected number of visits etc. Cost-analysis is also carried out for the system models...|$|R

40|$|The mean {{local time}} (MLT) of {{equatorial}} crossing of a sun-synchronous Earth-observing spacecraft orbit drifts with inclination; therefore, {{in order to}} maintain the MLT, the inclination must be controlled. Inclination may be maintained actively by costly out-of-plane maneuvers or passively by using the perturbing forces due to the sun and moon. This paper examines the passive control approach using the Earth Observing System (EOS) as a basis for the discussion. Applications to Landsat and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spacecraft are presented for comparison. This technique is especially beneficial to spacecraft lacking propulsion systems. The results indicate that passive inclination control appears to be the preferable maintenance method when spacecraft weight <b>restrictions,</b> <b>operational</b> considerations, and scientific requirements apply...|$|R

40|$|Research Question and Problem Statement: Developing a {{sustainable}} financial systems for poor {{is critical for}} any developing economy particularly Bangladesh for various reasons. Firstly, it will include a large population of bankable poor into formal financial sector who are currently excluded and hence will benefit both parties over a long run. Secondly, generating sustainable funds for skilled/semi-skilled poor {{to start a business}} will increase number of micro and small enterprises and employment. Thirdly, sustainable financial service with access to credit can help poverty reduction through improving the productivity of micro and small enterprises or creating new opportunities of livelihood. Though micro credit for helping poor in the context of Bangladesh is not a new idea, yet question remains on the sustainability of such institutions which are mostly backed by donor funds or government funds with high risk of insolvency along with high transaction cost (due to high cost of capital at 26. 5 per cent on loan and advances) (Hossain, 1998, p. 7). The micro finance institutions are not recognised as regulated financial institutions which impact the ability and cost of finance and transactions. The regulatory and <b>operational</b> <b>restriction</b> often result in rationing out sectors of the client population which the institutions and programmes want to serve and eventually questions the sustainability of micro-finance institutions and programmes working with the poor. In this bleak situation, a second generation social bank in Bangladesh focusing on a new model to bank with poor {{is considered to be a}} bold step towards building sustainable financial system for banking with the poor. The main research objective is to explore the views held by bank directors as well as managers towards their mission statement for ‘Empowering real poor families and create local income opportunities’ and ‘Providing support for social benefit organizations - by way of mobilizing funds and social services’ and thus analyse the findings from the unique socio-economic-political-regulatory context of developing economy like Bangladesh. This longitudinal case study will explore the participatory three sector banking model developed by the bank which includes: i) Formal sector : dealing with human face approach to credit and banking on the profit and loss sharing ii) Non—formal sector: informal finance and credit package that empowers and humanizes real poor family and create local income opportunities and discourage internal migration iii) Voluntary sector: responding spontaneously to its social commitment to help hard core poor with various welfare activities The purpose of the study is to focus on the model for sustainable banking with the poor in the context of developing economy which will contribute towards reduction of poverty...|$|R
