At 16 years of age, she graduated from Fitchburg High School, and, beginning in 1870, she attended Wheaton Female Seminary, now Wheaton College. When she was 16 and 17 years old she wrote essays for Rushlight, the school's literary journal. The nature of her essays {{provide insight into the}} woman she would become: <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> successfully operate in a male-oriented society, had an interest in bettering the plight of others, and appreciated historical things. She graduated in 1872. Frances Vose Emerson was a classmate at Wheaton, good friend from childhood, and ultimately a trustee for the Fitchburg Art Museum.|$|E

Additional veteran troops came from {{the remains of the}} former Army of England. The new mililary doctrine emphasised the offensive, mobility and the bayonet, over linear firepower. In front of the Austrian army were stationed, in and to the south of Marengo, the corps of Victor (Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne's divisions), supported on the left by François Étienne de Kellermann's cavalry and, further to the northeast, by the corps of Lannes (François Watrin's division, Mainoni's brigade) together with two cavalry brigades. To the east of Castel Ceriolo took position Jean-Charles Monnier's division, supported by the Guard, which formed the reserve.

25|$|However, Baldwin II {{also thought}} {{that he would have}} to marry Melisende to a {{powerful}} ally, <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> protect and safeguard Melisende's inheritance and her future heirs. Baldwin deferred to King Louis VI of France to recommend a Frankish vassal for his daughter's hand. The Frankish connection remained an important consideration for Crusader Jerusalem, as the nascent kingdom depended heavily on manpower and connections from France, Germany, and Italy. By deferring to France, Baldwin II was not submitting Jerusalem to the suzerainty of France, rather was placing the moral guardianship of the Outremer with the West for its survival, reminding Louis VI that the Outremer was, to some extent, Frankish lands.|$|E
25|$|In 1818 John Edwards senior died. John Edwards junior {{was now in}} sole {{possession}} of Rheola. He had married twice and both wives brought considerable inheritances with them which, added to his own inheritance and successful professional activities, meant he was a person of some substance. He had run for parliament to represent Glamorganshire in 1817 and failed to be elected. The local landed gentry, unimpressed {{by the idea of}} an outsider and a mere solicitor representing them, ensured a preferred candidate, Sir Christopher Cole, was elected. At the next year's general election, Edwards stood again, and Cole could not afford to run against him. Capitalising on his Neath valley residence and Welsh ancestry, Edwards stood as <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> stand up against the clique of landed gentry. He appealed to lesser gentry, industrialists and professional men, and was, uniquely for a county seat, elected against the interests of the leading landowners, who duly snubbed him. Two years later, when his term of office ended, he did not stand again, and chose rather to focus on the Wells constituency, where he served for two further years from 1830.|$|E

25|$|Of all {{the architects}} {{associated}} with Blacket, the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> become most famous was John Horbury Hunt, {{who worked with}} him from 1863 to 1868. It was at this time, that Blacket's architecture developed bolder forms, based upon Norman, Transitional and Early French Gothic architecture, rather than the more refined Gothic. This is particularly noticeable in the presence of simple round windows divided by four circles of tracery in the gables of several churches of this time. Blacket permitted his staff to enter competitions, and it was while at Blacket's office that Horbury Hunt won the commission for Newcastle Cathedral, to be executed in his preferred material of brick. The brick church at Tumut, consecrated in 1873, is ascribed to Blacket, but appears to owe much to Hunt. Hunt, who lived most of his early life in North America, had previously worked under Edward Clarke Cabot. One of the innovations that he introduced to Australian architecture while working for Blacket was the saw-tooth roof for industrial building, which was employed at Mort's Woolstore. Hunt appears to have been influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly Philip Webb, and ultimately he created buildings of great originality such as the Anglican Cathedrals of Grafton and Armidale.|$|E
25|$|Hugo Gressmann {{has found}} 22 similar stories in world {{folklore}} and literature, especially in India {{and the far}} east. One Indian version is a Jataka story dealing with Buddha {{in one of his}} previous incarnations as the sage Mahosadha, who arbitrates between a mother and a Yakshini who is {{in the shape of a}} woman, who kidnapped the mother's baby and claimed he was hers. The sage announced a tug war: He drew a line on the ground and asked the two to stand on opposite sides of the line, one holding his feet and the other his hands – The <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> pull the baby's whole body beyond the line would get him. The mother, seeing how the baby suffers, released him and let the Yakshini take him, weeping. When the sage saw that, he turned the baby back to the hands of the true mother, exposed the identity of the Yakshini and expelled her. In other Indian versions the two women are widows of one husband. Another version appears in the Chinese drama The Chalk Circle (in this version the judge draws a circle on the ground), which has been widespread all over the world and many versions and reworkings were made after it, among them The Caucasian Chalk Circle, a play by Bertolt Brecht.|$|E

500|$|Her {{greatest}} critic was Kenneth Tynan who ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 {{production of}} Titus Andronicus, commenting that she [...] "receives {{the news that}} {{she is about to}} be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have preferred foam rubber." [...] He was also critical of her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role. After her death, however, Tynan revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as [...] "one of the worst errors of judgment" [...] he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, [...] "made more sense... than the usual battle-axe" [...] portrayal of the character. In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named her performance as Lady Macbeth as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.|$|E
500|$|The {{division}} {{among the}} generals {{came to a}} head {{at a meeting of the}} MRC on August 26–27. Khánh said the instability was due to troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), whom he accused of putting partisan plotting ahead of the national interest. Prominent officers associated with the Đại Việt included Thieu and Khiêm. Khiêm blamed Khánh's weakness in dealing with Buddhist activists for the demonstrations in the cities and the rural losses to the communists. Thieu and another Catholic General Nguyễn Hữu Có called for the replacement of Khánh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh claimed that Khánh was the only <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> get funding from Washington, so they should support him, prompting Khiêm to angrily say [...] "Obviously, Khánh is a puppet of the US government, and we are tired of being told by the Americans how we should run our internal affairs."
