5|$|The Crawford {{expedition}}, {{also known}} as the Sandusky expedition and Crawford's Defeat, was a 1782 campaign on the western front of the American Revolutionary War, and one of the final operations of the conflict. Led by Colonel William Crawford, the campaign's goal was to destroy enemy American Indian towns along the Sandusky River in the Ohio Country, with the hope <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> Indian attacks on American settlers. The expedition was one in a long series of raids against enemy settlements which both sides had conducted throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The Easter Rising was a {{rebellion}} staged in Ireland during Easter Week, 1916. It was mounted by Irish republicans with the aims <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> British rule in Ireland and establishing an Irish Republic. Organised by the Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the rising lasted from 24–30 April 1916. Members of the Irish Volunteers, {{joined by the}} smaller Irish Citizen Army, along with 200 members of Cumann na mBan, seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic independent of Britain.|$|E
30|$|Exploring the {{motivation}} <b>of</b> <b>end</b> users: We {{would like to}} better understand {{the motivation}} <b>of</b> <b>end</b> users and have therefore started collaborating with the Department of Psychology at the University of Zurich. The degree <b>of</b> <b>end</b> user commitment may vary within projects. In some projects, it might be the duty <b>of</b> <b>end</b> users to participate in requirements elicitation, prioritization and negotiation activities. Other end users might draw motivation from different sources (e.g. interest in the topic, supporting a friend, curiosity). Better understanding the motivation <b>of</b> <b>end</b> users will support us in defining more stable and predictable approaches.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. If G is a group, a pseudocharacter f: G → R is a {{function}} which is “almost ” a homomorphism. If G admits a nontrivial pseudocharacter f, we define the space <b>of</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> G relative to f and show that if the space <b>of</b> <b>ends</b> is complicated enough, then G contains a nonabelian free group. We also construct a quasi-action by G on a tree whose space <b>of</b> <b>ends</b> contains the space <b>of</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> G relative to f. This construction gives rise to examples of “exotic ” quasi-actions on trees...|$|R

5|$|The {{withdrawal}} method (also {{known as}} coitus interruptus) is the practice <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> intercourse ("pulling out") before ejaculation. The main {{risk of the}} withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner. First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage. It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.|$|E

5|$|When Otho was {{defeated}} by Vitellius at the First Battle of Bedriacum, the armies in Judaea and Egypt took {{matters into their own}} hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69. Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus, the governor of Syria, against Vitellius. A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to Alexandria, leaving Titus in charge <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> the Jewish rebellion.|$|E
5|$|After {{abortive}} {{talks between}} Smith and Wilson in 1966 and 1968, a constitution was agreed {{upon by the}} Rhodesian and British governments in November 1971; however, when a British test of Rhodesian public opinion was undertaken in early 1972, black opinion was judged to be against the new deal, causing it to be shelved. The Rhodesian Bush War suddenly re-erupted in December 1972, {{after two years of}} relative inactivity, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. After a successful security force counter-campaign during 1973 and 1974, drastic changes in the foreign policy of the Rhodesian government's two main backers, Portugal and South Africa, caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the nationalists' favour. In April 1974, the Portuguese government was overthrown by a military coup and replaced with a leftist administration in favour <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> the unpopular Colonial War in Angola, Mozambique and Portugal's other African territories.|$|E

Similarly, Djokovic achieved world No. 1 status following his Wimbledon victory in 2011, after four consecutive years at No. 3, in a season which is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest in the history of the sport. Murray reached the number one position after the Paris Masters on 7 November 2016, towards the end of a season in which he had made 3 Grand Slam finals (winning one, Wimbledon), as well as winning the Olympic Games and three Masters tournaments.|$|E

5|$|In 1845, the Senate {{took up the}} {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> the joint occupancy of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain. Lewis Cass, a senator from Michigan, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that a war with the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, and insisted that Britain be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended {{in order to allow}} time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations' claims at the 49th parallel north.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000–01 season, Arsenal {{finished}} second in the Premier League for the third consecutive season – this time ten points behind Manchester United. The title race was as good as over by February, when Arsenal lost 6–1 to United at Old Trafford. The season gave priority to cups, with the best chance <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> their three-year wait for a trophy being in the FA Cup; Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-finals and met Liverpool in the final. Although they dominated most of the match and went a goal up, they succumbed to two late Michael Owen goals and lost 2–1.|$|E

In the early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping in the store, and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for any black entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E

5|$|NY18 was {{extended}} northeastward to Rochester {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, effectively doubling the route's length. Instead <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> at the junction of Ohio and Main Streets (the latter then part of NY5) in downtown Buffalo, NY18 now overlapped with NY5 along Main Street north to Niagara Falls Boulevard, where it turned north and proceeded to Lake Ontario over NY34. At Youngstown, the route turned east, following a previously unnumbered alignment along the lakeshore to Rochester, where it ended at NY31 (now NY104) in Kodak Park. The route {{was extended}} further eastward to NY250 in Webster by the following year by way of East Ridge Road, Culver Road, and Lake Road. NY18 was never extended eastward past its junction with NY250.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany, {{supported}} by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, {{with the ultimate}} goal <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.|$|E
5|$|The Daleks in London, {{commissioned}} on 25 May 1971, {{was to be}} {{the final}} story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence. Little is known about the exact storyline of the six-part Robert Sloman serial, {{other than the fact that}} it would have had some similarities to The Dalek Invasion of Earth, except set in contemporary London. This similarity caused the production team some concern, and producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.|$|E
