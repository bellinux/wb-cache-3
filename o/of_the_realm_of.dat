25|$|This view is {{not shared}} by Andrew Baruch Wachtel (Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation) who sees him as a {{partisan}} of South Slav unity, albeit in a limited sense, in that his linguistic definition emphasized what united South Slavs rather than the religious differences that had earlier divided them. However, {{one might argue that}} such a definition is very partisan: Karadžić himself eloquently and explicitly professed that his aim was to unite all native Shtokavian speakers whom he identified as Serbs. Therefore, Vuk Karadžić's central linguistic-political aim was the growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> Serbdom according to his ethnic-linguistic ideas and not a unity of any sort between Serbs and the other nations.|$|E
25|$|At {{least in}} regards to the One, Michael Erler concludes from a {{statement}} in the Republic that Plato held it was only intuitively knowable. In contrast, Peter Stemmer, Kurt von Fritz, Jürgen Villers, and others oppose any independent role for non-verbal intuition. Jens Halfwassen believes that knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> the Forms rests centrally upon direct intuition, which he understands as unmediated comprehension by some non-sensory, 'inner perception' (Ger., Anschauung). He also, however, holds that Plato's highest principle transcended knowledge and was thus inaccessible to such intuition. For Plato, the One would therefore make knowledge possible and give it the power of knowing things, but would itself remain unknowable and ineffable.|$|E

He arose like a storm of wind and fire from the inferno pits of Angband beneath the Iron Mountains, as a last defense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> Dor Daedeloth. Near the end of the War of Wrath that pitted Morgoth's hosts against the Host of the Valar, Morgoth sent Ancalagon leading a fleet of winged dragons from the fortress of Angband to destroy the Dark Lord's enemies. So powerful was the assault of the dragon flight that the Host of the Valar was driven back from the gates of Angband onto the ashy plain of Anfauglith.|$|E
25|$|Legenden om Ljusets rike or Sagnet om Lysets rike in some Scandinavian {{language}} (in English The Legend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Light; {{this novel}} {{has not been}} translated into English) {{is a set of}} fantasy novels by Norwegian-Swedish writer Margit Sandemo. It includes twenty titles. This set of novels can be read in Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic and Polish. Margit Sandemo says that she wrote this series of novels because she wanted, like many other fiction writers, to portray her own view about an idealized world. Another reason to write Legenden om Ljusets rike was for the character called Marco who Sandemo created in the end of The Legend of the Ice People. She was so fond of him that she wanted to write more about Marco in the following series of novels. Those ideas took shape in her mind when she had written around half of Häxmästaren.|$|E
