5|$|After the war, Daniel {{continued}} {{in his private}} law practice while remaining active in the anti-alcohol cause. He was elected president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Temperance Alliance when it was formed in 1872. He was re-elected to that position annually for the next twelve years. During that time, the local option law Daniel favored while in the legislature became law; thirteen of the state's twenty-three counties (including Somerset) adopted prohibition under the statute. Throughout his leadership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Temperance Alliance, Daniel remained {{a member of the}} Republican Party, but in 1884 he left to join the small Prohibition Party.|$|E

50|$|Born in Leesburg, Virginia, Gore was a {{prominent}} Maryland political heavy weight and daughter of lawyer and real estate investor H. Grady Gore. She served as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland's</b> General Assembly from 1963 to 1969. She was a Republican National Committee member from 1972 to 1984 and worked for Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidential campaign in 1952.|$|R

5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Senate {{lie in the}} {{creation}} of an assembly during the early days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> colony. This assembly first met in 1637, making it the longest continuously operating legislative body in the United States. Originally, the assembly was unicameral, but in 1650, the Governor and his appointed council began serving as the upper house of a now bicameral legislature. These appointees had close political and economic ties to the proprietors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> colony, Cecilius Calvert and his descendants. Thus, the upper house in colonial times often disagreed with the lower house, which was elected, tended to be more populist, and pushed for greater legislative power in the colony.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} extension {{from the}} line's Greenbelt terminus to Baltimore Washington International Airport has been studied. This expansion, which would also serve the Laurel and Fort Meade areas of central Maryland, would link the Washington Metro {{system to the}} Baltimore Light Rail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Transit Administration.|$|E

5|$|Leggett {{was elected}} as {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Association of Counties in January 2015. In January 2017, he vetoed a bill {{which would have}} gradually raised the county minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Maryland's Senate {{consists}} of Senators elected from 47 Senate districts. While each Senator {{has the power}} to introduce and vote on bills and make motions on the floor, various committees, caucuses, and leadership positions help to organize the work of the Senate. Senators elect a President of the Senate, who serves as the presiding officer of the chamber. They also elect a President Pro Tempore, who presides over the chamber when the President is absent. The President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Senate has significant influence over legislation that passes through the body through both formal means, such as his ability to appoint committee chairs and leaders of the majority party, and informal means that are less easily defined. These powers place the President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Senate among the strongest state legislature presiding officers in the country.|$|E
5|$|Mathias' {{candidacy}} consideration did not endear him to {{the conservative}} wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Republican Party organization. In June 1976, he lost a vote by state Republicans to determine who would represent Maryland on the platform committee at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Instead, the group chose George Price, a conservative member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> House of Delegates from Baltimore County. At one point, Mathias was close to being denied attendance to the convention altogether as an at-large delegate, but a last minute compromise ensured all Republican congressional representatives seats as at-large delegates. Mathias maintained a low profile during the convention, and received harsh criticism {{from some of the}} conservative delegates from Maryland who attended.|$|E
50|$|Built between 1774 and 1777, {{the present}} church {{building}} is a Georgian structure of Flemish bond brick with random glazed headers.

2500|$|The Carroll {{family were}} slaveholders, and Charles Carroll was himself a {{substantial}} and wealthy planter. Carroll was opposed {{in principle to}} slavery, asking rhetorically [...] "Why keep alive <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> slavery? It is admitted by all {{to be a great}} evil". However, although he supported its gradual abolition, he did not free his own slaves. [...] Carroll introduced a bill for <b>the</b> gradual abolition <b>of</b> slavery in <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> senate but it did not pass. [...] In 1828, aged 91, he served as president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Auxiliary State Colonization Society <b>of</b> <b>Maryland,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Colonization Society, an organization dedicated to returning black Americans to lead free lives in African states such as Liberia.|$|R
5|$|On March 28, 2013 Smith {{was picked}} by the Ravens to {{represent}} the team at the Maryland State capital in Annapolis. Smith, along with Ravens' president Dick Cass spoke to the assembled members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> House of Delegates and then the Maryland State Senate.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings, a Marylander, was {{exchanged}} from British captivity in late December 1777 or January 1778, the Board of War, at {{the request}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> state government, assigned him command of the prisoner-of-war camp at Fort Frederick, Maryland, and its state militia guard. The elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> and Virginia Rifle Regiment in the field continued to be led by the company commanders until recruiting could bring the regiment up to greater strength. Maj. Otho Holland Williams, exchanged on January 16, 1778 (likely with Rawlings), had been promoted to colonel of the 6th Maryland Regiment in December 1776 while a prisoner of war; he took command of this unit upon his release. The position of major in the reduced Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was never refilled.|$|E

5|$|Violence {{erupted in}} Baltimore on July 20, with police and {{soldiers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> National Guard clashing with crowds of thousands gathered throughout the city. In response, President Rutherford B. Hayes ordered federal troops to Baltimore, local officials recruited {{as many as}} 500 additional police, and two entirely new national guard regiments were formed. Peace was restored on July 22.|$|E
5|$|Byrd was {{appointed}} to the post of assistant university president in 1918. He became a proponent of unification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Agricultural College and the Baltimore professional schools into a single public University of Maryland, and he was instrumental in what became the Consolidation Act of 1920. Byrd named the student newspaper The Diamondback in 1921, and in 1933, he was the lead advocate for the adoption of the diamondback terrapin as the university's official nickname and mascot.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{received}} a commission from Calvert as the colony's Attorney General on July 18, 1688, and {{arrived in the}} colony in October 1688. En route, Carroll changed his family motto from In fide et in bello forte (strong in faith and war) to Ubicumque cum libertate (anywhere {{so long as there}} be freedom). Soon after he left, the Protestant William of Orange invaded England, James II fled, and Parliament—which had been leery of James' Catholicism—recognized William and his wife Mary as the new King and Queen two weeks after Carroll's arrival in Maryland. This event, known as the Glorious Revolution, had profound implications for the future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> colony and for Carroll.|$|E

2500|$|The Cumberland Narrows acts as {{a western}} gateway from Cumberland to the Appalachian Plateau and the Ohio River Valley beyond.

In addition, the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line between Baltimore/Washington and Pittsburgh, now part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CSX system, and a former line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Maryland</b> Railroad, now used by the steam- and {{diesel-powered}} excursion trains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Maryland</b> Scenic Railroad, also use this route.|$|R
50|$|In 1868, <b>Maryland</b> founded <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Oyster Navy, {{predecessor}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern <b>Maryland</b> Natural Resources Police.
