25|$|The {{concept of}} natural {{products}} {{dates back to}} the early 19th century, when the foundations of organic chemistry were laid. Organic chemistry was regarded at that time as the chemistry of substances that plants and animals are composed <b>of.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> relatively complex form of chemistry and stood in stark contrast to inorganic chemistry, the principles of which had been established in 1789 by the Frenchman Antoine Lavoisier in his work Traité Élémentaire de Chimie.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{construction}} work continued on the planned route. To {{the east of}} the tunnel, the Hunters Point Avenue subway station went up {{to the level of the}} Hunterspoint Avenue LIRR station. Immediately east <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> ramp up to the elevated subway towards Queensboro Plaza. Hunters Point Avenue opened on February 15, 1916, and on November 5 of the same year, it was extended to Queensboro Plaza. Because of the lack of track connections to the rest of the IRT network, a provisional maintenance workshop was operated at the tunnel ramp until 1928. To the west, construction began in 1922. The tunnel was extended to Fifth Avenue on March 23, 1926, and Times Square on March 14, 1927.|$|E

25|$|This scheme, on {{the face}} <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fairly {{standard}} colour light system, with each stop signal (which could show red or green) having an attendant repeater signal (showing red, yellow or green – the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). What made the scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional signal head ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This marker light was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the marker light was offset to the left-hand side of the post {{to indicate that the}} 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two.|$|E

Literary historian Joel Porte suggests the American reading public during this period {{was more interested in}} fiction than poetry. Despite its lack of attention, the publication of Tamerlane and Other Poems gave a young Poe the confidence to continue writing.|$|E

500|$|Franklin's first {{experiments}} {{explained in}} this first set of letters to Collinson that the Leyden jar, a type of capacitor, had equal and opposite charges on {{the inner and outer}} conductors. This was shown in illustrations in his book. The significant Franklin theory introduced to Collinson in a letter dated April 29, 1747, was the concept of the [...] "dissectible condenser." [...] Today we call this distribution of charges in a device, a capacitor. He observed that a charge was built up on both sides between a piece of nonconducting material. In the case of the Leyden jar this was glass (nonconducting matter) and on each side <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> metal material (conducting matter). These opposite metal layers had the exact opposite electric charges (positive and negative). He observed that when the wire {{on the inside of the}} jar was electrised positively by a certain amount, that the outer conductor simultaneously became electrised negatively in the same proportion.|$|E

Beyond, the line rose on an embankment to Crowle swing bridge, crossing three brick arches over a road and a drain, a [...] girder bridge over the Scunthorpe to Doncaster main line, and another brick arch as it approached.

[...] Coppola opted to fall somewhere in the middle, with mixed results. Updating the story line was limited to changing Woody from a labor organizer to the manager of a sharecroppers' cooperative, making college-student Howard a research botanist, and a few minor changes to the lyrics in the Burton Lane-E. Y. Harburg score, such as changing a reference to Carmen Miranda to Zsa Zsa Gabor. Other than that, the plot remains firmly entrenched in an era that predates the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
2500|$|A pageant play by Eliot called The Rock was {{performed}} in 1934 {{for the benefit of}} churches in the Diocese of London. Much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses. George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester, had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer E. Martin Browne for the production of The Rock, and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the Canterbury Festival in 1935. This one, Murder in the Cathedral, concerning the death of the martyr, Thomas Becket, was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer Peter Ackroyd comments that [...] "for , Murder in the Cathedral and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility." [...] After this, he worked on more [...] "commercial" [...] plays for more general audiences: The Family Reunion (1939), The Cocktail Party (1949), The Confidential Clerk, (1953) and The Elder Statesman (1958) (the latter three were produced by Henry Sherek and directed by E. Martin Browne). The Broadway production in New York of The Cocktail Party received the 1950 Tony Award for Best Play. Eliot wrote The Cocktail Party while he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study.|$|E
2500|$|An Irish Latin psalter of {{the early}} 7th century, {{this is perhaps the}} oldest known Irish {{manuscript}} of any sort. [...] It contains only decorated letters, {{at the beginning of each}} Psalm, but these already show distinctive traits. [...] Not just the initial, but the first few letters are decorated, at diminishing sizes. [...] The decoration influences the shape of the letters, and various decorative forms are mixed in a very unclassical way. Lines are already inclined to spiral and metamorphose, as in the example shown. Apart from black, some orange ink is used for dotted decoration. [...] The classical tradition was late to use capital letters for initials at all (in Roman texts it is often very hard to even separate the words), and though by this time they were in common use in Italy, they were often set in the left margin, as though to cut them off from the rest of the text. [...] The insular tendency for the decoration to lunge into the text, and take over more and more <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> radical innovation. The Bobbio Jerome which according to an inscription dates to before 622, from Bobbio Abbey, an Irish mission centre in northern Italy, has a more elaborate initial with colouring, showing Insular characteristics still more developed, even in such an outpost. From the same scriptorium and of similar date, the Bobbio Orosius has the earliest carpet page, although a relatively simple one.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, the Lakers won {{the title}} again; however, O'Neal and Bryant began feuding during the season. O'Neal came into {{training}} camp out of shape, which disappointed Jackson and also Bryant, who worked hard over the offseason {{to improve his}} game. Bryant was leading the league in scoring as 2001 began, and Jackson said Bryant was playing the best ball of his career. O'Neal was shooting below 50 percent during stretches, and his free throw shooting was in the 20 percent range. O'Neal said of the Lakers in January, [...] "When {{it was clear that}} everything went through me, the outcome <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> (<b>a</b> record of) 67–15, playing with enthusiasm, the city jumping up and down and a parade. And now we're 23–11. You figure it out ... I don't know why anybody else would want to change – other than selfish reasons." [...] Bryant responded that it was a different year and the roster had undergone some changes and [...] "things change, things evolve, {{and you just have to}} grow with that change." [...] Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka said a key factor was the team's defense after losing Fisher for most of the season. O'Neal requested a trade after a blowout win against the Phoenix Suns where Bryant scored 38 and O'Neal scored 18. Jackson commented that their actions were [...] "juvenile" [...] and they should appreciate each other and play as a team. Bryant would be criticized for forcing his offense and not involving his teammates enough. Even O'Neal's stepfather was overheard yelling at Bryant to pass the ball during a game. Bryant told Jackson that the [...] "(triangle) offense is so simple. It doesn't display my talent ... it doesn't give me what I have to have for my game." [...] According to Bryant, the team's defense was the issue and not his increased role in the offense. [...] Bryant said that [...] "scoring shouldn't affect (O'Neal's) defense", while O'Neal maintained that [...] "if the big dog ain't me, then the house won't get guarded – period." [...] Due to O'Neal's sensitivity toward criticism, Jackson overlooked O'Neal's shortcomings while maintaining his criticism of Bryant. West told O'Neal that he also had personal rivalries when he played with all-time greats Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor, but O'Neal needed to [...] "stop being a baby ... put the team's success first." ...|$|E
