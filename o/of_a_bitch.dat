500|$|Hemingway {{learned from}} Ezra Pound {{how to achieve}} a stripped-down style and how to {{incorporate}} the concepts of imagism in his prose. He said Pound [...] "had taught him more 'about how to write and how not to write' than any son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> alive"; and his friend James Joyce told him [...] "to pare down his work to the essentials". The prose is spare and lacks a clear symbolism. Instead of more conventional literary allusions, Hemingway relied on repetitive metaphors or metonymy to build images. The caesarian is repeatedly associated with words such as [...] "the blanket" [...] and [...] "the bunk" [...] {{in a series of}} objective correlatives, a technique Hemingway learned from T.S. Eliot. Tetlow believes in this early story Hemingway ignored character development; he simply places a character in a setting, and adds descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound, which give a sense of truth.|$|E

500|$|Hemingway was {{inspired}} by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the principles of imagism to his own work. Pound's influence {{can be seen in}} the stripped-down, minimalist style [...] characteristic in Hemingway's early fiction. Betraying his admiration for the older writer, he admitted that Pound [...] "taught [...] more about how to write and how not to write than any son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> alive". He also learned from James Joyce, who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose. Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism; biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to [...] "get the most from the least, [...] prune language, [...] multiply intensities, [...] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.|$|E

In June 1779, the Indian warriors joined with Tory rangers led by Colonel William Butler and slew over 200 frontiersmen, using barbarities normally shunned, and laid waste to the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania. One British officer who witnessed the Tory brutality said that the redcoats on return to England would [...] "scalp every son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> of them." [...] In August 1779, General John Sullivan led a military operation that destroyed at least 40 Iroquois villages, burning all available crops.

Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground.

A positive effect is that it is beneficial for business and for people who enjoy fake displays.

500|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{began its}} dealings with Canada badly, with Kennedy mispronouncing Diefenbaker's {{name in a}} press conference announcing the Prime Minister's visit to Washington in February 1961. A furious Diefenbaker brought up in Cabinet whether to send a note of protest at the gaffe to Washington; his colleagues were inclined to let the matter pass.

President Kennedy, however, told his aides that he never wanted [...] "to see the boring son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> again". The Ottawa visit also began badly: at the welcome at the airport, Kennedy again mispronounced Diefenbaker's name and stated that after hearing the Prime Minister's (notoriously bad) French, he was uncertain if he should venture into the language (Kennedy's French was equally bad). After meeting with Diefenbaker, Kennedy accidentally left behind a briefing note suggesting he [...] "push" [...] Diefenbaker on several issues, including the decision to accept nuclear weapons on Canadian soil, which bitterly divided the Cabinet. Diefenbaker was also annoyed by Kennedy's speech to Parliament, in which he urged Canada to join the OAS (which Diefenbaker had already rejected), and by the President spending most of his time talking to Leader of the Opposition Pearson at the formal dinner. Both Kennedy and his wife Jackie were bored by Diefenbaker's Churchill anecdotes at lunch, stories that Jackie Kennedy later described as [...] "painful".|$|E
500|$|The 1927 New York Yankees team is {{considered}} one of the greatest squads to ever take the field. Known as Murderer's Row because of the power of its lineup, the team clinched first place on Labor Day, won a then-AL-record 110 games and took the AL pennant by 19 games. There was no suspense in the pennant race, and the nation turned its attention to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. Ruth was not alone in this chase. Teammate Lou Gehrig proved to be a slugger who was capable of challenging Ruth for his home run crown; he tied Ruth with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, the dynamic duo was never separated by more than two home runs. Gehrig took the lead, 45–44, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; Ruth responded with two blasts of his own to take the lead, as it proved permanently—Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, Ruth was still several games off his 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. He hit two in the first game of the series, including one off of Paul Hopkins, facing his first major league batter, to tie the record. The following day, September 30, he broke it with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off Tom Zachary to break a 2–2 tie. [...] "Sixty! Let's see some son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> try to top that one", Ruth exulted after the game. In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted [...]356, drove in 164 runs and slugged [...]772. In the 1927 World Series, the Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games; the National Leaguers were disheartened after watching the Yankees take batting practice before Game One, with ball after ball leaving Forbes Field.

40|$|The ovarian remnant {{syndrome}} (ORS) {{is defined}} as the persistence of ovarian activity in surgically spayed females, in which part or the entire ovary remains after the surgical procedure. ORS is characterized as a neo-vascular formation that promotes the organ's functions again, and may occur in cats and dogs. This condition causes the return of all undesirable signs of estrus, like male attraction, vaginal secretion (proestral bleeding), anxiety, pseudocyesis, among other symptoms. The recommended treatment is the surgical removal of the remaining ovary tissue. However, this procedure should be performed at the estrogenic stage of the cycle, when the remaining ovary tissue is enlarged due to the presence of follicles, which facilitates its location.
