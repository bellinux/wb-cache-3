50|$|To help {{coordinate}} {{efforts to}} sift through and understand the data, NASA needed a way for researchers to collaborate across disciplines. The success of the Virtual Planetary Laboratory research network at the University of Washington led Mary A. Voytek, director <b>of</b> the <b>NASA</b> Astrobiology Program, to model its structure and create the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) initiative. Leaders from three NASA research centers will run the program: Natalie Batalha <b>of</b> <b>NASA's</b> Ames Research Center, Dawn Gelino <b>of</b> the <b>NASA</b> Exoplanet Science Institute, and Anthony Del Genio <b>of</b> <b>NASA's</b> Goddard Institute for Space Studies.|$|R

5|$|The Space Shuttle {{became the}} major focus <b>of</b> <b>NASA</b> {{in the late}} 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a {{frequently}} launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, Columbia, did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{thirteen}} other pilots, Chaffee {{was selected}} {{to be an astronaut}} as part <b>of</b> <b>NASA</b> Astronaut Group 3 in 1963. He served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for the Gemini 3 and Gemini 4 missions, and received his first spaceflight assignment in 1966. In 1967, he died in a fire along with fellow astronauts Virgil (Gus) Grissom and Edward H. White II during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission at what was then the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34, Florida. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and a second Air Medal.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green <b>of</b> <b>NASA</b> is optimistic that it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Porco <b>of</b> <b>NASA</b> was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|Glynn Stephen Lunney (born November 27, 1936) is {{a retired}} NASA engineer. An {{employee}} <b>of</b> <b>NASA</b> since its creation in 1958, Lunney was a flight director during the Gemini and Apollo programs, and was on duty during historic {{events such as the}} Apollo 11 lunar ascent and the pivotal hours of the Apollo 13 crisis. At the end of the Apollo program, he became manager of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United States and the Soviet Union. Later, he served as manager of the Space Shuttle program before leaving NASA in 1985 and later becoming {{a vice president of the}} United Space Alliance.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, NASA {{contracted}} Emerson {{to build}} a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement. The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline {{with the addition of}} a guthook cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages. The knife is not available for purchase outside <b>of</b> <b>NASA.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 1962, Chaffee {{confided in}} his family that he had {{submitted}} an application for the NASA astronaut training program, and informed his superiors he wanted to train as a test pilot for astronaut status. In mid-1962, he was accepted in the initial pool of 1,800 applicants for the third group <b>of</b> <b>NASA</b> astronauts. After his naval tour was over, and he had racked up over 1,800 hours of flying time, the Navy offered {{him the opportunity to}} continue work on his master's degree. In January 1963, he entered the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, to work on his Master of Science degree in Reliability Engineering.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group <b>of</b> <b>NASA</b> astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E

5|$|Notwithstanding that in NASA's {{judgment}} {{the contractor}} later made {{significant progress in}} overcoming the problems, the committee believes {{it should have been}} informed of the situation.
