50|$|The {{government}} {{sought to}} go further and end the repayment to Britain of land annuities. These originated from the government loans granted to Irish tenant farmers by the Land Commission from the 1880s, which had enabled them purchase lands from their former landlords, under the Irish Land Acts. In 1923, the previous W. T. Cosgrave government had assured Britain that the Free State would honour its debts and hand over the land annuities and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Under the 1925 London Agreement, the Free State was relieved from its treaty obligation to pay its share towards the public debt of the United Kingdom. The Free State's liability to supervise and pass on land annuities payments led to controversy and debate on whether they were private or public debts. In 1932, de Valera interpreted that the annuities {{were part of the}} public debt from which the Free State had been exempted, and decided that the State would no longer pay them to Britain. His government passed the Land Act of 1933 that allowed the money to be spent on local government projects.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of fair value {{measurement}} by 228 listed companies in the UK and Australia {{around the time of}} adoption of IFRS from 1 January 2005. We test whether within and between country comparability in policy choices (as measured by T indices) has changed in relation to (a) mandatory and (b) optional use of fair value measurement. Mandatory requirements related to financial instruments (IAS 39) and share-based payments (IFRS 2) have increased comparability, with a weaker effect for biological assets (IAS 41). In relation to the optional use of fair value, comparability increased in relation to property (IAS 16) because some companies discontinued fair value measurement. Under IAS 39, the fair value option for other financial assets and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> decreased comparability. Options to use fair value in other areas (intangible assets, plant and equipment and investment properties) are not generally taken up, either for on-going measurement or on IFRS adoption (under the 'deemed cost' option). The results suggest a conservative approach and/or lack of incentives to use fair value measurement for most companies. Exceptions include some banks and insurance companies (for other financial assets and liabilities) and companies holding investment properties...|$|E
40|$|With the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the {{responsibility}} of American utilities in the long-term management of spent nuclear fuel {{was limited to the}} payment of a fee. This narrow involvement did not result in faster or safer development of a solution for commercial nuclear waste. In most <b>other</b> countries, the <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> and practical involvement of utilities appear more extensive. This paper highlights how such differences in institutional frameworks affect risk sharing and economic incentives. It argues that a greater allocation of risk and responsibility to the utilities should reenter the debate over nuclear waste in the US.

Moreover, designation is not possible for equity instruments which are not traded in an active market and the fair value of which cannot be reliably determined. Further (alternative) requirements for designation are e.g. at least a clear diminution of a [...] "mismatch" [...] with <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> assets or <b>liabilities,</b> an internal valuation and reporting and steering at fair value, or a combined contract with an embedded derivative which is not immaterial and which may be separated.

An analysis of the acting legislation concerning peculiarities of legal {{regulation of the}} employer?s <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> to the employee according to the labour legislation of Ukraine has been performed.

The author made an attempt to characterize the <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> of the employer. Some grounds for <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> of the employer for the harm caused to the employee as well as peculiarities of the sanctions applied to the employer for violation of the acting legislation have been examined. In order to investigate the peculiarities of <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> of the employer the author considers the essence of the <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> institution, analyzes the existing legislation and addresses the judicial practice. In particular, some cases of <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> of the employer to the employee in labour relations are singled out, for example emergence of financial liability: a) in case of illegal dismissal from work; b) in case of illegal transfer to a different job; c) in case of illegal suspending from a job; d) in case of delay in giving back a service record book at dismissal; e) in case of delay in settling accounts at dismissal and others.
