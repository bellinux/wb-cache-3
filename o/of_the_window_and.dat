5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which {{found its way into}} Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{the shark}} has been lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay {{go down to}} repair the {{underwater}} tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pump {{to be shut down}} to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows her to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade, and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their brush with the shark.|$|E

25|$|The first {{train in}} the United Kingdom with {{corridor}} connections between all carriages entered service on 7 March 1890 on the Paddington to Birkenhead route, and further corridor trains were introduced on all the main routes {{over the next few}} years. In 1900 a new Milford Boat Train set introduced electric lights and the communication cord was moved inside the train; until now a passenger needing to stop the train in an emergency had to lean out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> pull a cord above the door. At this time carriages generally had a clerestory roof but elliptical roofs were fitted to the GWR steam rail motors in 1903.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the summer term at Meadowbank School for Girls, the most prestigious prep school in England, Miss Bulstrode, the popular but aging headmistress, has {{no reason to believe that}} the {{challenges}} facing her on parent's day will be more than the occasional irate or inebriated parent. She scarcely listens when Mrs Upjohn, a parent, who just happened to have worked in military intelligence, looks out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> notices on the school campus someone whom she recognises and whose presence at the school apparently surprises but does not alarm her. Mrs Upjohn is still talking but the crucial moment has passed. After Mrs Upjohn leaves, Miss Bulstrode has a sudden feeling that she has missed something to which she should have paid attention but then dismisses the notion.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} Amy Lee {{dressed in a}} nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are {{performing}} in another room as Lee awakens and makes {{her way to the}} window. Lee climbs out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> climbs the building with the wind blowing her hair and dress until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.|$|E

25|$|However, Mannerheim and {{his guests}} {{chose to go}} to a car that did not have a {{microphone}} in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the car windows to a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation, Hitler's SS bodyguards spotted the cords coming out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They gestured to him to stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be immediately destroyed; but YLE was allowed to keep the reel, after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to Kustaa Vilkuna, head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to YLE. It was made available to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler speaking in an unofficial tone.|$|E
500|$|Described by Arjona as [...] "the {{world out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> the prison built by ourselves", [...] "Qui√©n" [...] became a {{moderate}} commercial success, reaching number 21 on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart, and number four at the Latin Pop Songs chart.

It was a stormy day and the bay water was highly turbulent. As the escapees were not found, they were declared drowned by the prison authorities as it was conjectured that they drowned in the bay and their bodies swept out into the sea due to the turbulent bay currents.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead have {{maintained}} {{a close relationship}} with a number of frequent collaborators. Producer Nigel Godrich made his name with Radiohead, working as an audio engineer on The Bends and as their producer on every studio album since. He has been dubbed the [...] "sixth member" [...] of the band, in an allusion to George Martin being called the [...] "Fifth Beatle". In 2016, Godrich said of the collaboration: [...] "I can only ever have one band like Radiohead who I've worked with for this many years. That's a very deep and profound relationship. The Beatles could only have ever had one George Martin; they couldn't have switched producers halfway through their career. All that work, trust, and knowledge of each other would have been thrown out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> they'd have to start again." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the assault}} concluded, the police {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} the siege and the deaths of the two hostages and five terrorists, including the actions of the SAS. The soldiers' weapons were taken away for examination and, the following day, the soldiers themselves were interviewed at length by the police at the regiment's base in Hereford. There was controversy over the deaths of two terrorists in the telex room, where the male hostages were held. Hostages later said in interviews that they had persuaded their captors to surrender and television footage appeared to show them throwing weapons out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> holding a white flag. The two SAS soldiers who killed the men both stated at the inquest into the terrorists' deaths that they believed the men had been reaching for weapons before they were shot. The inquest jury reached the verdict that the soldiers' actions were justifiable homicide (later known as [...] "lawful killing").|$|E
500|$|Lambert's girth {{was then}} enormous; six men of normal size could fit {{together}} inside his waistcoat, {{and each of}} his stockings {{was the size of}} a sack. [...] His ¬£50 annuity did not adequately cover his living costs, and his size prevented him from working. He became a virtual recluse. [...] Stories of his bulk had by then begun to spread, and travellers visiting Leicester would use various pretexts to visit his home. One such visitor asked Lambert's servant to allow him entry as he wished to ask Lambert's advice about fighting cocks; Lambert leaned out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> told the servant to [...] "tell the gentleman that I am a shy cock". On another occasion, he admitted into his house a Nottingham man who sought his advice about a mare's pedigree; on realising the man was visiting only to look at him, Lambert told him that the horse in question was [...] "by Impertinence out of Curiosity".|$|E

500|$|This album {{included}} three new songs. [...] "Qui√©n" [...] {{was written by}} Arjona, who co-produced it with Tommy Torres. It was released as the lead single from the album on 19 June 2007. Arjona commented that [...] "'Qui√©n' is the world out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> the prison built by ourselves. It's {{the freedom to choose}} the path or to prefer loneliness as an argument of nostalgia. 'Qui√©n' is a story with the hurry of the desperate, is the flashback of those who end up loving alone." [...] "Quiero", also written by Arjona, was released as the second single in November 2007. Website ADN Mundo called the song bohemian and hippie, and that it was [...] "a love story that doesn't speak about love, but instead about the recent events on the world we live [...] and finally comes to the search of an individual who challenges nostalgia finding entertainment on the impossible." [...] In 2009, [...] "Quiero" [...] was awarded the Pop/Ballad Songs of the Year award by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. The third new song on the album was [...] "Espantap√°jaros", which was written by Arjona and Miguel Luna.|$|E

The song's lyrics were written by Ricardo Arjona and the music was composed by Tommy Torres, who also worked with Arjona on his tenth studio album, Adentro. The song was produced by Lee Levin, Dan Warner and Torres with additional help from Arjona. Warner also played the electric and acoustic guitars and the bass; Levin handled the drum and percussion instruments, and Matt Rollings played the piano. [...] "Qui√©n" [...] is performed by Arjona with additional background vocals from Tommy Torres. The song was recorded between five studios in Miami: The Tiki Room, Picks & Hammers, Jet Wash Studio, The Hit Factory Criteria and Hit Masters; and in Jocoteco Studios in Mexico City. [...] "Qui√©n" [...] was mixed in Barking Doctor Studios in New York City by Mick Guzauski, and mastered by Vlado Meller at the Sony Music Studios on that city.
