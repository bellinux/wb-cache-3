5|$|Igloo White {{was rushed}} into service during the Battle of Khe Sanh and {{successfully}} passed its first <b>operational</b> <b>test.</b> Combined with Operation Commando Hunt in 1969, the system {{served as the}} keystone of the U.S. aerial interdiction effort of the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|A {{shakedown}} of {{the system}} {{took place during the}} first two weeks of November 1967 and it seemed to work. The PAVN siege of the U.S. Marines at the Khe Sanh Combat Base, in western Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, provided the opportunity for an <b>operational</b> <b>test.</b> The American command in Saigon launched Operation Niagara, the largest tactical and B-52 operation thus far in the conflict, to support the Marines at Khe Sanh. By the end of January 1968, Muscle Shoals had emplaced 316 sensors in 44 strings to detect PAVN troop movements in the vicinity of the combat base. The operation was deemed a success, but locating and targeting enemy troops moving toward a fixed location like Khe Sanh was not the same as doing it on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

In parallel, national and international field <b>operational</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted. Their aim is to prove the interoperability and practical feasibility of the standards. Three recently conducted field <b>operational</b> <b>tests</b> were realized in Germany (sim TD), France (score@F), and Europe (DRIVE C 2 X) [8 â€“ 10]. As they focused on the communication between vehicles, these field <b>operational</b> <b>tests</b> utilized powerful hardware.

5|$|The use of {{inclined}} elevators {{was intended}} to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with a shorter, easier path to the train platform {{as well as to}} reduce tunneling costs. The two elevators were manufactured by Maspero Elevatori, in Appiano Gentile, Italy, using a controller made on Long Island, speed governors made in Ohio, and buttons and other parts in Queens. The software for the elevator was written in the United States. Maspero Elevatori assembled the elevators in Italy, and they failed an <b>operational</b> <b>test</b> there, prior to being shipped to the United States. The MTA said the manufacturer chose to use American subcontractors in place of local Italian suppliers after reading the specifications the transit agency submitted. The MTA worked with the manufacturer to try to resolve the problems caused by a very high level of customization.|$|E
