I protest their injustices – ask anyone that knows me". On his blog, Oldfield compared his actions to those of Emily Davison, the suffragette killed after stepping in front of the King's horse at The Derby in 1913. [...] Despite later stating he had some sympathy for both the rowers and spectators, he said he had no regrets and that he [...] "would have felt less of a man" [...] had he not made the protest. [...] In October 2012, Oldfield was jailed for six months for causing a public nuisance and ordered to pay £750 costs. In June 2013, he was refused leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the Home Office claiming his presence there was not [...] "conducive to the public good". Oldfield, whose wife is from India, appealed on the grounds that she would be threatened in Australia, and in December 2013, the deportation order was overturned.

2500|$|Writing in Barclays World of Cricket (1986), former England captain Tony Lewis commented upon Botham's strength, {{enthusiasm and}} {{aggression}} [...] "which he took into every game". Lewis, however, {{pointed out that}} Botham's exuberance often reduced the efficiency of his play, in {{that he would take}} too many risks or refuse to give up on a bowling tactic despite ongoing heavy cost. He summarised Botham as an exciting cricketer who lacked self-discipline. Botham {{was in the middle of}} his career when the book was published but Lewis emphasised the speed at which Botham had achieved certain milestones such as 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test cricket. At that time, there seemed no reason why Botham should not go on reaching milestones but he had already peaked and, in retrospect, his career had a meteoric aspect. His rival Imran Khan asserted this when he said: [...] "Botham was someone who I don't think ever did justice to his talent. When he started he could have done anything, but he declined very quickly. In a way <b>our</b> <b>careers</b> were the opposite of each other. I started quite slowly but got better, maximised my talent. He went the other way, I think".|$|E
