John notes this and interprets Ælfhere's part in Edward's reburial as being a penance for the assassination.|$|E
5|$|After Holiday died, Waldron {{played with}} vocalist Abbey Lincoln and her husband, drummer Max Roach. Around this time, Waldron's playing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{recordings}} became darker, featuring emotional shifts and variations in minor keys. In 1961, Waldron played in Eric Dolphy and Booker Little's quintet, a promising combination that ended when Little died that year, aged 23.|$|E

5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{takes place}} in the formalized structure of the yeshiva or kollel, as well as in Talmudic study that an individual does at any time of day. Although a man skilled in learning could study certain topics <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> the chavrusa relationship is preferred to help him crystallize his thoughts.|$|E

5|$|Clarke {{also had}} a good {{appreciation}} of the complex interplay between Operations and intelligence in deception operations.

5|$|Fanny Longfellow died in {{the home}} in July 1861 after her dress accidentally caught fire; her husband {{attempted}} to quell the flames, managing to keep her face from burning.

5|$|From that point, Manne refocused his {{attention}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> drumming. It might {{be argued that}} he never played with more taste, refinement, and soulful swing than in the 1970s, when he recorded numerous albums with musicians like trumpeter Red Rodney, pianist Hank Jones, saxophonists Art Pepper and Lew Tabackin, and composer-arranger-saxophonist Oliver Nelson.|$|E

5|$|Hitchcock {{did most}} of the {{promotion}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> forbidding Leigh and Perkins to make the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of their revealing the plot. Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews, certainly preserved the secret.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} had neither a budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head Lew Wasserman thought the film {{could be made}} for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. It would be {{impossible}} to settle on a specific amount without a screenplay to review, and after Mitch Glazer declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote one <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E
