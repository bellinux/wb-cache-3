25|$|During {{her time}} working at Castelli Gallery, Lawler was making paintings, artist’s books, prints, and {{photographs}} of her own. But when she landed her first official gallery exhibition, in 1978 at Artists Space, she did not exhibit any of that work.

To highlight her appropriation, she installed two spotlights: one above the picture and another pointed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> building next door, hinting to sidewalk passersby {{that there was something}} of note going on upstairs.|$|E

However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works. Morgan was astounded by Sawa's performance in Idle Hands, and Sawa was hired.|$|E
