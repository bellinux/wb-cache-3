He was keen to exercise as soon as he could during his rehabilitation. He tried several sports, including wheelchair tennis, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball, following his accident in an attempt to find <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> him feel able-bodied. He drove dune buggies and tried kayaking, and in 2007 was learning how to para-glide.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the Prussian victory in the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War, the Liberal Party {{government}} of Prime Minister William Gladstone and Secretary of State for War Edward Cardwell called for the Army to undergo major reforms. Cardwell succeeded in pushing through a number of reforms, including <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> the Commander in chief nominally report to the Secretary of State for War.|$|E
25|$|Until Ocean Grove's {{municipal}} authority was folded into Neptune Township in 1981, it boasted {{a set of}} unique laws, including <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> it illegal on Sundays to have cars {{on the streets of}} Ocean Grove. This had a significant effect on the development of a close-knit community. People looking to get away for the weekend typically avoided the Grove (the beach was closed on Sunday, too). That meant the visitors were likely to be coming for a week-long visit or more. Most came to attend programs sponsored by the Camp Meeting.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, after Pro Arts Inc. {{pitched the}} idea of a poster of Fawcett to her agent, a photo shoot was {{arranged}} with photographer Bruce McBroom, who was hired by the poster company. According to friend Nels Van Patten, Fawcett styled her own hair and did her makeup without the aid of a mirror. Her blonde highlights were further heightened by a squeeze of lemon juice. From 40 rolls of film, Fawcett herself selected her six favorite pictures, and eventually the choice was narrowed to the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> her famous. The resulting image of Fawcett in a one-piece red bathing suit is the best-selling poster in history.|$|E

For the first time, she competed in the 4×100m medley relay where one of her teammates was a young Ágnes Kovács, a future Olympic champion. They came second and Egerszegi has named this silver medal as 'the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> her the happiest'. She decided not {{to compete in the}} 100m backstroke even though her time of 1:00.93 clocked during the 4×100m relay final was better than Mette Jacobsen's winning time of 1:02.46 by almost two seconds.|$|E
25|$|The Flint Sit-Down Strike was a {{risky and}} illegal {{enterprise}} from the outset: the union {{was able to}} share its plans {{with only a few}} workers because of the danger that spies employed by GM would alert management in time to stop it, yet needed to be able to mobilize enough to seize physical control of GM's factories. The union, in fact, not only took over several GM factories in Flint, including <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> the dies necessary to stamp automotive body parts and a companion facility in Cleveland, Ohio, but held on to those sites despite repeated attempts by the police and National Guard to retake them and court orders threatening the union with ruinous fines if it did not call off the strike.|$|E

500|$|Faulks {{wrote the}} novel {{partly because he}} felt that the First World War had not been {{discussed}} enough in both literary and historical contexts. Reflecting on the novel twenty years later, Faulks felt that the published version did not fully do justice to the experience of war: it did not provide readers with [...] "a full appreciation of the soldiers' physical experience; and, perhaps more importantly, a philosophical understanding of {{what it meant to be}} part of the first genocidal event of the century – the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> the others imaginable".|$|E

[...] She cites a 1959 review in the same publication by William O. Douglas, later a Supreme Court judge, who called the book [...] "a chatty, humorous and perceptive account", adding that [...] "Even the unsanitary hotel accommodations, the infected drinking water, the unpalatable food, the inevitable dysentery are lively, amusing, laughable episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lost in Paradise" [...] {{was written}} by Evanescence frontwoman Amy Lee while {{production}} was handled by Nick Raskulinecz.

During an interview Lee said, [...] "That's the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> us cry ... like, literally, just in here, working on it, there have been tears." [...] At first, Lee anticipated that the song would become a B-side at most, thinking of the song as too personal for an album track.|$|E

500|$|Of these improvements, {{the slide}} lock is the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> the Model 1897 into a safe firearm. This {{improved}} slide lock kept the shotgun locked until actual firing occurred which prevented it from jamming {{in the case}} of a misfire. The slide lock [...] "stands in such a relation to the body of the firing pin as will prevent the firing pin reaching the primer until the pin has moved forward a sufficient distance to insure locking of the breech bolt". This prevents the action sleeve [...] "from being retracted by the hand of the gunner until after firing, and hence rendering the firearm more safe".|$|E
500|$|Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's {{production}} of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa {{as the basis for}} Neverminds songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1993 that he [...] "heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody." [...] Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as [...] "the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame." [...] Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa [...] "blew my mind," [...] and that she [...] "immediately went to track down Steve Albini." [...] Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.|$|E
500|$|Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille is the most {{straightforward}} and formulaic picture to date from Pixar Animation Studios, but it is also among the most enchanting and touching." [...] Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The Pixar magic continues with Brad Bird's Ratatouille, a gorgeous, wonderfully inventive computer-animated comedy." [...] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Fresh family fun. Although there are those slightly noxious images of rodents scampering around a kitchen, the movie doesn't stoop to kid-pandering jokes based on back talk and bodily gases." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "A film as rich as a sauce béarnaise, as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet, and a lot less predictable than the damn food metaphors and adjectives all us critics will churn out to describe it. OK, one more and then I'll be done: it's yummy." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille never overwhelms, even though it's stocked with action, romance, historical content, family drama and serious statements about the creation of art." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "From the moment Remy enters, crashing, to the final happy fadeout, Ratatouille parades the brio and depth that set Pixar apart from and above other animation studios." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> me positively desire one." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Had Bird gone the safe route, he would have robbed us of a great new cartoon figure in Remy, who {{like the rest of the}} film is rendered with animation that is at once fanciful and life-like. It's also my pick for Pixar's best." ...|$|E

Moreover, a master of the craft was also said to be able to raise storms, make distant ships sink, make swords blunt, make armour soft and decide victory or defeat in battles. Examples of this can be found in Grógaldr and in Frithiof's Saga.

2500|$|The closing track, {{the longest}} {{composition}} ever released by Dylan, the 16-minute [...] "Highlands", most probably took its central motif ("My heart's in the highlands") from {{a poem by}} Robert Burns called [...] "My heart's in the highlands" [...] (published in 1790). In Jim Dickinson's account, [...] "I remember, when we finished 'Highlands'—there are two other versions of that, the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> the record is the rundown, literally, {{you can hear the}} beat turn over, which I think Dylan liked.

2500|$|Cosmopolitan Building (1895) - This three-story stone neo-Classical revival {{building}} {{topped by}} three small domes {{was designed by}} Stanford White as the headquarters for Cosmopolitan when the magazine moved from New York to Irvington. John Brisben Walker, who had bought the general interest magazine in 1889, had a mansion in Irvington only a short walk away. In 1897 Walker started a free correspondence school, the Cosmopolitan Educational University Extension. When 20,000 people enrolled, Walker was unable to keep to its offer of a no-cost education for all, and had to ask the students to pay $20 per year. Nevertheless, the venture attracted well-known academics to its staff, and public lectures and other events associated with the school were held in the headquarters building. The magazine also sponsored several automobile races from New York to Irvington to promote the automobile. Cosmopolitan left Irvington shortly after William Randolph Hearst bought the magazine in 1905 and moved it back to New York. Afterwards, the building {{was used as a}} silent movie studio for some period of time, but for most of its subsequent history has primarily housed manufacturing concerns of various types, including <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> radio oscillators used by the U.S. Army in World War II, and a company that made looseleaf binders and other paper products.The Cosmopolitan Building still stands, although it is known as the [...] "Trent Building" [...] after the family that owns it, but it is quite run down, and its visage has suffered from the pedestrian brick industrial building which was stuck onto its rear, obscuring the eastern facade. The building houses manufacturers, offices, a video production facility, a publisher of art books, interior design firms, a yoga studio, a chapel, photographers, a spa, a florist and event space and at least one restaurant.
