5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>by</b> {{the door of the}} master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
25|$|The {{prohibition}} of sex discrimination was added <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>by</b> Smith. While Smith was a conservative who strongly opposed {{civil rights laws}} for blacks, he supported such laws for women. Smith's amendment passed {{by a vote of}} 168 to 133.|$|E

50|$|The {{doors at}} the rear of the hallway open onto an L-shaped, skillion roofed, rear verandah.

25|$|The {{story begins}} with Chanie {{describing}} his experiences of abuse from residential school teachers, who {{he and his}} friends (two brothers) call “Fish Bellies” or “Sucker Bellies” for their pale skin. On an October afternoon, Chanie and the two brothers decide to run away. Because of a lung infection, Chanie struggles to keep up with his friends. Eventually the three boys reach a river, where they run into the two brothers’ uncle. They are given a meager meal of freshly-caught fish in the cabin where the uncle, his wife, and his daughter are staying. That night, Chanie sleeps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>by</b> the wood stove.|$|E
25|$|I {{was often}} {{asked if he}} had cancer or AIDS. In fact at 67, he had diabetes, some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy {{capacity}} to whinge and the usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses were gone and the dog had died. He was eating less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>by</b> his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. We were to learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and we decided to keep it private.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>by</b> the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands.|$|E

500|$|After twelve years' {{absence from}} the {{national}} conventions of the Democratic Party, Yancey attended the Charleston convention in April 1860. [...] The Douglas faction refused to accept a platform, modeled after Yancey’s Alabama Platform of 1848, committed to protecting slavery in the territories. [...] When the platform committee presented such a proposal to the convention, it was voted down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>by</b> a 165–138 vote. [...] Yancey and the Alabama delegation left the hall and were followed by the delegates of Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, {{and two of the}} three delegates from Delaware. On the next day, the Georgia delegation and a majority of the Arkansas delegation withdrew. [...] As Eric Walther states, [...] "Through his years of preparation and despite some brief wavering, William L. Yancey had finally destroyed the Democratic Party." ...|$|E

Guests are able to send text {{messages}} after the show requesting songs from the DJ's playlist. About 20 songs are used in the show, including <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Floor</b> <b>by</b> Jennifer Lopez, Moves like Jagger by Maroon 5, The Edge of Glory by Lady Gaga, Sexy and I Know It by LMFAO, and Livin' on a Prayer by Bon Jovi. The music relates to each segment. For example, Shut Up and Drive by Rihanna, Sweet Dreams by Beyoncé, and Empire State of Mind by Jay-Z are played during [...] "Land Travel". Come Sail Away by Styx is played during [...] "Sea Travel" [...] and E.T. by Katy Perry is played during [...] "Space Travel".

2500|$|In 1975, the Senate revised its cloture rule so that three-fifths of sworn {{senators}} (60 votes out of 100) could limit debate, {{except for}} changing Senate rules which still requires {{a two-thirds majority}} of those present and voting to invoke cloture. However, by returning to an absolute number of all Senators (60) rather than a proportion of those present and voting, the change also made any filibusters easier to sustain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>by</b> {{a small number of}} senators from the minority party without requiring the presence of their minority colleagues. [...] This further reduced the majority's leverage to force an issue through extended debate.|$|E
2500|$|Playing {{the cello}} is done while seated with the {{instrument}} supported <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>by</b> the endpin. The left hand fingertips stop the strings on the fingerboard, determining {{the pitch of}} the fingered note. The right hand plucks or bows the strings to sound the notes. The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in [...] higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the neck positions (which use just {{less than half of}} the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in thumb position (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the events following her arrest in Ghazni. American authorities said that two FBI agents, a US Army warrant officer, a US Army captain, and their US military interpreters arrived in Ghazni the following day on 18 July to interview Siddiqui at the Afghan National Police facility where she was being held. They reported they congregated in a meeting room that was partitioned by a curtain, but did not realise that Siddiqui was standing unsecured behind the curtain. The warrant officer sat down and put his loaded M4 carbine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>by</b> his feet near the curtain. Siddiqui drew back the curtain, picked up the rifle, and pointed it at the captain. [...] "I could see {{the barrel of the}} rifle, the inner portion of the barrel of the weapon; that indicated to me that it was pointed straight at my head," [...] he said. Then, she was said to have threatened them loudly in English, and yelled [...] "Get the fuck out of here" [...] and [...] "May the blood of [...] be on your [...] ". The captain dove for cover to his left as she yelled [...] "Allah Akbar" [...] and fired at least two shots at them, missing them. An Afghan interpreter who was seated closest to her tried to disarm her. At that point the warrant officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, hitting her in the torso, and one of the interpreters disarmed her. A Justice Department statement said that Siddiqui struck and kicked the officers during the ensuing struggle; [...] "she shout in English that she wanted to kill Americans" [...] and then lost consciousness.|$|E
