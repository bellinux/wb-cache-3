30|$|Financial {{innovation}} in the economy brings about changes through {{the introduction of new}} financial instruments, institutions, services, and reporting (Laeven et al. 2015). The impact of financial innovation on the economy is diversified and no single variable can be considered as an appropriate indicator for measuring its significance in the economy. We selected 2 Proxy indicators to measure financial innovation. The first proxy for financial innovation is the Domestic Credit to the Private Sector (DCB), which refers to the ratio of the number of credit facilities to the private sector for investment in the form of securities, loan, and <b>other</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>receivable.</b> Growth economic theory predicts that capital adequacy will positively influence economic growth, and so we assigned this variable a positive sign for its coefficient. Using the approach found in Bakang (2016), the second proxy for financial innovation was defined as the Broad-to-Narrow Money (M 2 /M 1) (Laeven et al. 2015; Bara and Mudxingiri 2016; Bara et al. 2016; Ansong et al. 2011).|$|E
