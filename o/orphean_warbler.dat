60|$|I spoke {{just now}} {{of the time when}} England was joined to France, as bearing on Hampshire botany. It bears no less on Hampshire zoology. In insects, for instance, the {{presence}} of the purple emperor and the white admiral in our Hampshire woods, as well as the abundance of the great stag-beetle, point to a time when the two countries were joined, at least as far west as Hampshire; while the absence of these insects farther to the westward shows that the countries, if ever joined, were already parted; and that those insects have not yet had time to spread westward. The presence of these two butterflies, and partly of the stag-beetle, along the south-east coast of England as far as the primeval forests of South Lincolnshire, points, as do a hundred other facts, to a time when the Straits of Dover either did not exist, or were the bed of a river running from the west; and when, as I told you just now, all the rivers which now run into the German Ocean, from the Humber on the west to the Elbe on the east, discharged themselves into the sea between Scotland and Norway, after wandering through a vast lowland, covered with countless herds of mammoth, rhinoceros, gigantic ox, and other mammals now extinct; while the birds, as far as we know, the insects, the fresh-water fish, and even, as my friend Mr. Brady has proved, the Entomostraca of the rivers, were the same in what is now Holland as in what is now our Eastern counties. I could dwell long on this matter. I could talk long about how certain species of Lepidoptera--moths and butterflies--like Papilio Machaon and P. Podalirius, swarm through France, reach up to the British Channel, and have not crossed it, {{with the exception of one}} colony of Machaon in the Cambridgeshire fens. I could talk long about a similar phenomenon in the case of our migratory and singing birds; how many exquisite species--notably those two glorious songsters, the <b>Orphean</b> <b>Warbler</b> and Hippolais, which delight our ears everywhere on the other side of the Channel--follow our nightingales, blackcaps, and warblers northward every spring almost to the Straits of Dover, but dare not cross, simply because they have been, as it were, created since the gulf was opened, and have never learnt from their parents how to fly over it.|$|E
5000|$|These small {{passerine}} {{birds are}} found in open deciduous woodland. 4-6 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush or tree. Like most [...] "warblers", <b>Orphean</b> <b>warbler</b> is an insectivore.|$|E
50|$|The eastern <b>Orphean</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia crassirostris) is {{a typical}} warbler of the genus Sylvia. This species occurs in summer around the Mediterranean, through the Balkans via Turkey, the Caucasus and {{surrounding}} regions to Central Asia. It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
50|$|The western <b>Orphean</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia hortensis) is {{a typical}} warbler of the genus Sylvia. This species occurs in summer around the Mediterranean, through western Europe and {{extending}} into northwest Africa. It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a rare vagrant to northern and north-western Europe.|$|E
50|$|In {{a recent}} bird survey {{carried out in}} the sanctuary, {{reported}} in January 2014, the total number of bird species identified in the park are 280, which include 19 new species. Some of the notable species reported are: Indian courser, Malabar parakeet, large-billed leaf warbler, green leaf-warbler, western crowned leaf warbler, fairy-bluebird, the Indian blue robin, the yellow-throated bulbul, the crested goshawk, rosefinch, Blyth's swift, <b>Orphean</b> <b>warbler,</b> European bee-eater, and Eurasian crag martin.|$|E
50|$|The western <b>Orphean</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{probably}} most closely allied to the Arabian warbler, {{as well as}} the brown warbler and Yemen warblers which are sometimes placed in Parisoma. They together with the lesser whitethroat group seem to form a distinct clade of typical warblers. The species therein do not appear much alike at first glance, but they all have prominent white throats, lack rufous wing-patches, and usually having dark sides to the head.|$|E
50|$|At 15-16 cm length—somewhat {{larger than}} a blackcap—this {{is one of the}} largest species of typical warblers. The adult males have a plain grey back. The bill is long and pointed and the legs black. The male has a dark grey head, black eye mask, and white throat. The iris is white. Females and immatures have a paler head and reddish underparts; their grey back has a {{brownish}} tinge. The iris is dark in young birds. The song is a series of warbling liroo-liroo and scolding notes. Song is more varied than the western <b>Orphean</b> <b>warbler,</b> approaching Nightingale in richness.|$|E
50|$|As of 2007, the {{following}} reviews are underway: {{a review of}} past records of Macaronesian shearwaters, reviews of all redhead and royal tern records, a review of great white egrets to establish if any are of the Nearctic race, a review of sandplovers, a review of records of the eastern race of redstart, a review of <b>Orphean</b> <b>warbler</b> records aimed at determining the race of each, and a review of subalpine warblers to determine which individuals are ascribable to the race albistriata. It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of great snipe, as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.|$|E
50|$|Rather, {{the lesser}} {{whitethroat}} and its closest relatives Hume's whitethroat {{and the small}} whitethroat appear more related {{to a group of}} morphologically quite dissimilar species. These vary much in size and color pattern, but also lack chestnut wing patches and have a strong contrast between the usually dark head sides and the white or whitish throat. The latter group occurs from the southern parts of the lesser whitethroat complex' range into Africa and include the <b>Orphean</b> <b>warbler</b> group, the Arabian warbler, and the brown and Yemen warblers sometimes placed in Parisoma. Thus, it rather appears as if the divergence of the lesser whitethroat complex and its closest living relatives is more ancient than assumed, and that it did not involve separation by ice sheets building up in Europe, but by aridification of the Arabian region (which also occurred throughout the Ice Ages).|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in Magnesia Prefecture, central Greece, during the period May-June 2007. It aimed at the comparison between conventional and certified organic olive groves with regard to olive and olive oil production, diversity of plants (herbaceous and woody) and diversity and abundance of avifauna. Correlations between variables within herbaceous plants (linear regression) and woody plants (Principal Component Analysis), and the role of integration time of olive groves to the organic system were investigated. Also, finding easily measurable parameters indicating high bird diversity levels within organic and conventional management systems was a main target of the study. According to our findings, neither edible olive yield nor olive oil yield showed significant differences between conventional and certified organic olive groves. There is an increasing trend for alpha and beta diversity of herbaceous plant species, woody plant beta diversity, density and cover of woody plants, and density of breeding birds in certified organic olive groves (10 years) in comparison with conventional ones. The effect of time since the adoption of organic procedures is very important and produces benefits for the biodiversity. In the total olive groves 15 insectivorous, six granivorous and three insectivorous/granivorous birds species were recorded. Nine bird species distinguished by Ward's hierarchical clustering were identified as typical (indicator value, IndVal> 50 %) of specific farming systems. Among them, the Eurasian jay, associated with the 10 -year certified organic olive groves, and the common cuckoo, <b>Orphean</b> <b>warbler</b> and Red-backed shrike, associated with the 6 -year certified organic olive groves, should be regarded as characteristic species (IndVal> 70 %). Conclusively, organic farming favors some aspects of diversity of herbaceous and woody plants of olive grove ecosystems. On the contrary, similar effects on breeding bird diversity and density were not clearly recorded. However, breeding bird density proved a good indicator of their richness...|$|E
