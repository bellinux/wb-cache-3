25|$|Recently, {{aesthetic}} and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation {{as a work}} of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza wrote Revelation: Vision <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Just</b> World from the viewpoint of rhetoric. Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about saying things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic.|$|E
25|$|Naturals in {{that table}} {{are not the}} {{alphabetic}} series A to G without sharps and flats: Naturals are reciprocals of terms in the Harmonic series (mathematics), which are in practice multiples of a fundamental frequency. This may be derived by proceeding with the principle that historically gives the Pythagorean diatonic and chromatic scales, stacking perfect fifths with 3:2 frequency proportions (C-G-D-A-E). Considering the anhemitonic scale as a subset <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>just</b> diatonic scale, it is tuned thus: 20:24:27:30:36 (A-C-D-E-G = 5/3-1/1-9/8-5/4-3/2). Assigning precise frequency proportions to the pentatonic scales of most cultures is problematic as tuning may be variable.|$|E

25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{leveled at}} this justification {{is that it}} does not fulfill one of the requirements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>just</b> war and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and the authority of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the Nuremberg principles, therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.|$|E

The EU is also the largest donor of aid to the Palestinian autonomous areas.|$|E
25|$|The Governmental {{view of the}} atonement of Hugo Grotius is, historically, a {{modification}} of Calvin's view, although it represents in some ways {{a return to the}} general nature of Anselm's theory. According to Grotius, Christ's death is an acceptable substitute for punishment, satisfying the demands of God's moral government. In this view, in contrast to Calvin, Christ does not specifically bear the penalty for humanity's sins; nor does he pay for individual sins. Instead, his suffering demonstrates God's displeasure with sin and what sin deserves at the hands <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>just</b> Governor of the universe, enabling God to extend forgiveness while maintaining divine order. The Governmental view is the basis for the salvation theories of Protestant denominations who stress freedom of the will as in Arminianism.|$|E

She says we are to look behind the symbols rather than make a fetish out of them. In contrast, Tina Pippin states that John writes [...] "horror literature" [...] and [...] "the misogyny which underlies the narrative is extreme." ...|$|E

2500|$|Geryon, {{the winged}} monster who allows Dante and Virgil to descend a vast cliff {{to reach the}} Eighth Circle, was {{traditionally}} represented as a giant with three heads and three conjoined bodies.
