5|$|A {{self-described}} anarchist, Baker {{has been}} categorized {{as a writer}} of transgressional fiction, in that his novels are frequently populated by sociopathic, nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy drug use, incest, necrophilia and other practices; and often commit acts <b>of</b> <b>extreme,</b> surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from Proust to Jim Thompson and Sam Peckinpah. He also admired the punk writer Dennis Cooper.|$|E

5|$|As the American colonies went to war, {{they needed}} soldiers, supplies, {{and lots of}} them.

40|$|In many real applications, such as climate, {{finance and}} social media among others, {{we are often}} {{interested}} in extreme events. An important part <b>of</b> modeling <b>extremes</b> is dis-covery <b>of</b> covariates on which the quantities related to the extremes are dependent, as this may lead to improved understanding and the discovery of new causal drivers <b>of</b> <b>extremes.</b> Despite developments in sparse covariate dis-covery algorithms, adaptations to extremes can fail because the tail attributes do not fol-low a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we proposed a sparse Bayesian framework for discovery of covariates that influences the fre-quency <b>of</b> <b>extremes</b> based on the Poisson de-scription <b>of</b> <b>extremes</b> frequency and hierar-chical Bayesian description of a sparse re-gression model. We developed an efficient approximation algorithm based on the vari-ational Bayes approach to estimate the dis-tribution over regression coefficients that in-dicate dependence <b>of</b> <b>extremes</b> on the corre-sponding covariates. Experiments with syn-thetic data demonstrate {{the ability of the}} ap-proach to accurately characterize dependence structures. Applications to rainfall extremes suggest new insights relevant for improved understanding <b>of</b> hydrological <b>extremes</b> un-der climate variability and change...|$|R

5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide.

Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E

5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change.

Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E

Analytical expressions for n-fold cumulative distributions and their associated densities, for the exceedance probabilities and spatial propagation <b>of</b> <b>extremes,</b> are derived and complemented by numerical simulations. Substantial differences from the classical statistical theory are found and illustrated on generic classes of dynamical systems, giving rise to fully developed chaos, intermittent chaos, and quasi-periodic behavior.
