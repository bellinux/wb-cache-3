25|$|More than 6000 {{occupational}} schemes were {{in place}} in the UK in 2015, of which over 5000 were in deficit. The total shortfall of the schemes was over 360 billion pounds as of February 2015. A large number of UK employers offer their employees access to a defined benefit <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme,</b> often based on final salary. In such an arrangement, the employee was typically promised a pension of a fixed proportion of their salary in the period leading up to retirement. The proportion would depend on the number of years of service with the employer. Post retirement increases are typically partly discretionary. The amounts payable are restricted by taxation rules, the maximum being typically either a pension of one-sixtieth of final salary for each year of membership or a pension of one-eightieth of their salary per year of membership plus a tax free lump sum of three-eightieths. With increases in longevity and reductions in interest rates, such arrangements were becoming progressively unaffordable. So following a review by a Pensions Commission, to get a given income, the length it is necessary to pay into a pension in the public sector is linked to longevity.|$|E

50|$|The Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) is {{the minimum}} pension which a United Kingdom <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> has {{to provide for}} those {{employees}} who were contracted out of the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) between 6 April 1978 and 5 April 1997.

50|$|On {{earnings}} {{above the}} LEL, {{up to and}} including the PT, employee contributions are not paid but are credited by the government as if they were (enabling certain low-paid workers to qualify for benefits). Additionally, where the employee and/or employer contribute to certain types of <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme,</b> there is a negative contribution rate on earnings in this band - this 'rebate' can be offset against contributions in other earnings bands.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{when the}} GMP became payable at State Pension Age, the cost-of-living {{increases}} {{associated with this}} element of a member's pension were paid by the state with the individual's state pension. With regard to any GMP accrued from 6 April 1988, the <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> is required to pay increases {{in line with the}} Consumer Price Index up to a maximum of 3%. The change in rules led to a distinction between Pre 1988 GMP and Post 1988 GMP.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the role which (funded) defined benefit private sector <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> play in national pensions in a sub-group of OECD countries. The paper {{shows that in}} the majority of countries under consideration statutory (state) <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> are the main if not only source of income in retirement for most people, with <b>occupational</b> <b>pensions</b> only playing at most a minor role. In several countries private sector <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> do {{play an important role in}} providing pensioner incomes though. In these countries there has generally been a shift from DB to DC pensions, with the risks associated with pensions moved from businesses to individuals. Australia, for example, shifted from DB to compulsory DC pensions a generation ago, leaving only a few major businesses with any sizeable DB pension liabilities now. The US has undergone a similar shift though there is no compulsion. In the UK the economic and financial crisis has accelerated the closure of existing DB <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> and dealing with the legacy of DB pension liabilities is becoming a major issue. The picture is similar in the Netherlands and Ireland. The paper also shows the diverging DB arrangements in the private and public sectors, with governments in a number of countries continuing to offer (unfunded) DB pension promises when they have become less popular in the private sector.

50|$|Employees and {{employers}} pay contributions {{according to a}} complex classification based on employment type and income. Class 1 (employed persons) NIC is charged at several rates depending on various income thresholds {{and a number of}} other factors including age, the type of <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> contributed to by the employee and/or employer and whether or not the employee is an ocean-going mariner. Certain married women who opted to pay reduced contributions (in return for reduced benefits) prior to 1977 retain this right for historical reasons.|$|E

Mr Jones {{was a member of}} his <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> between 1980 and 1995 and was entitled to a pension of £500 per month on his retirement. Because he was contracted out of SERPS, the government advised that he was entitled to a GMP of £110 per month, including £50 post 1988 GMP. The non-GMP element of his pension—in this case £390 per month—is usually known as the 'excess' and his payment advice would give a breakdown as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|A career average pension {{is a type}} of <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme,</b> {{where people}} saving for {{retirement}} pay for a benefit after retirement where they will receive a sum that is calculated according to their average earnings over their career. Particularly in UK pensions, this model has been introduced as an alternative to both defined contribution pensions, which may run out and lead to old age poverty if they live longer, and final salary pensions which give people a benefit based on the last salary they earned before retirement. It is thought that career average pensions are more fair than final salary pensions, when people have not, for instance in their last few years of work, jumped up to management positions with much higher salaries: career average pensions mean that lower earners do not subsidise much higher pension benefits for just a few people.|$|E
50|$|The European Court of Justice {{held that}} TFEU article 157 (now TEC article 119) precluded {{men and women}} having {{different}} age conditions for <b>pension</b> entitlements. <b>Occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> are included as pay, even though the scheme operated by a trust technically independent of the employers. It operated in partial substitution for benefits under the state social security system, {{even if it is}} with reference to a national scheme.|$|R
50|$|Today the Republic of Ireland has a two-tiered {{approach}} to the provision of pensions or retirement benefits. First, there is a state social welfare retirement pension, which promises a basic level of pension. This is a flat rate pension, {{funded by the national}} social insurance system and is termed Pay Related Social Insurance or PRSI. Secondly, there are the <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> and self-employed arrangements, which supplement the state pension.|$|R
30|$|The {{market has}} been more active in the {{pensions}} part of social insurance. In fact, within pensions we see four strong governance modes: government, {{in the form of}} public social insurance; associational governance in those countries and sectors where pension funds are typically managed by unions and associations of employers; the corporate hierarchy in the case of company and <b>occupational</b> <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> not subject to associational governance; and the market in the personal pensions sector.|$|R
