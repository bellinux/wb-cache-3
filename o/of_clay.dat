5|$|The {{underlying}} geology {{consists of}} the Permo-Triassic New Red Sandstone in the south, and the Middle Coal Measures of the Manchester Coalfield to the north. The upper soils are a mixture <b>of</b> <b>clay</b> and sand, with a subsoil <b>of</b> <b>clay.</b> The Astley area encompasses smaller, suburban and semi-outlying areas, including Blackmoor, Astley Green, Gin Pit and Cross Hillock. The isolated hamlet of terraced houses at Gin Pit was built by the Astley and Tyldesley Collieries Company. Peace Street, Lord Street and Maden Street were named after directors of the company.|$|E
5|$|At Westhay Moor in {{the early}} 19thcentury, it was shown how peat bogs could be {{successfully}} drained and top-dressed with silt deposited via flooding, creating a very rich soil. The character of the soil was also changed by the spreading <b>of</b> <b>clay</b> and silt from the digging of King's Sedgemoor Drain.|$|E
5|$|Geophagy, the {{practice}} of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans. There are three main reasons for this dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the ingestion <b>of</b> <b>clay</b> minerals that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat a disorder such as diarrhoea. Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.|$|E
50|$|First, {{there must}} be usable clay available.

40|$|Effective site {{characterization}} {{requires that}} many relevant geologic, hydrogeologic and biological {{properties of the}} subsurface be evaluated. A parameter that often directly influences chemical processes, ground water flow, contaminant transport, and biological activities is the lateral and vertical distribution <b>of</b> <b>clays.</b> The objective <b>of</b> the research an development under this contract is to improve non-invasive methods for detecting clay lenses. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>clays</b> in soils influences most physical properties that {{have an impact on}} environmental restoration and waste management. For example, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>clays</b> determine hydraulic permeability and the rate of contaminant migration, absorption of radioactive elements, and interaction with organic compounds. Therefore, improvements in non-invasive mapping <b>of</b> <b>clays</b> in the subsurface will result in better: characterization of contaminated sites, prediction of pathways of contaminant migration, assessment of risk of contaminants to public health if contaminants reach water supplies, design of remedial action and evaluation of alternative action...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the relationships between}} the water content, mineralogical properties and mechanical properties <b>of</b> saturated <b>clays.</b> The findings are based on theoretical analysis and were confirmed experimentally on monomineral clay samples. It was foundthat the quantity of intergrain water, which determines the undrained shear strength and compressibility <b>of</b> <b>clays,</b> consists <b>of</b> free pore water, and the firmly adsorbed water on the external surfaces <b>of</b> the <b>clay</b> grains. The free water quantity is the same for differentsaturated clays, at the same undrained shear strength, and same effective stress after consolidation and, likewise, the thickness of the water film around the clay grains.

5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal.

However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack <b>of</b> <b>clay</b> is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E
