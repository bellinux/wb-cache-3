50|$|The EIO {{contained}} several significant innovations over existing procedures. The EIO {{focuses on}} the investigative measure to be executed, {{rather than on the}} type of evidence to be gathered. The EIO has a broad scope - all investigative measures are covered, except those explicitly excluded. In principle, the issuing authority decides on the type of investigative measure to be used. However, flexibility is introduced by allowing, in a limited number of cases, the executing authority to decide to have recourse to an investigative measure other than that provided for in the EIO. Clear time limits are provided for the recognition and, with more flexibility, for the execution of the EIO. The proposal also innovates by providing the legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> the EIO with the same celerity and priority as for a similar national case. The EIO provides for the use of a form that should be used in all cases.|$|E

In this paper, we investigate a more sophisticated approach in which an information system specification is compliant with its security policy even though some security requirements may be violated. Our proposal is to consider that this is acceptable when the security policy specifies additional requirements that apply in case of violation of other security requirements. In this case, we formally define conditions to be satisfied by an information system to comply with its security policy. We then present a proof-based approach to check if these conditions are enforced...|$|R

3000|$|The {{language}} {{we define}} to specify permissions and obligations in security policies {{is based on}} deontic logic of actions.

Obligations with deadline are specified using modality O(α<d|p) which intuitively means that when formula p starts to hold, there is an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> action α before the deadline condition d starts to hold.

S. climate policy as it related to international relations and negotiations {{in the wake of the}} Bush Administration’s rejection of the Kyoto Protocol. Acknowledging that future U. S. negotiating positions would depend significantly on the outcome of the 2008 presidential election, he briefly reviews the platforms of the leading U. S. presidential candidates before turning to federal domestic policy. Summarizing the Bush initiatives to tie greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to economic output and to reduce emissions by voluntary measures, he also discusses the first U. S. Supreme Court case to address climate change, Massachusetts v. EPA (549 U. S. 497, 2007), wherein the high court chided the EPA for ignoring its statutory <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> the Clean Air Act, while refusing to take a stand on whether greenhouse gases cause or contribute to climate change. The author reviews legislation that was then making its way through the 110 th Congress, such as Senator Waxman’s Safe Climate Act, and goes on to analyze activities at the sub-national level that collectively had a major impact on U. S. climate policy. The author concludes the chapter by identifying some of the implications of future U. S. climate policy, expected to be more robust post-Bush, for Canada and Canadian climate policy. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The ‘Risico- Inventarisatie- en Evaluatie-instrumenten’ is {{the name}} for the Dutch risk {{assessment}} (RA) tools. A RA tool {{can be used to}} perform a risk assessment including an evaluation of the identified risks. These tools were among the first online risk assessment tools developed in Europe. The Dutch RA tools and the web application system to generate RA tools has inspired EU-OSHA to use the Dutch model as a basis for developing the Online Interactive Risk Assessment (OiRA). OiRA is a European web application, consisting of a tools generator and interface. OiRA helps Sectoral Social Partners (employers' and employees' organisations) and National Authorities (Ministries, Labour Inspectorates, OSH institutes, etc.) to produce sector-specific risk assessment tools (RA tools) targeting small businesses. The overall purpose of the Dutch digital RA tools as they stand today is to ensure that SMEs primarily, but micro enterprises in particular, comply with the legal <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> a risk assessment and to reduce the administrative and financial burden on them in doing so. Other companies may use the tool, but they do not get the ‘bonuses’ that small companies get. Furthermore the aim is to improve their level of health and safety; to improve general awareness about the existence of the RA tools and finally to stimulate the development by the social partners of new sector-specific RA tools. Nowadays 182 sector-specific RA tools are available online on the website (www. rie. nl), either via a direct link or if the specific tool is not digital there is at least the contact details of the relevant sector organisation from which the paper-based risk assessment tool can be obtained. Sixty-nine of the RA tools are generated with the OiRA tool generator. The sector-specific digital RA tools are easy to use and the business owner only needs to answer questions that are really relevant to his/her particular field. The intention was that {{you should be able to}} complete the RA including the action plan, within 2 hours. Sometimes it is less, sometimes it takes more time, depending on the content of the tool. Sector-specific RA tools also make it easier to provide detailed solutions for business, as standard solutions to resolve a potential risk are available in the RA tool (or additional information is available, for instance through hyperlinks) ...|$|R
40|$|Across a {{range of}} contexts, federal courts have crafted doctrines that limit {{judicial}} secondguessing of executive nonenforcement decisions. Key case law, however, carries important ambiguities of scope and rationale. In particular, key decisions have combined rationales rooted in executive prerogative with concerns about nonenforcement’s “unsuitability” for judicial resolution. With one nonenforcement initiative now before the Supreme Court and other related issues percolating in lower courts, this Article makes {{the case for the}} latter rationale. Judicial review of nonenforcement, on this account, involves a form of political question, {{in the sense of the}} “political question doctrine”: while executive officials hold a basic statutory and constitutional <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> faithfully <b>execute</b> regulatory statutes, that <b>obligation</b> is subject <b>to</b> incomplete judicial enforcement because structural constitutional considerations place a gap between executive duties and judicial enforcement of those duties. What is more, the twin prongs of the modern political question doctrine—“textual assignment” and “judicial manageability”—usefully describe the gap between executive obligation and judicial power. Bringing enforcement suits and prosecutions in particular cases is a textually assigned function of the executive branch, while the broader executive task of setting priorities for enforcement frequently presents a judicially unmanageable inquiry. This reframing may account descriptively for much of the current doctrine but also carries important normative implications. Among other things, the framework clarifies that judicial decisions may not fully define executive <b>obligations</b> with respect <b>to</b> enforcement; it helps identify contexts in which judicial review may be appropriate, including with respect to current immigration programs before the Supreme Court and the controversial prosecutorial practice of entering “deferred prosecution agreements” in white-collar criminal cases; and it reinforces longstanding arguments for a more flexible doctrine of Article III standing...|$|R
40|$|Best {{execution}} obligations weigh on brokers {{when they}} execute orders {{to trade in}} shares for clients. These obligations {{have been seen as}} an outflow of general agency duties, and have been complemented by regulatory requirements related to best execution, dissemination of trading data, the handling of client orders and – in the United States – an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> at the best publicly available price or better (price protection). Here, different sets of real-world rules are analyzed with regard to transactional efficiency. Economic analyses are used to compare the effects of different rules, and are underpinned by a detailed analysis of relevant rules in the United States, the European Union, France, Sweden and England & Wales. Several normative conclusions can be drawn. Best execution rules that impose an agency duty on brokers do not seem to contribute in a discernible way to increased transactional efficiency. In contrast, disclosure rules that require both brokers and trading venues to provide ex post information about execution quality, and about how client orders have been routed, may contribute to mitigating the information asymmetry between brokers and clients. The compliance costs associated with such rules are outweighed by the positive effects on transactional efficiency. Lastly, a solution such as the US National Market System, which entails consolidated collection and dissemination of market data as well as price protection, can deliver significant efficiency gains through the virtual consolidation of trading venues. It also allows for more detailed regulations on different aspects of order execution, allow order execution regulations to function better, and is conducive to deeper integration of trading. However, creating such a system entails large initial investments. In the end, the choice whether to create a tightly-knit market system or not has wide-ranging implications for market structure, the design of regulatory rules and market integration...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the failure of states to comply with their <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> the warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for the arrest of President Omar Hassan Ahmed Al Bashir of Sudan. President Al Bashir is to stand trial on serious charges, {{including}} acts of genocide, based on action taken on instructions of President Al Bashir to eliminate nationals of Sudan who are not of Arab extraction. President Al Bashir may be depicted as the Adolph Hitler of Africa {{by virtue of his}} efforts to create a Sudanese Herrenvolk and, in the process, causing the death of between 200 000 and 400 000 members of African tribes in the Sudanese province of Darfur and the displacement of approximately 2, 5 million people. A special focus of the article is the hosting of President Al Bashir by the South African government in June 2015 at a summit of the African Union in Johannesburg, in blatant defiance of the rule of law, and escorting him out of the country in contempt of an order of the High Court, Gauteng Division. South Africa claimed that its obligations as a member state of the African Union prevented it from executing the warrant of arrest. However, South Africa was compelled to execute the warrant of arrest (a) as a state party to the ICC Statute; (b) because the Security Council had instructed all member states of the United Nations to do so, and (c) because South Africa’s own Rome Statute Implementation Act, 2002 requires it of South African authorities. Claiming that President Al Bashir as a head of state enjoyed sovereign immunity is also based on a false premise, since sovereign immunity does not apply to prosecutions in international tribunals. Maintaining that President Al Bashir is immune from prosecution in the ICC is criticised in the article. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|We {{naturally}} attribute <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups, {{and take}} such <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> have {{consequences for the}} obligations of group members. The threat posed by anthropogenic climate change provides an urgent case. It seems that we, together, have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prevent climate catastrophe, and that we, as individuals, have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> contribute. However, understood strictly, attributions of <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups might seem illegitimate. On the one hand, the groups in question—the people alive today, say—are rarely fully-fledged moral agents, making it unclear {{how they can be}} subjects of obligations. On the other, the attributions can rarely be understood distributively, as concerned with members’ <b>obligations,</b> because <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> do something require a capacity to do it, and individual members often lack the relevant capacities. Moreover, even if groups can have obligations, it is unclear why that would be relevant for members, exactly because members often lack control over whether group obligations are fulfilled. In previous work, I have argued that a general understanding of individual <b>obligations</b> extends non-mysteriously <b>to</b> irreducibly shared <b>obligations,</b> rendering attributions of <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups legitimate. In this paper, I spell out how the proposed account also helps us understand the relation between individual and shared obligations.
