25|$|As of 2007, several {{airlines}} {{are experimenting with}} base station and antenna systems installed on the airplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during take off and landing. Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline Qantas is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration {{in the autumn of}} 2007. Emirates has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} {{batteries}} employ toxic {{materials such as}} lead, mercury, and cadmium as an electrode or electrolyte. When each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage. Batteries are one form of electronic waste (e-waste). E-waste recycling services recover toxic substances, which can then be used for new batteries. Of the nearly three billion batteries purchased annually in the United States, about 179,000 tons end up in landfills across the country. In the United States, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act of 1996 banned the sale of mercury-containing batteries, enacted uniform labeling requirements for rechargeable batteries and required that rechargeable batteries be easily removable. California and New York City prohibit the disposal of rechargeable batteries in solid waste, and along with Maine require recycling <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phones.</b> The rechargeable battery industry operates nationwide recycling programs in the United States and Canada, with dropoff points at local retailers.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{the factors}} {{influencing}} phone-related driving safety and drivers’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> usage were analyzed. A {{representative sample of}} more than 500 licensed drivers in Texas who own a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> was interviewed based on a well-design questionnaire. Logistic regression model showed that the impact <b>of</b> using <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> on driving safety varies depending {{on the characteristics of}} drivers, such as gender, age, driving experience, and use intensity. Additionally, the results indicated that the strong determinants of phone-related hazard are different from that of phone-related accidents. Regarding the drivers’ perception <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> usage, there are two key findings. First, there is no explicit belief among the drivers about whether <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> usage impairs driving safety regardless of the drivers’ age, gender, driving education experience etc. Second, most of drivers have not realized that <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use while driving would increase their perception reaction time. Based on the analysis of these results, implications <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use on driving safety along with some safety countermeasures, such as selective bans and non-cell phone zones, are discussed in the paper.|$|R

Before its official release date on October5, the band played at the Austin City Limits Music Festival and KBCO's World Class Rockfest. The album was also preceded by its first single, [...] "No Phone", which hit number13 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart; the song covered the ubiquitous and privacy-invading use <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phones,</b> and was described by Jeremy Mahadevan of the New Straits Times as [...] "a traditionally minimalist Cake anthem, with a killer melody and, unique to this album, fairly extensive use of synths". A second single, [...] "Wheels", was also released but failed to chart. Pressure Chief itself hit number17 on the Billboard top200, spending 7 weeks in the charts, and received mixed reviews from critics. Although it was acknowledged as a continuation of their old work, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers, Sam Spies of the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that [...] "the experiments in style that made Cake fun to listen to have all but disappeared from 'Pressure Chief'...What's left is mostly uninspired, so-called alternative rock", and Graeme Hammond of the Sunday Herald Sun wrote that [...] "the melodies are listless, the album bereft of anything with the verve of Short Skirt/Long Jacket or Comfort Eagle".|$|E

40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>phones</b> {{have become}} very {{important}} communication tool for the reach of common person Now a situation has come that without <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> one cannot be comfortable both in domestic and business circle. For the past 15 years scientist started working to screen the harmful effects <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> radiation. The resulting reports from the study are quite contradictory because majority of studies published have failed to show an association between exposure to radiofrequency [RF] from a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> and health problems. While RF energy doesn’t ionize particles, but large amounts can increase body temperatures and cause tissue damage. Two areas of the body, the eyes and the testes, are particularly vulnerable to RF heating because there is relatively little blood flow in them to carry away excess heat. Whereas other reports say that <b>Cell</b> <b>phone</b> users had {{an increased risk of}} malignant gliomas, acoustic neuromas. But recent reports enlighten that one hour <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use per day significantly increases tumor risk after ten years or more. Further studies explain about the Gene-toxic effect, reduction in reproductive capacity in animal study. Whereas other report is quite encouraging to note that <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> radiation has not disturbed sleep and cognitive functions. Since the results are quite contradictory, hence it is necessary to review the study related to electro magnetic effect <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> on human health to create awareness among the people to give more emphasis on limited use <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> to protect innocent future generation of India...|$|R

This was postponed {{because of a lack}} of intelligence, but during the first week fighting was limited to exchanges of fire over the border. The original plan deemed it unnecessary to occupy Lebanese territory to rid the border of Hizbullah. Israel used the air force, both aircraft and attack helicopters, and artillery fire. The Lebanese fighters fired rockets, guided missiles, mortars, Katyusha rockets and heavy machine guns at Israeli towns and positions. According to Yedioth Ahronoth more than 300 rockets were fired from the area during the war. The headquarters of the 91st Division at Biranit just across the border from Ayta ash-Sha'b was subjected to a [...] "hard and extremely accurate" [...] attack by Katyusha rockets.

40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>phone</b> use is {{increasing}} worldwide, {{leading to a}} concern that <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use while driving increases accidents. Several countries, three states and Washington, D. C. have banned the use <b>of</b> hand-held <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> while driving. In this paper, we develop a new approach for estimating the relationship between <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use while driving and accidents. Our approach {{is the first to}} allow for the direct estimation of the impact <b>of</b> a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> ban while driving. It is based on new survey data from over 7, 000 individuals. This paper differs from previous research in two significant ways: first, we use a larger sample of individual-level data; and second, we test for selection effects, such as whether drivers who use <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> are inherently less safe drivers, even when not on the phone. The paper has two key findings. First, the impact <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use on accidents varies across the population. This result implies that previous estimates of the impact <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use on risk for the population, based on accident-only samples, may be overstated by about one-third. Second, once we correct for endogeneity, there is no significant effect of hands-free or hand-held <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use on accidents. ...|$|R
