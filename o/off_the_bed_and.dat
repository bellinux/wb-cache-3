25|$|Early {{ambulation}} also prevents venous stasis {{and physicians}} order OOB {{activities on the}} same day of surgery. This is accomplished in increments. The progression of increasing mobility proceeds by: raising the head of the bed, sitting up in bed, moving {{to the edge of the}} bed, dangling the legs <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> then ambulating to a close chair.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was lying}} there in some pain {{trying to get}} {{cockroaches}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> the guy next to me, this drunken soldier, started singing [...] "The Ocean" [...] from Houses of the Holy.|$|E
2500|$|Raymond v. Raymond mirrors Usher's 2004 Confessions, as a self-confessional album, {{with several}} {{recordings}} from the album inferring to Usher's marriage. Jive Records urban music president and album executive producer Mark Pitts also conceived the album as {{a return to}} the themes of the latter album; [...] "based on what happened with Confessions", Pitts wanted to reproduce its success. Pitts told The New York Times that [...] "Usher had a rough couple years", elaborating: [...] "The scrutiny of everything going on, he was worrying too much about what people were thinking. We felt like we had to get his swagger back. Dust <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> get it popping and young again." [...] Pitts noted that it was important Raymond v. Raymond addressed the rumors that circulated around Usher's marriage. The latter reiterated that the album is not specifically about his marriage, and that it is [...] "about the tug-of-war between man and woman, and the honesty a man has to have." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{heard her}} cries,' {{continued}} Nicholas, 'and ran down, {{in time to}} prevent her setting fire to anything else. You may depend upon it {{that the child is}} not hurt; for I took it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> myself, <b>and</b> brought it here to convince you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, she lurched {{suddenly}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> fell on {{her knees}} before Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically.|$|E
60|$|Anne squirmed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> sat rigidly on a {{chair beside}} it, her face swollen and tear-stained and her eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor.|$|E
60|$|Gerald {{looked at}} his watch, and at length rose <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> went to his room. But he {{returned}} in a few minutes, in his shirt.|$|E
60|$|Sam nearly fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with {{surprise}} <b>and</b> temper. Then 'e hid the locket in his 'and and {{blew out the}} candle.|$|R
50|$|As {{the grain}} dries it is {{possible}} to raise the air-on temperatures, (the second stage or the forced drying stage) to further dry the grain, the target malt moisture after kilning is around 5% by weight. During forced drying the relative humidity of <b>the</b> air coming <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> drops <b>and</b> <b>the</b> maltster is able to use a portion of the warm air as return air.|$|R
5|$|For {{transportation}} on the bay, steamboats were commonplace between Corpus Christi and Ingleside {{during the}} 1930s. Native Americans used a route {{made up of}} a series of shallow oyster beds, dubbed Reef Road. The passage, which was about 18 to 24inches in depth, could be navigated on foot or horseback during low tides to travel across the opening of Nueces Bay into Corpus Christi Bay. White settlers discovered the road in the 1860s, and it became a common way to pass from Portland to Corpus Christi via buggy, although its jagged course had to be marked with posts and horses would sometimes fall <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> drown. A wooden causeway connecting Portland and Corpus Christi was first constructed in 1915, but was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed by several storms. A permanent concrete bridge was erected in the 1950s, and a double lane was added in 1988. The approximately mile long structure is today known as the Nueces Bay Causeway.|$|R
60|$|The girl nodded. Tommy dropped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> {{came and}} {{inspected}} {{the contents of}} the tray. It consisted of a loaf, some margarine, and a jug of coffee.|$|E
60|$|Lenore complied, {{wondering}} and frightened, yet fascinated, too. She {{helped him}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> steadied {{him on his}} feet. Then she felt him release himself so he stood free.|$|E
6000|$|... "Posy will do me {{more good}} than Dr. Filgrave I am quite sure;--but Posy shall go now." [...] So Posy {{scrambled}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> {{the doctor was}} ushered into the room.|$|E
50|$|Hong-guan {{switched}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lights for <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> {{ignored his}} brother {{who was still}} sleeping. Hong-shee, who saw {{stars in the sky}} as he wandered his eyes around the room, jumped into bed hugged his brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "The bed first," [...] whispered Fred; {{and in a}} trice {{the boys}} had taken <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> {{clothing}} <b>and</b> turned up the mattress. On the springs they placed one of the bedsheets and {{on the top of}} this they distributed all of Nappy's choice neckties and also his fancy-colored socks. Then to this they added his cuffs, his fancy underwear, and all of his loose jewelry. The articles were spread over <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with care, so that they rested as flat as possible.|$|R
50|$|On 9 April 1953, Scott Crossfield began {{a series}} of flights on behalf of NACA. These tests {{revealed}} a violent pitch-up tendency during high-speed turns, often as much as 6 g, and on one occasion 8 g. The addition of wing fences partially alleviated this problem. Crossfield flew 25 flights in the XF-92A by 14 October 1953. After the aircraft's last flight the nose gear collapsed as Crossfield taxied <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lake <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> aircraft was retired.|$|R
60|$|So {{there was}} the Wolf with his throat burnt, jumping <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> {{trying to find the}} door, howling and howling as if all the dogs in the country were at his heels.|$|E
6000|$|... "I 'm going, I ain't afraid; I 'll just hug him, and say I 'm ever so glad we {{are going}} to the little house," [...] cried Maud, {{scrambling}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> running down stairs.|$|E
6000|$|Phebe {{clapped her}} hands as she skipped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> ran to the door, saying merrily, [...] "One of them is for your feet, anyway. I don't know what you'll say to the other, but I think it's elegant." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{inspired}} by the true story of Briggs's mother, Laurel Robinson, and aunt, Lois Peeler, who toured Vietnam as singers. The pair slept on the stage, as Robinson recalled: [...] "It was so scary - one night a bomb went <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> fell down <b>and</b> <b>the</b> place shook." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{not able}} to get <b>off</b> from <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> my {{mistress}} much less; and my master was so sick that I thought he had been expiring; so we could not open the cabin-door, or get any account what it was that occasioned such a combustion; nor had we any conversation with the ship's company for two days, they having told us they had not a mouthful of any thing to eat in the ship; and they told us afterwards they thought we had been dead.|$|R
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. I saw it. It was extraordinary. When {{you were}} thrown out he {{held on to the}} top bar with one hand. You came past him in the air, going {{straight}} for the glass. He caught you and turned you <b>off</b> into <b>the</b> flower <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> then lighted beside you like a bird.|$|R
6000|$|... "Louise, put {{something}} over your shoulders. You'll catch cold. Here," [...] said Pan {{and he picked}} a robe <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> wrapped it round her. [...] "I didn't know you were so pretty. No wonder poor Blink worships you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Miss Susan," [...] said Mr. Larramie, [...] "let me {{help you}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> {{you can go into}} another room, and then we will attend to this animal. You need not be afraid to get down. He won't hurt you." ...|$|E
60|$|He got up <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> put his 'ands up as Ginger {{walked across}} the room to 'im, but Ginger on'y wanted to shake 'ands, and arter he 'ad done that 'e patted 'im on the back and smiled at 'im.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Kenwigs rushed out, and was met at {{the door}} of the bedroom by a young man with the baby (upside down) in his arms, who came out so quickly that he knocked Mr. Kenwigs down; handing the child to his mother, he said, [...] "Don't be alarmed, it's all out, it's all over--the little girl, being tired, I suppose, fell asleep and set her hair on fire. I heard her cries and ran up in time to prevent her setting fire to {{anything}} else. The child is not hurt: I took it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> myself <b>and</b> brought it here to convince you." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{came from}} my room at half-past eleven o'clock I found all {{well in the}} sick-room. The new nurse, prim, neat, and watchful, {{sat in the chair}} by the bedside where Nurse Kennedy had sat last night. A little way <b>off,</b> between <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> safe, sat Dr. Winchester alert and wakeful, but looking strange and almost comic with the {{respirator}} over mouth and nose. As I stood in the doorway looking at them I heard a slight sound; turning round I saw the new detective, who nodded, held up the finger of silence and withdrew quietly. Hitherto no one of the watchers was overcome by sleep.|$|R
60|$|This, however, did {{not satisfy}} the captain, and orders were {{forthwith}} {{given that the}} fire should be taken away, <b>the</b> curtains stripped <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> feather <b>beds</b> removed, <b>and</b> everything reduced to {{pretty much the same}} state in which it had usually been left for Harry Norman's accommodation. So much for all the feminine care which had been thrown away upon the consideration of Uncle Bat's infirmities.|$|R
60|$|He got up <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> put his ’ands up as Ginger {{walked across}} the room to ’im, but Ginger on’y wanted to shake ’ands, and arter he ’ad done that ’e patted ’im on the back and smiled at ’im.|$|E
60|$|June {{watched her}} {{removing}} {{with cold water}} the traces of emotion. Save for a little becoming pinkness {{there was nothing left}} when she stood before the mirror. June got <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> took a pin-cushion in her hand. To put two pins into the wrong places was all the vent she found for sympathy.|$|E
6000|$|He {{heard me}} almost {{with his former}} schoolboy delight, when I had succeeded, to his satisfaction, in a feat of {{strength}} or activity. He jumped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> seized both my hands in his strong grasp; his face radiant, his eyes sparkling. [...] "Shake hands, Basil! Shake hands, as we haven't shaken hands yet: this makes amends for everything! One word more, though, about that fellow; where is he now?" ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{designed}} and built a hydrophone system to quantify the amount of bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers where conventional methods fail to capture their episodic, high flux rates. The system was tested in a 45 foot long flume in which one-inch median diameter gravel was transported at varying rates. Transport rates were measured by digital videography. Results show that the total acoustic intensity measured by a hydrophone placed approximately a decimeter <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> is positively <b>and</b> statistically significantly correlated {{with the number of}} moving grains...|$|R
50|$|Droit House, the {{headquarters}} of the Pier and Harbour Company which was situated above a restaurant suffered considerable damage and the Switchback railway was completely destroyed. Work on the Lifeboat Station had previously been underway, with the intended construction of a much needed slipway incomplete, during the storm blocks weighing 10 tons were lifted out of their positions and ‘thrown about like pebbles’. The beach itself, renowned for its golden sands was a carpet of seaweed ripped up <b>off</b> <b>the</b> murky ocean <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> thrown upon <b>the</b> shore by the hundreds of tons.|$|R
50|$|Smith {{was born}} and raised in Meridian, Mississippi. He has one sister and one brother. He was {{inspired}} by contortionists since the age of four, giving him the dream of becoming the world's best one. At this time, Daniel began to jump <b>off</b> <b>the</b> top bunk <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> land in a straddle split, he did 20 backflips followed by 5 backward sit ups, much to the amazement of his family. Later, in his teen years, he began street performing with this technique to attract people's attention. When Smith turned 18, he ran away from home in order to join a touring circus show.|$|R
