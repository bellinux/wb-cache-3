5|$|Adrian {{previously}} converted their downtown {{streets to}} <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual arrangement in the routings {{of the two}} state highways downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US223 business loop. These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009.|$|E
5|$|Trafalgar Square {{is owned}} by the Queen in Right of the Crown and managed by the Greater London Authority, while Westminster City Council owns the roads around the square, {{including}} the pedestrianised area of the North Terrace. The square contains a large central area with roadways on three sides and a terrace to the north, in front of the National Gallery. The roads around the square form part of the A4, a major road running west of the City of London. The square was formerly surrounded by a <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> system, but works completed in 2003 reduced the width of the roads and closed the northern side to traffic.|$|E
5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement {{was similar to}} a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing {{to the east of}} the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street. In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> between 1950 and 1973.|$|E

25|$|The square is {{rectangular}} in shape. Buildings line {{all four}} {{sides of the}} square, while a large oval park sits in its center. A <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> pattern circles the park. Seven of Watertown's main streets (including U.S. Route 11, New York State Route 3, New York State Route 12, and New York State Route 283) intersect at the square, making it a heavy traffic destination for motorists.|$|E
25|$|These {{streetcar}} {{lines were}} replaced with bus routes in the 1930s and 1940s. Before Broadway became one-way, the main bus routes along {{it were the}} New York City Omnibus Company's (NYCO) 6 (Broadway below Times Square), 7 (Broadway and Columbus Avenue), and 11 (Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues), and the Surface Transportation Corporation's M100 (Kingsbridge) and M104 (Broadway Branch). Additionally, the Fifth Avenue Coach Company's (FACCo) 4 and 5 used Broadway from 135th Street north to Washington Heights, and their 5 and 6 used Broadway between 57th Street and 72nd Street. With the implementation of <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic,</b> the northbound 6 and 7 were moved to Sixth Avenue.|$|E
50|$|The road {{continues}} as the A3202 {{and turns to}} east-northeast as it enters the St George's <b>one-way</b> system (<b>traffic</b> flows eastbound only) and ends at St George's Circus, where Waterloo Road, Blackfriars Road, Borough Road, London Road and Lambeth Road meet.|$|R

25|$|A start {{was made}} in April on {{building}} the new depot at Carter Gate (Parliament Street), with accommodation for buses, trams and trolleybuses. Trams were given eight roads, all with pits, the capacity being 80 cars. A most complicated layout of track leading to the depot was put in at same time, the intention being to build a single line for <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> inward to the Market Place along Lower Parliament Street and Hockley, via Victoria Street and South Parade, the outward route, also single line and <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> via Long Row and Pelham Street to Hockley. Hockley was a narrow thoroughfare that had been widened towards its junction with Lower Parliament Street, but, owing to the Corporation being unable to obtain a property higher up the street at a reasonable price, the whole scheme was later abandoned, although not before much track and pointwork had been laid. The double turnout {{at the bottom of}} Hockley had been in position for approximately six months when it was removed together with the short length of track leading to it, no car ever having run over it. Lines built in connection with the depot were along Southwell Road, with a three-way junction at Manvers Street, another three-way junction at Lower Parliament Street, and then along Lower Parliament Street to within 30 yards of Pennyfoot Street. There were trailing points from both lines into Stanhope Street, where the depot entrances were. A single line ran along Stanhope Street, with trailing junctions both ways into Manvers Street.|$|E
25|$|The 3.73-mile (6.00km) {{northwest}} {{section in}} Queens is mostly built to freeway standards and lies {{along the north}} edge of JFK Airport, {{just south of the}} Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue (NY27). Officially it stretches from the interchange between the Belt Parkway, Conduit Avenue (NY27) and Cross Bay Boulevard east to the intersection of Rockaway Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard. The eastbound freeway does in fact begin in the median of Conduit Avenue just west of Cross Bay Boulevard– but it carries NY27 until a point between the IND Rockaway Line underpass and Lefferts Boulevard. The separate NY878 begins at that split, and carries eastbound <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> only until the junction with I-678 (Van Wyck Expressway). There it becomes two-way, continuing east past the JFK Expressway; the freeway ends at a traffic light at North Hangar Road. NY878 ends soon after at Rockaway Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|Bangalore's {{rapid growth}} has created several {{problems}} relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence that the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has found challenging to address. The unplanned nature {{of growth in}} the city resulted in massive traffic gridlocks that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a flyover system and by imposing <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> systems. Some of the flyovers and one-ways mitigated the traffic situation moderately but were unable to adequately address the disproportionate growth of city traffic. A 2003 Battelle Environmental Evaluation System (BEES) evaluation of Bangalore's physical, biological and socioeconomic parameters indicated that Bangalore's water quality and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems were close to ideal, while the city's socioeconomic parameters (traffic, quality of life) aire quality and noise pollution scored poorly. The BBMP works in conjunction with the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and the Agenda for Bangalore's Infrastructure and Development Task Force (ABIDe) to design and implement civic and infrastructural projects.|$|E

25|$|At this point, PA 462 becomes {{concurrent}} with PA 74 and {{the road}} splits into a city-maintained one-way pair, with the eastbound direction following West Market Street, which is two-way and two lanes wide, and the westbound direction following West Philadelphia Street, which carries two lanes of <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> westbound. The two routes follow the one-way pair through urban residential areas of rowhomes with a few businesses, with West Market Street becoming three lanes wide with two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. PA 74/PA 462 cross over the Codorus Creek and intersect a York Railway line at Pershing Avenue. Past this intersection, the routes head into the commercial downtown of York, with West Market Street carrying two lanes of eastbound traffic and West Philadelphia Street carrying two lanes of westbound traffic. PA 74/PA 462 intersects I-83 Bus. (George Street) at Continental Square eastbound and near the York County Courthouse westbound. Past this, the one-way pair becomes East Market Street eastbound and East Philadelphia Street westbound. East of downtown, PA 74 splits from PA 462 by heading south along Queen Street. PA 462 continues east through urban residential areas along the one-way pair. The route crosses a York Railway line in a commercial area before it runs northeast past more homes and a few businesses. At Harrison Street, westbound PA 462 returns to eastbound PA 462 along East Market Street.|$|E
500|$|Business US Highway10 (Bus. US 10) was an {{approximately}} [...] business loop {{running in}} Pontiac.

500|$|Although {{parts of}} South Blackstone Avenue south of 53rd Street {{accommodate}} two-way traffic, near the library it is a northbound street that accommodates <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> running {{north along the}} 1436 east block and ending immediately {{to the west of}} (behind) the Blackstone Library at 4900 south (see Kenwood map in external links below and picture to the right). [...] The street was also named after Timothy Blackstone well after the library was built. [...] The Blackstone Library does not bear a Blackstone Avenue address, despite its proximity. Blackstone Hotel and adjacent Blackstone Theatre (now the Merle Reskin Theatre) would also be named after Timothy Blackstone, whose mansion had stood on their site.|$|E

500|$|The Seattle Department of Transportation secured $190.5 {{million in}} early 2010 to fund its [...] "Mercer Corridor Project", which {{proposed}} improving traffic flow by restoring westbound lanes on Mercer Street. A groundbreaking ceremony was held the following September, with {{construction on the}} project starting shortly thereafter, hoping to reduce congestion on Mercer Street. After two years of construction, the expanded six-lane Mercer Street opened to traffic on August 27, 2012, allowing for two-way traffic between Dexter Avenue North and I-5 to be carried by Mercer Street {{for the first time}} in 44 years. The two-way segment was extended west to 9th Avenue North on May 30, 2014, removing the final section of <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> on Mercer Street, while also permanently closing Broad Street in preparation for the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel project.|$|E
500|$|Depots were {{established}} inland {{rather than in}} the vicinity of the port because the Japanese threatened a landing on the coast. A [...] speed limit was imposed to minimise damage to the main road. This was covered with [...] of dust that turned to mud when it rained. The surface soon broke up under heavy military traffic. The road was only wide enough to allow for <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> and had a number of hairpin bends that required 3-ton trucks to make three-point turns. The 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot was established at 17 Mile in prefabricated huts, erected by Papuan labour, while the 8th Advanced Ammunition Depot handled the ammunition depots at 12 Mile and 19 Mile. In the crisis days of early 1942 some [...] of ammunition was dumped where it was unloaded off the trucks and covered with tarpaulins, with only one storeman on hand to receive it. Soon, no one knew what lay under the tarpaulins. This was hard to rectify as there was an acute shortage of ordnance personnel due to the low priority accorded to service units. The 19 Mile site was poor and a new depot was developed on a better site at 12 Mile.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{after work}} had been {{completed}} on enlarging the locks, in 1882, the canal's size remained a constraint on volumes, notably at Pouilly-en-Auxois, where the tunnel's <b>one-way</b> only <b>traffic</b> lengthened journey times and reduced flexibility for canal users (the tugboat that towed the convoys of péniches can still be seen at Pouilly-en-Auxois.) ...|$|R

500|$|M-39 {{begins at}} Lafayette Boulevard a block east of its {{junction}} with I-75 in Lincoln Park. From there {{the road is}} a six-lane boulevard through residential areas as it [...] runs west-northwesterly to pass under I-75. In Allen Park, the highway continues through residential and commercial areas. Southfield Road crosses lines of the Norfolk Southern Railway and Conrail Shared Assets Operations near the location where the highway turns to the northeast and transitions into a six-lane limited-access freeway. Immediately after this transition, the Southfield Freeway, as M-39 is now called, has an interchange with I-94. There is a second, adjacent interchange that connects to Van Born Road, and the freeway winds its way northeasterly through Dearborn. The freeway is bordered by service drives that carry <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic</b> and bear the Southfield Road name on either side. M-39 meets Outer Drive near {{the campus of the}} University of Michigan–Dearborn. The adjoining properties are residential to the west and commercial to the east. Near Greenfield Village, the freeway curves to the northwest around the Ford Proving Grounds before turning to the north, a direction it will maintain until the end of its run. The freeway crosses the River Rouge and meets US Highway12 (Michigan Avenue) next to the Fairlane Town Center and Ford Motor Company's world headquarters in Dearborn.|$|E
500|$|Construction of Brockway Mountain Drive {{began in}} early 1933 by the Keweenaw County Road Commission with federal highway funding {{designed}} to provide meaningful work to the many copper miners who became unemployed during the Great Depression. Rather than provide welfare, the government provided work for the jobless. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was the agency {{on the federal level}} responsible for the project. Up to 300laborers were employed for a wage of 25¢/hr (equivalent to $/hr in [...] ). The work required to build the road was carried out by manual labor, with the assistance of a team of horses, in a project designed to maximize the numbers of men employed. The grading and leveling of the road surface was done by hand; no survey instruments were used to level the roadway. The road was opened for public use that October 14, at a preliminary cost of $30,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ). That same year, the Skytop Inn opened on top of the mountain. During 1934, additional work was done to the roadway to build the stone walls. Motorists were restricted to <b>one-way</b> <b>traffic,</b> and the road was only open to the public on Sundays and holidays. In the interim, the road was temporarily used as a connection between completed segments of the parallel state highway, numbered M-129 at the time. This highway, now part of M-26, was built starting in July 1933 but was not completed through the area until October 1934. The KCRC declared the road initially finished on June 14, 1935, at a cost of $40,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) ...|$|E
