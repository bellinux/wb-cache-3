This afforded the BBC the opportunity to vet the shows before broadcast. Everett was then heard on various BBC local radio stations before being reinstated at Radio 1 in April 1973.

He then joined Capital Gold in November 1988 to present its daily 10:00am to 1.00pm show. In addition to that, he also presented a weekly oldies show which was heard on various ILR stations around the UK. This was usually heard <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E

25|$|Only on rare {{occasions}} has HNIC broadcast regular-season games involving two U.S.-based teams, and this has usually been due to exceptional circumstances. Special occasions have included Wayne Gretzky's final game in 1999 (which actually took place <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon),</b> the retirement of Steve Yzerman's jersey in 2007, Sidney Crosby's comeback game in Pittsburgh against the New York Islanders in 2011, and the league's major outdoor games (such as the Winter Classic, though the 2014 edition did feature a Canadian team, and the Stadium Series).|$|E
25|$|To {{accommodate}} the American TV coverage on NBC (1966 {{marked the first}} time that a Stanley Cup Finals game was to be nationally broadcast on American network television), Game 1 of the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals was shifted to a Sunday afternoon.

This allowed NBC to air the game live across the United States – marking (surprisingly) the first time that a national audience would see Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux play. Referees and other officials were also wired with microphones in this game, as were the two head coaches. Finally, NBC was also allowed to conduct interviews with players during stoppages in play, to the chagrin of the Hockey Night in Canada crew, whose attempts to do likewise were repeatedly denied by the league in previous years.|$|E

The ceremony attracted a large audience, {{many of whom were}} not members of the Catholic Church. By 3:30p.m., the Australian Light Horse Band began marching towards the orphanage from a cathedral on Verner Street. The priests and the bishop brought up the rear walking behind several Catholic acolytes. While many attendees remained at the orphanage, hundreds walked along with the procession. Children who had marched with the procession were divided and formed a guard of honour. The bishop, who was accompanied by Father Cahill, entered the building and preceded to bless it; a crucifix was subsequently placed in the main dormitory of the building. After the blessing, the bishop addressed the attending crowd from the front verandah, and discussed the use of the building.

2500|$|Rapid {{flooding}} events, including flash floods, {{more often}} occur on smaller rivers, rivers with steep valleys, rivers that flow {{for much of}} their length over impermeable terrain, or normally-dry channels.

After the Spanish missions were established, the games usually took place <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> from about noon until dark. The two teams kicked a small ball (not much bigger than a musket ball), made by wrapping buckskin around dried mud, trying to hit the goalpost. The single goalpost was triangular, flat, and taller than it was wide, on a long post (Bushnell described it, based on a drawing in a Spanish manuscript, as [...] "like a tall, flat Christmas tree with a long trunk"). There were snail shells, a nest and a stuffed eagle {{on top of the}} goalpost. Benches, and sometimes arbors to shade them, were placed {{at the edges of the}} field for the two teams. Spectators gambled heavily on the games. As the Apalachee did not normally use money, their bets were made with personal goods.|$|E
