5|$|Schaeffer's {{chemical}} test {{is often used}} to help identify and differentiate Agaricus species. In this test, aniline plus nitric acid are applied {{to the surface of the}} fruit body, and if positive, a red <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> color forms. Agaricus deserticola has a positive Schaeffer's reaction, similar to species in section Arvensis in the genus Agaricus.|$|E
5|$|The club crest is {{a shield}} {{with black and}} white stripes and a stylised football, with a banner {{displaying}} the club name at the top. It has several variations with the football and banner coloured black, white <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> in different versions.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} Fritillaria species {{are used as}} early spring {{ornamental}} flowers. These vary from the large Fritillaria imperialis (crown imperial) available {{in a number of}} colours such as yellow <b>or</b> <b>orange,</b> to the relatively tiny species such as Fritillaria meleagris or Fritillaria uva-vulpis with their chequered patterns. Erythronium is less common but a popular cultivar is 'Pagoda' with its sulphur yellow flowers. Calochortus (mariposa lily) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars.|$|E
5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red <b>or</b> <b>orange.</b> Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
50|$|In Bulgaria, it {{is called}} greyano vino (греяно вино) ("heated wine"), and {{consists}} of red wine, honey and peppercorn. Sometimes apples and/or citrus fruits, such as lemon <b>or</b> <b>oranges,</b> can be added.|$|R

5|$|Chhinnamasta is {{described}} as being as red as the hibiscus flower or as bright as a million suns. She is usually depicted as red <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> in complexion and sometimes as black. She is depicted mostly nude; however, she is so posed that her genitals are generally hidden or a multi-hooded cobra or jewellery around the waist covers them. She is depicted as being young and slim. She {{is described}} as a sixteen-year-old girl with full breasts, adorned with lotuses or having a single blue lotus near her heart. Sometimes, she is partially or fully clothed.|$|E
5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Clumber Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog of the spaniel type, {{developed}} in the United Kingdom. It is {{the largest of the}} spaniels, and comes in predominantly white with either lemon <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> markings, but can sometimes be either brown or lemon predominantly. The name of the breed is taken from Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire where the breed was first developed. It is a gundog that specialises in hunting in heavy cover. They are gentle and loyal, and can act aloof with strangers. They have several habits which could be considered disadvantages, including a constant shedding of its coat and snoring.|$|E
50|$|Lilium davidii {{grows up}} to 1.5m high, and bears {{up to about}} 20 unscented flowers with {{recurved}} leaves (bent backwards), <b>orange</b> <b>or</b> reddish <b>orange,</b> from July to August.|$|R
25|$|Of the 387 carved stone balls {{known in}} 1976 (now about 425), 375 are about 70mm in diameter, but twelve are known with diameters of 90 to 114mm. Only 7 are oval. They are {{therefore}} {{about the size}} of tennis balls <b>or</b> <b>oranges.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{color of}} the Melo amphora shell {{is said to be}} highly variable. It is {{commonly}} mainly coloured brown, white, <b>or</b> pale <b>orange.</b> It usually presents spiral darker brown banding. The interior is glazed, and is commonly coloured cream <b>or</b> pinky <b>orange.</b>|$|R
5|$|The agaricoid {{species in}} Lactarius, Lactifluus, Multifurca, and Russula are readily {{distinguished}} from other gilled mushrooms by {{the consistency of}} their flesh, which is granular, brittle and breaks easily, somewhat {{like a piece of}} chalk. Russulaceae never have a volva, but a partial veil can be found in some tropical species. Gills are adnate to decurrent, and the colour of the spore print ranges from white to ochre <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> (with the brown-spored Lactarius chromospermus as an exception).|$|E
5|$|The head {{offering}} {{and subsequent}} {{restoration of the}} head signify immortality. The dichotomy of temporality and immortality is alluded to by the blood stream drunk by Chhinnamasta's head– interpreted as amrita and the serpent, which sheds its skin without dying. The skull and severed head garlands signify her victory over Time and fear of Death. Chhinnamasta's black complexion denotes destruction; her depiction as red <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> denotes life. By drinking the blood, she appears as the Saviour, who drinks the negativity {{of the world and}} transforms it to benevolent energies; in this interpretation, the blood is seen in negative light rather than amrita.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.|$|E

5|$|The {{song thrush}} (as {{represented}} by the nominate subspecies T. p. philomelos) is 20 to 23.5centimetres (8 to 9.25in) in length and weighs 50–107grammes (1.8 to 3.8oz). The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> streaks {{on the back and}} wing coverts.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red <b>or</b> <b>orange,</b> while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef sea star (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific sea star is considered {{to be one of the}} world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E
5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow <b>or</b> <b>orange</b> for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this type of vehicle.|$|E
