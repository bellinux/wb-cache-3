25|$|It was {{possible}} to appeal against a judge's decision, and the apellant could demand that the judge show the authority of a book for his judgment. The consequences for a judge could be serious if his judgement was reversed, involving a financial penalty equivalent to the value <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> as laid down in {{the values of the}} parts of the body. He would also be banned from acting as a judge in future.|$|E

25|$|On 30 October, {{police found}} {{the body of a}} 16-year-old boy, named Vadim Gromov, at Donleskhoz station. The wounds upon Gromov's body {{immediately}} linked his murder to the manhunt: the youth had been strangled, stabbed 27 times and castrated, with the tip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> severed and his left eye stabbed. Gromov had been killed on 17 October, 10 days {{before the start of the}} initiative. The same day Gromov's body was found, Chikatilo lured another 16-year-old boy, Viktor Tishchenko, off a train at Kirpichnaya station, another station under surveillance from undercover police, and killed him in a nearby forest. Tishchenko's body—bearing 40 separate knife wounds—was found on 3 November.|$|E

That night, Heather records herself apologizing to her family, as well as to the families of Mike and Josh, taking full responsibility for their predicament.|$|E
2500|$|Suffering from {{lingering}} {{injuries from}} past high-risk acrobatic stage antics and crashes, Van Halen underwent hip replacement surgery in November 1999, after his chronic avascular necrosis, {{with which he}} was diagnosed in 1995, became unbearable. In April 2001, Van Halen confirmed he had been undergoing treatment for tongue cancer since May 2000. [...] The subsequent surgery removed roughly a third <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue.</b> [...] He was declared cancer-free in May 2002.|$|E

2500|$|While {{stationed}} in Perth, Chard—a lifelong pipe smoker—was {{diagnosed with cancer}} of the tongue. He underwent two operations: the second—which took place in March 1897—resulted in the removal <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> but despite this {{it was reported that}} he could still converse clearly. However, by August it was discovered the cancer was terminal and Chard retired to his brother, Charles', rectory at Hatch Beauchamp, Somerset.

2500|$|Although Laughton was {{the main}} star and there were seven other acts on the show, Elvis was on camera {{for more than a}} quarter of the time allotted to all acts. The show was viewed by a record 60 million people which at the time was 82.6 percent of the {{television}} audience, and the largest single audience in television history. [...] "In the New York Times", however, [...] "Jack Gould began his review indignantly: Elvis Presley had 'injected movements <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> and indulged in wordless singing that were singularly distasteful.' Overstimulating the physical impulses of the teenagers was 'a gross national disservice.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Both {{characters}} talk, {{but their}} voices are usually unintelligible. Picking achieves the sound by speaking {{without the use}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue,</b> and constantly changing {{the speed of the}} audio recording; [...] speech balloons are provided. In fact, in the episodes [...] "Asshat" [...] and [...] "Stains", it is implied that this is the only reason they can understand each other. This speech is generally punctuated, but capitals are not used, correct grammar and syntax are rarely employed (e.g. [...] "when come back bring pie!"), and the speech bubbles are occasionally entirely inaccurate; another feature is the occasional addition of an 's' to nouns or verbs that do not require one (e.g. [...] "beefs come from here", or [...] "I have become a Goths" [...] "Is that rights?").|$|E

50|$|In 1992, Mellon, then aged 84, started {{dispersing}} most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stock {{but kept}} Sea Hero, {{who was in}} training with MacKenzie Miller.

60|$|Wall-eye grinned {{as he went}} away. He could, <b>of</b> course, hold <b>his</b> <b>tongue,</b> but {{the little}} case was sodden already, and {{it could not have}} got so wet as that in Austin's room.|$|R
60|$|This was the {{substance}} of what he said, though his talk was more broken since he never learned to speak English well and helped it out with words <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>tongue,</b> <b>of</b> which, as I have told, he had taught me something.|$|R
60|$|The claret got {{the better}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue,</b> at last. He mumbled and muttered; he sank back in his chair; he chuckled; he hiccupped; he fell asleep.|$|E
60|$|Instinctively Schomberg {{looked at}} Ricardo, who only passed the tip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> over his lips with an uncanny sort of gusto, {{but did not}} offer to begin.|$|E

5000|$|When {{learning}} a new language, students {{are not in a}} position to compare L1 and L2 sounds competently because the L2 sounds are evaluated using the categorical perception developed for L1. Trubetzkoy described the process as follows: [...] "The phonological system of a language is like a sieve through which everything that is said passes ... Each person acquires the system <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother <b>tongue.</b> But when he hears another language spoken, he intuitively uses the familiar 'phonological sieve' <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother <b>tongue</b> to analyze what has been said. However, since this sieve is not suited for the foreign language, numerous mistakes and misinterpretations are the result. The sounds of the foreign language receive an incorrect phonological interpretation since they are strained through the 'phonological sieve' of one's own mother tongue." ...|$|R
