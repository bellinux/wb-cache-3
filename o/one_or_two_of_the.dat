Of the 496 species on the list, 167 are noted as rare anywhere in the province and another 108 are rare in <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zones. Eight species have been introduced to North America. One species has been extirpated, one is extinct, and another might be.|$|E
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack by <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent's pieces, {{it is said}} to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E

25|$|After {{the engine}} and {{aircraft}} were in production there were several incidents where <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high pressure turbine blades failed, forcing the aircraft to make emergency landings. An investigation revealed that the turbine section was suffering from a vibration resonance problem, leading to the turbine blade failures. The blades were strengthened and modified to dampen the vibrations. The engine, and the aircraft, returned to service in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Often, <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urinals, {{typically}} {{at one end}} of a long row, will {{be mounted}} lower than the others; they are meant for the disabled and other users who cannot reach the regular urinals.

25|$|Their tactic was {{to advance}} {{simultaneously}} {{from all sides}} targeting a single central objective. This {{would lead to the}} dispersion of enemy forces and prevent their concentration on any one front. Another important reason for this tactic was that even if <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacking columns faced stiff resistance and became unable to break through, then the attack could continue from other flanks. This would also prevent any of the Quresh from escaping.|$|E

The Sydney Ports Corporation employed Waterways Constructions {{to reconstruct the}} lighthouse. The new tower was designed to look as similar as possible to its predecessor, using the salvaged and renovated lantern house, and a new lower section.

25|$|British {{authorities}} quickly realised {{that these}} men could not just be dumped into any old armaments factory because of two problems – the obvious one of language (most Belgian soldiers spoke little or no English) and totally different working practices. Thus {{it was decided to}} man <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factories with only Belgians and put purely Belgian management teams in charge, with a British supervisory team alongside to monitor the financial aspects of the job. After all, it was the British government who was paying for everything, even if the Belgian government was finding the workers. Birtley was chosen as one of these sites.|$|E

25|$|The basic block named CJK Unified Ideographs (4E00–9FFF) {{contains}} 20,971 basic Chinese {{characters in}} the range U+4E00 through U+9FEA. The block not only includes characters used in the Chinese writing system but also kanji used in the Japanese writing system and hanja, whose use is diminishing in Korea. Many characters in this block are used in all three writing systems, while others are in only <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three. Chinese characters were also used in Vietnam's Nôm script (now obsolete). The first 20,902 {{characters in the}} block are arranged according to the Kangxi Dictionary ordering of radicals. In this system the characters written with the fewest strokes are listed first. The remaining characters were added later, and so are not in radical order.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} shape in Inca {{architecture}} was the rectangular building without any internal walls and roofed with wooden beams and thatch. There were several variations of this basic design, including gabled roofs, rooms with <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long sides opened and rooms that shared a long wall. Rectangular buildings {{were used for}} quite different functions in almost all Inca buildings, from humble houses to palaces and temples. Even so, there are some examples of curved walls on Inca buildings, mostly in regions outside the central area of the empire. Two-story buildings were infrequent; when they were built the second floor was accessed from the outside via a stairway or high terrain {{rather than from the}} first floor. Wall apertures, including doors, niches and windows, usually had a trapezoidal shape; they could be fitted with double or triple jambs as a form of ornamentation. Other kinds of decoration were scarce; some walls were painted or adorned with metal plaques, in rare cases walls were sculpted with small animals or geometric patterns.|$|E

25|$|If the {{computer}} controlling the display knows the exact position {{and color of}} all the subpixels on the screen, it {{can take advantage of}} this to improve the apparent resolution in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, then things on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the horizontal resolution of the image at normal viewing distances; the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).|$|E

500|$|The {{first class}} of {{students}} at the Georgia School of Technology was small and homogeneous, and educational options were limited. 85students signed up on the first registration day, October 7, 1888, and the enrollment {{for the first year}} climbed to a total of 129 by January 7, 1889. The first student to register was William H. Glenn. All but <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students were from Georgia. Tuition was free for Georgia residents and $150 (...) for out-of-state students. The only degree offered was a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, and no elective courses were available. All students were required to follow exactly the same program, which was so rigorous that nearly two thirds of the first class failed to complete it. The first graduating class consisted of two students in 1890, Henry L. Smith and George G. Crawford, who decided their graduation order on the flip of a coin.|$|E
