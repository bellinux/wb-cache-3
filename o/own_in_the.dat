5|$|In addition, {{the giant}} planets {{probably}} had accretion disks of their <b>own,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first {{meaning of the}} word. The clouds of captured hydrogen and helium gas contracted, spun up, flattened, and deposited gas {{onto the surface of}} each giant protoplanet, while solid bodies within that disk accreted into the giant planet's regular moons.|$|E

Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time Battle of the Lycus.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} over 1,300hill forts in England, they are {{concentrated}} {{in the south of}} the country, with only seven in Cheshire. Eddisbury is the largest and most complex of the Cheshire hill forts. The forts form two geographical groups of three, with Maiden Castle on its <b>own</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south of the county; Eddisbury hill fort is in the southern group with Kelsborrow Castle and Oakmere hill fort.

5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Competitors {{must meet}} {{a series of}} written and unwritten {{requirements}} before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants {{have been known to}} lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.|$|E
5|$|Dreyer {{shot and}} edited {{the film in}} France and then brought it to Berlin where it was post-synchronized in both German and French. Dreyer did the audio work at Universum Film AG, as they had the best sound {{equipment}} available {{to him at the}} time. Most of the actors did not dub their own voices. The only voices of the actors that are their <b>own</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film are of Schmitz and Gunzburg. The sounds of dogs, parrots, and other animals in the film were fake and were done by professional imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film's score and worked with Dreyer to develop the music.|$|E

5|$|During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain pioneered European {{exploration}} of the globe, {{and in the process}} established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their <b>own</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then, following union between England and Scotland in 1707, Great Britain, the dominant colonial power in North America. It then became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757.|$|E

In 1997, she voiced Young Anastasia in the animated musical film Anastasia. Also in 1997, Dunst co-starred in the black comedy film Wag the Dog, opposite Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman. The following year she voiced the title character, Kiki, a thirteen-year-old apprentice witch who leaves her home village to spend a year on her <b>own,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anime movie Kiki's Delivery Service (1998).|$|E
5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.|$|E

Brandywine was developed on the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad's Pope Creek (Southern Maryland) line in about 1873 and was the only town on the route that developed into a railroad town.|$|R

5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in the Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having one of his <b>own</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of the enemy camp.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter against Navy, Scarbath scored on a quarterback keeper. Before the half, he {{completed}} passes to ends Stan Karnash and Pete Augsburger for 44- and 59-yard touchdowns. In the third quarter, the Midshipmen responded with a score of their <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> final period, Maryland end Elmer Wingate returned an interception 34 yards for another touchdown. Then, 54 seconds later, end Lew Weidensaul recovered a Midshipmen fumble, which allowed Ed Modzelewski to rush five yards for the final score by the Terrapins. Navy scored twice more, but Maryland held on to win, 35–21.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its <b>own</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
5|$|Tradition and old records {{assert that}} {{southern}} Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was inhabited very early by hunter-gatherers of Khoisan descent. Although {{most of these}} early inhabitants {{are believed to have}} been either overwhelmed, driven away or, in some cases, assimilated by later migrants to the area, physical traces of their occupation survive in certain ethnic minority groups inhabiting modern-day Jubaland {{and other parts of the}} south. The latter descendants include relict populations such as the Eile, Aweer, the Wa-Ribi, and especially the Wa-Boni. By the time of the arrival of peoples from the Cushitic Rahanweyn (Digil and Mirifle) clan confederacy, who would go on to establish a local aristocracy, other Cushitic groups affiliated with the Oromo (Wardai) and Ajuuraan (Ma'adanle) had already formed settlements of their <b>own</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sub-region.|$|E
5|$|Although Tenebrae was an Italian production, most of {{the cast}} spoke their {{dialogue}} in English to increase the film's chances of success in United States. For domestic audiences, the film was dubbed into Italian. The English-language dub retained Franciosa's, Saxon's and Steiner's natural voices. However, Nicolodi's voice was dubbed by Theresa Russell, Giuliano Gemma's was dubbed by David Graham, and {{most of the}} female voices were dubbed by Adrienne Posta. Michele Soavi – frequent Argento collaborator, second assistant director on Tenebrae and later a noted director in his own right – acted alongside Robin's in the second flashback scene. Another of Argento's collaborators, Fulvio Mingozzi cameoed as a hotel porter. In common with several other Argento films, close-ups of the killer's gloved hands were Argento's <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> film's Italian-language dub, Argento also provided the opening voice-over, reading aloud descriptions of murderous actions from Neal's fictitious novel, Tenebrae.|$|E
