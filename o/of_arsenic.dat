5|$|A 2015 study {{reported}} that during the non-monsoon season the levels <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> in the Duilong River, at 205.6 μg/L were higher than the WHO guideline of 10 μg/L for drinking water.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities <b>of</b> <b>arsenic.</b> An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family members by putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the matrix {{interference}} for the qualitative and quantitative analysis <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic</b> species in seaweed by ion chromatography (IC) combined with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The matrix of seaweed has {{a significant effect on}} the determination <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic</b> species. In particular, the retention times <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic</b> species in the in the standard solution were different from those in seaweed because of the matrix interference. Thus, it was not suitable to use the chromatographic method for the determination <b>of</b> the <b>arsenic</b> species in seaweed. We investigated an alternative method for the determination <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic</b> species in seaweed. The method was applied for the seaweed samples such as laver, green laver, sea tangle and sea mustard. The sample extraction methods <b>of</b> the <b>arsenic</b> species were also investigated in this study...|$|R
25|$|At least 10 {{nuclear isomers}} have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 66 to 84. The most stable <b>of</b> <b>arsenic's</b> isomers is 68mAs with a {{half-life}} of 111seconds.|$|R

5|$|In {{the past}} the Norman water supply has also been criticized for the {{presence}} of excessive levels <b>of</b> <b>arsenic.</b> The city is attempting to combat this problem by building new wells and removing older ones.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} metalloid in the environmental chemistry literature. It moves through the aquatic environment similarly to arsenic and antimony; its water-soluble salts, in higher concentrations, have a similar toxicological profile to that <b>of</b> <b>arsenic.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} modern {{studies that have}} {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels <b>of</b> <b>arsenic,</b> approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives. Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.|$|E
50|$|For the {{toxicology}} <b>of</b> other <b>arsenic</b> compounds, see Arsenic, Arsenic trioxide, and Arsenicosis. The {{toxicity of}} arsine {{is distinct from}} that <b>of</b> other <b>arsenic</b> compounds. The main route of exposure is by inhalation, although poisoning after skin contact has also been described. Arsine attacks haemoglobin in the red blood cells, causing them to be destroyed by the body.|$|R

5|$|On Earth, thorium {{is not a}} rare element as was {{previously}} thought, having a crustal abundance {{comparable to that of}} lead and molybdenum, twice that <b>of</b> <b>arsenic,</b> and three times that of tin. Thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals. Soil normally contains about 6 ppm of thorium.|$|E
5|$|Orders for {{the bodies}} of the previously-deceased members of the {{household}} to be exhumed were issued {{when it became clear that}} arsenic was the mechanism of Thomas Higgins's death. The bodies of John Flannagan, Mary Higgins, and Margaret Jennings all showed evidence of minimal deterioration – a quality associated with arsenic poisoning – and traces <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> were found in the remains of all three.|$|E

5|$|The 18th and 19th century {{brought the}} {{discovery}} {{and production of}} synthetic green pigments and dyes, which rapidly replaced the earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> is predominately nonmetallic. Whether or not arsenic forms a cation is unclear. Its many metal alloys {{are mostly}} brittle. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by {{the formation of}} oxyanions. Arsenic generally forms compounds {{in which it has}} an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. In the trivalent state, arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties. The halides are hydrolysed by water but these reactions, particularly those of the chloride, are reversible {{with the addition of a}} hydrohalic acid. The oxide is acidic but, as noted below, (weakly) amphoteric. The higher, less stable, pentavalent state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties. Compared to phosphorus, the stronger metallic character <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as AsPO4, As2(SO4)3 and arsenic acetate As(CH3COO)3. The oxide As2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Arsenic has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoarsenic chemistry).|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have {{the highest levels of}} copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels of mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E

5|$|At ambient {{conditions}} bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> and antimony, crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group Rm No. 166), {{which is often}} classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity; they are rather reproducible and abrupt, and are therefore used for calibration of high-pressure equipment.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} exobiologists have {{proposed}} {{the existence of}} a shadow biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium GFAJ-1, was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.|$|E
5|$|They {{maintained}} that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was {{a symptom of the}} poison. Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E
25|$|Albertus Magnus (Albert the Great, 1193–1280) is {{believed}} to have been the first to isolate the element from a compound in 1250, by heating soap together with arsenic trisulfide.

40|$|The {{influence}} of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and chemical species on arsenic accumulation in aquatic floating macrophyte Spirodela polyrhiza L. (duckweed) was investigated.

The As(inorganic) /Fe ratios in plant were {{higher than those of}} CBE-extract which indicate the increased uptake <b>of</b> these <b>arsenic</b> species into the plant relative to the iron.

5|$|Copper {{smelting}} was independently {{invented in}} different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action similar to that <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, {{all of which have}} high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E

40|$|Arsenic {{occurs in}} various {{concentrations}} {{everywhere in the}} soil. It {{has been known for}} quite some time that cereals such as rice can contain more arsenic in the form <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic</b> compounds (also known as inorganic arsenic) from the environment than other cereal types. […] international panels classify inorganic arsenic as carcinogenic for humans. The carcinogenic mechanism <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic</b> has not been fully clarified yet. Thus it has not been possible up to now to derive a safe intake quantity which may not involve an increased risk of cancer. The existence <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic</b> in foods is therefore undesired in all quantities, although it cannot be completely avoided. Examinations undertaken by the regional authorities responsible for monitoring have confirmed that rice and rice products such as rice cakes and creamed rice for infants can have relatively high levels <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic,</b> which is <b>of</b> particular relevance from a toxicological point of view. These findings match up with those of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the authorities in other EU member states. On behalf of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the health risk posed for various consumer groups through the intake <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic</b> compounds with rice and rice products. After making an assessment based on the Margin of Exposure concept, the BfR arrives at the conclusion that health impairments concerning the risk of cancer are possible. The levels <b>of</b> inorganic <b>arsenic</b> in foods should therefore be reduced to an unavoidable minimum (ALARA principle). The BfR recommends that possibilities to reduce exposure to inorganic arsenic compounds from rice and rice products be examined.
