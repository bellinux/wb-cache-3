5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|An {{amplitude}} splitting interferometer uses {{a partial}} reflector {{to divide the}} amplitude of the incident wave into separate beams which are separated and recombined.

5|$|Elves {{appear in}} some place-names, {{though it is}} hard to be sure how many as a variety of other words, {{including}} personal names, can appear similar to elf. The clearest English example is Elveden ("elves' hill", Suffolk); <b>other</b> <b>examples</b> may be Eldon Hill ("Elves' hill", Derbyshire); and Alden Valley ("elves' valley", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.|$|E
5|$|Hudson {{purchased}} Château d'Auppegard near Dieppe, France in 1920, {{which was}} the subject of several of Sand's paintings. Some of the interior paintings are A Spare Room, Château d'Auppegard and Double Doors, Château d'Auppegard. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> are the landscape Auppegard Church from Château, France and one of per partner, Nan Hudson Playing Patience at Auppegard.

5|$|Like the Septuagint, the Greek {{translation}} of the Hebrew Bible that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature in Greek under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek. Some Jews writing in Greek during the late Hellenistic and early Imperial period—notably the philosopher Philo and the historian Josephus—included gentiles among their intended audience. The Sibylline Oracles and the Wisdom of Solomon are <b>other</b> <b>examples</b> of Jewish literature in Greek from this general period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> of Song bridges include Guyue Bridge, a stone {{arch bridge}} in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province. The bridge {{was built in}} 1213, the sixth year of the Jiading Era in the Southern Song dynasty. Song-era pontoon bridges include the Dongjin Bridge, 400m (mi) long, which may still be seen today.|$|E
5|$|Some {{states of}} matter exhibit {{symmetry}} breaking, where the relevant {{laws of physics}} possess some symmetry that is broken. A common example is crystalline solids, which break continuous translational symmetry. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> include magnetized ferromagnets, which break rotational symmetry, and more exotic states such as the ground state of a BCS superconductor, that breaks U(1) phase rotational symmetry.|$|E

5|$|Specialised subsets of English arise spontaneously in {{international}} communities, for example, among international business people, as an auxiliary language. This {{has led some}} scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary languages. Globish uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words with highest use {{in international}} business English) {{in combination with the}} standard English grammar. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> include Simple English.|$|E
5|$|The 1900 Galveston hurricane, {{the deadliest}} natural {{disaster}} {{to hit the}} United States, peaked at an intensity that corresponds to a modern-day Category4 storm. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> of storms that peaked at Category4 intensity, and made landfall at that intensity include: Hazel (1954), Gracie (1959), Flora (1963), Cleo (1964), Betsy (1965), Frederic (1979), Joan (1988), Iniki (1992), Luis (1995), Iris (2001), Charley (2004), Dennis (2005), Gustav (2008), Ike (2008), Joaquin (2015), and Harvey (2017).|$|E
5|$|The deity {{depicted}} on page 9 of the Grolier Codex {{is believed to}} be the Mountain God with split head. This image was otherwise unknown in the 1960s. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> of it were later discovered at the Maya sites of Tancah and Pasión del Cristo. Coe and his colleagues argue that it is very unlikely that a forger would have known about this deity before it was described elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|These {{mechanisms}} can {{be divided}} into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as triosephosphate isomerase, aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate. Some <b>other</b> <b>examples</b> of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for cellular respiration (glycolysis).|$|E
5|$|Variations are {{markedly}} different with each subspecies. The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest, more white along the tips and retraces and obvious wing bars. T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and less obvious wing bars. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri {{and has more}} visible spotting on its breast.|$|E
5|$|Whale {{morphology}} shows {{a number}} of examples of convergent evolution, the most obvious being the streamlined fish-like body shape. <b>Other</b> <b>examples</b> {{include the use of}} echolocation for hunting in low light conditions— which is the same hearing adaptation used by bats— and, in the rorqual whales, jaw adaptations, similar to those found in pelicans, that enable engulfment feeding.|$|E
