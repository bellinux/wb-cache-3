5|$|Fluor diversified its {{business}} more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral Drilling {{and it started}} a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created Fluor Ocean Services in Houston in 1968 and acquired an interest in <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> operations in the 1970s. Fluor acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction. In 1972, Fluor bought land in Irvine, California and started building its new headquarters on it. The following year, the company's oil and gas operations were consolidated under a new entity, Fluor Oil and Gas Corp.|$|E
25|$|PAHs {{typically}} disperse {{from urban}} and suburban non-point sources through road run-off, sewage, and atmospheric circulation and subsequent deposition of particulate air pollution. Soil and river sediment near industrial sites such as creosote manufacturing facilities can be highly contaminated with PAHs. Oil spills, creosote, coal mining dust, and <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> sources can also distribute PAHs in the environment.|$|E
25|$|A related {{issue is}} the methane {{clathrate}} reservoirs found under sediments on the ocean floors. These trap large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane, which ocean warming {{has the potential to}} release. In 2004 the global inventory of ocean methane clathrates was estimated to occupy between one and five million cubic kilometres. If all these clathrates were to be spread uniformly across the ocean floor, this would translate to a thickness between three and fourteen metres. This estimate corresponds to 500â€“2500 gigatonnes carbon (GtC), and can be compared with the 5000 GtC estimated for all <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> reserves.|$|E

50|$|LPG can {{be stored}} in a variety of manners. LPG, as with <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> can be {{combined}} with renewable power sources to provide greater reliability while still achieving some reduction in CO2 emissions.|$|R
25|$|Different {{production}} methods {{each have}} differing associated investment and marginal costs. The energy and feedstock could originate from {{a multitude of}} sources, i.e. natural gas, nuclear, solar, wind, biomass, coal, <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> and geothermal.|$|R
50|$|Biogenic (b) methane is {{produced}} by microorganisms in a process called methanogenesis. Abiogenic (a) methane stored in rocks and soil stems from ancient biomass and the generation mechanisms {{are the same as}} for <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Peak wheat is {{the concept}} that {{agricultural}} production, due to its high use of water and energy inputs, {{is subject to the}} same profile as oil and <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> production.

50|$|It is {{produced}} {{on a large}} scale by flue gas desulfurization (FGD). When coal or <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> is burned, the byproduct is known as flue gas. Flue gas often contains SO2, whose emission is often regulated to prevent acid rain. Sulfur dioxide is scrubbed before the remaining gases are emitted through the chimney stack. An economical way of scrubbing SO2 from flue gases is by treating the effluent with Ca(OH)2 hydrated lime or CaCO3 limestone.|$|E
50|$|Part of the 50 reissued permits {{also include}} {{construction}} of natural gas, oil, and <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> pipelines. This includes {{the construction of}} the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has caused major controversies over its possible affects on the surrounding environment. Because of this controversy, the Obama Administration did not grant a real estate easement to the developers. This action by the Obama Administration did not stop the construction because the jurisdiction still falls under the Rivers and Harbors Act, which is overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.|$|E
40|$|The current {{concern about}} an {{anthropogenic}} impact on global climate {{has made it}} of interest to compare the potential effect of various human activities. A {{case in point is}} the comparison between the emission of greenhouse gases from the use of natural gas and that from <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> This comparison requires an evaluation of the effect of methane emissions relative to that of carbon dioxide emissions. A rough analysis based on the use of currently accepted values shows that natural gas is preferable to <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> in consideration of the greenhouse effect as long as its leakage can be limited to 3 to 6 percent...|$|R
50|$|Petrochemicals, {{also called}} {{petroleum}} distillates, are chemical products derived from petroleum.

Exxon Mobil includes the NBCC on its 2004 list of contributions and community investments. From 2002 through 2014 NBCC received $1 million, and from 2008 through 2015 $800,000, from Exxon Mobil. In June of 2015 Peabody Energy contributed $10,000 to the NBCC. <b>Other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> companies that have funded NBCC include the Gulf Power Company division of the Southern Company and Chevron. The NBCC acknowledges funding from fossil fuel companies.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of fuel cell technologies currently employed are either PEM or SOFC cells. However, the electrolyte is often costly {{and not always}} completely effective. Although hydrogen technology has significantly evolved, <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> based cells (such as DMFC's) are still plagued by the shortcomings of proton exchange membranes. For example, fuel crossover means that low concentrations need to be used which limits the available power of the cell. In solid oxide fuel cells, high temperatures are needed which require energy and {{can also lead to}} quicker degradation of materials. Membraneless fuel cells offer a solution to these problems.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani did {{not address}} the fact that coal-generated {{electricity}} produces more carbon dioxide than <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> and was not asked what specific measures could be taken to reduce the environmental impacts of coal.

50|$|Molten {{carbonate}} {{fuel cells}} are not prone to poisoning by carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide â€” {{they can even}} use carbon oxides as fuel â€” making them more attractive for fueling with gases made from coal. Because they are more resistant to impurities than other fuel cell types, scientists believe that they could even be capable of internal reforming of coal, assuming they can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal, a dirtier fossil fuel source than many others, into hydrogen. Alternatively, because MCFCs require CO2 be delivered to the cathode along with the oxidizer, {{they can be used}} to electrochemically separate carbon dioxide from the flue gas of <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> power plants for sequestration.|$|E
50|$|A key {{advantage}} of Methane is the existence in principle {{of most of}} the infrastructure and the supply chain, which is non-interchangeable with Hydrogen. Whilst distribution capacity may need to be scaled up, widespread adoption of Methane as an autonomous mobility fuel should be less expensive to society and more rapid to implement than other alternative fuel options. In many markets, especially the Americas, natural gas may trade at a discount to <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> products such as petrol, diesel or coal, or indeed be a less valuable by-product associated with their production that has to be disposed. Venting or leaking of natural gas to atmosphere would result in far greater global warming potential than its combustion to CO2. Many countries also provide tax incentives for natural gas powered vehicles due to the environmental benefits to society.|$|E
50|$|On {{a smaller}} scale, poultry litter {{is used in}} Ireland as a biomass energy source. This system uses the poultry litter as a fuel to heat the broiler houses for the next batch of poultry being grown thus {{removing}} the need for LPG gas or <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Panama, {{through its}} {{affiliate}} HidrolÃ³gica del Teribe (HET), the Bonyic {{hydroelectric power station}} is being built. This power station {{will be able to}} generate up to 31.3 MW and will contribute to decrease that country's dependence on imported oil and <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> that are highly contaminating of the environment.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} actuator {{is powered by}} a motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical torque. The electrical energy is used to actuate equipment such as multi-turn valves. It is one of the cleanest and most readily available forms of actuator because it does not directly involve oil or <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric stations is low, around 7-10%, because geothermal fluids {{are at a}} low temperature compared with steam from boilers. By the laws of thermodynamics this low temperature limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy during the generation of electricity. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. The efficiency of the system does not affect operational costs as it would for a coal or <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> plant, but it does factor into the viability of the station. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires high temperature geothermal fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large - up to 96% has been demonstrated. However the global average capacity factor was 74.5% in 2008, according to the IPCC.|$|E
50|$|In February 2009, the Ex-Im Bank {{settled a}} seven-year-long legal {{proceeding}} brought by Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace {{together with the}} cities of Boulder, Arcata and Oakland. The plaintiffs said that the Ex-Im Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation provided financial assistance to oil and <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> projects without first evaluating the projects' climate change impacts. In 2005, the plaintiffs were granted legal standing to sue. This is considered a landmark decision {{because it is the}} first time that a federal court has specifically granted legal standing for a lawsuit exclusively challenging the federal government's failure to evaluate the impacts of its actions on the Earth's climate and U.S. citizens. In its settlement agreement, the Ex-Im Bank agrees to evaluate the carbon dioxide emissions as part of its determination for qualification for a project. However, Ex-Im Bank fossil fuel financing and associated greenhouse gas emissions grew swiftly after the settlement agreement, coinciding with Chairman Hochberg's tenure. Between 2009 and 2012, Ex-Im Bank fossil fuel financing grew from $2.56 billion to nearly $10 billion.|$|E

50|$|At present, {{the main}} energy source used by humans is non-renewable <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> Since {{the dawn of}} {{internal}} combustion engine technologies in the 19th century, petroleum and <b>other</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> have remained in continual demand. As a result, conventional infrastructure and transport systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain prominent throughout the globe. The continual use of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> at the current rate is believed to increase global warming and cause more severe climate change.|$|R
