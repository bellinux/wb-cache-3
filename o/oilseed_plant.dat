40|$|AbstractThe {{germination}} {{process of}} <b>oilseed</b> <b>plants</b> {{is characterized by}} a mobilization of the storage lipids which constitute the major carbon source for the growing seedling. Despite the physiological importance of the lipid mobilization, the mechanism of this process is not well understood. Recently, it was found that a specific linoleate 13 -lipoxygenase is induced during the stage of lipid mobilization in various <b>oilseed</b> <b>plants</b> and that this enzyme is translocated to the membranes of the lipid storage organelles, the so called lipid bodies. Lipoxygenase expression was paralleled by the occurrence of enantiospecific hydro(pero) xy polyenoic fatty acid derivatives in the storage lipids suggesting the in vivo action of the enzyme. Furthermore, it was reported that oxygenated polyenoic fatty acids, in particular as 13 (S) -hydro(pero) xy- 9 (Z), 11 (E) -octadecanoic acid [13 (S) -H(P) ODE], are cleaved preferentially from the storage lipids when compared with their non-oxygenated linoleate residues. These findings may suggest that 13 (S) -H(P) ODE may constitute the endogenous substrate for β-oxidation during lipid mobilization of <b>oilseed</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

One of the critics of this development is the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI), a group that campaigns on behalf of farmers in poor countries. Hope Shand, research director at RAFI, fears that such developments would {{have a major impact}} tin the countries that depend on sales of 'naturally, produced' coconut and palm oil which, in many cases, comes from small farmers who grow coconut or oil palm alongside other crops. Hope Shand believes that this genetically engineered oilseed rape {{is a perfect example of}} how genetic engineering may impoverish the Third World rather than helping it to develop. In reply, Roger Salameh, a market analyst with Calgene, says that the altered rapeseed poses no threat to the countries which produce tropical oils because their aim is to produce a reliable oil source to buffer the US market from the wildly fluctuating crops of tropical countries. In 1993 the US imported 600, 000 tonnes of lauric oil, while Calgene's goal for the new rapeseed plant is to produce only about 10 % of the lauric oils used in the US.

The mRNAs begin to accumulate during late embryogeny, reach maximal levels in seedling cotyledons, are not detected at significant amounts in leaves, and are distributed similarly in cotyledons and axes of seedlings. Furthermore, transcription studies with isolated nuclei indicate that the genes are controlled primarily although not exclusively at the transcriptional level.

Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the mechanisms involved in controlling the C 18 - unsaturated-fatty-acid content of the oils. We have demonstrated that the microsomes were capable of: the transfer of oleate from acyl-CoA to position 2 of sn-phosphatidylcholine for its subsequent desaturation and the return of the polyunsaturated products to the acyl-CoA pool by further acyl exchange; the acylation of sn-glycerol 3 -phosphate with acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid, which was further utilized in diacyl- and tri-acylglycerol synthesis; and (3) the equilibrium of a diacylglycerol pool with phosphatidylcholine. The acyl exchange between acyl-CoA and position 2 of sn-phosphatidylcholine coupled to the equilibration of diacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine brings about the continuous enrichment of the glycerol backbone with C 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids for triacylglycerol production. Similar reactions were found to operate in another <b>oilseed</b> <b>plant,</b> safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.).

There have been several transcriptomic analyses of developing physic nut seeds using ESTs, but they have provided limited information on the accumulation of stored resources in the seeds. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We applied next-generation Illumina sequencing technology to analyze global gene expression profiles of developing physic nut seeds 14, 19, 25, 29, 35, 41, and 45 days after pollination (DAP). The acquired profiles reveal the key genes, and their expression timeframes, involved in major metabolic processes including: carbon flow, starch metabolism, and synthesis of storage lipids and proteins in the developing seeds. The main period of storage reserves synthesis in the seeds appears to be 29 - 41 DAP, and the fatty acid composition of the developing seeds is consistent with relative expression levels of different isoforms of acyl-ACP thioesterase and fatty acid desaturase genes. Several transcription factor genes whose expression coincides with storage reserve deposition correspond to those known to regulate the process in Arabidopsis.

Camelina has been identified as a useful plant source. Camelina (Camelina sativa), a member of the mustard family, is an <b>oilseed</b> <b>plant</b> with both summer annual and winter hardy biennial forms. A series of field trials were conducted over a three-year period, as part of an EUsponsored research programme across four countries. The objective was to establish the potential of winter hardy varieties of camelina, grown without the use of herbicides, fungicides or pesticides, as a commercial source of a high quality oil for human consumption. The study has shown that winter camelina cannot produce an economic yield in Ireland where the use of herbicides and fungicides are excluded. The relatively mild wet winters encountered in Ireland result in very high levels of weed competition. The resultant dense, wet canopy encourages high levels of disease infection and creates conditions where excessive lodging occurs early in the season. The result is difficult harvesting conditions and low yields. The herbicide Trifluralin (Treflan) incorporated into the seedbed before sowing was identified as an effective herbicide for camelina. However, the full potential of the winter crop, using herbicides and an effective disease control programme, remains to be established. End of Project ReportEuropean Union Framework Programm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Soluble {{sugar levels}} must be closely {{regulated}} in germinating seeds to ensure an adequate {{supply of energy}} and building materials for the developing seedling. Studies on germinating cereal seeds indicate that production of sugars from starch is inhibited by increasing sugar levels. Although numerous {{studies have focused on}} the regulation of starch metabolism, very few studies have addressed the control of storage lipid metabolism by germinating oilseeds. Results Mobilization of storage lipid by germinating seeds of the model <b>oilseed</b> <b>plant</b> Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. occurs at a greatly reduced rate in the presence of exogenous glucose or mannose, but not in the presence of equi-molar 3 - O -methylglucose or sorbitol. The sugar-insensitive 5 - 1 /abscisic acid-insensitive 4 - 101 (sis 5 - 1 /abi 4 - 101) mutant is resistant to glucose inhibition of seed storage lipid mobilization. Wild-type seedlings become insensitive to glucose inhibition of storage lipid breakdown within 3 days of the start of imbibition. Conclusions Growth in the presence of exogenous glucose significantly retards mobilization of seed storage lipid in germinating seeds from wild-type Arabidopsis. This effect is not solely due to the osmotic potential of the media, as substantially higher concentrations of sorbitol than of glucose are required to exert significant effects on lipid breakdown. The inhibitory effect of glucose on lipid breakdown is limited to a narrow developmental window, suggesting that completion of some critical metabolic transition results in loss of sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of glucose on lipid breakdown. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Insect pollinators play an {{important}} role in crop pollination, but the relative contribution of wild pollinators and honey bees to pollination is currently under debate. There is virtually no information available on the strength of pollination services and the identity of pollination service providers from Asian smallholder farming systems, where fields are small, and variation among fields is high. We established 18 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields along a large geographical gradient in Jiangxi province in China. In each field, <b>oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> were grown in closed cages that excluded pollinators and open cages that allowed pollinator access. The pollinator community was sampled by pan traps for the entire oilseed rape blooming period. Results: <b>Oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> from which insect pollinators were excluded had on average 38 % lower seed set, 17 % lower fruit set and 12 % lower yield per plant, but the seeds were 17 % heavier, and the caged plants had 28 % more flowers and 18 % higher aboveground vegetative biomass than plants with pollinator access. <b>Oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> thus compensate for pollination deficit by producing heavier seeds and more flowers. Regression analysis indicated that local abundance and diversity of wild pollinators were positively associated with seed set and yield/straw ratio, while honey bee abundance was not related to yield parameters.

Yet, the melliferous capacity in sunflower is affected by the climate conditions [3], fact ascertained by beekeepers over great variations in time and space of honey productions. Likewise, the melliferous capacity in sunflower differs from one hybrid to another [1][2], the beekeepers being interested in the melliferous capacities specific to various sunflower hybrids cultivated in our country. The current work depicts the results of researches on the melliferous capacity on a variety of 4 sunflower hybrids cultivated over 5 periods, under the conditions of the southern part of Romania, (15 km North-East from Bucharest) and under the climate conditions of 2007. The studied sunflower hybrids were: Fleoret OR, Melodi, Sunko and Arena. By the cultivation over different periods it was intended that the flowering period to overlap periods with different climate conditions, so to determine the melliferous potential in the hybrids studied in different climate conditions and to note the way in which the vary according to the climate conditions...|$|E
40|$|Camelina sativa is a cruciferous <b>oilseed</b> <b>plant.</b> With {{the aim of}} {{describing}} the general characteristics of the oil obtained from the seeds of plants grown in Slovenia and of comparing it to camelina oil from other countries we determined some physico-chemical properties, fatty acid composition, iodine and saponification value and followed its oxidative stability under different storage conditions. The density at 20 °C was (0. 927 0. 0001) g/cm 3 and the refractive index reached 1. 4756 0. 0001 at 25 °C. The analysis of fatty acids showed 10. 3 % of saturated and 55. 8 % of polyunsaturated acids, with 16. 9 % of linoleic (C 18 : 2), 35. 2 % of -linolenic (C 18 : 33) and 1. 6 % of erucic acid (C 22 : 1). Determination of oxidative stability of this highly unsaturated oil revealed that the formation of primary oxidation products was affected by photooxidation. The peroxide value, PV, of fresh oil was (2. 38 0. 01) meq O 2 /kg, while after 1 month in daylight at room temperature PV reached (21. 0 0. 1) meq O 2 /kg. When stored in darkness PV was (8. 12 0. 08) meq O 2 /kg. In the fresh oil, the p-anisidine value, AV, was 6. 2 0. 1, after 11 months at room temperature 10. 4 0. 1, and after the same time at 8 °C in darkness 7. 1 0. 1. Susceptibility to oxidation of camelina oil {{was measured by the}} Rancimat test and expressed as the induction period. In fresh camelina oil the induction period was 4. 8 h...|$|E
40|$|Plant-specific GRAS {{transcription}} factors play {{important roles}} in regulating growth, development, and stress responses. Castor beans (Ricinus communis) are important non-edible <b>oilseed</b> <b>plants,</b> cultivated worldwide for its seed oils and its adaptability to growth conditions. In this study, we identified and characterized a total of 48 GRAS genes based on the castor bean genome. Combined with phylogenetic analysis, the castor bean GRAS members were divided into 13 distinct groups. Functional divergence analysis revealed the presence of mostly Type-I functional divergence. The gene structures and conserved motifs, {{both within and outside}} the GRAS domain, were characterized. Gene expression analysis, performed in various tissues and under a range of abiotic stress conditions, uncovered the potential functions of GRAS members in regulating plant growth development and stress responses. The results obtained from this study provide valuable information toward understanding the potential molecular mechanisms of GRAS proteins in castor beans. These findings also serve as a resource for identifying the genes that allow castor beans to grow in stressful conditions and to enable further breeding and genetic improvements in agriculture...|$|R
40|$|An Arabidopsis cDNA (AtPGMp) {{encoding}} the plastidic phosphoglucomutase (PGM) {{predicted a}} 623 -amino acid protein with an N-terminal sequence {{typical of a}} plastid signal peptide. Expression of a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli confirmed its enzyme activity. The recombinant enzyme had an apparent Km value of 98. 5 μm and a Vmax of 4. 48 μmol min− 1 (mg protein) − 1. The Calvin cycle intermediates fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate and ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate exerted an inhibitory effect on PGM activity, supporting its proposed involvement in controlling photosynthetic carbon flow. A point mutation was identified in the AtPGMp gene of the Arabidopsis pgm- 1 mutant. The mutation in the mutant transcript generated a stop codon at about {{one third of the}} wild-type open reading frame, and thus rendered the polypeptide nonfunctional. Storage lipid analysis of the pgm- 1 mutant seeds showed a 40 % reduction in oil content compared with that of wild type. Our results indicate that plastidic PGM is an important factor affecting carbon flux in triacylglycerol accumulation in <b>oilseed</b> <b>plants,</b> most likely through its essential role in starch synthesis...|$|R
40|$|This {{scientific}} paper {{presents the}} evolution of oilseeds market in Romania, during the period 2008 - 2013. In order to show as concise as possible {{the reality of the}} oilseeds sector, the research pictures, on the one hand, an evolution of oilseeds specific indicators and on the other hand, an evolution of external trade. Romania disposes of tradition and favourable pedo-climatic conditions for cultivating the <b>oilseeds</b> <b>plants.</b> This is demonstrated by the favourable results obtained in the last years, especially concerning the sunflower crop. In 2013, Romania registered a record for sunflower, occupying the first position in the European Union for cultivated area and production. A negative aspect is represented by the fact that our country has the best conditions in Europe for soybean crop, but it is still dependent on import. Romania imports a huge quantity of soybean oilcakes for animal feeding. Nowadays, Romania is an important actor in the sunflower world market, covering almost 19 % of the global demand. In perspective, one could expect significant oilseeds productions with a positive influence on the agro-food trade balance in our country...|$|R
