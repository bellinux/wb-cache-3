5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard's role in all this appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Work</b> as an Author.|$|E
25|$|According to Kierkegaard in his {{autobiography}} The Point of View <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Work</b> as an Author, most of his pseudonymous writings are not necessarily reflective of his own opinions.

The main theme <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>works</b> is the concept of "performativity" on the social and cultural construction of identity, which is examined in terms of gender roles, nationalism and health. The notion of "believing" comes out as the focal point when analyzing and defining these concepts.

25|$|Many of Kierkegaard's earlier {{writings}} from 1843 to 1846 {{were written}} pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous The Point of View <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Work</b> as an Author, {{he explained that}} the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is Anti-Climacus, a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of The Point of View: Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.|$|E

I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>work.</b> I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E

There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places.
