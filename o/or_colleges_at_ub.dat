50|$|When the University of Minnesota {{perceived}} its {{need for}} preparing instructors {{to teach in}} this new emerging area of vocational education, they began to look for partnerships. On April 22, 1920, Fred Snyder, President of the University of Minnesota, entered into a cooperative agreement with William Hood Dunwoody Institute allowing students who were enrolled at the University in teacher training courses to spend {{a portion of their}} class time at the institute to receive experiences related to observations and practice of all types of trade and industrial education. The reciprocity of this agreement allowed Dunwoody instructors to enroll and receive credit for any courses offered by the <b>College</b> of Education <b>at</b> the University that were a part of the teacher training authorized by the Smith Hughes Act. These matriculations were considered scholarships and did not encumber the University or the Institute in monetary exchanges, only the awarding of credits.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{creative}} project {{was to develop a}} First-Year Experience (FYE) course for matriculating college students that included many developmental components including life skills, diversity immersion, and a mandatory student involvement component. This project was done to create a structure within FYE settings that emphasizes outside involvement as a complement to the academia components. This course was designed as a complement to the overall first-year experience that freshmen students will have. While FYE programs already exist, this class was made to further get the student involved with his or her school outside of the classroom. Many FYE programs have involvement components that encompass work, volunteering or other clubs – but none that were studied made it a mandatory component. By engaging in outside involvement outside of the classroom, students become more affiliated with his <b>or</b> her <b>college</b> surroundings and may have a better collegiate experience than a student who is not engaged with involvement. With the design of this class, students will become more involved with their university <b>or</b> <b>college</b> <b>at</b> both the social and academic level.
