500|$|While on {{the trail}} in Iowa on November 20 Dodd criticized fellow {{candidates}} who threatened to cut off funding to Pakistan in light of President Pervez Musharraf's suspension of the constitution. He stated [...] "I think it's a very dangerous thing to suggest at this point. We could find ourselves cut <b>off.</b> ... <b>We</b> could not get into Afghanistan except through Pakistan. So {{in addition to the}} issue of nuclear weapons, and who controls them, and a state hostile to our interest, {{you have to be careful}} how much you threaten." ...|$|E
500|$|Years later, showrunner D. B. Weiss {{commented that}} the {{explicit}} style of the execution scene was selected in part {{to make it clear}} to the viewers that Eddard Stark, despite being the arguable protagonist of season one, actually was dead: [...] "It’s that rule: 'If you don't see the body then they’re not really dead.' [...] Like when we cut Ned’s head <b>off,</b> <b>we</b> didn’t want a gory Monty Python geyser of blood, but we needed to see the blade enter his neck and cut out on the frame where the blade was mid-neck. [...] we needed Ned's death to be totally unambiguous." ...|$|E

Speaking later of the severe losses suffered by the squadron—eight out of nineteen planes—Shannon contended, [...] "I suppose we had become hardened to loss– we could shrug it <b>off.</b> <b>We</b> had to, otherwise we could never have flown again."

500|$|Years later, Wintour {{admitted}} the photo {{had never been}} planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when Vogue put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, [...] "I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And <b>off</b> <b>we</b> went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, 'This is something new. This is something different.' [...] The printers called {{to make sure that}} was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made." [...] In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. [...] "t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for Vogue." ...|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{was an avid}} music lover, most {{interested}} in Baroque and Renaissance music. She sang in choral groups {{for most of her}} life, spending over 50 years in the Philadelphia Chamber Chorus. She was also a hiking and canoeing enthusiast. She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it <b>off,</b> <b>we</b> started courting. I flew to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not care what the world thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her and kissed her. That was not being done in 1961." ...|$|E

Lindala later said, [...] "he little babies kept tearing their hair <b>off,</b> <b>we</b> kept gluing it back on". Lindala was happy that the episode was filmed {{in black and}} white because it helped [...] "the prosthetic [...] it is difficult to work in a foam piece that long and not recognize it as a painted, opaque, false translucency."

Although the [...] "Evil Woman" [...] single failed to chart, the band were afforded two days of studio time in November to record their debut album with producer Rodger Bain. Iommi recalls recording live: [...] "We thought 'We have two days {{to do it and}} one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and <b>off</b> <b>we</b> went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|As soon as Starr {{arrived in}} Delhi he asked Evans {{to take him}} to a doctor because of a {{reaction}} to an inoculation: [...] "When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.'

500|$|Increasing {{territorial}} {{conflict between}} the Sioux and the Ojibwe on the western frontier, particularly along the Mississippi river, led the U.S. government to attempt to mediate the conflicts. President Andrew Jackson's policy toward the tribes ultimately was to either pacify them sufficiently to allow westward expansion of American settlers, or else remove the tribes from {{the areas in which}} they prevented settlement. The First Treaty of Prairie du Chien (1825), among its provisions established southern Minnesota as well as much of modern North and South Dakota as the homeland of the Dakota Sioux. The Ojibwe were given northern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin. The U.S. government, though, failed to enforce the treaty agreements leading to Little Crow's pronouncement to Indian agent Taliaferro in 1829: [...] "We made peace to please you, but if we are badly <b>off</b> <b>we</b> must blame you for causing us to give up so much of our lands to our enemies." ...|$|E
500|$|Chuck's {{father and}} co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated {{the fact that}} he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days <b>off</b> <b>we</b> had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} the About.com, Nancy Basile's review was mixed to {{positive}} {{and gave the}} episode a score of four out of five. She wrote, [...] "...though I disagree {{with a few of}} the animator's choices, this Christmas special is a treat." [...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We thought that was a great idea. So we came up with our own little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes <b>off</b> ... <b>We</b> honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E

500|$|When Phase II was {{discussed}} in the media, the return of Whitney as Rand {{was one of the}} things highlighted. Two weeks before the series was about to shoot, it was canceled by Paramount executives. Instead there was going to be a film. Whitney returned for , with Roddenberry bringing her back as Rand who was now the transporter chief on board the Enterprise. The film reunited the entire main cast of Star Trek. She didn't appear in , and wasn't in the script for [...] But for the latter film, Nimoy, who was directing the movie, gave Whitney a cameo as another character who was looking out of a window in spacedock watching the return of the damaged Enterprise at the start of the production. As he was also directing The Voyage Home, he was looking to give Whitney a larger role. By this time, she had hoped that Rand had moved over to become a counselor – an idea originally suggested by a fan. Alongside Majel Barrett as Christine Chapel, the duo were given four pages of dialogue initially which was trimmed down to one scene in the final film. Following the reappearance, Whitney was enthusiastic about returning as Rand, saying [...] "I think Janice Rand is going to be around for a long time, as long as they don't kill our characters <b>off,</b> <b>we</b> have a chance of constantly coming back." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles flew to India in February 1968, {{to visit}} the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the London Hilton hotel). Evans arrived in India {{a few days earlier}} to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his {{inoculation}} shots were causing him pain. Evans: “When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So <b>off</b> <b>we</b> go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'." [...] Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: [...] "The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me [...] "No bloody foreigner is going to stop me in my own country", I cooled it." [...] Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: [...] "It's hard to believe that a week has already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly," [...] and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.|$|E

2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "The {{dialogue}} in tonight's episode was flat and sometimes ridiculous but not necessarily because of the subject at hand.

The delivery and flow all felt a little <b>off.</b> <b>We</b> can see how Emma is slowly succumbing to becoming the Dark One and it's great to see Merlin is already free, but the scenes between Henry and Violet were a distraction and a spell being cured with love is something we've seen before."
