5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers in the direction <b>of</b> <b>lean,</b> but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, {{at which point the}} steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle <b>of</b> <b>lean</b> increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E

30|$|The {{contents}} of CO 2 and H 2 S {{in the wet}} purified gas decreased with the increasing circulation rate <b>of</b> the <b>lean</b> solution. However, the CO 2 absorption rate eventually dropped when the circulation rate <b>of</b> the <b>lean</b> solution was increased beyond 320  m 3 /h. This was because the reaction rate between CO 2 and MDEA decreased. To remove {{a large amount of}} CO 2, the retention time <b>of</b> the <b>lean</b> solution on the tray had to be maximized. Thus, increasing the circulation rate inevitably shortened the retention time <b>of</b> the <b>lean</b> solution on the tray, which slowed down the CO 2 absorption rate. In addition, the reboiler load increased with the increasing circulation rate. Based on the simulation results, the circulation rate <b>of</b> the <b>lean</b> solution was estimated to be 330  m 3 /h when the design margin of the apparatus was taken into account.|$|R
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle <b>of</b> <b>lean.</b>|$|E

We aimed to compare definitions for clinically relevant weakness and low lean mass proposed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Sarcopenia project with the definition of sarcopenia proposed by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). Methods. A total of 1566 {{men and women from}} a British birth cohort had measures <b>of</b> appendicular <b>lean</b> mass, grip strength and timed up, and go speed at ages 60 – 64.

Results. The combined prevalence <b>of</b> low <b>lean</b> mass and weakness ranged from 1. 1 % in men using FNIH criteria to 6. 4 % in women using EWGSOP criteria.
