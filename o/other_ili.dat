The spill resulted in a consent agreement between Alyeska and PHMSA requiring Alyeska to remove all liquid-transport piping from its system {{that could not be}} assessed using ILI tools or a similar suitable inspection technique. Because <b>other</b> <b>ILI</b> tools could not navigate the pipeline geometry common to each of the eleven pump stations along the pipeline, Alyeska received approval to use a tethered robotic ILI crawler manufactured by Diakont to complete an inspection project at Pump Station 3. This tool allowed Alyeska to only remove a few small aboveground fittings to permit crawler entry into the piping, saving the time and expense necessary to excavate hundreds of feet of pipe (some of which was also encased in concrete vaults) to inspect by hand.|$|E

40|$|Southeast Asia is a {{potential}} locus {{for the emergence of}} novel influenza strains. However, information on influenza within the region is limited. This {{study was to determine the}} proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) caused by influenza A and B viruses in a university cohort in Singapore, identify important distinctive clinical features of influenza infection and potential factors associated with influenza infection compared with <b>other</b> causes of <b>ILI.</b> A surveillance study was conducted from 2007 to 2009, at the University Health and Wellness Centre, National University of Singapore (NUS). Basic demographic information and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from consenting students and staff with ILI, with Influenza A and B identified by both culture and molecular methods. Proportions of influenza A and B virus infections in subjects with ILI were 153 / 500 (30. 6 %) and 11 / 500 (2. 2 %) respectively. The predominant subtype was A/H 1 N 1, including both the seasonal strain (20 / 153) and the pandemic strain (72 / 153). The clinical symptom of fever was more common in subjects with laboratory confirmed influenza than <b>other</b> <b>ILIs.</b> On-campus hostel residence and being a student (compared with staff) were associated with increased risk of laboratory confirmed influenza A/H 1 N 1 2009 infection. This study provides a baseline prevalence of influenza infection within young adults in Singapore in a university setting. Potential risk factors, such as hostel residence, were identified, allowing for more targeted infection control measures in the event of a future influenza pandemic...|$|R
40|$|Communicated by Abba Gumel) Abstract. During flu season, {{respiratory}} infections {{can cause}} non-specific influenza-like-illnesses (ILIs) {{in up to}} one-half of the general population. If a future SARS outbreak were to coincide with flu season, it would become excep-tionally difficult to distinguish SARS rapidly and accurately from <b>other</b> <b>ILIs,</b> given the non-specific clinical presentation of SARS and the current lack of a widely available, rapid, diagnostic test. We construct a deterministic compart-mental model to examine {{the potential impact of}} preemptive mass influenza vaccination on SARS containment during a hypothetical SARS outbreak coin-ciding with a peak flu season. Our model was developed based upon the events of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto, Canada. The relationship of different vaccination rates for influenza and the corresponding required quarantine rates for individuals who are exposed to SARS was analyzed and simulated under different assumptions. The study revealed that a campaign of mass influenza vaccination prior to the onset of flu season could aid the containment of a future SARS outbreak by decreasing the total number of persons with ILIs presenting to the health-care system, and consequently decreasing nosocomial transmission of SARS in persons under investigation for the disease...|$|R

40|$|Background: Acute {{respiratory}} infections {{represent a}} serious public health issue worldwide but virological aetiologies of Influenza Like Illnesses (ILIs) remain largely unknown in developing countries. This study represents {{the first attempt}} to characterise viral aetiologies of ILIs in Bolivia. Methods: It was performed in Santa Cruz city from January 2010 to September 2012, based on 564 naso pharyngeal swabs collected in a National Reference Laboratory and real-time PCR techniques, viral cultures and phylogenetic analyses. Results: 50. 2 % of samples were positive {{for at least one}} virus with influenza viruses (Flu A: similar to 15 %; Flu B: similar to 9 %), rhinoviruses (similar to 8 %), coronaviruses (similar to 5 %) and hRSV (similar to 4 %) being the most frequently identified. The pattern of viral infections varied according to age groups. The elucidation rate was the highest (> 60 %) amongst patients under 10 yo and the lowest (= 60 yo. Nearly 3 % of samples showed dual viral infections. Epidemiological peaks were associated with a predominant virus but generally included 30 - 50 % of infections by different viruses. Unexpectedly, the frequency of influenza in the 0 - 4 yo population was very low and a complete hRSV eclipse occurred in 2011. Genetic analyses indicated that distinct evolutionary lineages of Flu A(H 1 N 1) pdm 2009, Flu A/H 3 N 2 and Flu B have co-circulated in Bolivia in the study period, originating from Central and North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Conclusion: Our results emphasise the requirement for a reinforced epidemiological and genetic follow-up of influenza and <b>other</b> <b>ILIs</b> in Bolivia to further inform the preparation of vaccines used in the region, guide vaccination campaigns and improve the medical management of patients...|$|R
40|$|The International Lignin Institute (ILI) {{was created}} in 1991 as a new {{platform}} for promotion of lignin utilisations. For a few years, the activity was based on informal information exchange, such as Newsletters, international conferences (Forums) and Workshops, {{as well as in}} the proceedings of these events. Considerable work has also been carried out in project initiations where ILI acted as a matchmaker. During this time, in various Workshops the positioning of ILI was discussed with <b>ILI</b> members and <b>other</b> participants, in order to identify the needs of the stakeholders in the lignin field. This resulted in the creation of various projects. Among <b>others,</b> <b>ILI</b> succeeded to establish a strong partnership with the Dutch Research Institute ATO-DLO (now A&F), which led to a project proposal for a concerted action project financed by the European Union, that has now become the thematic network EUROLIGNIN. This network collects and organises four types of data: 1. production situation of existing and new lignin types (lignosulphonates, Kraft lignins, sulphur-free lignins from Soda pulping of non wood plants, as well as from steam explosion, hydrolysis for ethanol production, oxygen and organosolv pulping processes), 2. application and market data on existing and new utilisations, identification of critical limiting factors and recommendations on research needs in different selected market sectors (materials, health, biocides, animal feed, crops cultivation), 3. development of analytical norms for key characterisation methods of lignin (protocols, round robins and reference samples), 4. project promotion (setting up of new research projects as recommended by the results of the network) and dissemination of results. Being at mid-term of this network project, it is time to think about the more general context of lignin promotion and about how to multiply the very promising results of Eurolignin in a near future. During the General Assembly of ILI on November 2003 in Copenhagen, these topics were discussed extensively. The ILI management tries now to put in place actions corresponding to the wishes and suggestions made at this meeting: upgrading of the information packages available to members, project promotion and support of their start-up, increasing of the network and establishment of links to other networks in the biomass field, membership promotion (call for new participants...|$|R
40|$|Background: During the 2009 {{influenza}} pandemic period, routine surveillance of influenza-like-illness (ILI) {{was conducted in}} The Netherlands by a network of sentinel general practitioners (GPs). In addition during the pandemic period, four other ILI/influenza surveillance systems existed. For pandemic preparedness, we evaluated {{the performance of the}} sentinel system and the others to assess which of the four could be useful additions in the future. We also assessed whether performance of the five systems was influenced by media reports during the pandemic period. Methods: The trends in ILI consultation rates reported by sentinel GPs from 20 April 2009 through 3 January 2010 were compared with trends in data from the <b>other</b> systems: <b>ILI</b> cases self-reported through the web-based Great Influenza Survey (GIS); influenza-related web searches through Google Flu Trends (GFT); patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza, and detections of influenza virus by laboratories. In addition, correlations were determined between ILI consultation rates of the sentinel GPs and data from the four other systems. We also compared the trends of the five surveillance systems with trends in pandemic-related newspaper and television coverage and determined correlation coefficients with and without time lags. Results: The four other systems showed similar trends and had strong correlations with the ILI consultation rates reported by sentinel GPs. The number of influenza virus detections was the only system to register a summer peak. Increases in the number of newspaper articles and television broadcasts did not precede increases in activity among the five surveillance systems. Conclusions: The sentinel general practice network should remain the basis of influenza surveillance, as it integrates epidemiological and virological information and was able to maintain stability and continuity under pandemic pressure. Hospital and virological data are important during a pandemic, tracking the severity, molecular and phenotypic characterization of the viruses and confirming whether ILI incidence is truly related to influenza virus infections. GIS showed that web-based, self-reported ILI can be a useful addition, especially if virological self-sampling is added and an epidemic threshold could be determined. GFT showed negligible added value. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Influenza-like illness (ILI) {{definitions}} {{have been}} used worldwide for influenza surveillance. These different case definitions can vary with regard to sensitivity and predictive values for laboratory confirmed influenza. the literature has indicated the inclusion of other viruses may {{be the cause of}} these variable results. the objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate ILI national sentinel criteria and viral etiologies in adults diagnosed with acute respiratory infection ARI) and/or ILI from 2001 to 2003 in São Paulo, Brazil. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were observed from 420 adults and collected on a daily basis from outpatient care units at University Hospital. the ILI definition included: fever plus at least one respiratory symptom (cough and/or sore throat) and one constitutional symptom (headache, malaise, myalgia, sweat or chills, or fatigue). DFA and RT-PCR for influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were performed on nasal washes and 61. 8 % resulted positive. the respiratory viruses detected most often were influenza and rhinovirus. ILI was reported for 240 / 420 patients (57. 1 %), with influenza and rhinovirus etiologies accounting for 30. 9 % and 19. 6 %, respectively. Rhinovirus peak activity was concurrent with the influenza season. These findings highlight the implications of <b>other</b> viruses in <b>ILI</b> etiology and suggest that during the influenza season, this clinical overlap must be considered in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate predictive utility of online social media and web search queries, particularly, Google search data, to forecast new cases of influenza-like-illness (ILI) in general outpatient clinics (GOPC) in Hong Kong. To mitigate the impact of sensitivity to self-excitement (i. e., fickle media interest) and other artifacts of online social media data, in our approach we fuse multiple offline and online data sources. Four individual models: generalized linear model (GLM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and deep learning (DL) with Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) are employed to forecast ILI-GOPC both one week and two weeks in advance. The covariates include Google search queries, meteorological data, and previously recorded offline ILI. To our knowledge, this is the first study that introduces deep learning methodology into surveillance of infectious diseases and investigates its predictive utility. Furthermore, to exploit the strength from each individual forecasting models, we use statistical model fusion, using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which allows a systematic integration of multiple forecast scenarios. For each model, an adaptive approach is used to capture the recent relationship between ILI and covariates. DL with FNN appears to deliver the most competitive predictive performance among the four considered individual models. Combing all four models in a comprehensive BMA framework allows to further improve such predictive evaluation metrics as root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute predictive error (MAPE). Nevertheless, DL with FNN remains the preferred method for predicting locations of influenza peaks. The proposed approach can be viewed a feasible alternative to forecast ILI in Hong Kong or <b>other</b> countries where <b>ILI</b> has no constant seasonal trend and influenza data resources are limited. The proposed methodology is easily tractable and computationally efficient...|$|R
