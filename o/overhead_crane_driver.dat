40|$|Abstract: This paper {{pertains}} to advanced automation {{of the load}} transfer process using <b>overhead</b> <b>cranes.</b> <b>Overhead</b> <b>cranes</b> are widely used in various areas of industry, including manufacturing, construction, shipping, etc. Load transfer operations using <b>overhead</b> <b>cranes</b> {{have to be performed}} fast and safely. As such, these operations are handled by expert operators � however, the demand for an automatic consistent and reliable crane operation is on the rise. The crane–load system is highly nonlinear and time-varying, hence, solutions considering model-base approaches may lead to a complicated controller structure. Such a controller may require accurate estimation of the crane system parameters. In this paper we present a new fuzzy logic controller for <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> operation. The fuzzy controller is designed based on knowledge of an expert crane operator, and does not require any parameter estimation. It mimics the operator behavior by using the same crane–load system states that are realized by the operator. These states are the trolley position error and the load sway angle. The fuzzy controller action, on the other hand, is the desired trolley speed. The proposed controller is implemented and tested on a small-scale <b>overhead</b> <b>crane.</b> Experimental results sho...|$|R
