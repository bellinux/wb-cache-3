2500|$|Mountain bike {{disc brakes}} may range from simple, {{mechanical}} (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on downhill racing bikes.

Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its anti-rust properties. Discs are thin, often about 2mm.

5000|$|Power - Brakes {{are often}} {{described}} as [...] "powerful" [...] when a small human application force leads to a braking force that is higher than typical for <b>other</b> <b>brakes</b> in the same class.

50|$|Drum brakes, {{like most}} <b>other</b> <b>brakes,</b> convert kinetic energy into heat by friction. This heat should {{dissipate}} {{into the surrounding}} air, but can just as easily transfer to other braking system components. Brake drums must be large {{to cope with the}} massive forces involved, and must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat. Heat transfer to air can be aided by incorporating cooling fins onto the drum. However, excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking, which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{the term}} bhp fell into disuse in 1971-1972, as {{automakers}} began to quote power {{in terms of}} SAE net horsepower in accord with SAE standard J1349.

However, the SAE net power testing protocol calls for standard production-type belt-driven accessories, air cleaner, emission controls, exhaust system, and other power-consuming accessories. This produces ratings in closer alignment with the power produced by the engine as it is actually configured and sold.|$|R
50|$|Brake pads are a {{component}} of disc brakes used in automotive and <b>other</b> applications. <b>Brake</b> pads are steel backing plates with friction material bound to the surface that faces the disc brake rotor.|$|R
25|$|When {{braking force}} is applied, {{the act of}} {{abrasive}} friction between the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and <b>other</b> <b>braking</b> system components consists mostly of disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened brake disc wear and brake pad wear.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{resistance}} models control {{resistance by}} means of electromagnets that engage a mechanical brake with the flywheel. The magnetic braking system is quieter than the <b>other</b> <b>braked</b> flywheel types. The braking resistance is adjustable and energy can be accurately measured on this type of rower. The drawback {{of this type of}} resistance mechanism is that the resistance is constant; rowers using air or water resistance more accurately simulate actual rowing, where the resistance increases the harder the handle is pulled. Since they use electromagnets to build up the resistance, they really do not offer the intensity of resistance that one needs for an effective workout.|$|R

40|$|At present time, {{the brake}} test bench conducts the braking and {{suspension}} tests of front or rear axles {{and the test}} results are evaluated through one axle. The purpose of the brake testing system is to determine braking force and damping coefficient dissymmetry of one axle. Thus, this test system evaluates the performance of service brake, hand brake and suspension systems by considering separately front and rear axle dissymmetry. For this reason, the effects of different braking and damping forces applied by right and left wheels of both axles on braking performance of all vehicle are not determined due to available algorithm of the test bench. Also, the <b>other</b> <b>brake</b> failures are not occurred due to the algorithm of brake test system. In this study, the interface has been developed to determine the other effects of dissymmetry and the <b>other</b> <b>brake</b> failures by using the one axle results of brake test bench.

Also, it gives the warnings by comparing changes in the parameters with braking performance rules. Braking and suspension tests of three different vehicles have been conducted by using brake test bench to determine {{the performance of the}} algorithm. Parameters based on the axle interaction have been calculated by transferring brake test results to the interface and the test results have been evaluated.

40|$|Abstract: EMB is {{considered}} {{as the next}} generation braking mechanism because it has simple structure and is environment friendly. However, as <b>other</b> <b>brake</b> mechanisms, EMB should be operated reliably for any operating conditions. EMB should be designed with fail-safe and fault-tolerant control concepts which require robust fault detection algorithms for various possible faults. In the design of fault detection algorithms, {{it is very difficult}} to construct faulty conditions in real EMB and thus, simulations are often used to emulate the faulty conditions. In this paper, a simulation tool is developed using the commercial software to emulate gear faults in the EMB mechanism.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{effectiveness}} of closed-loop brake control to reduce vehicle off-tracking arising from overspeeding in curves. When a driver enters a curve too fast given the available friction, {{the aim is to}} use electronic brake control to reduce speed and increase path curvature to complete the turn. Previously it has been found that coordinated four wheel braking referenced to an inertially fixed vehicle mass center acceleration (PPR) is an optimal control strategy. The present work introduces the effect of driver-vehicle interaction, using simulation and track experiments. It is confirmed that PPR effectiveness is not disrupted by typical steering corrections from the driver. PPR is found to offer significant path following improvements compared with <b>other</b> <b>brake</b> control strategies...|$|R
50|$|Most brakes {{commonly}} use {{friction between}} two surfaces pressed together {{to convert the}} kinetic energy of the moving object into heat, though other methods of energy conversion may be employed. For example, regenerative braking converts much of the energy to electrical energy, which may be stored for later use. Other methods convert kinetic energy into potential energy in such stored forms as pressurized air or pressurized oil. Eddy current brakes use magnetic fields to convert kinetic energy into electric current in the brake disc, fin, or rail, which is converted into heat. Still <b>other</b> <b>braking</b> methods even transform kinetic energy into different forms, for example by transferring the energy to a rotating flywheel.|$|R

40|$|Abridged) The main {{sequence}} star beta Pictoris hosts the best studied circumstellar disk to date. Nonetheless, a long-standing puzzle {{has been around}} since the detection of metallic gas in the disk: radiation pressure from the star should blow the gas away, yet the observed motion is consistent with Keplerian rotation. In this work we search for braking mechanisms that can resolve this discrepancy. We find that all species affected by radiation force are heavily ionized and dynamically coupled into a single fluid by Coulomb collisions, reducing the radiation force on species feeling the strongest acceleration. For a gas of solar composition, the resulting total radiation force still exceeds gravity, while a gas of enhanced carbon abundance could be self-braking. We also explore two <b>other</b> <b>braking</b> agents: collisions with dust grains and neutral gas. Grains surrounding beta Pic are photoelectrically charged to a positive electrostatic potential.

A combined brake system can be created to enhance safety and comfort by establishing a hydraulic connection between the front brake control and the rear caliper or vice versa. The Motorcycle Integral Brake System MIB, which was introduced to the market in 2006, provides motorcycle manufacturers with the possibility to realize any combined integral functionality characteristic. In addition, the pressure in each brake circuit can be built up actively independently of any rider input, so that the system reacts appropriately in any riding situation.
