50|$|The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 placed strict {{limits on}} the tonnages of battleships and battlecruisers for the major naval powers after World War I, as well as not only a limit on the total tonnage for carriers, but also an upper limit of 27000 tons for each ship. Although {{exceptions}} were made regarding the maximum ship tonnage (fleet units counted, experimental units did not), the total tonnage could not be exceeded. However, while {{all of the major}} navies were <b>over-tonnage</b> on battleships, they were all considerably under-tonnage on aircraft carriers. Consequently, many battleships and battlecruisers under construction (or in service) were converted into aircraft carriers.|$|R
