These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts <b>of</b> <b>Appeals,</b> and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts <b>of</b> <b>Appeals,</b> he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> were made in his second.|$|E

Because {{of the rules}} of the federal judiciary, Combs had to liquidate his business and banking assets and severely restrict contact with many of his political acquaintances to avoid potential conflicts of interest with cases he might adjudicate on the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals.</b> He expressed frustration that the cases that came before the court were frequently appealed to the Supreme Court, which often gave little weight to the opinions rendered by the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals.</b> Consequently, he resigned from the court on June 5, 1970, and joined the Louisville law firm of Tarrant, Combs, and Bullitt (later Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs).|$|E
50|$|Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> in Ordinary {{were joined}} by a number <b>of</b> Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal.</b> The Lords <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> were {{individuals}} who are already members of the House of Lords under other Acts (including the Life Peerages Act 1958 and the House of Lords Act 1999) who held or had held high judicial office. High judicial officers included judges of the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>of</b> England and Wales, the Inner House of the Court of Session and the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> in Northern Ireland.

5|$|The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the claim for trespass, {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession. The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent. Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} appealed and {{heard by the}} Second Circuit Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> in Manhattan on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second Circuit Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case.

Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> also confirmed this decision.

5|$|After Governor Adair's term {{expired in}} 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General Joseph Desha.

Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals,</b> Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court of last resort; this period {{was referred to as}} the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
