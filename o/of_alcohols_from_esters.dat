40|$|The {{variety of}} {{chemical}} substances present in modern building products, household products and furnishings provides potential for chemical reactions {{in the material}} (case 1), on the material surface (case 2) and in the gas phase (case 3). Such "indoor chemistry" is {{known as one of}} the main reasons for primary and secondary emissions. The conditions of production often cause unwanted side reactions and a number of new compounds can be found in finished products. Elevated temperatures are responsible for the degradation of cellulose, decomposition of non-heat-resistant additives and other thermally induced reactions like Diels-Alder synthesis. Heterogeneous chemistry takes place on the surface of materials. Well-known examples are the formation of aliphatic aldehydes from the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids or the cleavage of photoinitiators under the influence of light. In case of composite flooring structures hydrolysis is one of the major pathways for the appearance <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> <b>from</b> <b>esters.</b> If different kinds of material are fixed together, emissions of new VOCs formed by inter-species reactions are possible. Other indoor air pollutants are formed by rearrangement of cleavage products or by metabolism. Compounds with -C=C- bonds like terpenes, styrene, 4 -phenylcyclohexene, etc. undergo gas phase reactions with O 3, NO x, OH and other reactive gases. It has been shown that such products derived from indoor-related reactions may have a negative impact on indoor air quality due to their low odor threshold or health-related properties. Therefore, the understanding of primary and secondary emissions and the chemical processes behind is essential for the evaluation of indoor air quality. This publication gives an overview on the current state of research and new findings regarding primary and secondary emissions from building products and furnishings...|$|E
40|$|Flash vacuum pyrolyses or pulsed {{pyrolysis}} of azole esters 1 b and 20 {{and their}} carboxylic acids la and 19 or acid chloride 1 c give five-membered ring ketenes (azafulvenones) 2 and 24 which dimerize to diketopiperazines 3 and 21 but also undergo efficient rearrangement to (cyanovinyl) - and (o-cyanophenyl) ketene (6 and 27). The same products are obtained by elimination <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>from</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> these (cyanovinyl) ketenes. Both types of ketenes are observed directly by IR spectroscopy and are trapped by alcohols {{to give the}} corresponding azole esters or (cyanovinyl) acetates. 1 -Carbonyl- 1 H-isoindole (34) is a highly reactive ketene, dimerizing at 50 K. All ketene IR spectra are in good accord with ab initio calculations. The mechanism of this apparent retro-Wolff rearrangement is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Apparent Km and Vmax {{values were}} {{obtained}} for hydrolysis of methyl and ethyl chlorophyllides a, methyl and ethyl pheophorbide a, and 9 -hydroxymethyl pheophorbide a by chlorophyllase from Ailanthus altissima. Analysis of substrate specificity data for chlorophyllase indicates {{that the presence of}} a 9 -keto group and a methyl alcohol group esterified at the 7 -position in chlorophyll derivatives results in maximum binding affinity for substrates. Data on maximum reaction rates indicate that the rate-controlling step of hydrolysis occurs after release <b>of</b> the <b>alcohol</b> <b>from</b> the <b>ester.</b> Probable high affinity chlorophyllase inhibitors can be predicted {{on the basis of these}} specificity studies...|$|R
40|$|Extending {{longevity}} of temporary soft liners {{is an important}} concern for prosthodontists. One method {{was reported in the}} literature by which a syrup-like mixture of heat-curing PMMA powder and self-curing MMA liquid named “mono-poly” is coated on soft-liners surfaces. It was claimed that their longevity could thus be extended considerably. This study attempted to verify those claims by monitoring the leaching <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> and <b>esters</b> <b>from</b> the coated soft liners and comparing those to uncoated samples. The results revealed that “mono-poly” application might delay the leaching out of <b>esters</b> <b>from</b> temporary soft liners but only for a few days. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Total {{synthesis}} of naturally occurring products {{has been the}} most fecund field for developing new methodologies in Organic Chemistry. Interest in {{synthesis of}} chlorins has lead into investigation of new methodologies towards these natural products, including studies directed to total synthesis of chlorophyll a. With this objective we have developed a flexible synthetic concept for the synthesis of chlorins, which is based on the connection of four heterocyclic rings, leading to chlorin macrotetracycles. This work focused on the synthesis of new ring D building blocks <b>from</b> Hagemann's <b>ester,</b> which is an ease accessible starting material. Constitutional and sterochemical requirements have imposed the application of regio- and enantioselective protocols for obtaining appropriate intermediates to be transformed into the desired ring D units. The scope of enantioselective reductions of ketones as well as kinetic enzymatic resolution <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> derived <b>from</b> Hagemann's <b>ester</b> type was explored...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} {{increasingly}} accepting {{the fact that}} conventional sources of fuel and energy are being rapidly depleted and cannot be renewed. One possible alternative to fossil fuel is biodiesel, biodiesel defined as “a substitute for, or an additive to Diesel fuel that {{is derived from the}} oils and fats of plants and animals”. The main advantages of using this alternative fuel are its renewability, better quality of exhaust gas emissions and its biodegradability. Renewable resources as the raw material for production of biodiesel can be categorized into vegetable oils, animal fat and algae and there are at least four ways in which oils and fats can be converted into biodiesel which are direct use and blending, micro-emulsion, pyrolysis (thermal cracking) and transesterification. Transesterification or alcoholysis is the displacement <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>from</b> an <b>ester</b> by another, the presence of a catalyst accelerates the conversion. In this project, the RBD palm oil was used as raw material to produce biodiesel via single step transesterification process in the presence of NaOH as homogeneous alkali catalyst and ultrasonic irradiation. This process was studied in order to find the optimal conditions of the process, the experiment plan was involved three independent variables which are catalyst concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time. The first parameter studied was the catalyst concentrations, the optimal could be achieved at catalyst concentration at 0. 5 wt%. The second parameter was the reaction temperature, the optimal temperature is 40 °C. The last parameter studied was the reaction time and the result showed that the reaction time at 20 minutes was the best optimal value. Overall, after conducting three different set of experiments, it can be concluded that the best condition for biodiesel production are 71. 5 % methyl ester with 74. 01 % product yield and 0. 02 % moisture contents...|$|R

40|$|Spillage of {{volatile}} chemicals such as organic solvents into {{aquatic environment}} via various industrial activities {{has been a}} growing major worldwide concern. These volatile chemicals may spread into the atmosphere via evaporation and diffusion. Evaporation is a process where a substance in liquid phase is converted into the vapor phase. Reversed– flow gas chromatography (RF-GC) technique {{which is one of}} the perturbation gas chromatography techniques was used to determine the rate coefficient for evaporation and diffusion coefficients (D) <b>of</b> selected <b>alcohols.</b> The main objectives of this study are to determine the effect of water on the evaporation <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> <b>from</b> water-alcohol mixture, to study the influence of temperature, concentration <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> and carbon number on the evaporation <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> <b>from</b> water-alcohol mixture, and to study the effect of surfactant concentration and the types of surfactant (nonionic, cationic and anionic surfactant) on the evaporation <b>of</b> selected <b>alcohols.</b> With the presence of water, the KG values of methanol and ethanol were largely reduced and it was due to the formation of hydrogen bond between water and alcohol molecules. As most of the evaporation process, the rate of evaporation <b>of</b> selected <b>alcohols</b> <b>from</b> alcohol-water mixtures was also found to increase with temperature.
