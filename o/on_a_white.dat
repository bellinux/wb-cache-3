5|$|In {{addition}} to the flags used by the military, several other flag designs were inspired by the national flag. The former Japan Post flag consisted of the Hinomaru with a red horizontal bar placed {{in the center of}} the flag. There was also a thin white ring around the red sun. It was later replaced by a flag that consisted of the 〒 postal mark in red <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> background.|$|E

5|$|In the 1900s Barney held early {{gatherings of}} the salon {{at her house}} in Neuilly. The {{entertainment}} included poetry readings and theatricals (in which Colette sometimes performed). Mata Hari performed a dance once, riding into the garden as Lady Godiva <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> horse harnessed with turquoise cloisonné.|$|E
5|$|Saint Michael the Archangel appears {{often in}} heraldic settings. In one case, the device from the shield of the Trinity {{is placed on}} a blue field and {{attributed}} to St. Michael (Dennys, 95). More usually, he is shown in armour with a red cross <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> shield, slaying the devil depicted as a dragon. These attributed arms were later transferred to Saint George (Dennys, 109).|$|E
5|$|Several special {{editions of}} The Black Parade were released. One bears white text {{on a black}} background, and the second has black text <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> background. A third version has the normal booklet reversed, showing {{the picture of the}} parade drawn and painted by comic artist James Jean. Inside the booklet there are also lyrics, a photo of the band, and {{characters}} from the album.|$|E

5|$|The three vinyl LPs and booklet were housed {{inside a}} deep orange-coloured box. The 1991 CD release placed the cover photo <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> background, however, replicating {{the front of}} the {{original}} album booklet. As commentators noted in 1991, the necessary downsizing to CD dimensions meant that much of the effectiveness of the booklet photography was lost, not least because the contents had also been trimmed down to just 36 pages.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1960s, a badge {{was worn}} {{on the playing}} shirt only for {{high-profile}} matches such as FA Cup finals, usually {{in the form of}} a monogram of the club's initials in red <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> background.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities {{can also}} adopt flags of their own. The designs {{of the city}} flags {{are similar to the}} prefectural flags: a mon on a monocolored background. An example is the flag of Amakusa in Kumamoto Prefecture: the city symbol is {{composed}} of the Katakana character ア (a) and surrounded by waves. This symbol is centered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> flag, with a ratio of 2:3. Both the city emblem and the flag were adopted in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} the album with producers Michael Angelo, Focus..., and Jake and the Phatman, among others. He {{also worked with}} singer-songwriter Joi, former Tony! Toni! Toné! member D'wayne Wiggins, singer-songwriter Teedra Moses, singer Dawn Robinson, formerly of Saadiq's other group Lucy Pearl, singer-songwriter Babyface, and rapper Allie Baba, Saadiq's nephew. The album's title is a reference to his mother's nickname for him, also a childhood name. Its cover artwork {{was inspired by the}} blaxploitation films of the 1970s. It shows Saadiq dressed in a vintage cornflower blue suit, knicker pants, and lime green argyle socks, while leaning <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> 1967 Mercury Cougar.|$|E
5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and sits <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E
5|$|The Flag of Hong Kong between 1959 and 1997 was a Blue Ensign {{with the}} {{coat of arms}} of Hong Kong <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> disk. In Hong Kong, it is also nicknamed the Hong Kong flag (Chinese: 香港旗) or the Dragon and Lion flag (Chinese: 龍獅旗). In 1959, {{following}} {{a grant from the}} College of Arms and with the consent of Queen Elizabeth II, it was adopted as the flag of British Hong Kong. While the flag lost its official status following 1 July 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, it resurfaced in the 2010s as a symbol of protest against Chinese intervention in Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|When Rovers were {{admitted}} to The Football League in 1920 they wore white shirts with blue shorts. These remained the team colours until 1930, when the colours were reversed to blue shirts and white shorts for one season. The {{blue and white}} quarters were first worn in 1931, when they were introduced {{to try to make}} the players look larger and more intimidating. Rovers continued to wear the quarters for 31 years until they were replaced by blue pinstripes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> background.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Newfoundland and Labrador, each {{province}} and territory bears {{at least some}} elements from its coat of arms upon its flag. The flags of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island are banners of the provincial arms, while Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon each have the shield of the local coat of arms on their flags, with other design elements. The flag of Nunavut uses some elements from its coat of arms along with other symbols and colours. The shield of the arms of each province, on a blue background and circled with ten gold maple leaves, the whole surmounted by a crown, forms the main element of {{the flag of the}} Lieutenant-Governor of that province. The exceptions are Nova Scotia, which uses the Union Flag defaced with the shield of Nova Scotia, surrounded by green maple leaves, and Quebec, which uses the shield <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> circle with the provincial motto inscribed below.|$|E
50|$|The {{regional}} flag is a blue field, in {{the bottom}} of which stands a golden strip highlighting six peaks, which are covered <b>on</b> top by <b>a</b> <b>white</b> border. <b>On</b> top of these, and in front of blue background, is placed the Southern Cross <b>on</b> <b>a</b> slant and <b>white</b> stars.|$|R

5|$|St George's can admit up to 380 pupils annually. Upon admission, pupils are {{allocated}} a mixed ability form, {{where they}} are registered, taught Life Skills and have access to pastoral support from their tutors. For all the other lessons, the pupils are set by ability. Each year group has a progress manager with responsibility for the students in that year. Since the Education Act 2002, years 7, 8 and 9 have been grouped into Key Stage 3 and years 10 and 11 into Key Stage 4, which co-ordinates how the National Curriculum is taught. At St George's, a manager is assigned to each Key Stage for pastoral support. Before the conversion to Academy status, the school uniform consisted of a navy-blue blazer with the school emblem sewn <b>on,</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> shirt, navy-blue tie and dark-grey trousers (girls could wear plain-blue skirts) for all pupils in years 7–10; year 11 pupils could wear a dark-blue jumper, shirt and grey trousers. Since 2010, girls no longer wear ties, and must wear a revere collar blouse. Dark-grey trousers or a pleated dark-grey skirt are available for girls to wear; boys have dark-grey trousers. All pupils wear a blue blazer, but those in Key Stage 3 have bright blue piping on their lapels; shirts are white until Year 11, when thin blue stripes are worn.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Trafford Council {{depicts a}} griffin on a shield flanked by two unicorns. The line {{bisecting}} the shield horizontally symbolises the River Mersey running through Trafford {{from east to west}} and the canals in the borough. The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. The fist holding bolts of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham's engineering industry. The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features {{a cross between a}} sword and a violin <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had a cross between a violin and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E
