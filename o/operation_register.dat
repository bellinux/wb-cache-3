40|$|Context: Large breast is a {{major problem}} because of {{associated}} symptomatology and aesthetic concerns. Reduction mammoplasty (RM) resolves the symptom {{and at the same time}} improves the aesthetic appearance of the breast, hence improving self-esteem and social integration. Aims: To describe the pattern of RM in a hospital in the developing world and its impact on postgraduate surgical training. Settings and Design: A retrospective review of all the RMs done in the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Enugu (a major plastic surgery training center in Nigeria) over a ten-year period (2001 - 2010), in the developing country of Nigeria. Subjects and Methods: All RMs done in the hospital were reviewed after retrieving their records from <b>operation</b> <b>register</b> and medical records department. Fifteen (15) cases were retrieved and analyzed. Data Analysis: Data was analyzed with Microsoft excel 2007. Results: Average age of female patients who had RM was 26. 5 years and 83. 3 % were single. The most common complaint was abnormally large breast (macromastia). Inferior pedicle technique was commonly used. Conclusions: The results of RM are remarkable as it impact positively on the quality of life of the patients. However, the level of awareness about the availability of this service is still low in the region as shown by few cases done over the period of review and this impacts negatively on the training. The need for public awareness cannot be overemphasized...|$|E
40|$|Background/aims To {{investigate}} {{the incidence of}} Nd:YAG-laser treatment for posterior capsular opacification (PCO) {{over a period of}} 5 years from phacoemulsification in an unselected population, comparing outcomes for three acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs). Methods Retrospective longitudinal cohort study comprising 900 eyes. Three subgroups of 300 eyes, receiving the AR 40, AR 40 e (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, California), or BL 27 (Bausch andamp; Lomb, Rochester, New York) IOL respectively, were compared. Data on patient age, gender, IOL type, dates of cataract surgery, Nd:YAG-laser treatment and/or death, and visual acuities before/after cataract surgery/Nd:YAG-laser treatment were collected from five sources: cataract <b>operation</b> <b>register,</b> patient administration system, quality control system for cataract operations, Nd:YAG-laser treatment register and clinical patient records. Results 216 eyes (24 %) received Nd:YAG-laser treatment over a 5 -year period. Statistically significant differences (pandlt; 0. 001, chi(2) test) were found between treatment rates for the three IOLs: AR 40 73 eyes (24 %), BL 27 91 eyes (30 %) and AR 40 e 52 eyes (17 %). Eyes of patients who died during the follow-up period had fewer treatments (23 / 266, 8. 6 %) than eyes of patients living (193 / 634, 30 %) {{at the end of the}} follow-up period. Conclusion In comparison with a hydrophobic acrylic IOL with sharp posterior optic edge, a hydrophilic acrylic IOL was associated with almost twice the number of Nd:YAG-laser treatments over the 5 -year period. The results are useful for discussing the economic long-term consequences of choosing an IOL with a design that makes PCO development more or less likely. Caution is advised when applying data from post-mortem PCO studies on living populations...|$|E
40|$|Background/Purpose : The {{excision}} of sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) {{may be associated}} with significant long-term morbidity for the child. We reviewed our experience with SCT in a tertiary health care facility in a developing country with particular interest on the long-term sequelae. Methods : Between January 1990 and May 2008 inclusive, 38 consecutive children with the diagnosis of SCT were identified from the <b>operation</b> <b>register</b> and the Cancer Registry of the Jos University Teaching Hospital. Their clinical presentation, investigation, operative findings, histology report, and outcome were recorded and analyzed. The long-term follow-up of some of the patients were also recorded and analyzed. Results : There were 31 females and 7 males. Twenty-three patients presented during the neonatal period with a median age at presentation of 7 days (range 1 - 18 days) and a median weight at presentation of 2. 8 kg (range 2. 0 - 3. 6 kg), 10 presented between 1 month and 12 months, while 5 were older than 1 year at presentation. Most of the patients had significantly external tumors. Excision of the tumor was mainly by the sacral route, four had abdominal-sacral excision. Histology was mainly benign; four were malignant at presentation. Four children with malignant disease had chemotherapy in addition to {{excision of}} the tumor. Eight had immediate post-operative wound-related complications while three children died, two of the deaths were related to anesthesia, while one died of colostomy complications. Twenty-one (60 &#x 0025;) were followed up for a median duration of 6 years (range 1 month- 8 years). Two (9. 5 &#x 0025;) had recurrent disease after primary excision; five (23. 8 &#x 0025;) had some degree of functional impairment at the follow-up. Conclusion : While SCT is usually benign, recurrence, malignant transformations in patients who present late and long-term functional sequelae are problems that must be tackled by the care givers. A multi-center study may be necessary to characterize this disease in developing countries and assess the long-term functional sequelae in survivors...|$|E

40|$|Objective of {{the work}} could be found out primarily, whether the refraktive a {{foldable}} multi-focal lens of the type ARRAY SA 40 N meets the expectations of patients and Ophthalmologen, like eyesight nearby and distance at far-reaching glasses independence. At the same time, it should be checked how far prejudices are justified conditionally {{by the quality of}} earlier multi-focal lens generations such as a dazzling sensitiveness increased post-operatively and perception of visual phenomena. As a comparison group patients were consulted by the type Allergan SI 40 nb to this with Monofokallinsen. The two models are foldable intraocular back chamber lenses of silicone material breaking highly with PMMA-Haptik, a complete diameter of 13 mm and a visual diameter of 6 mm. The multi-focal lenses of the type ARRAY SA 40 N are refraktive silicone multi-focal lenses. They stand out wavy surface of the visual part due to an asphärische. At first the extraction of the patient data was carried out from the <b>operation</b> <b>register</b> of the eye hospital Berlin-Marzahn of the period of 1997 - 2001. The data of the medical files were been in a recording bend and encoded with answers of the questionnaires in a database. In the questionnaire these became post-operative glasses carrying behaviors, light sensations, dazzling sensitiveness as well as includes subjective patient satisfaction. 34 patients got bilateral and 45 patients a multi-focal lens, 56 patients from the consecutively select patients a Monofokallinse unilaterally. The after-control and follow-up treatment was generally carried out with the set up eye specialists. 7. 2 months after the first implantation found a first later check-up of the clinic instead of, a further with 10 patients (17 eyes) after 4. 14 years in connection with the implantation of the art lens at the partner eye on average. The examination on hand shows that the Visus after implantation of the multi-focal lens Array SA 40 N has improved with almost all patients. At the multi-focal lens patients 66. 07 % on the first post-operative day reached an approaching keenness of sight of Nieden 1 and 58. 7 % a keenness of sight of at least 1. 0 in the distance without an additional correction. The implantation of this multi-focal lens led to a good post-operative unkorrigierten Fernvisus comparably with it of Monofokallinsen. Better results were obtained in the local area as expected as the examination points. The patient interview has shown {{that the majority of the}} patients is satisfied with the operation result. Although light sensations which are found disturbing of most patients as little, however, appear post-operatively. The perception of visual phenomena depends on the objective refraction, the Astigma-tismus, the IOL design, the pupil distance and the patient age. The post-operative increase of the dazzling sensitiveness as well as the perception of visual side-effects are negligible for the patient at corresponding clearing up and it therefore turns out that the prejudices are not justified opposite the multi-focal lens of the type ARRAY SA 40 N unlike the multi-focal lenses of earlier generation. The multi-focal intraocular lens used here increases the quality of the visual rehabilitation of the patients after cataract extraction by reducing the necessity of an additional glasses correction. By the use of foldable intraocular lenses and with that small cut technology the post-operative astigmatism is negligible. The advantages of the multi-focal lenses get noticeable for many patients particularly after a bilateral implantation as ours covers examination. The majority of the multi-focal lens straps uses primarily or reading post-operative glasses at longer approaching work. The far zones of ARRAY SA 40 N can be used by reading-glasses for the proximity; what particularly when reading longer than pleasant is found. The majority of the patients has also more than four year after implantation of the multi-focal lens a good Fern and also Nahvisus without correction. They get by largely without glasses, have a good contrast sensitiveness and feel neither increased dazzling nor visual phenomena strongly impaired. Our case idea and also other publications show that the implantation of multi-focal lenses is possible also with younger patients, particularly children. The careful pre-operative patient selection as well as a detailed patient clearing up also on the part of the introducing and giving further treatment eye specialists are imperative for a good result. The patient should know that despite an ideal bio metric objective, a complete renunciation of glasses cannot be always reached. It a certain degree of tolerance of the dazzling phenomena known, appearing post-operatively should also from the patient and halo as well as the contrast perception reduced be found. Extremely critical patients should be warned against multi-focal lenses under circumstances. To be able to obtain a correct visual effect of the lens, a symmetrical Kapselsackfixation is imperative from the surgeon. Moreover, astigmatism as low as possible and post-operative Emmetropie have to be striven which is reached by the use of foldable MIOL and an exact biometrics. The stake of the IOL Masters has proved itself very much. The foldable multi-focal lens ARRAY SA 40 N used by us here has several focal lengths and provides with a sharp eyesight in a different distance by the fluent transition of 5 refraktiven zones. At the time of the assessment it was the only multi-focal lens with FDA admission. Further operative proceedings for the correction of the presbyopia which partly are in the experimental stage still are akkommodierende intraocular lenses, magnetically movable intraocular lenses or the replacement of the cloudy lens by "Lens refilling". The so-called akkommodativen lenses are not, however, an actual alternative to the multi-focal lens due to the too low accommodation breadth at present. The method of the "Lens refilling" is still immature by the inaccurate precomputation of the lens size, the bend radii and the refracting power. The sum of our results and the literature enquiry show that the multi-focal lens used by us is a good alternative to the Monofokallinse under strict consideration of the selection criteria which contributes to the improvement on the quality of life. The newest generation of multi-focal lenses seems to compensate for the known disadvantages by the additional asphärische surface, the amplified approaching part of+ 4. 0 diopters, the dependence on pupildiameter lenweitenunabhängikeit, the sharp optics edge, flashing blue light filter as well as apodisierung in a certain measure...|$|E

The experimental results show that when the LSMAR technique is applied, the number of memory accesses can be reduced by 18. 47 % on average over the benchmarks when it is not applied. The measurements also indicate that the optimizations only lead to an average 1. 41 % increase in code size.
