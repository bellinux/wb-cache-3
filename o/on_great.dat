The Coach and Horses at No.1 and the Marlborough Head at Nos.37–38 were both {{established}} in the 1730s.

5|$|In February 1793, amid rising {{political}} tension, the French Republic {{declared war}} <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain, drawing Britain into the French Revolutionary Wars. At sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Western Approaches and the English Channel all became areas of significant naval activity as French privateers sailed on raiding cruises against British merchant shipping. To augment these attacks, the French naval authorities dispatched squadrons of frigates to attack British trade routes. To counter these operations, the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to sea, sometimes in squadrons and sometimes on single patrols.|$|E
5|$|In {{professional}} wrestling, some wrestlers use {{the soccer}} kick is as a finishing move. A number of professional wrestlers {{prior to the}} 1980s professional wrestling boom were taught to use wrestling moves and strikes legitimately. This {{was due to the}} likelihood of attacks on the wrestlers from fans. This included the soccer kick, which former pro-wrestler, CM Punk stated was the easiest tactic to use when a fan tried to get in the ring to confront a wrestler. High profile users of soccer kicks as a finishing move includes Katsuyori Shibata, and Randy Orton. In Japan within a 1977 puroresu match between Antonio Inoki and Great Antonio, Inoki started to shoot <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Antonio after Great Antonio refused to sell Inoki's offence. Inoki used a takedown <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Antonio and then used soccer kicks and head stomps to legitimately knock out Great Antonio.|$|E

5|$|Little Gidding is {{the fourth}} and final poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets, a series of poems that discuss time, perspective, humanity, and salvation. It was first {{published}} in September 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the air-raids <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain during World War II and Eliot's declining health. The title refers to a small Anglican community in Huntingdonshire, established by Nicholas Ferrar in the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January the French {{ambassador}} {{was expelled}} {{in response to}} the execution of Louis XVI in Paris on 21 January and on 1 February the National Convention declared war <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain. The naval campaign in the Atlantic began in earnest in March 1793, when a French battle squadron briefly put to sea before a mutiny forced it to return. The war between Britain and France begun in the Goulet on 2 January 1793 was to last, with a 14-month break in 1802–1803, until 1815.|$|E
5|$|The Dry Salvages is {{the third}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets and marks the {{beginning}} of when the series was consciously being formed as a set of four poems. It was written and published in 1941 during the air-raids <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain, an event that threatened him while giving lectures in the area. The title comes from the name of a rock formation near a town he spent time at as a child, which reflects Eliot's references to his own past throughout the poem.|$|E

5|$|The {{railways}} {{arrived in}} the 19th century. Early proposals to bring a line to Sleaford failed, but in 1852 plans were made to build the Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway and its Act of Parliament passed in 1853. The line from Grantham opened in 1857; Boston was connected in 1859, Bourne in 1871 and Ruskington <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway in 1882.|$|E

5|$|Artillery {{may have}} been {{installed}} at Gun Hill on the coast near Burnham Overy during the Napoleonic wars, {{but there were no}} modern fortifications in north Norfolk at the start of World War I. Following the German naval attack <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Yarmouth in November 1914, defences such as trenches, concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of the Norfolk coast. The main bases were outside the SSSI boundaries, but Thornham Marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a bombing range. A World War I concrete building on Titchwell's west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942; some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period.|$|E
5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or <b>on</b> <b>great</b> plains.|$|E
5|$|Following the French Republic's {{declaration}} of war <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain in February 1793, the French Navy immediately launched squadrons, individual cruisers and privateers against British trade routes in the Eastern Atlantic. The French Atlantic fleet, based at the fortified port of Brest in Brittany, {{was in a state}} of political turmoil during the early years of the war, suffering a mutiny in August 1793, and then defeat at the battle of Glorious First of June in 1794. In spite of these difficulties, the independent raiders caused considerable damage to British commerce, and in response the Admiralty ordered a squadron of frigates from the Channel Fleet to cruise the French coastline in search of these raiders. This force, known as the flying squadron and initially commanded by Sir John Borlase Warren, achieved a number of successes in the first year of the war, most notably in the Action of 23 April 1794, when a French frigate squadron was destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Four Quartets {{is a set}} of four poems {{written by}} T. S. Eliot that were {{published}} individually over a six-year period. The first poem, Burnt Norton, was written and published with a collection of his early works following the production of Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. After a few years, Eliot composed the other three poems, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and Little Gidding, which were written during World War II and the air-raids <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain. The poems were not collected until Eliot's New York publisher printed them together in 1943. They were first published as a series in Great Britain in 1941 to 1942 towards the end of Eliot's poetic career.|$|E
5|$|In 1796, {{following}} the secret {{terms of the}} Treaty of San Ildefonso, the Kingdom of Spain suddenly reversed {{its position in the}} French Revolutionary Wars turning from an enemy of the French Republic into an ally. The Spanish declaration of war <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain forced the British Mediterranean Fleet to abandon the Mediterranean Sea entirely, retreating to ports at Gibraltar and Lisbon. This force now concentrated against the Spanish Navy, most of which was stationed at the main fleet base of Cádiz in Southern Spain. A British blockade fleet won a significant victory over the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797, dissuading the Spanish fleet from playing {{a significant role in the}} ongoing war.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793 {{the newly}} formed French Republic {{declared}} war <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain, extending the French Revolutionary Wars that had begun the year before on the continent. The French Navy {{was in a state}} of upheaval due to the social consequences of the French Revolution, and as a result found itself at a disadvantage to the Royal Navy, which had been preparing for war since June 1792. In response, the French sent several frigate squadrons to sea, including their newest ships and best sailors and officers in an attempt to disrupt British commerce in the early stages of the war. One such squadron was sent in April 1793 to the United States, carrying the French ambassador to the United States, Edmond-Charles Genêt. After the ambassador disembarked, the squadron, under the command of Captain Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart, dispersed to raid British shipping along the coast, capturing or destroying more than 60 merchant vessels before retiring to American ports for repairs.|$|E

5|$|In February 1793, the National Convention that governed the French Republic {{expanded}} the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars by declaring war <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain and the Dutch Republic. The light vessels of the British Royal Navy had {{been preparing for}} the conflict for several months, having concentrated in June 1792 at Spithead {{in anticipation of the}} outbreak of war. These ships were stationed in large numbers in the North Sea and the English Channel to defend British maritime trade against the threat of French commerce raiders operating from the French Channel ports. The French Navy by contrast was riven with the same social divisions that had divided France {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution four years earlier. This had led to the collapse of the professional officer corps and the elimination of the rank of trained seamen-gunners on the grounds of elitism, resulting in a dearth of experience both in seamanship and naval combat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} after the {{collapse}} of the Romano-British economy, very few substantial buildings were constructed and many villas and towns were abandoned. New long- and round-houses were constructed in some settlements, while in others timber buildings were built imitating the older Roman styles. The Germanic immigrants constructed small rectangular buildings from wood, and occasionally grander halls. However, the conversion to Christianity in the 6th and 7th centuries reintroduced Italian and French masons, and these craftsmen built stone churches, low in height, following a narrow, rectangular plan, plastered inside and fitted with glass and colourful vestments. This Romanesque style developed throughout the period, featuring characteristic circular arches. By the 10th and 11th centuries, much larger churches and monastery buildings were being built, featuring square and circular towers after the contemporary European fashion. The palaces constructed for the nobility centred <b>on</b> <b>great</b> timber halls, while manor houses began to appear in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1793, amid {{mounting}} tensions {{following the}} French Revolution of 1789, the recently formed French Republic, already {{at war with}} the Austrian Empire and Prussia, declared war <b>on</b> <b>Great</b> Britain and the Dutch Republic. This act spread the French Revolutionary Wars beyond Europe to encompass the British, French and Dutch colonies in the Americas and the East Indies. Britain and France were already rivals in the East Indies, having fought campaigns in the Indian Ocean during both the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) and the American War of Independence (1775–1783). More recently British and French naval forces had fought the Battle of Tellicherry in 1791 as part of the Third Anglo-Mysore War, a conflict between the East India Company (EIC), which controlled British mercantile interests in the East Indies, and the French-supported Kingdom of Mysore in Southern India. The battle was a French defeat, but it had little impact on either the war itself, which saw the EIC extract significant concessions from Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, or the worsening political climate in Europe.|$|E
