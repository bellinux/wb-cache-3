50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 36 mm for males 48 mm for females. The forewings are white, with blue-grey markings. The first line is found at one-fourth and {{is marked by}} three blotches, {{and there is a}} large oblique oval pale <b>olive</b> <b>blotch</b> {{at the end of the}} cell, edged outwardly by fuscous brown. The veins within are silvery white and there is an oblique costal blotch above it, and a larger diffuse one beyond it. There is also a silvery white streak on the inner edge of the ocellus, which is continued to the inner margin as an olive double streak. There is a subapical costal blotch and a submarginal blue-grey band of partially connected spots. There is also a marginal row of dark grey blotches. The hindwings have a double basal line and an occeloid blue-grey blotch, containing a white line and silvery veins tipped with black, followed by three hyaline patches. The rest is as the forewings.|$|E
50|$|The oval, porcellaneous {{shell is}} 9-20 mm in size. It is white in color with small yellow or <b>olive</b> <b>blotches</b> {{in a ring}} on the dorsum and on the sides. The {{extremities}} of the shell are hardly produced.|$|R
50|$|This {{species may}} be {{confused}} with Urticina crassicornis. Although they may both have a red column, the tentacles of U. crassicornis normally have transverse bands, and <b>olive</b> green <b>blotches</b> are commonly found on the column.|$|R
50|$|Tautog are {{brown and}} dark <b>olive,</b> with white <b>blotches,</b> and have plump, {{elongated}} bodies. They {{have an average}} weight of 1 to 3 lb and reach a maximum size of 3 ft, 28.8 lb.|$|R
50|$|Common snipe nest in a well-hidden {{location}} on the ground, laying four eggs of a dark <b>olive</b> colour, <b>blotched</b> and spotted with rich brown, which are incubated by the female for 18-21 days. The freshly hatched young are covered in dark maroon down, variegated with black, white and buff. The young are cared for by both parents, each parent looking after half the brood, with fledging in 10-20 days.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{the type}} series {{consisting}} of two adult males (including the holotype) and an adult female, males measure 33.6 - 37.4 mm and females 36.2 mm in snout-vent length. The parotoid gland is subtriangular. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes are webbed. The dorsum is pale to dark lime green with <b>olive</b> brown <b>blotching</b> and pale lime green lateral or dorsolater stripes. There are rusty brick red pustules. The venter is pale blue-green, with dark chocolate brown mottling.|$|R
50|$|Two to four eggs, usually three, {{are laid}} {{on the ground or}} cliff ledges in colonies, and are defended vigorously by this large gull. The eggs are a dark <b>blotched,</b> <b>olive</b> colour. They are {{incubated}} for 28-30 days. Breeding colonies are predated by great black-backed gulls, harriers, corvids, herons and raccoons.|$|R
50|$|The type series {{consists}} of two adult females measuring 51 and 55 mm in snout-vent length (SVL) and 92 and 104 mm in total length. A subadult female measured 34 mm SVL. The snout is truncate in dorsal aspect and rounded in profile. The tail is strongly constricted basally. The limbs are relatively slender and long; the digits are moderately webbed. The upper parts are grayish brown or brownish olive with small, inconspicuous, irregularly shaped buff-yellow spots. The ventral surface is uniformly buff-yellow (holotype) or brownish <b>olive</b> with buff-yellow <b>blotches</b> (paratype).|$|R
