This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under international free-trade agreements, which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions.

5|$|Following {{the release}} <b>of</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>Times,</b> Chaplin left with Goddard {{for a trip}} to the Far East. The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or not.

By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|Historian Matti Moosa {{considered}} Marrash to be {{the first}} truly cosmopolitan Arab intellectual and writer <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>times.</b> Marrash adhered to the principles of the French Revolution and defended them in his own works, implicitly criticizing Ottoman rule in Western Asia and North Africa. He was also influential in introducing French romanticism in the Arab world, especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry, of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature, according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh. His modes of thinking and feeling, and ways of expressing them, have had a lasting influence on contemporary Arab thought and on the Mahjari poets.|$|E

5|$|In Hastings's view, Lang was {{probably}} {{more sympathetic to}} Rome than any other Church of England archbishop <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>times,</b> responsible for a discreet catholicisation of the Church of England's practices. A small outward indication of this was his decision to use a cassock as everyday dress and to wear a mitre on formal occasions, the first archbishop since the English Reformation to do so. Lang believed that {{in relation to the}} supreme truths of the church, rituals and dress were of small account, but that if people's worship was assisted by such customs they should be allowed.|$|E
