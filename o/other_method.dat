Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully {{destroyed}}; {{they have to be}} destroyed as a whole in private, preferably by burning or by any <b>other</b> <b>method</b> consistent with the dignity of the flag.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the British {{botanist}} E. J. H. Corner published The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree. His {{theory was}} that endozoochory (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any <b>other</b> <b>method</b> of seed dispersal, and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (D. dulcis) exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.|$|E
5|$|For {{mourning}} activities, {{the flag}} can be flown {{in either of}} the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-staffing, is performed when the flag is hoisted {{to the top of}} the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The <b>other</b> <b>method</b> is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During a funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Other</b> <b>methods</b> {{of forming}} round metal parts include hydroforming, stamping, forging and casting. These <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> {{generally}} {{have a higher}} fixed cost, but a lower variable cost than metal spinning. As machinery for commercial applications has improved, parts are being spun with thicker materials in excess of 1in (25mm) thick steel. Conventional spinning also wastes a considerably smaller amount of material than <b>other</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|R
50|$|The delitto perfetto {{technique}} is also simpler compared to <b>other</b> <b>methods</b> for in vivo site-directed mutagenesis. <b>Other</b> <b>methods</b> require multiple cloning steps and extensive DNA sequencing to confirm mutagenesis, {{which is often}} a complicated and inefficient process.|$|R
5|$|The {{significance}} of atomic numbers {{to the organization}} of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood. Mendeleev's periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any <b>other</b> <b>method</b> then known. Substitution of atomic numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, and Moseley predicted (in 1913) that the only elements still missing between aluminium (Z=13) and gold (Z=79) were Z = 43, 61, 72 and 75, all of which were later discovered. The sequence of atomic numbers is still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.|$|E
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via lethal injection and the <b>other</b> <b>method</b> of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language. A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E
