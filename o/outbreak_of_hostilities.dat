5|$|Angered by the French surrender, {{and unhappy}} with British {{policies}} that affected them, an Ottawa chief named Pontiac organized 18 Native American tribes that attacked British {{military and civilian}} settlements beginning in April 1763. The tribes captured eight British forts and forced the evacuation of two more. General Amherst ordered the 17th to Albany in June 1763 to assist in combating the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b>|$|E

5|$|On the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> in April 1775, the 64th {{was still}} {{stationed}} at Castle William and remained {{there as the}} garrison throughout the Siege of Boston. Consequently, the regiment did not {{take part in the}} Battle of Bunker Hill. When, in March 1776, the British abandoned Boston, the 64th were the last regiment to depart for Halifax, giving them the distinction of being the last British unit to set foot in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during the war.|$|E
5|$|This set {{operated}} {{for most}} of the inter-war period, being withdrawn in April 1938. It was replaced by a very similar set of coaches at this time, which was withdrawn in September 1939 after the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> for use in troop trains. The carriages were replaced by the former Royal Train, built 1900–04, of the now-defunct South Eastern and Chatham Railway. These ornately decorated carriages were those destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated {{in the wake of}} the June 22, 1807, Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, Scott applied to Governor Christopher Greenup to raise a mounted militia unit in anticipation of an <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b> Although Greenup granted the requested authorization, Scott remarried on July 25, 1807, and never assembled the militia unit. His second wife, Judith Cary (Bell) Gist, was the 57-year-old widow of Colonel Nathaniel Gist, who had been a prisoner of war with Scott during the Revolutionary War. After their marriage, they moved to Canewood, Gist's family's plantation in Bourbon and Clark counties.|$|E

After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and employed as a barracks ship for the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. She was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship-breakers in Audorf-Rendsburg. She was scrapped the following year.|$|E

The depot assembled and tested new aircraft, and ferried them to operational areas such as northern Australia and New Guinea. It was also responsible {{for the maintenance of}} in-service aircraft, including their engines, instruments, and armament. As well as RAAF equipment, No.1 AD repaired battle-damaged US aircraft such as B-17 Flying Fortresses.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} war effort of Greece was {{initially}} turned towards Macedonia, on the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> in October 1912.

On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.|$|E
50|$|The Toxcatl Massacre, {{a turning}} point in the Spanish conquest of Mexico, {{occurred}} when the Spaniards who were tolerated as guests in Tenochtitlan attacked and massacred the unprepared Aztecs during the celebration of Toxcatl.

5|$|Despite Mashbir's dismissal, the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> in World War II between Japan and the US, led to {{him being}} {{immediately}} sought after by the Signal Corps {{due to his}} military experience, wide technical skill {{and knowledge of the}} Japanese language. He was sworn in for active duty on 24 January 1942 and sent to Brisbane, Australia, and later Manila, Philippines to co-ordinate the inter-service joint Australian/American Allied Translator and Interpreter Section (ATIS), within the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). It was at this time that the suspicions which lingered about Mashbir's 1937 mission to Japan on behalf of Naval Intelligence were cleared up with the assistance of Admiral Zacharias, now Assistant Director of Naval Intelligence, interceding with the Assistant Chief of Staff of G2.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin and the {{legislature}} continued to clash throughout {{the remainder of}} 1861 and into 1862. They found agreement only on the most menial of legislation, such as a bill to allow the common schools to continue the sessions that had been interrupted by the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> in 1861. He found particularly onerous a bill forfeiting the citizenship of anyone who fought for or aided the Confederacy, but in March 1862, his veto of the bill was overridden. Magoffin also opposed the military rule of Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle, who he believed was violating {{the civil rights of}} states' rights advocates, even if they did not advocate secession.|$|E
5|$|The {{lessons learned}} during the South African War of 1899-1902 had {{reinforced}} {{the idea that}} the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full-scale war without significant assistance; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities,</b> and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year. There had been no thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an ad-hoc basis, and a new auxiliary arm (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, but it was clear that a more effective system was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E

5|$|Vikrant was redeployed towards Chittagong at the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b> On 4 December, the ship's Sea Hawks struck {{shipping}} in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar harbours, sinking or incapacitating most of {{the ships}} present. Later strikes targeted Khulna and the Port of Mongla, which continued until 10 December, while other operations were flown to support a naval blockade of East Pakistan. On 14 December, the Sea Hawks attacked the cantonment area in Chittagong, destroying several Pakistani army barracks. Medium anti-aircraft fire was encountered during this strike. Simultaneous attacks by Alizés continued on Cox's Bazar. After this, Vikrants fuel levels dropped to less than 25 per cent, and the aircraft carrier sailed to Paradip for refueling. The crew of INS Vikrant earned two Maha Vir Chakras and twelve Vir Chakra gallantry medals for their part in the war.|$|E
5|$|An {{assessment}} of his record as the Byzantine Empire's first minister is difficult. Of the few available sources on his career, the Vita Euthymii, compiled years after Zaoutzes's death, is extremely hostile, seeking to pin {{the responsibility for}} several of the reign's failures or unpopular decisions on him, and thus preserve Leo from blame. The account of the Vita is further colored by the fierce rivalry between Zaoutzes and Euthymios, then a synkellos and Leo's spiritual father, over influence on the Byzantine emperor. Thus the Vita accuses Zaoutzes of being responsible for the sacking of the successful general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder from the army, {{as well as for}} the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> with Bulgaria in 893: allegedly, two of his protégés moved the main market for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessalonica and then proceeded to extract exorbitant fees from the Bulgarian merchants. When Leo, at the behest of Zaoutzes, rejected the merchants' protests, the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I found a pretext to attack Byzantium. It has, however, been recently suggested by the scholar Paul Magdalino that the transfer was in fact Leo's initiative, aiming to enrich Thessalonica, whose patron saint, Saint Demetrius, he showed special favor to.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} in Europe {{rose in the}} aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to Dar es Salaam on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores. He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area. On 27 July, Looff received a message from the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe. Concurrently, the cruisers of the British Cape Squadron, , , and , arrived with the intention of bottling up Königsberg at the colony's capital Dar es Salaam. Looff got his ship ready to sail and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914, with the three slower British ships shadowing him. Looff used a rain squall and his ship's superior speed to break contact with his British pursuers the following day. Königsberg steamed off Aden until 5 August, when word of the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship.|$|E
25|$|Following King John's death Llywelyn {{concluded}} the Treaty of Worcester with his successor Henry III in 1218. This treaty confirmed him {{in possession of}} all his recent conquests. From then until his death Llywelyn was the dominant force in Wales, though there were further <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> with marcher lords, particularly the Marshall family and Hubert de Burgh, and sometimes with the king. Llywelyn built up marriage alliances with several of the Marcher families. One daughter, Gwladus Ddu, ("Gwladus the Dark") was already married to Reginald de Braose of Brecon and Abergavenny, but with Reginald an unreliable ally Llywelyn married another daughter, Marared, to John de Braose of Gower, Reginald's nephew. He found a loyal ally in Ranulph, Earl of Chester, whose nephew and heir, John the Scot, married Llywelyn's daughter Elen in about 1222. Following Reginald de Braose's death in 1228, Llywelyn also made an alliance with the powerful Mortimer family of Wigmore when Gwladus Ddu married as her second husband Ralph de Mortimer.|$|R
