5|$|In early 1974, {{the group}} Americans for Democratic Action rated Mathias {{the most liberal}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> in the Senate based on twenty key votes in the 1973 {{legislative}} session. At 90 percent, his score was higher than most Democrats in the Senate, and was fourth highest amongst all members. Issues considered when rating senators included their positions on civil rights, mass transit, D.C. home rule, tax reform, and reducing overseas troop levels. The League of Women Voters gave Mathias a 100% on issues important to them, and the AFL-CIO agreed with Mathias on 32 out of 45 key labor votes. Conversely, the conservative group Americans for Constitutional Action stated Mathias agreed with their positions only 16% of the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{ascendancy}} of the Republican Party in Georgia {{and in the}} South in general resulted in Georgia U.S. House of Representatives member Newt Gingrich being elected as Speaker of the House following {{the election of a}} Republican majority in the House in 1994.

25|$|In 2012, {{the state}} elected a Republican Governor (Pat McCrory) and Lieutenant Governor (Dan Forest) {{for the first}} time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof {{majorities}} in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate. Several U.S. House of Representatives seats also flipped control, with the Republicans holding nine seats to the Democrats' four. In the 2014 mid-term elections, Republican David Rouzer won the state's Seventh Congressional District seat, increasing the congressional delegation party split to 10-3 in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP.</b>|$|E
25|$|The voter base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> {{has been}} {{changing}} in directions opposite from national trends.

During the 2016 presidential election, the Republicans also gained significant support in the Midwest.

25|$|When {{the furious}} {{election}} activity {{came to an}} end and the voters went to the polls, the result was mixed on the statewide level. Eight years of Democratic rule of the governor's mansion ended with Scranton's lopsided victory over Dilworth, 2.4 million votes to 1.9 million. But voters continued their ticket-splitting habit that began statewide in 1956, by reelecting Clark narrowly over VanZandt, 2.2 million votes to 2.1 million, about 51%. With the state losing three congressional seats due to reapportionment, the Republicans had a net loss of two seats in the election, while the Democrats lost one, but the lineup was still in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP,</b> 14 to 13.|$|E

In speeches during the campaign, Nice promised {{to clean up the}} dirty underworld politics of the Democrats and their political bosses and ensure elections were fair and open to everyone. In this time period ballot stuffing, voter fraud and outright voter intimidation were common place, especially in large cities like Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|Barry Goldwater crusaded {{against the}} Rockefeller Republicans, beating Rockefeller {{narrowly}} in the California primary of 1964 giving the Arizona senator, {{all of the}} California delegates and a majority at the presidential nominating convention. The election was {{a disaster for the}} conservatives, but the Goldwater activists now controlled large swaths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> and they had no intention of retreating. The stage was set for a conservative takeover, based in the South and West, in opposition to the Northeast. Ronald Reagan continued in the same theme. George H. W. Bush was more closely associated with the moderates, but his son George W. Bush was firmly allied with the conservatives.|$|E

25|$|Within a {{month of}} Despot's death, Democratic Governor Charles E. Roemer, III {{switched}} his allegiance to the Republican Party. Roemer's switch did not unite the feuding wings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP.</b> Because he supported abortion, the right-to-life contingent of the party rejected Roemer and coalesced around then U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway of Rapides Parish. But few other Republicans would support Holloway. Holloway did win a preference poll among Republicans attending statewide endorsement caucuses. Also running for governor was the candidate who was anathema to party leaders: State Representative David Duke of Jefferson Parish. When all the smoke had cleared, Duke eliminated Roemer from a general election berth, and Edwin Edwards staged a fourth-term victory over the unpopular Duke.|$|E
25|$|His {{subsequent}} book, {{released in}} summer 2006, is titled Conservatives without Conscience, {{a play on}} Barry Goldwater's book The Conscience of a Conservative. In it, he asserts that post-Goldwater conservatism has been co-opted by people with authoritarian personalities and policies, citing data from Bob Altemeyer. According to Dean, modern conservatism, specifically in the Christian Right, embraces obedience, inequality, intolerance, and strong intrusive government, {{in stark contrast to}} Goldwater's philosophies and policies. Using Altemeyer's scholarly work, he contends that there is a tendency toward ethically questionable political practices when authoritarians are placed in positions of power, and that the current political situation is dangerously unsound because of it. Dean cites the behavior of key members of the Republican leadership, including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Tom DeLay, Newt Gingrich, and Bill Frist, as clear evidence of a relationship between modern right-wing conservatism and this authoritarian approach to governance. He places particular emphasis on the abdication of checks and balances by the Republican Congress, and of the dishonesty of the conservative intellectual class in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP,</b> {{as a result of the}} obedience and arrogance innate to the authoritarian mentality.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt was {{a member}} of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 21st D.) in 1882, 1883 and 1884. He {{immediately}} began making his mark, specifically in corporate corruption issues. He blocked a corrupt effort by financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes. Roosevelt exposed suspected collusion in the matter by Judge Theodore Westbrook, and argued for and received approval for an investigation to proceed, aiming for the impeachment of the judge. The investigation committee rejected impeachment, but Roosevelt had exposed the potential corruption in Albany, and thus assumed a high and positive political profile in multiple New York publications. Roosevelt's anti-corruption efforts helped him win re-election in 1882 by a margin greater than two-to-one, an achievement made even more impressive by the fact that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Grover Cleveland won Roosevelt's district. With Conkling's Stalwart faction of the Republican Party in disarray following the assassination of President James Garfield, Roosevelt won election as the Republican party leader in the state assembly. He allied with Governor Cleveland to win passage of a civil service reform bill. Roosevelt won re-election a second time, and sought the office of Speaker of the New York State Assembly, but was defeated by Titus Sheard in a 41 to 29 vote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> caucus. In his final term, Roosevelt served as Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of Cities; he wrote more bills than any other legislator.|$|E
