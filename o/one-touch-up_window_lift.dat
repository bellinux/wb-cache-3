6000|$|O all ye fair ladies {{with your}} colours and your graces, [...] And your eyes clear in flame of candle and hearth, Toward {{the dark of}} this old <b>window</b> <b>lift</b> not up your smiling faces, [...] Where a Shade stands forlorn from the cold of the earth.|$|R
60|$|I {{lifted the}} paper {{up and saw}} that the chest was divided into two compartments. Lying on the top of one was a small, square, inlaid box. This Mrs. DeLisle took up and carried to the <b>window.</b> <b>Lifting</b> up the cover she laid it in my lap.|$|R
6000|$|Joscelyn {{rose and}} went to the <b>window.</b> <b>Lifting</b> back the curtain, she stood in the splendour of the moonlight, and sang the grand old hymn. At first Aunty Nan beat time to it feebly on the counterpane; but when Joscelyn came to the verse, [...] "With mercy and with judgment," [...] she folded her hands over her breast and smiled.|$|R
60|$|After {{reading for}} perhaps a half-hour {{he seemed to}} {{come to the end of}} a chapter and quietly laid away the book. He then rose and taking the reading-stand from the floor carried it into a corner of the room near one of the <b>windows,</b> <b>lifted</b> the candle from it and {{returned}} to the empty fireplace before which he had been sitting.|$|R
50|$|With the {{increased}} use of low current switching within automobiles, silicone rubber keypads are being used extensively as switch mechanisms for various function buttons such as <b>window</b> <b>lifts</b> and steering wheel mounted controls. With the availability of low resistance pills such as SC pills (produced by Abatek)and Gold pills, short-stroke metal dome contacts (produced by Shin-Etsu Polymer) application of keypad in automotive market has increased significantly.|$|R
50|$|A minor face {{lift and}} small trim {{variations}} {{were the main}} Cadillac styling news in 1951. Miniature eggcrate grilles were set into the out-board grille extension panels below the headlights. Larger, bullet shaped style bumper guards were used. Jump seats were used in both the seven-passenger sedan and Imperial limousine. Hydramatic automatic transmission was optional and hydraulic <b>window</b> <b>lifts</b> were standard. Business sedans were built in limited numbers on a special order basis.|$|R
5000|$|As {{advertised in}} The Times, Friday, 2 October 1959: The {{cylinder}} block and heads are cast in aluminum alloy and hydraulic tappets operate the overhead valves. The engine has a compression ratio of 8 to 1 and is fitted with twin carburetors with automatic choke.Other features available include fully automatic transmission, power-assisted steering, electrically operated ride control, redesigned and more flexible air conditioning, electric rear window demisters and press button <b>window</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was then}} a {{profound}} silence, as if the thunder had withdrawn into itself. People {{had just begun to}} eat again, when a gust of cold air came through the open <b>windows,</b> <b>lifting</b> tablecloths and skirts, a light flashed, and was instantly followed by a clap of thunder right over the hotel. The rain swished with it, and immediately there were all those sounds of windows being shut and doors slamming violently which accompany a storm.|$|R
50|$|The Trend & Fun {{specification}} {{offers a}} maximum approach angle of 18 degrees.

50|$|Unlike the 150 series, Two-Tens {{were always}} {{available}} {{with the same}} luxury options as the Bel Air, including the Powerglide automatic transmission, power <b>window</b> <b>lifts</b> and seat adjuster. The Two-Ten Townsman was the top station wagon model offered in 1953, but the Townsman was moved up to the Bel Air series for 1954, only {{to return to the}} Two-Ten for 1955. The lower-priced Handyman station wagon, a four-door model in 1953-54, became a two-door for 1955-57. Both were joined by a nine-passenger Beauville four-door wagon in 1956-57.|$|R
50|$|Hayes did {{not give}} up, however, and {{continued}} his passionate internal marketing of the project. As prototypes started to emerge, dealers were invited to test drive sessions, and this increased the enthusiasm for the new car. In addition, Ford took some radical measures to reduce the price on the car. As an example, the car was only offered in three exterior colours (black, white and moonstone blue) and one interior colour (grey). There were also just two equipment options: with or without central locking and electric <b>window</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|R

60|$|Then {{he led her}} to the <b>window,</b> and <b>lifted</b> {{her onto}} the sill. It was not high from the ground and two pairs of willing arms were there ready to help her down.|$|R

60|$|Tink, tink, tink. The {{locksmith}} {{paused at}} last, {{and wiped his}} brow. The silence roused the cat, who, jumping softly down, crept to the door, and watched with tiger eyes a bird-cage in an opposite <b>window.</b> Gabriel <b>lifted</b> Toby to his mouth, and took a hearty draught.|$|R
5000|$|The {{project at}} The Sentinels {{involved}} replacing <b>windows,</b> kitchens, <b>lifts,</b> refurbishing the communal areas and improving security. A new entrance was constructed {{as well as}} a roof feature, lighting scheme, which illuminates the building a blue light at night, and the addition of new cladding to the exterior of the building.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here," [...] said Mildred, {{when they}} rose from table, [...] "a wonder {{has come to}} pass since you deserted us. Look, sceptic that you are!"

50|$|The {{circular}} red-brick {{tower is}} 168 feet (41.2 m) tall and 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter {{at the base}} tapering to 20 feet (6 m) at the top, with small arched <b>windows.</b> A <b>lift</b> shaft dating from 1971 remains attached to the exterior; the interior retains a spiral staircase and melting pots.|$|R
6000|$|To the {{surprise}} of the Normans, Louis IV., king of France, suddenly arrived at Rouen, to claim, as he said, the homage of his young vassal. On the following day, Richard did not, as usual, appear beyond {{the walls of the}} castle, and there were rumors that he was detained there by order of the king. Assembling in great numbers, the Rouennais came before the castle, shouting loudly for [...] "Richard! Richard! our little Duke!" [...] nor could they be pacified till Louis appeared at the <b>window,</b> <b>lifting</b> young Richard in his arms, and made them a speech upon the gratitude and admiration which he pretended to feel for Duke William, to whom he said he owed his restoration to the throne of his fathers, and whose son he promised to regard as his own child.|$|R
2500|$|... 1974 saw the {{introduction}} of the rare, factory request, Spider-Targa. Based upon the Spider, it featured a Porsche style solid rear <b>window</b> and <b>lift</b> out roof panels, all made out of black GRP type material. Less than 2,000 models of such type were ever made and was the only part solid roof Spider until {{the introduction}} of the factory crafted hard top.|$|R
25|$|On {{the second}} day, Alex Gidman posted 115 and Steve Adshead 73 to lift Gloucestershire from 191 for 6 to 363. Hampshire then {{collapsed}} again, falling to 23 for 3 (including the wicket of nightwatchman Chris Tremlett) before John Crawley and Shane Watson rescued {{them with a}} 120-run partnership, as spinners Bandara and Ian Fisher toiled away to little effect. Hampshire eventually declared on 388 for 7, with four of their batsmen passing fifty, which left Gloucestershire 411 to win in a day. That never looked likely, but attritional cricket from Ramnaresh Sarwan and Matt <b>Windows</b> <b>lifted</b> Gloucestershire to 156 for 2, and then Gidman came in to add a further 39 for the fourth wicket. However, Shane Watson got a vital breakthrough with the wicket of Gidman, Shaun Udal unleashed a spell of furious off-spin on the tail, taking six for 61, and Gloucestershire were bowled out with an hour to spare.|$|R
25|$|Middlesex Crusaders amassed 333 for 4 in 45 overs - that's {{nearly seven}} and a half runs an over, well over the average five in 45-over games - and still lost to Gloucestershire Gladiators. It didn't look as the score would be as big at first,as Paul Weekes with 81, Ed Smith with 53, Owais Shah with 55 and Scott Styris with 42 kept the score ticking at roughly a run a ball. However, Kenyan-born Jamie Dalrymple slashed four sixes and seven fours in an unbeaten 24-ball 60 to up the run rate late on, and Gloucestershire's Jon Lewis, who earlier in the summer had played ODIs for England, conceded 86 runs in nine overs. Gloucestershire always kept up with the run rate, however, as Phil Weston, Craig Spearman and Matt <b>Windows</b> <b>lifted</b> Gloucestershire to 275 for 2, and despite Paul Weekes' late burst of four wickets, Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher shared a stand of 18 to see Gloucestershire to the target.|$|R
40|$|Poor {{performance}} of the convectional household induction motors which used in home appliances such as refrigerator, cooler, laundry, washing machines, fans, hand-held power tools, and automotive <b>window</b> <b>lift</b> is generally caused by two main reasons. Firstly, they have high starting current which causes significant voltage drop, and secondly, they operate in a single speed mode and not in variable speed. In many home appliances, traditionally a discrete speed control method is used by changing {{the number of the}} poles. A proper solution for these problems can be achieved by using control drive systems. In this paper, a simple scalar control method is applied to control the speed of a permanent capacitor single phase induction motor (PCSPIM). The philosophy of this method is on the basis of simultaneous system’s frequency and voltage control on the machines terminals subject to V/f=cte. Simulation and practical implementation results clearly show the effectiveness of the simple V/f =cte speed control method for home appliances...|$|R
50|$|Nearly every {{model was}} {{redesigned}} for 1948, including the $3,820 Sixty Special. With all-new sheet metal, but still riding an exclusive 133-inch wheelbase, the luxurious Sixty Special weighed in at 4,370 pounds shipping weight (over 4,500 pounds curb weight). Inside, electric <b>window</b> <b>lifts</b> and a two-way power bench seat were standard equipment. A clever rainbow-shaped instrument cluster which {{put all the}} gauges directly above the steering column {{in front of the}} driver was used for 1948 only, while a new curved dashboard design added to passenger roominess. The roof-mounted decorative chrome louvers and individually framed side door glass (a Sixty Special design element since 1938) were carried over to this latest model as well. With trim inspired by the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the new Sixty Special featured simulated side-scoops and curious tail-fins - resembling the P-38's vertical stabilizers. Its appearance is similar to cross-town rival Chrysler Imperial and the Chrysler New Yorker initially in 1949, and less so with yearly appearance changes.|$|R

2500|$|In 1968, the NASCAR {{inspired}} Charger R/T {{failed to}} beat the Ford cars (the Ford Torino Talladega and the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II) on the high-banks oval-tracks.
