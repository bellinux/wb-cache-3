40|$|Recent {{research}} has found that the entrance of a low cost carrier leads to lower prices <b>on</b> <b>routes</b> it has entered. This paper extends this analysis by examining the impact of route entry by a discount carrier, ValuJet into an established carrier's hub, Delta, and by examining price changes <b>on</b> <b>routes</b> not entered by the low cost carrier. We found that Delta lowered its fares <b>on</b> competitive <b>routes</b> terminating in Atlanta and <b>on</b> <b>routes</b> flowing through its Atlanta hub in response to competition by ValuJet. We did not find evidence that Delta increased fares <b>on</b> non-competitive <b>routes</b> (either those terminating in Atlanta or flowing through Atlanta) to compensate for lost revenues <b>on</b> the competitive <b>routes.</b> This final result runs counter to the conjectures of the DOT and supports the argument that firms practice rational economic pricing in their hub-and-spoke networks.
