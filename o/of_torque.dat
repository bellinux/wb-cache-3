5|$|As {{early as}} the Han dynasty, when the state needed to {{accurately}} measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on a mechanical odometer. The Chinese odometer was a wheeled carriage, its gearwork being driven by {{the rotation of the}} carriage's wheels; specific units of distance—the Chinese li—were marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell as an auditory signal. The specifications for the 11th century odometer were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the Song Shi (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally crafted by Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a differential gear that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels turned about. The concept of the differential gear that was used in this navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply an equal amount <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> to a car's wheels even when they are rotating at different speeds.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{whether there is}} {{a significant difference between the}} peak <b>torque</b> and angle <b>of</b> peak <b>torque</b> <b>of</b> the hamstrings in a group of recreational female football players. Methods: A convenience sample of 17 females aged 18 - 22 years from a university ladies football team. Peak <b>torque</b> and angle <b>of</b> peak <b>torque</b> <b>of</b> both hamstrings were measured using a Biodex system 2 isokinetic dynamometer in concentric and eccentric mode at an angular velocity of 60 °/sec. The related t-test was used to test for significant differences between limbs. Results: Muscle strength differences ranging between 0. 9 % - 38. 3 % (Concentric: 9. 7 ± 7. 7; Eccentric: 15. 4 ± 9. 3) were noted. However, no significant differences were found between the dominant and non dominant limb (peak torque concentric p= 0. 068, eccentric p= 0. 063; angle <b>of</b> peak <b>torque</b> concentric p= 0. 449, eccentric p= 0. 246). Conclusions: In a group of recreational football players, limb dominance did not significantly affect peak <b>torque</b> or angle <b>of</b> peak <b>torque</b> at 60 °/secs. However, noteworthy strength imbalances were observed in a number of participants, indicating that clinicians need to be cautious when using the uninjured limb as a baseline measure. Implications: The findings highlight that caution may be exercised when using the peak <b>torque</b> and angle <b>of</b> peak <b>torque</b> <b>of</b> the contralateral limb as a target for rehabilitation. <br/...|$|R
