The sailor (Borzage) falls in love with the {{daughter}} (Aoki) of the family, unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is cursed by God, such that if she marries, a nearby volcano will erupt and destroy the entire island on which the family lives. Writer and producer Thomas H. Ince got the idea for the film from the volcanic eruption on the island of Sakura-Jima in 1914. Hayakawa was paid $500 a week, the highest paid of all oriental stars at the time.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{returned}} to Britain to become senior lecturer and {{acting director of}} research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With {{the help of a}} Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczysław (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled {{the rest of the family}} out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become an editor of the Dictionary of National Biography.|$|E

In the film, Selena's real voice {{is used for the}} musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip syncing. When asked in an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: [...] "I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like..." [...] After filming Selena, Lopez was [...] "really feeling [...] Latin roots" [...] and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled [...] "Vivir Sin Ti", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6. During production of the album, Lopez was aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: [...] "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career." ...|$|E

On the whole, the overwhelming probability is that she died from complications arising from her earlier miscarriage.|$|E

2500|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a {{stranger}} {{in the city and}} because of the rather secluded life she was forced to lead while a boarder at the convent, she found it practically impossible to do much as a reporter and began editorial work. Conversant with every phase of life, ancient and modern, alive to every new issue, she was especially fitted for such work. She wrote editorials on every conceivable subject, art, literature, science, education, economics and politics. Although the editors accepted her work they still refused to give her a position. Finally, she went to Wilbur F. Storey, editor of the Times, and reminding him that he had never refused her editorials, demanded that she be given a place on the paper. The editor doubted that [...] Buchanan was really the author of the masterly editorials that he had been publishing and to try her, he asked her to write an editorial on the Canadian monetary system. Without a moment's hesitation Buchanan wrote the article assigned. Storey, thoroughly astonished, made a place for her on the paper. “What salary do you expect,” he asked. “The salary of the man whose place I am to take,” Buchanan answered. The answer was typical of her. She never allowed anyone to underestimate her work because she was a woman. Not in the least egotistical, she, nevertheless, realized her ability and no false modesty prevented her from frankly admitting it.|$|E

She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, [...] "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was good enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on EastEnders in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on EastEnders you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor." ...|$|E
