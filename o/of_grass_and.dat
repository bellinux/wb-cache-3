5|$|The adult Iago sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> grain (the main cereal crop grown in Cape Verde is maize), but also on insects and plant shoots. They can do damage to crops by eating young leaves, and like house sparrows will eat the food scraps {{available}} near houses. Nestlings, by contrast to adults, are fed almost exclusively on insects, especially caterpillars, flies, and orthopterans. The Iago sparrow forages mostly on the ground, moving restlessly whilst clinging to the ground like a mouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the site {{is made up of}} species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three dominant species <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> several other grass species at lower abundances. The dominant species are Red Fescue (Festuca rubra), Common Bent (Agrostis capillaris) and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus). The less abundant species of grass include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata). The subcommunity also has many broad-leaved herbs including Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra), Tormentil (Potentilla erecta), Devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) and Betony (Stachys officinalis).|$|E
5|$|A prophecy {{states that}} a female {{child with a}} special {{birthmark}} will herald {{the downfall of the}} evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda. Bavmorda imprisons all pregnant women in her realm to prevent fulfillment of the prophecy. When the prophesied child Elora Danan is born, the mother begs the midwife to hide the infant and smuggle her to safety. The midwife reluctantly accepts and leaves Nockmaar castle unnoticed. The mother is executed, the midwife is hunted down and eventually found. Knowing she cannot escape, she sets the baby on a makeshift raft <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> sends her down the river hoping for fate to run its course. The midwife is killed by Nockmaar hounds. Bavmorda, furious about the escape, summons her daughter Sorsha and her army's commander, General Kael, to find the baby.|$|E

5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{the player}} can find {{rustling}} patches <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> rippling water, {{where they can}} encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon {{more common in the}} opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This {{is the only way to}} capture Pokémon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pokémon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pokémon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.|$|E
5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest {{is little more}} than a pad <b>of</b> <b>grass,</b> <b>and</b> a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E

5|$|The male {{selects a}} territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship {{involves}} ritualised flight and ground displays, {{and the male}} often presents a fish to his partner. Most species {{have little or no}} nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a Humboldt penguin. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E

Typical herbs associated with old meadows are plentiful including Cowslip, Betony, Pepper Saxifrage and Ox-eye Daisy. Orchids include the Green-winged Orchid.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{woodlands}} surrounding the grasslands cannot {{be converted into}} grasslands, FWS will maintain them as such.

25|$|The savannah zone's three {{categories}} {{are divided into}} mm' Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, made up of plains of tall grass which are interrupted by trees, the most common across the country; Sudan savannah, similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees; and Sahel savannah patches <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> sand, found in the northeast.|$|E

25|$|What links them {{is their}} common {{connection}} to Emerson (a passage from whom Whitman {{printed on the}} second edition of Leaves <b>of</b> <b>Grass),</b> <b>and</b> the daring originality of their visions.

25|$|The {{evolution}} of Rhinocerotidae follows {{a very similar}} pattern to the {{evolution of}} the Equidae, both being facets of the evolution of mammalian herbivores during the Cenozoic. The overall pattern is based on the evolutionary development <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> grassland, and further the changing distribution of C3 and C4 types of plant metabolism, so-called because they generate a molecule containing three or four Carbon atoms by different metabolic pathways (sequences of chemical reactions).|$|E
