5|$|The {{defensive}} line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT). Defensive ends line up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles {{is to stop}} running plays {{on the outside and}} inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the linebackers can break through.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> {{their toes}} to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities {{on the surface}} and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E
5|$|All {{preparations}} for the operation were completed by {{the first week of}} May and on 9 May the weather was nearly perfect for the attack. The British armada had collected at Dunkirk in Allied-held France and departed port shortly after dark. Two minutes after midnight, the force suffered a setback when Sappho suffered a minor boiler explosion and had to return to Dunkirk, unable to complete the journey. Although this accident halved the ability of the force to block Ostend, Lynes decided to continue the operation, and at 01:30, the force closed on the port, making the final {{preparations for}} the assault. Torpedoes fired from motor launches demolished machine gun posts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the piers marking the canal, beginning the attack. Ten heavy bombers of the newly formed Royal Air Force then dropped incendiary bombs on German positions, but did not cause significant damage. In spite of the fog, air operations continued as planned under the overall direction of Brigadier-General Charles Lambe. At {{the same time as the}} aerial bombardment began, the long range artillery of the Royal Marine Artillery opened fire on Ostend from Allied positions around the Belgian town of Ypres.|$|E

5|$|The Russians did {{not believe}} that super firing turrets offered any {{advantage}} as they discounted the value of axial fire, believed that broadside fire was much more important and also believed that super firing turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast interfering with the open sighting hoods in the lower turret's roof. They therefore designed the ships with a 'linear' arrangement (lineinoe raspolozhenie) of turrets distributed over the length of the ship. This arrangement had several advantages because it reduced the stress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the ship since the turrets were not concentrated {{at the end of the}} ship, increased stability because the lack of elevated turrets and their barbettes, improved the survivability of the ship because the magazines were separated from each other and gave a lower silhouette. Disadvantages were that the magazines had to be put in the middle of all the machinery, which required steam pipes to be run through or around them and the lack of deck space free from blast. This greatly complicated the placement of the anti-torpedo boat guns which ultimately had to be mounted in the hull, closer to the water than was desirable.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored {{it and put it}} on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E

25|$|A mega-{{telomere}} (also {{known as}} an ultra-long telomere or a class III telomere), is an extremely long telomere sequence that sits {{on the end of}} chromosomes and prevents the loss of genetic information during cell replication.

However, mega-telomeres are substantially longer than regular telomeres, ranging in size from 50 kilobases to several megabases (for comparison, the normal length of vertebrate telomeres is usually between 10 and 20 kilobases).|$|E
