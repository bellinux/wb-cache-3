40|$|Photocatalytic {{isomerization}} of thermodynamically stable E-alkene to {{less stable}} Z-alkene {{has been the}} subject of numerous studies, being successfully achieved mainly under UV irradiation. Recent development of visible light photoredox catalysis has witnessed it emerging as a powerful tool for the access of new structural complexity and many challenging targets. Herein, we report a visible light-promoted E to Z isomerization of cinnamates. When E-isomer of cinnamates was irradiated with blue light in the presence of an <b>organo-photocatalyst,</b> fac-Ir(ppy) 3, Z-isomer was exclusively obtained in high yields and with good selectivity. The mild, convenient reaction condition has made this protocol an effective synthetic methodology, which was subsequently implemented in an efficient synthesis of coumarins...|$|E
40|$|Herein, the {{successful}} utilization of core shell poly-methyl methacrylate nanoparticles (CS-PMMA NPs) {{as a valuable}} support for organocatalyst immobilization in aqueous medium is presented along with an unprecedented direct current-based electrochemical method for processing a water colloid of the result- ing nano-supported catalyst. The NP coagulation procedure relied on various electrocoagulation tech- niques and it was achieved through water electrolysis occurring in a dialysis membrane immersed in the colloid. Mass recoveries of up to 95 % w/w were obtained for the NPs within 1 h of electrolysis. This was optimized at a constant current of 90 mA or a constant potential of 24 V. The disclosed NP separation procedure was effectively exploited in a continuous-flow reaction/separation/recycle sequence involving the tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonate (TPPS) <b>organo-photocatalyst</b> immobilized on CS-PMMA NPs (NP 2 s). After an optimization study aimed at maximizing the chemical efficiency of the entire synthetic and purification process, the nano-supported catalyst NP 2 (0. 05 mol%) efficiently promoted the photo- excitation of triplet oxygen to singlet oxygen for the selective and environmentally benign sulfoxidation of a model sulfide in an aqueous medium...|$|E
