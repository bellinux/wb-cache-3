25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one <b>old</b> <b>cow.</b> The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the <b>old</b> <b>cow</b> would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall {{and saw that it was}} crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E

Lyrics were added in 1950 by Ray Gilbert. First recorded by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five in 1926, {{it became the}} group's most frequently recorded piece. Composer credit was given to Ory, although bandleader Armstrong has claimed to have written the song himself. Others, like New Orleans clarinetist Sidney Bechet, have {{argued that it was}} originally a Buddy Bolden tune titled [...] "The <b>Old</b> <b>Cow</b> Died and the Old Man Cried". The tune was a prominent part of the Dixieland revival repertoire in the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E

40|$|Decline in {{fertility}} {{with age}} {{has been well}} documented in women. There are ethical limitations to use humans as a model for basic research, and {{there is a lack of}} well characterized animal model. The objective was to characterize and validate a bovine model for the study of age-associated subfertility. All experiments were conducted on the same group of 13 - 14 year <b>old</b> <b>cows</b> (n= 10), and their 1 - 4 year old young daughters (n= 10). Mother-daughter pairs were used to reduce genetic variations. Follicular wave pattern in a natural reproductive cycle was maintained in <b>old</b> <b>cows</b> similar to that in daughters. We hypothesized that aging in cattle is associated with elevated circulating concentrations of FSH, and reduced concentrations of steroid hormones. As stated, circulating FSH concentrations were higher (P= 0. 009) during follicular waves in <b>old</b> than young <b>cows.</b> The ovulatory follicle in 2 -wave cycles was smaller in <b>old</b> <b>cows</b> (P= 0. 04), but plasma estradiol concentrations were higher (P= 0. 01). Luteal phase progesterone tended to be lower in <b>old</b> than young <b>cows</b> (P= 0. 1). The number of 4 - 5 mm follicles recruited into a follicular wave was lower (...|$|R
30|$|In general, {{animals were}} only sold when pastoralists had a {{pressing}} economic need for cash. The {{size of the}} need determined what animals were sold (see also Moritz 2003). If pastoralists had large needs (e.g. marriage, legal fees), they would sell a large or fat animal. If they had small needs (e.g. food, taxes, medical bills, clothes, wages), they would sell small stock, young male calves, or <b>old</b> <b>cows</b> that were no longer productive. Only {{if there were no}} young male calves or <b>old</b> <b>cows</b> would pastoralists sell chronically sick animals.|$|R
2500|$|Leesburg {{operates}} the Leesburg Executive Airport at Godfrey Field, which serves Loudoun County with private and corporate aircraft operations. [...] A designated reliever airport for Dulles International, the airport accounts for nearly $78 {{million per year}} in economic impact according to a 2011 study by the Virginia Department of Aviation. It is home (as of 2005) to over 240 aircraft, and hosts 2030 jet operations per day.The airport was built in 1963 to replace the original Leesburg airport, which Arthur Godfrey owned and referred to affectionately as [...] "The <b>Old</b> <b>Cow</b> Pasture" [...] on his radio show. [...] Godfrey, who, by the early 1950s, had purchased the Beacon Hill Estate west of Leesburg, used a DC-3 to commute from his farm to studios in New York City every Sunday night during the 1950s and 1960s. His DC-3 was so powerful and noisy that Godfrey built a new airport, funding it through {{the sale of the}} old field. Originally named Godfrey Field, it is now known as Leesburg Executive Airport at Godfrey Field.|$|E
2500|$|Queensland {{political}} scientist Rae Wear described Bjelke-Petersen as an authoritarian who treated democratic values with contempt and was intolerant and resentful of opposition, yet who also demonstrated a down-home charm and old-fashioned courtesies {{as well as}} kindness to colleagues. Those who worked closely with him described him as stubborn with a propensity to fly into rages {{in which he would}} [...] "rant and rave like Adolf Hitler", creating [...] "fantastic performances" [...] as he shook with rage, becoming increasingly incoherent. Many of his National Party colleagues were in terror of him on such occasions. Raised by migrant parents in spartan rural surroundings, he combined a strong work ethic with an ascetic lifestyle that was strongly shaped by his Lutheran upbringing. As a young man Bjelke-Petersen lived alone for 15 years in an <b>old</b> <b>cow</b> bail with a leaky bark roof and only the most basic of facilities. He had a lifelong habit of hard work and long days and while premier often slept for just four hours a night. He valued [...] "the School of Life, the hard knocks of life" [...] more than formal education and showed little respect for academics and universities, although he accepted an honorary doctorate of Laws from Queensland University in May 1985, prompting criticism from both students and staff. Wear dismissed Bjelke-Petersen's claim that he was a reluctant and accidental entrant into state politics, concluding that he [...] "seized opportunity whenever it presented and held tenaciously to power", and was later willing to use any device to remain premier. She said that although Bjelke-Petersen denied ever knowing anything about corruption, [...] "the evidence suggests this is untrue. He ignored it because to acknowledge its presence was to hand a weapon to his political enemies and because he was prepared to trade off corruption for police loyalty".|$|E

40|$|Analysis {{was made}} of the effect of dry period length in first-calf heifers and <b>older</b> <b>cows</b> from the active {{population}} of cows in the Pomerania and Kujavia regions on their performance in the next production cycle. The GLM, FREQ and CORR PEARSON procedures of the SAS package were used for statistical calculations. It was found that a dry period of 41 - 60 days is the most favourable in terms of next lactation milk yield. Any shortening of the dry period, especially to less than 20 days, is particularly inadvisable for first-calf heifers. Dry periods of 21 - 40 days are the most favourable considering survival of <b>cows</b> (especially the <b>oldest</b> <b>cows)</b> in the next production cycle. Extending the standard dry period of 41 - 60 days by 20 days causes a slight decrease in performance (as determined by the parameters mentioned above) but extending it by another 20 days is highly detrimental. Especially in the <b>oldest</b> <b>cows,</b> a dry period that is too long (over 100 days) may carry the risk of increased culling in the herd, shorter lactations and poorer reproductive performance...|$|R
