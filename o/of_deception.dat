5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> by trial and error. From {{mistakes}} during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles <b>of</b> <b>deception.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Deception is {{a common}} and {{essential}} behavior in humans. Since human beings gain many advantages from deceptive capabilities, we can also assume that robotic deception can provide benefits in several ways. Particularly, the use <b>of</b> robotic <b>deception</b> in human-robot interaction contexts is becoming an important and interesting research question. Despite its importance, very little research on robot deception has been conducted. Furthermore, no basic metrics or definitions <b>of</b> robot <b>deception</b> have been proposed yet. In this paper, we review the previous work on deception in various fields including psychology, biology, and robotics and will propose a novel way to define a taxonomy <b>of</b> robot <b>deception.</b> In addition, we will introduce an interesting research question <b>of</b> robot <b>deception</b> in HRI contexts and discuss potential approaches...|$|R

5|$|Following Seven Assignments Clarke {{then took}} a job at Conservative Central Office, as Head of Public Opinion Research, where he worked until 1952. During this later career he also served as a {{director}} of Securicor. In 1952 he resumed his literary career with the publication of The Eleventh at War, a history of the 11th Hussars. The following year he submitted a publisher's proposal for The Secret War, a full account <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> during the Second World War, but was prevented from writing it by the Official Secrets Act. His final book was fiction, a thriller entitled Golden Arrow, published in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, 'A' Force (the Cairo-based {{department}} responsible for deception operations in the North Africa) had begun an operation, codenamed Cascade, to inflate {{the number of troops}} in the region by creating fictional divisions. By 1943 the use of notional formations had proved a useful part <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> operations, such as Operation Rayon, and the practice formed the basis for key parts of Bodyguard. The Allies invaded Italy in September 1943 {{and by the end of}} the year had occupied most of the south of the country. Thirty-eight divisions were deployed across the Mediterranean theatre, mostly in Italy with some in North Africa.|$|E

5|$|After Archer {{recklessly}} foils an Irish terrorist's {{attempt to}} assassinate a British nobleman, Malory begins {{to suspect that}} Lana's feelings for her son are resurfacing. Hoping to readjust Lana's desires so they are steered towards her current boyfriend, Cyril, she asks Archer to train {{him to be a}} field agent. Archer is wise to their scheme though, and tries to set Cyril up to fail to sabotage his relationship with Lana, Archer's ex. At one point, Cyril inquiries about Archer’s lack of ethics, and ease <b>of</b> <b>deception.</b> To which Archer’s replies “lying is, like, 95% of what I do.” One of his sessions involves trying to kill an assassin (portrayed by Archer's butler, Woodhouse) and using a dance partner (played by a prostitute Archer has befriended) as a human shield. During the session, however, Cyril accidentally poisons the prostitute and both he and Archer pronounce her deceased.|$|E
5|$|Bodyguard of Lies {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} to Ultra, the codename for decrypted signals intelligence. It goes on to document {{the origins of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and the work of Dudley Clarke in the Middle East. In late 1942, Allied high command in London became aware of Clarke's successes during the North African Campaign. Based on his theories <b>of</b> <b>deception,</b> the LCS was created under Colonel John Bevan and granted broad powers to plan deception strategy. The introduction finishes with a discussion of how the Allies evolved deception strategy prior to 1943, including the Double-Cross System (the Allied system of double agents). The second section of the book introduces the German intelligence forces, in particular Admiral Canaris and his Abwehr intelligence agency. Brown discusses early deceptions, such as those surrounding Operation Torch, conducted against the Germans, and how the Abwehr struggled to decipher the information it was being fed.|$|E
5|$|In February 1936, the Roeriches {{and their}} {{associates}} {{had attempted to}} obtain an injunction to prevent these actions. When the attempt failed, they sued Horch to regain what they believed to be their rightful authority {{to participate in the}} operation of the building and its component organizations. This case was settled on February 9, 1938, in favor of Horch. George Frankenthaler, the referee who decided the case, found that the Roeriches never possessed the authority they claimed. Horch alone administered the corporation that had the building constructed, ran the organizations that it housed, and obtained all the needed financing. In addition, he donated {{more than a million dollars}} of his own, while the Roeriches and their associates had contributed no money at all. Regarding allegations <b>of</b> <b>deception,</b> he found Horch to be the more creditable witness.|$|E

5|$|Most major belligerents {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another aspect of military intelligence was the use <b>of</b> <b>deception,</b> which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|The Persians had now {{captured}} most of Greece, but Xerxes had {{perhaps not}} expected such defiance; his priority was now {{to complete the}} war as quickly as possible. If Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, {{he would be in}} a strong position to force an Allied surrender; conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Allies could prevent conquest from being completed. The Allied fleet thus remained off the coast of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell, the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle. Partly because <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> by Themistocles, the navies met in the cramped Straits of Salamis. There, the Persian numbers became a hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the Allied fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships, therefore ensuring the safety of the Peloponnessus.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not give}} the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided experience for the planners in handling deception and for the Twenty Committee in proving the worth of double agents. Terry Crowdy, writing in 2008, argued that any experience that the LCS attained was limited {{by the lack of}} guidance from Cairo and knowledge of double agents. Dudley Clarke had already shown that the most effective method <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including Operation Tindall and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 Operation Fortitude North, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions.|$|E
40|$|In today's modern society, the {{increasing}} demands for connectivity and accessibility place computers in ever larger internetworks. As {{more and more}} computers become globally accessible, the number of threats from random and targeted attacks rise rapidly. To counter known and unknown threats, various technologies and concepts are employed as defensive measures. One concept that is in rising popularity is computer <b>deception,</b> the subject <b>of</b> this thesis. The field <b>of</b> computer <b>deception</b> is characterized by fragmentation and is lacking unified definitions and methods. This thesis has reviewed five deception paradigms, {{in order to build}} a descriptive theory that is used for understanding the concept <b>of</b> computer <b>deception.</b> The border between human deception and computer deception is investigated. The thesis concludes that computer deception for defense rarely {{can be seen as a}} field unrelated to human deception. When attacker tools are targeted for deception, they are only intermediary steps on the way to a human attacker. This makes the core issues <b>of</b> computer <b>deception</b> a matter <b>of</b> psychology, not technology. Computer specialists without knowledge of psychology do not have the expertise necessary for estimating the consequences <b>of</b> <b>deceptions</b> on human attackers...|$|R

5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} <b>of</b> <b>deception.</b> On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had {{from time to time}} secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1944 invasion of Normandy, the Allied nations conducted a complex series <b>of</b> <b>deceptions</b> under the codename Bodyguard. The overall aim of {{the plan was to}} confuse the German high command as to the exact location and timing of the invasion. Significant time was spent constructing the First United States Army Group, a notional army to threaten Pas de Calais, along with political and visual deceptions to communicate a fictional Allied battle plan. Copperhead was a small portion of Bodyguard conceived by Dudley Clarke. Earlier in the war Clarke had pioneered the idea <b>of</b> strategic <b>deception,</b> forming a deception department in Cairo named 'A' Force. Clarke and 'A' Force were not officially in charge of Bodyguard planning (a role that fell to the London Controlling Section), but because of the location <b>of</b> the <b>deception</b> the Cairo planners organised much of the operation.|$|R
