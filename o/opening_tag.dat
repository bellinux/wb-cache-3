5000|$|HTML markup {{consists}} of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like [...] and , although some represent empty elements {{and so are}} unpaired, for example [...] The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, {{and the second is}} the end tag (they are also called <b>opening</b> <b>tags</b> and closing tags).|$|R
50|$|XML allows parsers to {{separate}} the process of interpreting the document syntax and its structure. In HTML and SGML, a parser needed to know certain rules about elements during parsing, such as what elements could be contained within other elements and which elements implicitly close the previous element. This is because in HTML and SGML, closing <b>tags</b> and even <b>opening</b> <b>tags</b> were optional on some elements. By requiring all elements to have explicit <b>opening</b> and closing <b>tags,</b> XML parsers can parse the document and produce a document tree without any knowledge of the document type. This allows parsers to be universal and very light-weight, and {{to be separated from}} the process of validating or interpreting the document.|$|R

50|$|Malformed markup {{is arguably}} the most severe problem in web authoring. However, thanks to better {{education}} and information and perhaps with some help from XHTML, the issue of malformed markup is becoming less common. Browsers, when faced with malformed markup, must guess the intended meaning of the author. They must infer closing tags where they expect them and then infer <b>opening</b> <b>tags</b> to match other closing-tags. The interpretation can vary markedly from one browser to the next. Ian Hickson wrote a detailed article investigating the differences between how browsers handle tag soup.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In 2004, Molnar and Wagner {{introduced}} a very appealing scheme {{dedicated to the}} identification of RFID tags. Their protocol relies on a binary tree of secrets which are shared – for all nodes except the leaves – amongst the tags. Hence the compromise of one tag also has implications on the other tags with whom it shares keys. We describe a new man-in-the-middle attack against this protocol which allows to break privacy even without <b>opening</b> <b>tags.</b> Moreover, it {{can be applied to}} some other RFID protocols which use correlated keys as the one described recently by Damg˚ard and Pedersen at CT-RSA 2008. We introduce a modification of the initial scheme to allow us to thwart this and to strengthen RFID tags by implementing secrets with Physical Obfuscated Keys (POKs). This doing, we augment tags and scheme privacy, particularly general resistance against physical threats...|$|R

Some data structures are treated as objects within the stream as with HTML's treatment of graphic images, e.g., footnotes and styles, but the bulk of a WordPerfect document's data and formatting codes appear as a single continuous stream.
