5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after its founding, the Khitan Empire began {{a process of}} territorial expansion, with Abaoji leading a successful conquest of Balhae. Later emperors would gain the Sixteen Prefectures by fueling a proxy war {{that led to the}} collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Later</b> Tang (923–936) and would establish tributary relationships with Goryeo and Song China after failing to conquer Goryeo.|$|E

50|$|Thus adjured, Vala Uga spared Anant's life, but {{released}} all {{the kings}} {{whom he had}} imprisoned. He subsequently was slain by Ra Kavat in revenge for a fancied insult at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later's</b> liberation.|$|R
5|$|As {{a protein}} {{synthesis}} inhibitor, {{it affects the}} ability of bacteria to produce protein. This either stops growth or results in bacterial death. Although many antibiotics work this way, the exact mechanism of action of linezolid appears to be unique in that it blocks the start of protein production, rather than one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> steps. As of 2014 bacterial resistance to linezolid has remained low.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, record {{companies}} like Paramount Records and OKeh Records launched {{the field of}} race music, which was mostly blues targeted at African American audiences. The most famous of these acts went on to inspire much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> popular development of the blues and blues-derived genres, including Charley Patton, Lonnie Johnson and Robert Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> Habsburg families, who ruled in both Spain and other nations of Europe, the Andalusian was crossbred with horses of Central Europe and the Low Countries and thus was closely related to many breeds that developed, including the Neapolitan horse, Groningen, Lipizzaner and Kladruber. Spanish horses have been used extensively in classical dressage in Germany since the 16th century. They thus influenced many German breeds, including the Hanoverian, Holstein, East Friesian and Oldenburg. Dutch breeds such as the Friesian and Gelderland also contain significant Spanish blood, as do Danish breeds such as the Fredericksborg and Knabstrupper.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{scholars}} have always defended {{the value of}} specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, {{has argued that the}} lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars. As a result, his translation of the History for Penguin Books covers only the first half, and was published as Lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Later</b> Caesars, Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these {{are not part of the}} original texts, which begin with Hadrian).|$|E
5|$|Constantine Doukas' {{wife was}} shorn and exiled to her husband's estate in Paphlagonia {{and his younger}} son Stephen was castrated. Along with the deaths of Constantine's son and nephew, this meant the {{extinction}} of this branch of the Doukas family: the relation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> bearers of the Doukas name with Andronikos and Constantine is unclear.|$|E
5|$|During much of Anne’s reign, the Duke of Marlborough was abroad {{fighting}} the War of the Spanish Succession, while Sarah remained in England. Despite {{being the most}} powerful woman in England besides the Queen, she appeared at court only rarely, preferring to oversee the construction of her new estate, Woodstock Manor (the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> Blenheim Palace), a gift from Queen Anne after the duke's victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Nevertheless, Anne sent her news of political developments in letters and consulted Sarah's advice in most matters.|$|E

5|$|Events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> {{years of}} the reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the {{relatively}} benevolent historian Menander Protector {{felt the need to}} attribute the Emperor's failure to protect the capital to the weakness of his body in his old age. In his efforts to renew the Roman Empire, Justinian dangerously stretched its resources while failing {{to take into account the}} changed realities of 6th-century Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the breakup}} of Throbbing Gristle, P-Orridge and Christopherson founded Psychic TV and signed to a major label. Their first album was much more {{accessible}} and melodic than the usual industrial style, and included hired work by trained musicians. Later work returned to the sound collage and noise elements of earlier industrial. They also borrowed from funk and disco. P-Orridge also founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, a quasi-religious organization that produced video art. Psychic TV's commercial aspirations were managed by Stevo of Some Bizzare records, who released many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> industrial musicians, including Eistürzende Neubauten, Test Dept, and Cabaret Voltaire.|$|E
5|$|German {{citizens}} (despite much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> denial) {{had access}} to information about what was happening, as soldiers returning from the occupied territories would report on what they had seen and done. Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide. Some Polish citizens tried to rescue or hide the remaining Jews {{and members of the}} Polish underground got word to their government in exile in London as to what was happening.|$|E

5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War {{during a period}} when he was {{producing}} images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> plates contain fantastical motifs which {{can be seen as}} a return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.|$|E
5|$|In 951, the Later Zhou emerged, {{the last}} of the five {{short-lived}} dynasties making up the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The founding emperor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Later</b> Zhou died in 954 and was succeeded by his adopted son, who would rule with the name Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou. Shizong believed that the Liao dynasty was poised to invade the Zhou, and in 958 he launched a preemptive military campaign against the Liao, aiming to take the sixteen prefectures ceded to the Liao by Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin in 938. Emperor Shizong died in 959, before his army had even met the Liao forces. In 960 the commander-in-chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Later</b> Zhou palace guard, Zhao Kuangyin, usurped the throne, then occupied by Emperor Shizong's seven-year-old son, and proclaimed himself the founder of the Song dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In January 1918, Friedrich Schlosser {{replaced}} von Trapp {{as commander}} of U-14. Schlosser was, in turn, replaced in June by Hugo Pistel, {{who remained in}} command {{until the end of}} the war. Neither <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> commanders was able to duplicate von Trapp's success in U-14; the U-boat sank no more ships through the rest of the war.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of species with two {{permanent}} sexes, including {{but not limited to}} Earth-humans, the stories state that females are psychologically incapable of allowing their psyches to be violated to the extent required by the educator tapes. However, in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> books a very assertive non-human female character accidentally acquires several sets of memories which cannot be erased, and adjusts to this with relative ease.|$|E
