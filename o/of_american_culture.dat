5|$|Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940– December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, {{activist and}} filmmaker. His work was {{characterized}} by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> In a career spanning more than 30years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced {{almost all of the}} 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He {{is considered one of the}} most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.|$|E

25|$|From their {{earliest}} {{presence in}} North America, White Americans have contributed literature, art, cinema, religion, agricultural skills, foods, science and technology, fashion and clothing styles, music, language, legal system, political system, {{and social and}} technological innovation to American culture. White American culture derived its earliest influences from English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish settlers and is quantitatively the largest proportion <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> The overall American culture reflects White American culture. The culture has been developing since long before the United States formed a separate country. Much <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> shows influences from English culture. Colonial ties to Great Britain spread the English language, legal system and other cultural attributes.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} African-American culture {{developed}} separately from European-American culture, {{both because of}} slavery and the persistence of racial discrimination in America, as well as African-American slave descendants' desire to create and maintain their own traditions.

25|$|Some aspects <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> codify racism. For example, the {{prevailing}} idea in American culture, perpetuated by the media, {{has been that}} black features are less attractive or desirable than white features. The idea that blackness was ugly was highly damaging to the psyche of African Americans, manifesting itself as internalized racism. The Black is beautiful cultural movement sought to dispel this notion.|$|E

25|$|One {{of the key}} {{beliefs and}} {{practices}} of the Beat Generation was free love and sexual liberation, which strayed from the Christian ideals <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> at the time.

25|$|Beyond {{promotion}} of the Phase I goals of proposing Intelligent Design related research, publications, and attempted integration into academia, the wedge strategy places an emphasis on Phases II and III advocacy aimed at increasing popular support of the Discovery Institute's ideas. Support {{for the creation of}} popular level books, newspaper and magazine articles, op-ed pieces, video productions, and apologetics seminars was hoped to embolden believers and sway the broader culture towards acceptance of intelligent design. This in turn would lead the ultimate goal of the wedge strategy; a social and political reformation <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Fischer, the {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> was formed from four mass migrations from four {{different regions of}} the British Isles by four distinct socio-religious groups. New England's earliest settlement period occurred between 1629-1640 when Puritans, mostly from East Anglia in England, settled there, forming the New England regional culture. The next mass migration was of southern English cavaliers and their Irish and Scottish domestic servants to the Chesapeake Bay region between 1640-1675, producing the Southern American culture. Then, between 1675-1725, thousands of Irish, English and German Quakers, led by William Penn, settled in the Delaware Valley.|$|E

25|$|Many North American {{hardcore}} punk fans {{adopted a}} dressed-down style of T-shirts, jeans, combat boots or sneakers and crewcut-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts. The clothing style was {{a reflection of}} hardcore ideology, which included dissatisfaction with suburban America and the hypocrisy <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> It was essentially deconstruction of American fashion staples—ripped jeans, holey T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and work boots. The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate hairdos, torn clothes, patches, safety pins, studs, spikes, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{protectionism}} in Canada has, {{since the}} mid-20th century, taken {{the form of}} conscious, interventionist attempts {{on the part of}} various Canadian governments to promote Canadian cultural production. Sharing a large border and (for the majority) a common language with the United States, Canada faces a difficult position in regard to American culture, be it direct attempts at the Canadian market or the general diffusion <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> in the globalized media arena. While Canada tries to maintain its cultural differences, it also must balance this with responsibility in trade arrangements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E
25|$|During this period, Richard Henry Pratt, a Civil War veteran, {{supervised}} the prisoners and upgraded {{the conditions for}} them.

Pratt recruited volunteers to teach the Indian prisoners English, the Christian religion, and elements <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>culture.</b> He and most US officials believed that such assimilation was needed for the Indians' survival in the changing society.|$|E
