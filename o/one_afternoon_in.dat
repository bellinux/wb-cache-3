5|$|Norman Stewart Mitchell-Innes {{was born}} in Calcutta on 7 September 1914, where {{his father was a}} {{businessman}} of Scottish descent. Both his father, also named Norman, and his grandfather, Gilbert, were keen golfers. The former was the All India Amateur Golf Champion in 1893 and 1894, while the latter captained Prestwick Golf Club. He moved to England with his family at the age of five to live in Minehead, Somerset, and gained a scholarship to Sedbergh School based in Cumbria. At Sedbergh he developed quickly as a cricketer, first playing for the school's first team aged 15. The subsequent year, he scored 302 not out in a house match in <b>one</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>In</b> the summer of 1931, after scoring two half-centuries for Sedbergh against Durham School and Stonyhurst College, Mitchell-Innes was called up to play for Somerset County Cricket Club in a County Championship match against Warwickshire. He had to travel down from Scotland by overnight train for the fixture at the County Ground, Taunton. He took two wickets, and scored 23 runs in the match, which was drawn.|$|E
25|$|Around the World in Eighty Days {{was written}} during {{difficult}} times, both for France and for Verne. It {{was during the}} Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) in which Verne was conscripted as a coastguard; he was having financial difficulties (his previous works were not paid royalties); his father had died recently; and he had witnessed a public execution, which had disturbed him. Despite all this, Verne was excited about {{his work on the}} new book, the idea of which came to him <b>one</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> a Paris café while reading a newspaper.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of his co-authored {{adaptation}} of The Deemster for the stage, under the title Ben-my-Chree, Caine set about adapting The Bondman into a play. However, his initial stage version of the story was intimidating for producers as it required a large cast and very difficult sets. Wilson Barrett had received permission to produce the play in 1890, but he could not raise the large funds that the production required. The first performance of this version of the play was given in a copyright performance in Bolton <b>one</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> November 1892, without scenery and with the cast reading their lines.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, Hecht inaugurated a Daily News column called, One Thousand and <b>One</b> <b>Afternoons</b> <b>in</b> Chicago. While it lasted, {{the column}} was {{enormously}} influential. His editor, Henry Justin Smith, later said it represented {{a new concept}} in journalism: ...|$|R

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> June, Bucey was {{returning}} from Tête Jaune Cache {{and had just}} passed the Grand Canyon when he spotted a white flag on the river bank. This {{was a sign that}} someone needed the sternwheeler to stop, either to take on cargo or passengers. The passengers turned out to be twenty burly railworkers with their paychecks in their pockets, all of whom {{were on their way to}} Fort George. In particular, South Fort George, where there was a licensed hotel, and a variety of other entertainments, where one could celebrate the end of another work week. However, when the purser approached the first of these men for his fare, the man obstinately refused to pay, even after the purser offered to cash his company paycheck. Fearing that if he let one get away without paying that none would pay, the purser went up to the pilot house and spoke to Captain Bucey.|$|E
25|$|The 1873, rubblestone built, stone dressed, Grade II listed {{building}} in its listed {{park in the}} far south known as Heathersett, Littleworth {{has been attributed to}} R. Norman, architect. The listed park is due to its later designer, Gertrude Jekyll. James Mangles, who lived at Valewood, Haslemere, was one of the earliest rhododendron collectors and hybridisers. When James died in 1884, most of his plant collection was brought to Littleworth Cross and Harry continued hybridising and exhibiting rhododendrons, {{with the help of his}} sister Clara. Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932), who lived nearby at Munstead, knew the Mangles family and was visiting <b>one</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> May 1889 when she was introduced to a young architect, Edwin Lutyens (1869–1944) who was designing a gardener's cottage and some garden buildings for Harry Mangles. The meeting was important for both Lutyens and Jekyll: she discovered someone with a similar love of the vernacular architecture of south-west Surrey, who would design her new home, Munstead Wood (qv), and through her, he was introduced to many potential clients. Lutyens and Jekyll began a collaboration of building and garden design that would last until her death in 1932.|$|E
500|$|Before {{recording}} the album, Waits {{became friends with}} his designated producer Jerry Yester and <b>one</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> early 1972 recorded a pre-production tape in Yester's residence. The instrumentation, recording arrangements, and musicians were also discussed during this session with Waits making it [...] "absolutely clear he wanted a standup bass player." [...] Drummer John Seiter, guitarist Peter Klimes, trumpeter Tony Terran and additional guitarist Shep Cooke were recruited through Yester and through Seiter, jazz bassist Bill Plummer was hired.|$|E

500|$|The {{hospital}} Sarah {{was held}} was filmed {{at a new}} private hospital in Hammersmith that was closed down at the time. A Radisson Edwardian Hotel in the London Docklands served as the filming location for the Summit Hotel; {{the management of the}} hotel were cooperative and allowed the filming crew access to several rooms and facilities. The scene where Ruth meets Heng was filmed at Dollis Hill; it was the last scene of the episode to be shot, and was completed in <b>one</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>In</b> the fight scene between Ros and Sarah at Lindemann's office, Hermione Norris played herself, and a stunt double stood in for Genevieve O'Reilly, because her character was getting [...] "thrown about a lot". The fight scene between Lucas and Sarah's assassin were performed by Armitage and stunt coordinator Crispin Layfield respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{grew up in}} Sydenham and, {{being the}} only girl on the street, played cricket in the street with the local boys. [...] She was unaware of women's cricket until she saw a game in {{progress}} <b>one</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> 1956. [...] Later that year, she made her first appearance in provincial cricket. [...] Her debut for Eastern province, coming {{at the age of}} 12, almost certainly makes her the youngest senior provincial player in South African history.|$|E
2500|$|After Charles Lindbergh's {{solo flight}} across the Atlantic in 1927, Amy Guest (1873–1959) {{expressed}} interest in being {{the first woman to}} fly (or be flown) across the Atlantic Ocean. After deciding that the trip was too perilous for her to undertake, she offered to sponsor the project, suggesting that they find [...] "another girl with the right image".

2500|$|Godfrey {{learned to}} fly in 1929 while working in {{broadcast}} radio in the Washington, D.C., area, starting with gliders, then learning to fly airplanes. He was badly injured {{on his way to}} a flying lesson <b>one</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> 1931 when an oncoming truck lost its left front wheel and hit him head on. [...] Godfrey spent months recuperating, and the injury would keep him from flying on active duty during World War II. He served as a reserve officer in the United States Navy in a public affairs role during the war.|$|E
2500|$|Remedios the Beauty is Arcadio and Santa Sofía's first child. It is {{said she}} is the most {{beautiful}} woman ever seen in Macondo, and unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her. She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally retarded. However, Colonel Aureliano Buendía believes she has inherited great lucidity: [...] "It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war", he said. [...] She rejects clothing and beauty. [...] Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends into the sky <b>one</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> the 4pm sun, while folding Fernanda's white sheet.|$|E
2500|$|Adeline Ravoux {{was asked}} sixty-six years later what she remembered of Van Gogh.

[...] After obtaining her parents permission, she sat <b>one</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> which he completed the painting. [...] He smoked continually on his pipe as he worked, and thanked her for sitting very still. [...] She was very proud to sit for the painting she described as a [...] "symphony in blue".

2500|$|Two {{tours of}} the USA {{followed}} in support of Kiln House, but the second, in early 1971, was blighted by Spencer's bizarre departure from the group, when he disappeared <b>one</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles, and was later discovered to have joined the religious cult the Children of God. After an uncomfortable time finishing the tour, during which Peter Green was asked {{to come back and}} help out, Californian Bob Welch was recruited to replace Spencer, without an audition as such, after a brief period getting to know the band. Welch's contrasting attitudes towards Kirwan, on the one hand their difficult personal relationship, and on the other, Welch's respect for Kirwan's musicianship, were a point of focus during the 18 months they were together in Fleetwood Mac. In 1999, Welch stated: [...] "He was a talented, gifted musician, almost equal to Pete Green in his beautiful guitar playing and faultless string bends." [...] In a later interview, Welch said: [...] "Danny wasn't a very lighthearted person, to say the least. He probably shouldn't have been drinking as much as he did, even at his young age... He was always very intense about his work, as I was, but he didn't seem to ever be able to distance himself from it... and laugh about it. Danny was the definition of 'deadly serious'." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>One</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> August 1913, Captain Bucey was {{attempting}} to run the BC Express through the Grand Canyon {{when he realized that}} the current was particularly strong in the whirlpool. Bucey decided that it would be necessary to line the sternwheeler through the canyon, and was pulling over to the side when a [...] spruce tree, complete with root structure, appeared {{on the surface of the}} whirlpool and swept under the BC Express, jamming against her three main rudders. Though Bucey had lost his main method of steering, he was still able to use the steamer's paddlewheel to maneuver backwards through the canyon, where he would eventually come to a place along the shore where he could tie up and his crew could disembark and remove the tree and check for damages. Most of his passengers, knowing Bucey's skillful reputation, were untroubled by the BC Express's plight, but one man panicked and raced across the bow and leapt onto the canyon wall, where he was left clinging 6 feet above the whirlpool. Unable to do anything for the passenger, Bucey had to continue downstream, where half an hour later he was able to tie up. After landing, Bucey's first thought was for his stranded passenger, and he sent out a rescue party of three men, led by AK Bouchier, the BC Express Company's agent at Tête Jaune Cache. The men walked back up the canyon and were relieved and astonished to find the man still clinging to the canyon wall, 70 feet below them. One of the rescuers was lowered down with a rope, and the passenger was hauled up to safety. The first thing the rescued man did was check his pockets for two small leather bags he was carrying, both full of diamond rings that he peddled along the new rail towns to brothels and private buyers. Once assured that his precious diamonds were safe, he was taken back to his berth on the BC Express and given a stiff scotch.|$|E
