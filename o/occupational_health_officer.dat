40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{continuing}} {{uncertainty about}} the silica-systemic sclerosis relationship led to the investigation of {{its role as a}} disease determinant in a large population-based study of systemic sclerosis. AIMS: To compare the frequency, socioeconomic and educational status, age-specific prevalence and duration of occupational silica exposure in males with and without systemic sclerosis. To assess the temporal relationship between exposure and disease onset. To estimate disease latency. To compare disease characteristics between silica-exposed and non-silica-exposed male cases. METHODS: The study was case-control in design. The exposure variable was occupational silica exposure as assessed by an <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> <b>officer</b> blinded to case/control status and the outcome variable was systemic sclerosis. The employed instrument comprised either a standardised telephone questionnaire (interviewed cases and controls) or medical records (deceased or living-status-unknown cases).

To assess the impact and the effects of the campaign, a panel study was carried out among those employees who actually handle carcinogenic substances. A random sample of this target group (N = 548) was interviewed by telephone a short while {{before the start of the}} campaign (pretest) and then again three months after its inception (posttest). In addition, a similar sample from the target group (N = 550) was approached for a posttest only, to control for potential measurement effects.

By means of covariance and loglinear analysis an inventory was made of the resulting changes in knowledge, attitude, behavioural intentions and interpersonal communication concerning work involving carcinogens. It was found that people who had the opportunity to study the information ended up being more alive to the risks of working with carcinogenic substances and were better able to take preventive action. A further positive effect is that the campaign appears to have encouraged people to communicate on the subject with colleagues, with management and with others (including the <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> <b>officer)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Nurses' aides (assistant nurses), {{the main}} {{providers}} of practical patient care in many countries, are doing both emotional and heavy physical work, and {{are exposed to}} frequent social encounters in their job. There is scarce knowledge, though, of how working conditions are related to psychological distress in this occupational group. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify work factors that predict the level of psychological distress in nurses' aides. Methods The sample of this prospective study comprised 5076 Norwegian nurses' aides, not on leave when they completed a mailed questionnaire in 1999. Of these, 4076 (80. 3 %) completed a second questionnaire 15 months later. A wide spectrum of physical, psychological, social, and organisational work factors were measured at baseline. Psychological distress (anxiety and depression) was assessed at baseline and follow-up by the SCL- 5, a short version of Hopkins Symptom Checklist- 25. Results In a linear regression model of the level of psychological distress at follow-up, with baseline level of psychological distress, work factors, and background factors as independent variables, work factors explained 2 % and baseline psychological distress explained 34 % of the variance. Exposures to role conflicts, exposures to threats and violence, working in apartment units for the aged, and changes in the work situation between baseline and follow-up that were reported to result in less support and encouragement were positively associated with the level of psychological distress. Working in psychiatric departments, and changes in the work situation between baseline and follow-up that gave lower work pace were negatively associated with psychological distress. Conclusion The study suggests that work factors explain only a modest part of the psychological distress in nurses' aides. Exposures to role conflicts and threats and violence at work may contribute to psychological distress in nurses' aides. It is important that protective measures against violent patients are implemented, and that <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers</b> offer victims of violence appropriate support or therapy. It is also important that health service organisations focus on reducing role conflicts, and that leaders listen to and consider the views of the staff. </p...|$|R

This study utilized mixed methods of {{qualitative and quantitative}} research for the years 2010 and 2011. The qualitative study covered respondents in West, Central, and East Java Provinces to gather stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on the impact, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance, and barriers of <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> services for informal sectors in Indonesia. The quantitative portion measured the impact of <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> training for community <b>health</b> <b>officers</b> using Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) dimensions. West Java, as a province with a center for <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> referral services (Balai Kesehatan Kerja Masyarakat/BKKM), was compared to Central Java as a province without BKKM. The qualitative study showed that interventions improved knowledge of and engagement in <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> among workers and <b>health</b> <b>officers.</b> Among other improvements, <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> training resulted in some owners of food processing home industries switching from non-food to food-based coloring.

The BKKM played important roles in delivering <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> in West Java Province. The quantitative study showed the efficacy variable to have the lowest p-value (p: 3 ̆c. 0001).

The qualitative study confirmed that <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> interventions in Indonesia resulted in some positive impacts related to safe and healthy work-related behaviors. The quantitative study found that West Java, a province with BKKM, had a better RE-AIM score as compared to Central Java, a province without BKKM.

Acknowledgement is a protective factor when it is sufficiently provided. We carried out a study about <b>occupational</b> <b>health</b> in police <b>officers</b> with special emphasis on acknowledgment and reward. A questionnaire was sent to 1000 police officers and inspectors working for a cantonal administration in Switzerland. In total, 695 participants answered the questionnaire. We used the TST questionnaire (French version of the Langner's questionnaire on psychiatric symptoms) to identify cases characterized by potential mental health problems. Multiple choice items (5 modalities ranging from "not at all" to "tremendously") were used to measure acknowledgment. The score for psychiatric symptoms was high (TST score >or= 9) for 86 police officers and inspectors for whom health might be at risk. Compared with police officers having low or medium scores for psychiatric symptoms (TST score < 9), police officers with high TST scores {{were more likely to report}} the lack of support and attention from the supervisors (odds ratio [OR] 3. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 0 to 5. 1) and the lack of acknowledgment by the hierarchy (OR 3. 0, 95 % CI 1. 9 to 4. 8). They were also more likely to mention that judicial authorities have a low consideration for police officers (OR 2. 7, 95 % CI 1. 7 to 4. 3) and that the public in general have a low appreciation of police officers (OR 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 2 to 2. 9).
