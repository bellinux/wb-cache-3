40|$|We present {{observation}} of electroweak single top quark production using 3. 2 fb − 1 of {{data collected by}} the CDF experiment. Candidate events are selected for further classification by five parallel analysis techniques: <b>one</b> <b>using</b> a likelihood discriminant, <b>one</b> <b>using</b> a matrix-element discriminant, <b>one</b> <b>using</b> decision trees, <b>one</b> <b>using</b> a neural network, and <b>one</b> <b>using</b> a complementary dataset. The results of these analyses are combined {{in order to improve}} the expected sensitivity. The signicance of the observed data is 5. 0 standard deviations, and the expected sensitivity is in excess of 5. 9 standard deviations.

5|$|The ads {{were based}} on the film series and was {{basically}} an amalgamation of both directors visuals. For example, The Batmobile was the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> in Batman and Batman Returns, while the Batsuit was a combination of what was worn by Val Kilmer in Batman Forever and George Clooney in Batman & Robin. The commercials also featured the Danny Elfman Batman theme from Tim Burton's two films.|$|E
5|$|The voice used on WWV {{was that}} of Don Elliott Heald until August 13, 1991, when {{equipment}} changes required rerecording the announcer's voice. The <b>one</b> <b>used</b> at that time {{was that of}} KSFO morning host Lee Rodgers, but was soon switched to the voice of John Doyle.|$|E
5|$|A PC Engine port of Ninja Ryūkenden was {{produced}} in 1992, published by Hudson Soft and released only in Japan; it features more colorful and detailed graphics, along with difficulty and gameplay tweaks and a different soundtrack. This version also supports three different language settings with Japanese, English and Chinese as the available options. However, the English translation used in this version differs from the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> in the earlier NES version. To switch between the three settings, the player must press the Select + I + II buttons simultaneously at the title screen, which will change the text under the logo to the appropriate characters.|$|E

5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> in Haymarket Square.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Christian apostle and martyr Saint Andrew, {{the patron}} saint of Scotland, was crucified on an X-shaped cross. Use of the {{familiar}} iconography of his martyrdom, showing the apostle bound to an X-shaped cross, first appears in the Kingdom of Scotland in 1180 during the reign of William I. It was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century, including on <b>one</b> <b>used</b> by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286.|$|E
5|$|After filming ended, {{one of the}} {{original}} Minis was sold to Kariker Kars to be hired for various events, whereupon it was then temporarily displayed as a major attraction at the Rover Group's museum. In 1997, it was purchased by the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum and displayed for a while, later being sold on to a private buyer in the United States. One other is privately owned and nearing the end of a restoration in the south of England. A replica— the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> to promote the animated series— is on display at National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.|$|E

5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme similar to the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E
5|$|An unknown {{librettist}} retained four {{of these}} seven combined stanzas, using {{the first and the}} two last unchanged as customary, and expanding the third by adding text for a recitative. He paraphrased the other stanzas for two arias and another recitative. Bach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of trumpet, oboe, strings and continuo. The first movement is a chorale fantasia dominated by the trumpet. In the unusual third movement, Bach has an alto and a tenor voice alternate for the recitative, while they sing the lines from the third hymn stanza in a duet. The fourth movement is a dramatic bass aria, accompanied by a restless continuo. Due to the compiled hymns, the melody of the closing two stanzas is different from the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> in movements 1 and 3.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E

50|$|This {{has proven}} to be a massive undertaking. As a {{consequence}} Chinese companies who offer shares for sale in the United States used to be required to prepare three sets of statements, <b>one</b> <b>using</b> Chinese accounting standards (China GAAP), <b>one</b> <b>using</b> international standards (IFRS), and <b>one</b> <b>using</b> North American GAAP standards (US GAAP).

5|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the {{electrical}} units in terms of length, mass, and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether <b>one</b> <b>used</b> the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only <b>one</b> <b>used</b> in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} favoring the law firm's position. The case dealt {{with the concept of}} an advance payment retainer, a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets {{as soon as it was}} paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as <b>one</b> <b>used</b> in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|E

5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts recovered from the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> to send a distress signal to Rhode Island and the last thing to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977. A gold wedding band was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitors crew members found in the turret.|$|E
5|$|Crew-only or cargo-only supply {{missions}} {{would have}} been launched aboard a Titan II, and the Saturn I or Saturn IB {{would have been}} used for the combined crew and cargo spacecraft. Because of the increased power of the Saturn I, the Gemini spacecraft's ejection seats {{would not have been able}} to propel the crew far enough in the event of an explosion, so a launch escape tower was proposed, based on the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> on the Mercury spacecraft. The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Early {{polls showed}} that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival Anne Northup in that area. Early in the campaign, Beshear {{attempted}} to set himself {{apart from the}} other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in new revenue without the need to raise taxes. Observers noted that this strategy was remarkably similar to the <b>one</b> <b>used</b> by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a state lottery would generate. Initially, all of the Democratic candidates except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was staking too much of his platform on a proposal that was not guaranteed to pass.|$|E
