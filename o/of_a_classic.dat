5|$|A Ghost Story for Christmas is {{a strand}} of annual British short {{television}} films originally broadcast on BBC One between 1971 and 1978, and revived in 2005 on BBC Four. With one exception, the original instalments were directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and the films were all shot on 16mm colour film. The remit behind the series {{was to provide a}} television adaptation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> ghost story, in line with the oral tradition of telling supernatural tales at Christmas.|$|E

5|$|A remaster of the game, also titled Perfect Dark, was {{released}} in 2010 for the Xbox 360 through its Xbox Live Arcade download service, featuring enhanced graphics and an online multiplayer. The remaster was developed by 4J Studios, the same studio that previously handled the Xbox 360 ports of Rare's platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie. The game received generally favorable reviews from gaming publications. Some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be outdated, but most agreed that the title was a solid revival <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic.</b> In 2015, the remaster {{was included in the}} Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic.</b> The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the monuments}} at Takalik Abaj {{are not in}} their {{original}} positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons.

5|$|Perfect Dark was {{developed}} over {{a course of}} nearly a year and its game engine was completely re-written from scratch to support several Xbox 360 features. Therefore, although the game plays {{exactly the same as}} the original, the code and renderer is different. The game received generally favorable reviews. Some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be outdated, but most agreed that the title was a solid revival <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic.</b> As of the end of 2011, the game had sold nearly 410,000 units. In 2015, the game was included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury is {{well known}} in culinary circles for being the namesake <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> English dessert. Shrewsbury cakes (or biscuits) are {{typically}} crisp and brittle creations that may incorporate fruit. They can be small in size for serving several at a time, or large for serving as a dessert in their own right. Traditionally Shrewsbury cakes have a distinct hint of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Another {{adaptation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> European theatrical work followed almost immediately, {{with production}} of The Lower Depths, {{based on a}} play by Maxim Gorky, taking place in May and June 1957. In contrast to the Shakespearean sweep of Throne of Blood, The Lower Depths was shot on only two confined sets, in order to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters' lives. Though faithful to the play, this adaptation of Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case, the late Edo period—unlike his earlier The Idiot, was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response {{similar to that of}} Throne of Blood. However, some critics rank it among the director's most underrated works.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, DC {{launched}} its The New 52 program, which introduced {{a number of}} new titles. In addition to a new Batwoman series, DC released Voodoo, which featured an African American bisexual woman as the title character. Additionally, The New 52 also introduced Bunker, the first openly-gay superhero ever to be featured in the Teen Titans ongoing series. Another of the changes brought about with the DC reboot was the reinvention <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> character as an out gay man, with DC as of 2012 depicting its longtime Green Lantern Alan Scott as a gay man in stories set on the parallel world of Earth-2.|$|E
5|$|In July 1996, Firaxis {{began work}} on Alpha Centauri, with Reynolds heading the project. Meier and Reynolds wrote playable {{prototype}} code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development libraries. Because the development of Gettysburg took up most of Firaxis' time, the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas. By late 1996, the developers were playing games on the prototype, and {{by the middle of}} the next year, they were working on a multiplayer engine. Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games, an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single-player mode because they believed that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way. Reynolds felt that smart computer opponents are an integral part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> computer game, and considered it a challenge to make them so. Reynolds' previous games omitted internet support because he believed that complex turn-based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online.|$|E
