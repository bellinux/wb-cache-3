40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper was to explore {{the extent to which}} strategic intelligence is utilised within the South African long-term insurance industry and whether it could be used to identify opportunities or threats within the global environment to remain competitive, create greater innovation, and corporate advantage. The paper obtained the qualitative views and opinions of strategic decision makers, <b>on</b> <b>an</b> executive <b>managerial</b> <b>level</b> within the South African long-term insurance industry, on their organisations use of strategic intelligence. It was found that there are marked differences in the conformity and usage of strategic intelligence and its components between the organisations surveyed, with a measurable difference between large and small organisations. It is, however, generally viewed that the use of a strategic intelligence framework could greatly enhance decision-making. Data collection for the research undertaken was limited to the 82 long-term insurance companies, which were registered with the South African Financial Services Board. More specifically the focus was on the organisations listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange within the Life Assurance sector, within which a final response rate of 36. 1 % was achieved, including the 100 % response rate from the six listed organisations. By understanding the extent to which strategic intelligence is utilised in the South African longterminsurance industry, and the benefits or problems that are experienced by implementing and using strategic intelligence as an input to the strategic management process we can comprehend the value that strategic intelligence adds in the decision making process. The originality of this work concludes in the identification and utilisation of the most important factors of a strategic intelligence framework that will greatly enhance global corporate decisionmakingand result in competitive advantage and constant innovation within the South African business environment.

40|$|Purpose – The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to test the {{controlled}} experiment (A/B split) methodology in B 2 C oriented e-mail marketing campaigns. Design/Methodology/Approach – E-mail marketing techniques have been a substantial part of e-marketing methodology since the early Internet days of the mid- 1990 s. From the very beginning of Internet utilization for business purposes, e-mail was one of the most widely used communication techniques in B 2 B and B 2 C markets alike. Due to high volumes of spamming and progression of online communication clutter, some practitioners began to question the usability of e-mail as a marketing communication channel, while others embarked on working on improving the message itself. Efforts were invested into improving message quality, as well as into better understanding user expectations. One of the most commonly used techniques to test specific e-mail message elements is the controlled experiment. Findings and implications – This paper explores several types of controlled experiments in a specific Croatian B 2 C market. Tests were run to determine subscriber behavior towards several newsletter components, including sending time, sending day, sender’s name, and subject line. Open and click rates for tested campaigns, and several other metrics were investigated using MailChimp software. An N − 1 two-proportion test using an adjusted Wald confidence interval around the difference in the proportions was used for comparing the open-rate measure in the controlled experiments between subjects. Limitation – Controlled experiments (A/B split tests) showed a lot of potential as a way of measuring behavior and preferences of subscribers, although several apparent limitations (the data-set scope, comparability issues) indicated a clear need for standardization <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>managerial</b> and scientific <b>level.</b> Originality – This paper provides an up-to-date e-mail marketing effectiveness literature review, describes and tests the methodology and metrics for e-mail campaigns measurement, and suggests several important guidelines for further research...|$|R

40|$|Third party {{logistics}} is {{a concept}} that is widely accepted as an alternative to vertical integration. The degree to which it is applied in practice varies considerably. The focus of this research is the role of TPLPs in existing logistics systems, and how they themselves can influence this. This is influenced by the strategic position with which a TPLP is trusted by a shipper, and to some extent by a TPLP's competence and entrepreneurial behaviour towards logistics management. Logistics competence is sourced externally up to the level at which a shipper recognises this to be advantageous. TPL involvement might be influenced by TPLPs' initiatives towards innovative ideas in logistics management. The objectives of this research were to explore different roles that TPLPs can assume in the management of their clients' logistics systems, and the impact of their contribution on logistics performance. This research aims therefore to provide further and better understanding of third party logistics, and to develop a general framework for evaluating the effects of the logistics competence and entrepreneurial behaviour (with regards to their clients' logistics requirements) of TPLPs on logistics outsourcing, and thus the strategic role assumed by TPLPs.

40|$|In {{times of}} dynamic markets, radical {{technological}} breakthroughs and rapidly changing customer demands, strategic flexibility and quick adaptations to market conditions are {{crucial for the}} economic success of an organization. However, due to inertial forces, some firms do not succeed in renewing their strategies, even if business charts expose urgent need for action. To date, these phenomena of organizational inertia {{have been the subject}} of much research. In the tradition of evolutionary economics, the concept of structural inertia exposes various internal (e. g. sunk costs) and external (e. g. social legitimacy) factors that might be causal for organizational rigidity. Further, the popular notion of capabilities analyzes how organizational routines and core competences inhibit an organization from deviating from its established trajectory of assets. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> cognitive <b>level,</b> <b>managerial</b> cognitions in terms of shared mental models and selective perceptions are seen as causal for one-sided decision making leading to organizational rigidity. Without doubt, all these concepts contribute to explain widespread inertia within organizations and reveal which factors may increase the likelihood of an organization to become inert. However, research to date has not fully revealed how the process leading to inertia emerges. It is about this gap that the theory of path dependence comes to the fore. By conducting a dynamic perspective, path dependence theory explains by what intermediate steps and due to which mechanisms inertia emerges. Since the theory of path dependence originally bases on technological innovations and standard settings, little research has yet been done in applying path dependent processes to an organizational context. Hence, the goal of this dissertation thesis is to explain strategic rigidity in an organization from a path dependence perspective. As the central research question it is analyzed why <b>an</b> organization holds <b>on</b> to its strategies despite declining businesses and dynamic market conditions. This question is answered by conducting a critical in-depth case study of an organization whose strategic development is constrained by strong inertial forces. Specifically, the strategic alignment of the German Bertelsmann book club, which is presumed to be path dependent, is analyzed retrospectively from 1950 to 2007. Results reveal that despite of market dynamics and declining businesses the basic strategic columns of the book club have not been changed within the stream of time. However, many attempts to correspond to changing customer demands and market conditions have been accomplished but none of them resulted in sustainable strategic deviations. The empirical findings of a detailed path-analysis shed light on the reasons for the strategic rigidity of the book club. Historical strategic decisions triggered self-reinforcing mechanisms (economies of scale, complementary, and learning effects), finally leading to a strategic lock-in due to path dependency...|$|R

30|$|Another {{surprising}} {{finding is}} the lack of a moderating role that managerial ethics has between social and technical quality management practices with innovation. This finding contradicts previous research in ethics theory which suggests the importance of ethical evaluation in decision making and behavior ([59 - 62];). Perhaps the reasoning behind this finding lies in the definition of social and technical quality management practices. Quality management is fundamental not only <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>level,</b> but also among lower level employees. Employees at all levels must work together with teams to establish long-term relationships with suppliers. A manager’s ethical stance about quality management may have little or no impact on the actual relationship between social and technical quality management practices of lower level employees and firm innovation. On the other hand a manager that is highly motivated to implement quality management practices (via a high moral stance toward high quality) may actually limit an employee’s ability to work with teams {{to find new ways to}} innovate because of a need to exercise control. Social quality management unlike technical quality management focuses on employee empowerment which enhances innovation. However, when management controls the actions of employees, employee empowerment is hindered, hindering teamwork and thereby innovation. Future research should further explore this surprising finding. Perhaps surveying all levels of employees would be an interesting undertaking.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the field of}} strategy-as-practice by developing understanding of the enacted performance of power within strategic interactions, an area that is underdeveloped. This is addressed by voicing the silences within the field of strategy-as-practice using an organisational studies lens. The study investigates the macro-influences of power, gender, body, culture, and Westernisation on micro-strategising activities and is based on an empirical cross-cultural study of a Saudi Arabian business college. The strategy-as-practice approach faces the challenge of balancing a focus on the specified actions of individuals and remaining aware of the social influences that govern them. This study complements linguistic approaches to understanding strategy with an embodied socially enacted dramaturgical approach to strategy analysis. Dramaturgy is the theoretical and methodological framework used to focus on micro-face-to-face interactions of strategists, complemented by frame analysis which enables invistigation of macro-level aspects of analysis at the meso-organisational level. The analysis focuses on two main areas: first it explores the embodied gendered aspects of strategising, which have previously been marginalised within the field. This analysis shows how the doing and undoing of gender <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>level</b> in mixed-gender strategic interactions reflects the values that govern the family context, maintaining traditional values and often constraining women from assuming active roles as participants in strategising. Second, it analyses the tensions that arise between the clash of modernity and tradition by the adoption of international/Western management practices. These institutional influences create conflicts within strategists’ scripts when tradition encounters modernity in confronting a significant aspect of the Arab struggle. This analysis focuses on the importance of adopting a multi-level of analysis that aknowledges both structure and agency within strategising contexts. It also considers the importance of adopting a different type of ethics that is more sensitive to the particularities of caring for the ‘other’.

This will be studied by using models intended for private organizations that hold relevance for public organizations. - What parts of the process {{can be described as}} emergent, deliberate, intended, realized and unrealized? - What influenced the reorganization process? - In this process, how does Mälardalen University use the concept of strategy? Purpose: The aim of this thesis is to explain a strategic organizational change process in a large organization. The choice fell on Mälardalen University due to its accessibility and significant size. By interpreting the empirical material, the underlying causes will be brought to the surface. The result will aim to explain how a change process might occur in a large organization and how internal and external influences were reflected in the strategic path. Method: The empirical data collected for this thesis was obtained through qualitative semi-structured interviews with organizational members <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>level.</b> One focal organization was used for a case study.

40|$|Firms {{increasingly}} {{adopt an}} open innovation {{model in which}} they rely on technology alliances to complement and supplement their internal innovation efforts. Although previous studies provide in-depth insight into the impact of technology alliances on the innovation performance, they remain relatively silent on how technology alliances eventually influence the financial performance of the firm. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop and test a conceptual framework that disentangles both the value-enhancing and cost-increasing effects of technology alliances on financial performance. The model was tested with a sample of 305 Belgian manufacturing firms. Combining data from the Belgian Community Information Survey (CIS IV) database and the BELFIRST database, structural equation analyses were conducted on the connection among technology alliance portfolio diversity, product innovation performance, and financial performance. This study's data provide empirical confirmation for the assumption of existing research that technology alliance portfolio diversity has an indirect positive impact on financial performance via increased product innovation performance. However, a direct cost-increasing effect of technology alliance portfolio diversity on financial performance is observed. Moreover, the structural equation analyses suggest that, in the short-term, the direct cost-increasing effect of technology alliance portfolio diversity exceeds the indirect value-generating effect of technology alliances. These findings contribute to the current research on open innovation in two important ways. First, these results support the open innovation model by illuminating the interconnectedness between internal and external innovation strategies. In particular, technology alliance portfolio diversity has a positive impact on internal innovation efforts, which increases product innovation performance. Second, the findings complement the focus of existing open innovation research on the value-generating properties of technology alliances, directing attention to the cost-increasing effects of such collaborative strategies. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>level,</b> these findings suggest that, when making technology alliance decisions, managers not only should consider the potential benefits of such collaborative strategies but also should take into account the additional costs of intensifying the technology alliance portfolio. ...|$|E

40|$|Technological {{resources}} {{in the form of}} patents, trade secrets, and know-how have become key assets for modern enterprises. This paper addresses a critical issue in technology and innovation management, namely, the commercial exploitation of technological resources resulting from research and development (R&D) investments. Extracting economic value from these resources by maximizing the benefits for shareholders is an extremely challenging task because technological resources are intangible, idiosyncratic, uncertain, predominantly tacit, and with poorly defined property rights. In their attempt to extract the maximum value from their technological resources, firms increasingly combine their internal exploitation through new product development (NPD) with external exploitation through licensing. However, most existing studies on NPD and technology licensing have treated the two exploitation paths independently and in isolation, which has resulted in two separate research streams using different theories and addressing different managerial challenges. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to contribute to filling this gap by developing and testing a comprehensive conceptual framework that simultaneously considers the antecedents affecting the successful implementation of NPD and licensing strategies as well as their consequences on firm profitability. The paper in particular investigates the effects of the interplay between technological resources and three types of complementary resources, marketing, manufacturing, and relational. We test the model using structural equation modeling on a sample of 733 Spanish manufacturing firms observed from 2003 to 2007. The data provide support for the existence of different paths to market firm technologies: an internal path, whereby the ownership of technological resources fully explains NPD performance, and an external path, whereby high intensity of marketing and relational resources reinforces the positive effect of technological resources on licensing performance. This sustains the relevance of the resource-based value-enhancing effects of complementary {{resources in}} licensing, as opposed to the motivation-reducing effects advanced by transaction cost-based literature. Moreover, the empirical analysis shows a substitution effect between NPD and licensing, whereby their simultaneous pursuit at intense levels is associated with lower profit margins. This provides evidence of the much theorized, but seldom tested, rent dissipation effect. These findings offer several contributions to research on licensing, NPD, open innovation, and the resource-based view of the firm. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>level,</b> they suggest that achieving maximum value from proprietary technologies may not entail exploiting them both through external and internal paths.

40|$|The {{cosmetic}} surgery industry {{has seen a}} substantial increase in demand in recent years. It is clear, that professional services, such as health care, elicit unique consumer behaviour and decision-making strategies. Past research has shown that factors such as body-image dissatisfaction, aging anxiety and appearance investment, among others, explain interest and likelihood of pursuing {{cosmetic surgery}}. Additionally, past research has identified characteristics that influence consumers’ selection of a health care service provider. However, these types of investigations, while closely involved with the phenomenon of interest, do not tell us anything about the reasons why a potential consumer in the target segment would not want to purchase cosmetic surgery services in general. This is a glaring research-gap. Thus, the purpose of this thesis is to uncover how and why consumers make decisions about utilizing cosmetic surgery services. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>level,</b> the research aims to identify reasons why potential target consumers do not wish to utilize cosmetic surgery. The following research questions are proposed: RQ 1 : What {{is the nature of the}} consumer decision-making process when purchasing cosmetic surgery services? RQ 2 : What beliefs do consumers associate with utilizing cosmetic surgery services? RQ 3 : How do these beliefs translate into possible barriers for purchase? The reasoned action approach states that the key to understanding any behaviour lies in the behavioural, normative and control beliefs related to that specific behaviour. A qualitative approach to the research problem was chosen. A group of four potential consumers of cosmetic surgery, four existing consumers of cosmetic surgery and two industry professionals, were interviewed using semi-structured interviews and an elicitation process in order to uncover the nature of the decision-making process, identify beliefs related to utilizing cosmetic surgery and resolve how they translate into perceived barriers to action. Results suggest that when purchasing cosmetic surgery, consumers’ decision-making processes may differ among individuals. Some support as well as slight opposition was found for previous research on the topic, further implying that decision-making processes can vary between individual professional services. The research uncovered 7 behavioural beliefs, 7 normative beliefs and 3 control beliefs influencing behaviour. Lack of money and time were most clearly identified as direct barriers to action, but additionally fear or pain or harm, service failure, addiction and social rejection were identified as indirect barriers. Respondents indicated fairly strong underlying fears of social judgement, which discontents trends indicating the softening of general attitudes towards the industry...|$|E
40|$|Organizational growth poses new {{challenges}} for top management. In small organizations, coordination and communication is spontaneous and require little structure to be efficient. However, as the organization grows, the {{increased number of}} individuals requires a larger amount of coordination and communication. In this study, our purpose is to increase understanding of why growing companies are experiencing challenges with coordination {{as well as to}} increase organizational control. To fulfill this, we study one organization in particular. In order to find a sustainable solution, we investigate why these challenges are experienced. We argue that addressing the underlying causes for experiencing these challenges is the most effective solution in the way that it ensures that the same challenges do not recur. Therefore, the relationship between the challenges that are articulated by the organization and the underlying causes for the challenges is central to our study. Our study shows that our object of study would benefit from an increased internal focus to enable for long-term growth. This finding supports several existing models for organizational growth. Our object of study currently employs few systematized internal processes and is in need of further systematization with regards to several aspects, such as strategy development and implementation and organizational control. Our study further shows that a lack of systematization <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>level</b> leads to ambiguities that are translated to the operational level. This explains the discrepancies between the challenges that are expressed by the organization and their underlying causes. Organisatorisk tillväxt innebär nya utmaningar för företagsledningen. I små organisationer sker koordination och kommunikation spontant och kräver inte särskilt mycket struktur för att vara effektiv. När organisationen växer, gör emellertid det ökade antalet individer så att mer koordination och kommunikation behövs. Vårt syfte med denna studie är att öka förståelse för varför växande företag upplever utmaningar med koordination samt att öka organisatorisk kontroll. För att uppnå detta studerar vi en specifik organisation. För att hitta en hållbar lösning, så undersöker vi varför dessa utmaningar upplevs. Vi menar att detta är den mest effektiva lösningen på så sätt att man genom att adressera de underliggande orsakerna till att utmaningarna upplevs kan säkerställa att samma utmaningar inte återuppstår vid ett senare tillfälle. Således blir kopplingen mellan de utmaningar som artikuleras av organisationen och dess underliggande orsaker en central del i vår studie. Vår studie visar på att vårt fallföretag skulle gynnas av ett ökat internt fokus. Detta ökade interna fokus skulle möjliggöra för långsiktig tillväxt. Denna upptäckt stödjer flertalet befintliga modeller för organisatorisk tillväxt. Vårt fallföretag har i nuläget få systematiserade interna processer och är i behov av ökad systematisering utav flera aspekter, bland annat strategiarbete och organisatorisk kontroll. Vår studie visar även att en bristande systematisering på ledningsnivå leder till tvetydigheter som fortplantar sig till den operationella nivån. Detta förklarar diskrepansen mellan de utmaningar som artikuleras av organisationen och dess underliggande orsaker...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} gender differences at <b>managerial</b> and non-managerial <b>level</b> in perceived stress and control and the relationship to health problems. Questionnaires were collected from 281 women and men at both <b>managerial</b> and non-managerial <b>level</b> in a sales department in a large Swedish telecom company. The results showed only minor differences in perceived stress and no differences in perceived control when comparing men and women working at the same level in the organization. Instead the differences in perceived stress and control were found between managers and non-managers. In addition, the study showed both differences and similarities in explaining health symptoms for women and men at the same organizational level. Similarities were found at a non-managerial <b>level</b> but at <b>a</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>level</b> health problems were not predicted by the same factors for women and men.
