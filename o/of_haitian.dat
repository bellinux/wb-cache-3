5|$|The division's {{mission was}} to create a secure and stable {{environment}} so the government <b>of</b> <b>Haitian</b> President Jean-Bertrand Aristide could be reestablished and democratic elections held.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the racialization {{of the immigrant}} Other in the American media by exploring the images <b>of</b> <b>Haitians</b> deployed in three different newspapers—Miami Herald, Miami Times, and Haiti-Observateur—that are directed to racially/ethnically distinct readers. I examine {{the positive and negative}} images <b>of</b> <b>Haitians</b> in these papers and trace their development over time. Specifically, I examine the reportage <b>of</b> <b>Haitians</b> over three events: the boatlift crisis of 1979, the AIDS epidemic crisis of 1983, and the earthquake of 2010. This study asks, is there an existing hegemonic view <b>of</b> <b>Haitians</b> in which race is a primary signifier in the American media? My study applies the concept of controlling images, the idea that racialized images are commonly deployed in the American media, to shed light on the production and reproduction <b>of</b> racism toward <b>Haitians.</b> This dissertation therefore sets out to investigate the presence, absence, and degree of racialized illustrations <b>of</b> <b>Haitians</b> among three newspapers in a city where many Haitian immigrants reside. My analysis reveals that before the 2010 earthquake, the controlling images <b>of</b> <b>Haitians</b> changed from negative to positive. Furthermore, the newspapers constructed and modified the controlling images according to racialized and political journalistic practices, especially after the earthquake because of social media. During the 1979 boatlift crisis and the 1983 AIDS epidemic, the mainstream newspaper, the Herald, offered more negative images <b>of</b> <b>Haitians</b> than the black newspaper, the Times, and the Haitian newspaper, Observateur. However, the Observateur mostly operated outside the racial framework of the American newspapers during these periods preceding the earthquake. After the 2010 earthquake, in an era of social media, the Herald changed its images <b>of</b> <b>Haitians.</b> The mainstream newspaper offered more positive images of this group than the other newspapers. During this time, the black newspaper reflected a reduced interest in race in the coverage of the Haiti disaster when compared to coverage of earlier crises. The Haitian newspaper was more closely engaged with the earthquake disaster, more than its coverage of the previous crises, though less engaged than the American newspapers. ...|$|R

5|$|Upon {{the death}} of Carroll on July 26, 1977, Bishop Edward Anthony McCarthy was {{appointed}} as Miami's archbishop. McCarthy oversaw {{the construction of the}} Pastoral Center for the archdiocese and restructured most senior operational divisions. He established the Office of Lay Ecclesial Ministry, the Office of Evangelization and the Permanent Diaconate program. In 1980, he offered support and assistance during the Mariel Boat Lift. The following year, he supported the rights <b>of</b> <b>Haitian</b> immigrants who were detained under the Wet Foot, Dry Foot policy. Responding to the needs of this new immigration, he opened the Pierre Toussaint Haitian Catholic Center. McCarthy retired in 1994 at the required age of 75.|$|E

Dunham approaches Mulder, telling him that Wharton has begun abusing the refugees as a means of retaliation against Bauvais; Wharton denies the accusations, but later has Bauvais beaten to death.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 3 February 1812 was {{an unusual}} minor naval {{engagement}} off the western coast of Haiti between a British frigate and a frigate manned by a loose coalition <b>of</b> <b>Haitian</b> rebels. The battle was fought {{against the background of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the collapse of government in Haiti {{in the aftermath of the}} Haitian Revolution eight years earlier. After the French had been expelled from Haiti in 1804, the newly independent nation was first ruled by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who was murdered in 1806 and replaced by two of his advisors, Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion. These rulers divided the country between them and in the confused political situation that followed a number of minor fiefdoms appeared, including one led by Jérôme Maximilien Borgella in the south-west of the island called Sud. The small Haitian Navy defected to Borgella, who crewed the vessels with a collection of sailors from various countries, led by a notorious privateer named Gaspard.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion <b>of</b> <b>Haitian</b> voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} after the storm struck Guadeloupe, there was a food shortage. Officials quickly cleared roads and worked to restore the damaged banana crop. Charles de Gaulle visited the island, and the French {{population}} unified to provide assistance to the island. In late October 1966, the French government set up a relief fund for Guadeloupe totaling $34million (₣170million francs). The government initiated plans to rebuild the island to withstand the winds of strong hurricanes. The United States Agency for International Development flew 20,000pounds of blankets and clothing to the island. Due to the heavy damage in Hispaniola, VMM-365, a United States Marine Corps helicopter division, spent 454hours and flew 740sorties to provide 186,676tons of relief supplies to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The division also helped evacuate 142hospital patients. The Dominican Air Force also assisted in transporting injured people from outlying areas to Santo Domingo. The country deployed 5,000troops to send food, medicine, and clothing to the storm-damaged areas in the interior, as well as Barahona Peninsula. The Holy See sent $2,000 to assist the residents affected by the storm in Haiti. After a nearly ten year boycott due to the actions <b>of</b> <b>Haitian</b> president François Duvalier, the United States provided a $1.3million loan to the country to help rebuild infrastructure and provide education. Industrialist Clint Murchison gave $50,000 in flour and food from a mill he owned in the country. The United States also sent vaccines and 4,360pounds of food.|$|E
