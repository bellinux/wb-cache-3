25|$|Parabolic trough {{power plants}} use a curved, {{mirrored}} trough which reflects the {{direct solar radiation}} onto a glass tube containing a fluid (also called a receiver, absorber <b>or</b> <b>collector)</b> running {{the length of the}} trough, positioned at {{the focal point of the}} reflectors. The trough is parabolic along one axis and linear in the orthogonal axis. For change of the daily position of the sun perpendicular to the receiver, the trough tilts east to west so that the direct radiation remains focused on the receiver. However, seasonal changes in the angle of sunlight parallel to the trough does not require adjustment of the mirrors, since the light is simply concentrated elsewhere on the receiver. Thus the trough design does not require tracking on a second axis. The receiver may be enclosed in a glass vacuum chamber. The vacuum significantly reduces convective heat loss.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{many other}} Thanhouser productions, no {{details on the}} {{director}} or cast are cited by Q. David Bowers. Prompt Payment was likely shot at the Thanhouser Studio in New Rochelle, New York and Stealing a Ride was likely shot in the surrounding area. Identification of the cast for Prompt Payment may be possible due to a surviving film still {{that was used in}} a Thanhouser advertisement. Both films are listed as comedies, despite the more serious nature and dramatic element of two children being lost in the woods during the winter. A detail in a review from The New York Dramatic Mirror states that the children are tracked [...] "to shelter behind some rocks, where the boy had built a fire by which the little girl had gone to sleep. After reaching home each youngster was spanked, but the punishment was eased by hearty kisses." [...] The films are presumed lost because neither film is known to exist by any archive <b>or</b> <b>collector.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Parshvanath Charitable Trust (PCT) {{wanted to}} start, from the {{academic}} year 2014–15, a new engineering college named A. P. Shah Institute of Technology, affiliated to the University of Mumbai, on the same campus (on east side of Ghodbunder Road) where the Parshvanath College of Engineering once operated. To grant approval, the AICTE had sought, among other documents, a certificate in a particular format from the sub-divisional magistrate <b>or</b> <b>collector</b> or tehsildar. The format was the certification that [...] "the land and the building are fit {{to be used for}} running a technical institution". But the tehsildar's office claimed that the land stood in the name of M/s Key Tech. It also stated that it was not the competent authority to issue a certificate as prescribed by the AICTE as per the rules. Since PCT failed to submit the required certificate, its application was rejected by the AICTE. PCT then moved the Bombay High Court. The court ruled in PCT's favour, saying that since the trust was not at fault for not producing the certificate, the AICTE should process its application without it. The trust was then asked to submit an affidavit stating the conditions in the certificate.|$|E

60|$|It will {{be obvious}} that the {{interest}} of this speculation, at any rate, centres upon this great intermediate mass {{of people who are}} neither passively wealthy, the sleeping partners of change, nor helplessly thrust out of the process. Indeed, from our point of view--an inquiry into coming things--these non-effective masses would have but the slightest interest were it not for their enormous possibilities of reaction upon the really living portion of the social organism. This really living portion seems at first sight to be as deliquescent in its nature, to be drifting down to as chaotic a structure as either the non-functional owners that float above it or the unemployed who sink below. What were once the definite subdivisions of the middle class modify and lose their boundaries. The retail tradesman of the towns, for example--once a fairly homogeneous class throughout Europe--expands here into vast store companies, and dwindles there to be an agent <b>or</b> <b>collector,</b> seeks employment or topples outright into the abyss. But under a certain scrutiny one can detect here what we do not detect in our other two elements, and that is that, going on {{side by side with the}} processes of dissolution and frequently masked by these, there are other processes by which men, often of the most diverse parentage and antecedent traditions, are being segregated into a multitude of specific new groups which may presently develop very distinctive characters and ideals.|$|E
60|$|I. That {{a prince}} called Ahmed Khân {{was of a}} family amongst the most {{distinguished}} in Hindostan, and of a nation famous through that empire for its valor in acquiring, and its policy and prudence in well governing the territories it had acquired, called the Patans, or Afghans, of which the Rohillas were a branch. The said Ahmed Khân had fixed his residence {{in the city of}} Furruckabad, and in the first wars of this nation in India the said Ahmed Khân attached himself to the Company against Sujah Dowlah, then an enemy, now a dependant on that Company. Ahmed Khân, towards the close of his life, was dispossessed of a large part of his dominions by the prevalence of the Mahratta power; but his son, a minor, succeeded to his pretensions, and to the remainder of his dominions. The Mahrattas were expelled by Sujah ul Dowlah, the late Vizier, who, finding a want of the services of the son and successor of Ahmed Khân, called Muzuffer Jung, did not only guaranty him in the possession of what he then actually held, but engaged to restore all the other territories which had been occupied by the Mahrattas; and this was confirmed by repeated treaties and solemn oaths, by the late Vizier and by the present. But neither the late nor the present Vizier fulfilled their engagements, or observed their oaths: the former having withheld what he had stipulated to restore; and the latter not only subjecting him to a tribute, instead of restoring him to what his father had unjustly withheld, but having made a further invasion by depriving him of fifteen of his districts, levying the tribute of the whole on the little that remained, and putting the small remains of his territory under a sequestrator <b>or</b> <b>collector</b> appointed by Almas Ali Khân, who did grievously afflict and oppress the prince and territory aforesaid.|$|E
