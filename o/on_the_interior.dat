5|$|Canterbury Castle, {{also known}} as Arlington Castle, was a private house located in {{southwest}} Portland, Oregon and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Constructed during 1929–1931, the house was designed by Jeter O.

5|$|Catherine {{was buried}} {{according}} to her wishes, but her tombstone was moved from the floor to a wall of Ara Coeli during works <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> {{of the church in}} 1590. The original epitaph was destroyed at that time, but the Roman calligrapher Giovanni Battista Palatino had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later. It was uniquely bilingual and digraphic, written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic. Only the Latin epitaph was restored, and can be found on her tombstone today.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to protein- and solution-mediated processes, {{it is also}} possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> side. During programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.|$|E

5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{decoration}} of the elongated {{north and south}} walls includes brick blind arches in the bottom part and a large arch for each wall adjacent to the dome with a columned window in the middle. There are windows above the lower arches of {{the north and south}} facade. The dome, which also exhibits a large number of ornamental details and ceramics, features eight windows, one for each of its sides. The medieval frescoes which were painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> walls of the church have been only fragmentarily preserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{gymnasium}} has {{a capacity}} of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events that are taking place. At {{the time it was}} built, the gymnasium had the world's largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a heavy concrete support system which forms a distinct curve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.|$|E

5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{predominantly}} military character, {{the castle}} {{is one of}} the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess. The one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E

5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 1880 Wagner {{conducted}} a private {{performance of the}} prelude for his patron Ludwig II of Bavaria at the Court Theatre in Munich. The premiere of the entire work was given in the Festspielhaus at Bayreuth on 26 July 1882 under the baton of the Jewish-born German conductor Hermann Levi. Stage designs were by Max Brückner and Paul von Joukowsky who took their lead from Wagner himself. The Grail hall was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of Siena Cathedral which Wagner had visited in 1880, while Klingsor's magic garden was modelled on those at the Palazzo Rufolo in Ravello. In July and August 1882 sixteen performances of the work were given in Bayreuth conducted by Levi and Franz Fischer. The production boasted an orchestra of 107, a chorus of 135 and 23 soloists (with the main parts being double cast). At the last of these performances, Wagner took the baton from Levi and conducted the final scene of act 3 from the orchestral interlude to the end.|$|E

On the second floor, many of the larger rooms, which were used for coining and melting, contain ceilings with beautiful high arches supported by the walls and freestanding piers. The smaller rectangular rooms on the second level (and the basement), such as the former superintendent's office, also contain these arched ceilings with a single groin vault. The basement formerly contained the boilers inside a brick cage, but now contain museum exhibits devoted to the minting processes {{as well as the}} Coin Vault at the Mint, a coin shop.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} forming thin films of {{dielectric}} material which exhibit improved quality and piezoelectric response, which are formed in a DC magnetron reactive sputtering system. The dielectric material is deposited onto a substrate, and the deposition is interrupted before a highly insulating film is grown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chamber <b>interior.</b> Then, <b>the</b> reactive gas {{is removed from}} the chamber and replaced with an inert gas, and a layer of metal is deposited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chamber <b>interior.</b> This deposition of a metal layer conceals the highly insulating film <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chamber <b>interior</b> thereby improving <b>the</b> quality and piezoelectric response of the dielectric thin films. During the step of depositing a metal layer, the deposited substrate is shielded in order to prevent metal from being deposited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> substrate. Then, the deposition of dielectric material <b>on</b> <b>the</b> substrate and deposition of <b>the</b> metal layer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chamber <b>interior</b> is repeatedly alternated until a desired thickness of the dielectric thin film has been reached...|$|R
