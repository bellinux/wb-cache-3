5|$|A {{hurricane}} in {{the middle}} <b>of</b> <b>September</b> affected {{some of the same}} areas along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico as the August hurricane. It was first detected on the evening <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 10 in the southeastern Gulf, although its track may be far off from the actual storms movement {{due to a lack of}} available information. Its first data point in the hurricane database lists it as possessing sustained winds of , placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm followed a broad northward curve through the central Gulf of Mexico, making landfall along the Mississippi River Delta of Louisiana on the night <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 14. It continued toward the north-northeast, dissipating on September 16.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-level}} circulation {{formed from}} the frontal cloud band on September 26 about 460miles (740km) east of central Florida. Dean was first identified {{on the afternoon}} <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 26 as a subtropical storm. An Air Force reconnaissance flight was sent to Dean on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) from the center. A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. This data also showed that the storm was gaining tropical characteristics and was given the name Dean on the afternoon <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 27.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} a nearly steady course for three days, Hurricane Debbie turned northward and slowed as it neared {{a break in}} the ridge previously steering it west-northwestward. During the evening <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 11, a United States Navy Aircraft reconnaissance mission into the storm found sustained winds of 110 – 120 mph (175 – 195 km/h) and a central pressure of 976 mbar (hPa; 28.82 inHg), reaching its peak intensity as a modern-day Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). After maintaining its windspeeds for over 24 hours, the system weakened and turned sharply towards the east-northeast in response to the upper-level westerlies. By the afternoon <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 13, Debbie was again a Category 1 storm as it quickly accelerated towards the Azores. Early on September 15, the storm passed over the easternmost Azores with winds estimated at 80 mph (130 km/h) before turning more northeasterly. Once past the Azores, there is an uncertainty over the structural changes that took place with Debbie. According to the United States Weather Bureau's preliminary report, the system acquired characteristics of an extratropical cyclone on September 15, though remained a strong system. This conflicts with the best track supplied by the Bureau and the National Hurricane Center's hurricane database maintains the system as a tropical cyclone until the afternoon <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 16.|$|E
