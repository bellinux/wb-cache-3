40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{professional}} nurses', associate degree prepared nurses', licensed practical nurses', {{and nursing}} assistants' {{knowledge of the}} causes <b>of</b> multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> infections, the risks theses infections pose to health care providers, the chain of transmission of these infections, and patients' susceptibility to colonization <b>of</b> these multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> infections. METHODS: This descriptive {{study was conducted in}} a major general hospital in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The sample consisted of 42 nursing staff from a medical clinical unit. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and present the data. RESULTS: Nursing staff had unsatisfactory knowledge of the causes <b>of</b> multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> infections, the chain of transmission <b>of</b> multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> infections, and patients' susceptibility to colonization <b>of</b> multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> infections. However, the majority of participants had some knowledge about the risks that multi-resistant bacterial infections posed to health care providers.

5|$|Though {{similar in}} their {{formation}} process, oil shales differ from coals in several distinct ways.

The origin of some of the organic matter in oil shale is obscure {{because of the lack of}} recognizable biologic structures that would help identify the precursor organisms.

Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E

The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth <b>of</b> <b>bacterial</b> phototrophs.|$|E

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause <b>of</b> <b>bacterial</b> pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
