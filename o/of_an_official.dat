5|$|In 755, he {{received}} an appointment as Registrar of the Right Commandant's office of the Crown Prince's Palace. Although this was a minor post, in normal times {{it would have been}} at least the start <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> career. Even before he had begun work, however, the position was swept away by events.|$|E
5|$|A small {{model of}} this toy is {{exhibited}} in Tipu Sultan's wooden palace in Bangalore. Although other items associated with Tipu, including his sword, {{have recently been}} purchased and brought back to India by billionaire Vijay Mallya, Tipu's Tiger has not itself been the subject <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> repatriation request, presumably due to the ambiguity underlying Tipu's image {{in the eyes of}} Indians; his being an object of loathing in the eyes of some Indians while considered a hero by others.|$|E
5|$|After {{collapsing}} at a House of Lords dinner, Thatcher, having suffered low blood pressure, {{was admitted}} to St Thomas' Hospital in central London on 7 March 2008 for tests. In 2009 she was hospitalised again when she fell and broke her arm. Thatcher returned to 10 Downing Street in late November 2009 for the unveiling <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> portrait by artist Richard Stone, an unusual honour for a living ex-Prime Minister. Stone previously painted portraits of the Queen and the Queen Mother.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, {{timekeeping}} {{rules have}} {{changed with the}} implementation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system where the blowing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official's</b> whistle stops the clock at the instant of the whistle, along with a rule change where the on-court <b>official</b> (not <b>an</b> <b>official</b> at the scorer's table) starts the clock by pressing a button attached to the official's belt.|$|R
5|$|Although {{multiple}} {{funding sources}} were originally {{considered by the}} NEDA to fund the airport's construction, {{it was decided that}} the project should avail <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> development assistance facility offered by the Japanese government through the then-newly formed Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). After almost two years of negotiations, and after initially refusing to bankroll the project, the JBIC extended a 6.2 billion peso (US$152million) loan to the Philippine government in August 2000.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{are also used}} within China to write non-Han languages. The largest non-Han group in China, the Zhuang, have for over 1300 years used Chinese characters. Despite both the introduction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> alphabetic script in 1957 and lack of a corresponding official set of Chinese characters, more Zhuang people can read the Zhuang logograms than the alphabetic script.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson {{formed a}} {{committee}} to resolve the ongoing issue of the lack <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> Canadian flag, sparking a serious debate about a flag change to replace the Union Flag. Out of three choices, the maple leaf design by George Stanley, based on {{the flag of the}} Royal Military College of Canada, was selected. The flag made its first official appearance on February 15, 1965; the date is now celebrated annually as National Flag of Canada Day.|$|E
5|$|In October 1915 17th Brigade was {{exchanged}} with 71st Brigade of 24th Division, as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> {{policy of}} mixing Regular with New Army units. Immediately on joining 24th Division, the battalion {{was moved to}} 72nd Brigade within the same division. It was to remain part of this formation {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> student {{government}} {{during the first}} few decades at Georgia Tech, the ANAK society acted as an unofficial student government and proposed an Honor Code, modeled on that of West Point's, in 1908. ANAK worked to set up a more formal organization, the Student Council (later the Student Government Association), in 1922, at which point it relinquished any decision-making privileges it had over the student body.|$|E

5|$|No {{official}} languages {{were recorded}} in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, {{on the grounds that}} the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> language.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of the current state flag of West Virginia, the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite {{the adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> seal, the state did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{bas-relief}} inscriptions of Jewish {{religious symbols}} were allegedly chiseled away intentionally at some stage between 1987 and 1993. During the Battle of Gaza between the Palestinian organizations of Hamas and Fatah, the mosque's pro-Hamas imam Mohammed al-Rafati {{was shot dead}} by Fatah gunmen on June 12, 2007, {{in retaliation for the}} killing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> of Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard by Hamas earlier that day. The mosque is still active and serves as an emotional and physical support base for Gaza's residents and a focal point of Palestinian pride.|$|E

5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Emergency centers were prepped {{across the}} {{northern}} Cook Islands on February8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February9. Volunteers {{from the organization}} assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters. Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. The lack <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
5|$|English was the {{official}} language of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 due to opposition from First Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan {{to the use of}} the Malay language in Sarawak. In 1974 the new Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised Malay alongside English as an official language of Sarawak. This new status given to the Malay language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning curriculum to Malay. In 1985 English lost the status <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> language, leaving only Malay. Despite official policy, Sarawak opposition members argue that English remained the de facto official language of Sarawak. English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly. In 2015, Chief Minister Adenan Satem announced that English will be reinstated as an official language.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, {{the castle}} was leased for 22 years by Anthony and Bunty Kinsman, {{at a cost}} of £1,000. The {{property}} required extensive structural repairs and renovations in order to be made habitable, which the Kinsmans undertook over the next two years. The construction work cost £8,596, and some financial support was provided by the Ministry of Works in exchange for the castle being opened to the public for the next fifteen years. The new oak doors in the castle were fitted with iron hinges that had originally been used in nearby Lowther Castle. In 1967, the castle was visited by Princess Sharada Shah, the daughter of the King Mahendra of Nepal, as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> trip to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{and his son}} Diadumenianus were {{declared}} hostes, {{enemies of}} the state, by the Senate immediately after news had arrived of their deaths and as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> declaration {{of support for the}} usurper Elagabalus, who was recognized in the Senate as the new Emperor. The declaration of hostes led to two actions being taken against the images of the former Emperors. First, their portraits were destroyed and their names were stricken from inscriptions and papyrii. The second action, taken by the Roman soldiers who had rebelled against Macrinus in favour of Elagabalus, was to destroy all of the works and possessions of Macrinus. The damnatio memoriae against Macrinus is among the earliest of such sanctions enacted by the Senate. Many of the marble busts of Macrinus that exist were defaced and mutilated {{as a response to the}} damnatio memoriae and many of the coins depicting Macrinus and Diadumenianus were also destroyed. These actions against Macrinus are evidence of his unpopularity in Rome.|$|E
5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E
