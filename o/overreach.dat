The <b>Overreach</b> Committee (the organization {{in charge of}} Brock's clandestine agency) decides to terminate {{him because of his}} brutal methods. Brock cuts the bomb from his chest, and uses it to escape. His escape brings him into a confrontation with Spider-Man. After a fight with Spider-Man and an injection of dopamine blockers by Agent Smith, Brock is separated from the symbiote (which is apparently killed when Brock is re-arrested). The final issue sees Brock recover some memory of his history with Spider-Man; he had lost his knowledge of the hero's secret identity in the Spider-Man/Venom single issue (December 1997).|$|E

40|$|Beneficial {{interests}} under a trust {{were not}} intended to be overriding interests under section 70 (1) (g) of the Land Registration Act 1925. The position was altered by Williams & Glyn's Bank Ltd v Boland, which determined that an interest under a trust for sale would bind a purchaser if the beneficiary were in actual occupation. The decision raised the question whether such interests could be <b>overreached</b> once the beneficiary was in occupation of the trust property. City of London Building Society v Flegg held that the relevant beneficial interest had been <b>overreached.</b> Both decisions assume that <b>overreaching</b> in registered conveyancing takes effect as it does in unregistered land. Yet there is considerable evidence that the Land Registration Act contains its own <b>overreaching</b> machinery. The House of Lords applied the wrong <b>overreaching</b> provisions in Boland and Flegg and there is no legal basis on which to recognise that trust interests can override a subsequent disposition under section 70 (1) (g) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} {{evaluated}} {{the response of}} objective and subjective markers of <b>overreaching</b> to a highly demanding conditioning training mesocycle in elite tennis players to determine 1) whether players would become functionally or non-functionally <b>overreached,</b> and 2) to explore how coherently <b>overreaching</b> markers would respond. Performance, laboratory and cardiac autonomous activity markers were evaluated in three experienced male tennis professionals competing at top 30, top 100 and top 1000 level before and after their strength and conditioning training was increased by 120, 160 and 180 %, respectively, for 30 days. Every week, subjective ratings of stress and recovery were evaluated {{by means of a}} questionnaire. After 74, 76 and 55 h of training, increases in V̇O 2 max (+ 8, + 5 and + 18 %) and speed strength indices (+ 9, + 23 and + 5 %) were observed in all players. Changes of maximal heart rate (- 5, - 6, + 4 beats per minute), laboratory markers (e. g. insulin-like growth factor - 26, - 17, - 9 %; free testosterone to cortisol ratio - 63, + 2, - 12 %) and cardiac autonomous activity markers (heart rate variability - 49, - 64, - 13 %) were variable among the players. Improved performance provides evidence that <b>overreaching</b> was functional in all players. However, several <b>overreaching</b> markers were altered and these alterations were more pronounced in the two top 100 players. The response of <b>overreaching</b> indicators was not coherent...|$|R

Fry 1. 1 Dept. of Health, Sport and Exercise Sciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS; e-mail: adam. j. sterczala@ku. edu Training {{and sport}} {{specific}} performance decrements are {{the hallmark of}} overtraining and <b>overreaching,</b> however the physiological cause of these decrements are unclear. Fatigue studies have demonstrated the effects of resistance exercise on neuromuscular activity; however, {{few studies have examined}} the effects of overtraining or <b>overreaching</b> on neuromuscular parameters. PURPOSE: To analyze the relationship between <b>overreaching</b> induced changes in performance and neuromuscular activity. METHODS: Eight resistance-trained men (n = 8; X ± SD; age = 22. 6 ± 2. 1 yrs) were assigned to the <b>overreaching</b> group {{as part of a larger}} study evaluating the effects of a nutritional supplement on <b>overreaching.</b> Following two weeks of resistance training twice per week, subjects trained twice per day for 7. 5 days, performing ten sets of five repetitions using 70 % 1 RM. Performance and neuromuscular measures were collected before (PRE) and after (POST) the 7. 5 day <b>overreaching</b> period. Performance measured included peak and average force during a back squat performed at the training load, as well as back squat one-repetition maximum. Neuromuscular activity was assessed via peak sEMG amplitude in the vastus lateralis during a seated leg extension isometric contraction performed with the knee positioned at a 90 ° angle. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to evaluate the relationship between performance and neuromuscular changes induced by the <b>overreaching</b> period. RESULTS: The relationship between PRE to POST changes in sEMG peak amplitude and peak force were significant at the p =. 05 level (r =. 804). Analysis of the relationship between changes in sEMG peak amplitude and average force yielded an r value of. 661, significant at the p =. 10 level. Similarly, the relationship between changes in the sEMG peak amplitude and 1 RM was significant at the p =. 10 level (r =. 627) CONCLUSION: The results of this investigation suggest that <b>overreaching</b> induced performance changes may, in part, be due to changes in neuromuscular activity. The observed changes in sEMG peak amplitude may to due to changes in motor unit recruitment or motor unit firing rates. Future investigations employing decomposition EMG (dEMG) may be able to further elucidate the effects of <b>overreaching</b> and overtraining on neuromuscular activity...|$|R

25|$|With Wolman's support, NLB Chairman Wagner {{intervened in}} the strike on March 6. AFL President William Green sought a {{compromise}} under which auto workers {{would be able}} to air their grievances and company unions would be banned but no additional organizing rights would be sought. Wolman, who had long supported company unions, pressed for the retention of these entities as a means of giving workers a voice during the Great Depression without empowering unions (which he felt would <b>overreach</b> themselves and inhibit economic recovery). The strike deadline passed without any action as talks continued. For a time the talks seemed to be making progress, but when the automakers refused to deal with the NLB President Roosevelt intervened personally in the negotiations. The strike was postponed to give the President time to broker a deal. Relying heavily on Wolman's advice, Roosevelt negotiated a deal on March 23, but the deal collapsed and negotiations resumed. At Wolman's suggestion, Roosevelt agreed on March 25 to establish an Automobile Labor Board which endorsed Johnson's reinterpretation of the auto industry code of February 1934 and would hear grievances and cases of discrimination against workers.|$|E
25|$|Foch, {{claiming}} that the Germans were showing signs of demoralisation, demanded (10 August) that Haig push on and capture the Somme crossings. Haig {{would have preferred to}} have First Army attack at Aubers and Third Army towards Bapaume, and after initially agreeing with Foch’s demand, changed his mind after consulting Currie and Lambert (GOC 32nd Division). Edmonds later claimed that Rawlinson was “almost insubordinate” in asking Haig whether he or “Marechal Foch” was in command, but this may not be an exact recollection as there is no record of the two men meeting that day. Haig told Byng (11 August) to be ready to attack with Third Army towards Bapaume and permitted Rawlinson to order a pause. Foch visited Haig’s command train that evening and concurred with the decision. Haig's initial orders to Rawlinson, to be ready to attack again after a short halt, have been criticised but Sheffield suggests that Haig had to defer to Foch this time, to clear the way for Byng’s attack. Haig then cancelled Fourth Army’s attack on Currie’s advice (based on aerial reconnaissance) that it would be “a desperate enterprise” for the BEF to <b>overreach</b> itself and engage new German troops with tired Allied ones who had outrun much of their artillery cover, and he switched to a new line of offensive. Haig wrote that on 15 August he “spoke to Foch quite straightly, and let him understand that I was responsible for the handling of the British forces”. Foch {{had little choice but to}} agree, and interfered little with Haig’s decisions thereafter, but removed First French Army from Haig’s command.|$|E

Findings indicated seasonal variations in cortisol levels, with different pattern in oral contraceptive users to non-users and moreover, higher cortisol levels in users to nonusers irrespective of season. No differences in seasonal variation in Global POMS score within the groups and no differences in Global POMS score between the groups were detected. Due to seasonality, impact of oral contraceptive use on cortisol levels, methodological considerations and standardization, as well as due to no convincing relationship to Global POMS score, cortisol is not suggested to be an optimal biological, diagnostic marker to detect <b>overreaching</b> and overtraining syndrome in physically active women...|$|R
