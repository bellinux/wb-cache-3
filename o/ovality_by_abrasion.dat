40|$|Aims—To {{elucidate}} the factors influencing {{the sensitivity of}} Bacillus subtilis spores to killing and disruption <b>by</b> mechanical <b>abrasion,</b> and the mechanism of stimulation of spore germination <b>by</b> <b>abrasion.</b> Methods and Results—Spores of B. subtilis strains were abraded by shaking with glass beads in liquid or the dry state, and spore killing, disruption and germination were determined. Dormant spores were more resistant to killing and disruption <b>by</b> <b>abrasion</b> than were growing cells or germinated spores. However, dormant spores of the wild-type strain with or without most coat proteins removed, spores of strains with mutations causing spore coat defects, spores lacking their large depot of dipicolinic acid (DPA) and spores with defects in the germination process exhibited essentially identical rates of killing and disruption <b>by</b> <b>abrasion.</b> When spores lacking all nutrient germinant receptors were enumerated by plating directly on nutrient medium, abrasion increased the plating efficiency of these spores before killing them. Spores lacking all nutrient receptors and {{either of the two}} redundant cortex-lytic enzymes behaved similarly in this regard, but the plating efficiency of spores lacking both cortex-lytic enzymes was not stimulated <b>by</b> <b>abrasion.</b> Conclusions—Dormant spores are more resistant to killing and disruption <b>by</b> <b>abrasion</b> than are growing cells or germinated spores, and neither the complete coats nor DPA are important in spore resistance to such treatments. Germination is not essential for spore killing <b>by</b> <b>abrasion,</b> although abrasion can trigger spore germination by activation of either of the spore’s cortex-lytic enzymes. Significance and Importance—This work provides new insight into the mechanisms of the killing, disruption and germination of spores <b>by</b> <b>abrasion</b> and makes the surprising finding that at least much of the spore coat is not important in spore resistance to abrasion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} fluoride (F) varnishes supplemented or not with sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) on enamel erosive wear followed or not <b>by</b> <b>abrasion</b> in situ. MethodsTen volunteers were selected and randomly divided into four groups, according to the varnishes tested: placebo (no F or TMP), 5 % NaF (positive control), 2. 5 % NaF and 2. 5 % NaF/ 5 % TMP. Enamel blocks (n= 4) were mounted in palatal devices and received an application of each test varnish, following a double-blind, crossover protocol. After 6 h, varnishes were completely removed and the blocks were subjected to erosive challenges by ex vivo immersion in citric acid (5 min, 4 ×/dia, 5 days). Following, half of the blocks were subjected to <b>abrasion</b> <b>by</b> brushing with a placebo dentifrice slurry for 15 s. Enamel wear (μm), surface hardness (SHf) and cross-sectional hardness (ΔKHN) were assessed after each experimental period. Results were analyzed by ANOVA, Student–Newman–Keuls's test and Pearson correlation coefficient (p< 0. 05). ResultsThe fluoride varnish supplemented with TMP promoted significantly lower wear and ΔKHN {{when compared to the}} other groups after erosive challenges, followed or not <b>by</b> <b>abrasion</b> (p< 0. 05). As for (SHf) the fluoride varnish supplemented with TMP promoted similar results to the 5 % NaF product, being significantly higher than the remaining groups after erosive and erosive+abrasive challenges (p< 0. 05). ConclusionTMP significantly enhanced the effects of F on enamel wear after erosive challenges, followed or not <b>by</b> <b>abrasion...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: The {{relevance}} of skin preparation <b>by</b> <b>abrasion</b> preceded or not by alcohol cleansing for digital ECG (dECGs) variables was prospectively evaluated. Methods: In 22 healthy male subjects (40. 2 ± 9. 7 years) dECGs were recorded continuously over 5 minute periods at 5 different time points at 3 separate 24 -hour visits, employing 2 electrode types and no skin preparation, abrasion and alcohol cleansing before abrasion. Smoothed means dECG data covering 5 minutes used for statistical analysis on leads V 2 - 3 and V 5. Results: Significant of skin preparation with reductions for skin-impedance and noise (p 0. 46). PRintervals were significantly prolonged by skin preparation (p= 0. 0003 – p= 0. 0165) in leads V 2 - 3 at 120 and 1 440 minutes; with additional impact of alcohol at 1 440 minutes (p= 0. 0005). Subject comfort was markedly higher {{with one of}} the electrode types (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|As {{the number}} of older adults in the United States {{continues}} to grow, this change in patient demographics will profoundly affect the practice of dental hygiene. Not only are there more older adults, {{but they are also}} retaining more of their natural teeth than ever before. The risk of alveolar bone loss; gingival recession, which can lead to exposed cervical and root areas of the teeth; 1 and tooth wear all increase with age.

40|$|Fluidized bed {{combustion}} of char from a biomass, Robinia pseudoacacia, {{was investigated}} in a bench scale combustor. Different experimental techniques have been adopted to characterize the combined role of combustion and comminution phenomena (primary, secondary, and percolative fragmentations, attrition <b>by</b> <b>abrasion)</b> in determining fixed carbon conversion {{and the rate of}} carbon elutriation. Comparison of experimental results obtained under steadily oxidizing conditions and under alternating oxidizing/inert conditions suggested mechanistic aspects of the fluidized bed combustion of biomass char. Fixed carbon combustion was almost always complete. Conversion occurred to a large extent via the generation of carbon fines followed by postcombustion during their residence time in the bed. Approximately half of the initial fixed carbon followed this pathway, the remainder being directly burnt as coarse char. The prevailing mechanism of carbon fines generation in the bed was percolative fragmentation rather than attrition <b>by</b> <b>abrasion.</b> In spite of the extensive generation of elutriable carbon fines, the combined effect of high fuel reactivity and of relatively long fines residence times in the reactor determined the large combustion efficiency. It is inferred from experimental results that char fines adhesion onto bed solids might be relevant to the observed phenomenology...|$|R
