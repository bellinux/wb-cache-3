40|$|The primary {{function}} of idler rolls in a belt conveyor {{system is to}} support the conveyor belt along its length. Predicting the cumulative resistance of idler rolls is vitally important in calculating the belt tension and therefore power requirements of a system, particularly on long <b>overland</b> <b>conveyors</b> where there are typically more than one thousand idler rolls per kilometer of belt. The rotating resistance occurs due to the friction of the rolling elements in the bearings, the viscous drag of the lubricant, and the friction of the contact lip seals.

40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) In {{a tender}} bid to energy and {{chemical}} company Sasol, {{a request to}} offer a technical solution for a two-flight <b>overland</b> <b>conveyor</b> system whose function is to transport coal from a 15 000 tonne bunker into an external stockpile storage facility in the plant was made. This conveyor consisted of two conveyor flight sections of lengths 18 423 m and 8 537 m each. The prospect of combining the two flights of conveyors to form one, super-efficient conveyor structure with additional cost saving benefits was identified. It was found that this occurrence was not unique to the individual project as other researching engineers have been faced with similar problems before [18]. This then lead the researcher into believing {{that there could be}} some advantage in investigating the possible benefits to the overall cost, maintainability and scheduling of the fabrication and erection activities for the entire project of combining the multiple flight conveyors into a single-flight conveyor. It is also the conviction of the researcher that the achieved outcomes will prove beneficial to the bulk materials handling industry as a whole. The problem is traditionally short, multiple flight conveyors have always been used for performing the function of transporting bulk material from one location in a mining plant to another hence; long, single-flight overland conveyors of lengths exceeding 26 km have not been commonly installed. In this dissertation the possibility of employing a single-flight overland as opposed to a two-flight conveyor in the Sasol Impumelelo coal plant is investigated. This is done against the work of other researchers who have conducted similar studies in the field as well as by utilizing project-specific data using applicable industry standards as well as Engineering Management course theory. By employing actual project procurement and engineering design data; the investigation is done by calculating and comparing the individual capital and operational costs that encompass the total cost of ownership (TCO) for both conveyor systems as well as the two systems’ reliability, availability and maintainability to establish each system’s complete life cycle costs. It is the opinion of the researcher that the investigation method is valid as it is in line with the guidelines given by The Miami University of Ohio [24] as well as J Hanek [25] and thus provides the researcher with a plausible technique for establishing which between the single-flight <b>overland</b> <b>conveyor</b> and two-flight <b>overland</b> <b>conveyor</b> configurations is overall the more superior system to install. It was found that even though its initial capital and operational costs are higher; the single-flight conveyor system is more reliable, readily available and cheaper to run and sustain over the 30 year expected life-span of the plant. It also is less labour intensive to perform maintenance on, yields less material degradation and results in less material spillage because of the elimination of additional transfer points and transfer towers. These results can be taken as valid on a global scale, for any mining plant, not restricted to any specific material as they are not subject to South African temperature, altitude or seismic conditions nor are they constrained to the type of bulk material being mined...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 124 - 131). <b>Overland</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt systems form a {{vital part}} of modern transportation systems in the mining and mineral processing industries. It is vital that the system is well maintained in order to minimise system downtime and maximise profit. The conveyor belt is the single most expensive item in the system. It must be monitored to pick up potential problems before they cause belt failure. The majority of conveyor belt monitoring methods identify belt failure events rather than belt failure causes. The purpose of this project was to research and design a belt condition monitoring board which could be physically embedded in the conveyor belt. This would then be used to monitor the condition of the conveyor idlers whose failure can result in major system damage. The venture was split into two areas of research: the design of a vibration data logging board and the design of a power generation system. The thesis focused on the design of a DSP vibration data logging prototype board, while S. A. Williams investigated the design of a power generation system...|$|E

40|$|Long <b>overland</b> <b>conveyor</b> {{systems have}} become an {{increasingly}} popular method of transporting bulk materials over relatively large distances from mine sites to fixed transport infrastructure - such as railways or ports. Lateral belt drift occurs in long overland systems wherever a horizontal curve exists in the system. This {{is due to a}} motivating force that stems from the tension present in the conveyor belt. This belt drift can be hazardous and operationally undesirable and as such, a number of control mechanisms have been developed to assist in the control of belt drift to an extent where it is tolerable. In this paper, a new method of control for belt drift is described in an effort to add- to the existing control methods- a complementary technique which will allow better control and ultimately a more reliable and viable conveyor system. The current profile of a horizontal curve section of a conveyor system is a constant radius curve- a segment of a circle- that simply sweeps through the desired angle. A belt tension increase over the length of the curve results in a corresponding increase in the extent of the belt drift. If a non-constant radius curve is adapted and used {{in such a way that}} the increase in curve radius over the length of the curve serves to counteract the increase in belt tension, a single, constant value for belt drift can be attained. This is an improvement and alongside current techniques can serve to increase the control over belt drift that a designer and mine site can expect to achieve...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: Millmerran Power Station (MPS) {{consists}} of two units with each unit producing 420 MW of electricity. The coal is delivered to the plant by off road type trucks and unloaded into a 500 MT hopper. The ROM (run of mine) coal is processed {{through a series of}} crushing stations and coal handling (storage/reclaim) systems, and delivered by <b>overland</b> <b>conveyor</b> to the power plant silos. MPS, as a coal fired station, is wholly dependent on a consistent and reliable supply of coal to maintain operating efficiency. MPS has been experiencing inefficiencies in their ROM coal supply because of constant blockage issues at the receiving hopper. This blockage {{is a direct result of}} large lumps of coal coming from the mine. The blockages interrupt the supply of coal potentially lowering the fuel supply to the power station. Currently, an excavator is hired to clear up the blockage which could be utilised more effectively elsewhere. This introduces an extra cost to the mine in terms of both money and inefficiency. MPS is seeking an engineering design solution to this problem. The elimination of the blockages through an automatic system without increasing any safety risks is highly desirable as that would result in a cheaper and smoother operation of the mine. A literature review on the current coal handling system of MPS was essential in order to be able to develop a design that is suitable for MPS. In this investigation, five conceptual designs with the most appropriate design, in terms of meeting the specified criteria, was analysed and detailed. It was found that the simpler and more effective the design, the higher its practicality in terms of reaching the desired objectives. This enabled an overall cost estimate budget to be produced, which would be the major deciding factor on the implementation of the design. The results of this investigation will aid in gaining an understanding of the overall general solution for the ROM coal blockage problem at MPS. Both design and engineering solutions have been recommended in this dissertation. This will lead eventually to a more automated, safer, efficient and cost effective operating environment...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, Western Australian iron ore mining {{industry}} experienced an exponential production growth arising from increased global demand for steel. The upturn in the iron ore price and considerably lower production cost encouraged extensive mining and consequently high-grade ore reserves were gradually depleted. Despite the energy-intensive nature of mining, high profitability motivated the mining companies to extract marginal-grade deposits with additional processing requirements, which increased energy consumption and ultimately increased the cost of iron ore production. This thesis sought to identify the energy efficiencies of open-cut iron ore mining operations, in terms of scale of operation as well as within individual mining processes, so that energy consumption could be reduced, and sustainability enhanced. Efficiency indices {{were used to determine}} energy efficiency across different scales of operation. Overall energy consumption (per unit of processed ore) was directly related to the scale of operation, where large-scale mining operations are more energy efficient compared to medium and small scales requiring the lowest amount of energy to process a unit of ore. This suggests that an economy of scale based on energy efficiency can be observed in iron ore mining operations. Small-scale mining operations recorded the highest energy consumption to process a unit of ore, indicating the lowest energy efficiency among the three different scales of operation. However, the composite energy indicator indicated that the energy efficiency of a particular mining operation is also influenced by the geological and physical parameters of individual factors including the waste-ore ratio, grade of ore, average haulage distance and production capacity. The results of the regression analysis confirmed that it is the combined effect of all the aforementioned parameters that has a pronounced effect on the amount of energy consumed to process a unit of ore. Energy consumption per unit of processed ore at different process stages revealed that the loading and hauling phase is the most energy intensive process stage in an iron ore mining operation regardless of the scale at which it is operating. The milling and stockpiling phase was the second highest energy consuming process stage, while the drilling and blasting phase was the subsequent energy demanding process stage in iron ore mining operations. Small-scale operations recorded a higher energy consumption in loading and hauling than the medium-scale operations, suggesting that the equipment with high load capacities and energy efficient technologies such as <b>overland</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts, and advanced technologies including autonomous haulage trucks resulted lower energy consumption in medium scale mining operations. However, the energy consumed to mill and stockpile a unit of ore in medium-scale operations was high compared to the small-scale operations, suggesting that the energy consumption in milling and stockpiling is mainly influenced by the properties of the mill feed, such as moisture content. Further, the amount of processing needed to achieve sufficient final product quality can also influence energy consumption. Findings from this study support the idea that an economy of scale can be observed across iron ore mining operations in Western Australia based on energy efficiency. The study also provided essential baseline information for future studies on the variations in energy efficiency across different iron ore mining operational scales in Western Australia...|$|E
40|$|The mining {{industry}} is an immense field with granular flows (e. g. coal) occurring in numerous areas. Accordingly {{there are a}} significant number of problems that arise, with a great number requiring solutions that are difficult to achieve by conventional industrial means. The modelling of granular flow using the numerical technique known as Distinct Element Method (DEM) has great potential in industry, particularly for solving transfer point problems. The advantage of DEM for transfer applications is that an entire system can be simulated using the single numerical technique, as opposed to the existing situation where a myriad of design techniques are required (e. g. analytical solution for one component and graphical solution for another). DEM involves solving the equations of motion for the trajectory/rotation/orientation of each particle and modelling each collision between particles and between particles and boundary objects. The research presented a comprehensive overview of all of the available analytical processes available to design chute system components, such as material trajectory calculations, impact plate models, and gravity flow chute aspects. To the author’s knowledge, this was the first such review in the literature. A detailed comparison between the most common analytical design methods was conducted, recommendations for which method to use were established, and areas of weakness and further study were identified. It was found that: most areas apart from the prediction of the initial material discharge and trajectory were lacking in design method; often the few available design methods for chute components, such as impact plates and gravity flow chutes, were lengthy and often difficult to implement. A computer code was developed {{during the course of the}} research to simulate bulk material using the Distinct Element Method (DEM). A background into DEM and its application to modelling material flow at transfer points was presented. One major drawback found in the recent transfer studies was the lack of quantification of the velocity distributions obtained using the DEM against existing analytical design theories. Contour coloured particulate simulations have also been recently produced by a number of companies (e. g. <b>Overland</b> <b>Conveyor</b> Company Inc.) however the flow A b s t r a c t ii regimes observed from the relevant simulation screen captures were not adequately scrutinised. All the DEM mathematical formulation and numerical methods utilised for the current work were comprehensively described and relevant computational aspects were also detailed, such as the coding of a pre-processor and post-processor allowing animations of the DEM particles. A series of tests was conducted to gauge the validity of the computer code, and this produced satisfactory results. The DEM code was also applied to simulate two separate transfers originally designed by The Gulf Group using their EasyFlowTM technology, and currently in operation in industry in Lithgow, Australia. By observing animation screen captures the current research confirmed the advantage of maintaining particle speed through the system when using curved chute elements. Quantitative DEM velocity data were compared to the velocities predicted by the most favourable analytical methods. It was found that DEM generally produced velocity regimes close to those of the analytical techniques. However it also provided the additional benefit of providing data on stream characteristics such as impact forces and velocities in the vicinity of the hood and spoon elements, which are difficult to examine in detail using analytical methods. An analysis of the micro dynamics of individual particles also identified that there are differing scales of contact during the flow through a chute. Although the analytical methods do not allow closer scrutiny of the flowing stream at the micro scale, they have the advantage of providing much faster solutions and are good for chute designs for free flowing material transfers...|$|E
