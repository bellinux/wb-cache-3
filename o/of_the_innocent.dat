5|$|In 1965 a {{retrospective}} of Berni's work was organized at the Instituto Di Tella, including the collage Monsters. Versions {{of the exhibit}} were shown in the United States, Argentina, and several Latin American countries. Compositions such as Ramona en la caverna (Ramona in the Cavern), El mundo de Ramona (Ramona's World), and La masacre de los inocentes (Massacre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent)</b> were becoming more complex. The latter was exhibited in 1971 at the Paris Museum of Modern Art. By the late 1970s Berni's Juanito and Ramona oil paintings had evolved into three-dimensional altar pieces.|$|E

With prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre being forced into retirement, artistic director Thomas Leroy announces {{he is looking for}} a new dancer to portray the dual role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>innocent</b> White Swan and the sensual Black Swan. Nina auditions for the role and gives a flawless performance as the White Swan, but fails to embody the Black Swan.|$|E
5|$|Batwoman {{was created}} by writer Edmond Hamilton and artist Sheldon Moldoff under the {{direction}} of editor Jack Schiff, as part of an ongoing effort to expand Batman's cast of supporting characters. Batwoman began appearing in DC Comics stories beginning with Detective Comics #233 (1956), in which she was introduced as a love interest for Batman in order to combat the allegations of Batman's homosexuality arising from the controversial book Seduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent</b> (1954). When Julius Schwartz became editor of the Batman-related comic books in 1964, he removed non-essential characters including Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Bat-Mite, and Bat-Hound. Later, the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths retroactively established that Batwoman had never existed, though her alter ego Kathy Kane continued to be referred to occasionally.|$|E

5|$|Reaction to Super Columbine Massacre was {{enormously}} negative; {{the title was}} criticized as trivializing the actions of two murderers and the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>innocent.</b> The game's cartoon presentation and the side-plot into hell were considered by critics as obscuring the game's message, but it received minor note as a game that transcended the stereotypical associations of the medium as entertainment for children. Super Columbine Massacres themes and content led to it being included in discussions as to whether video games cause violence; the title was later listed {{as one of the}} possible motivating factors of the shooter after the 2006 Dawson College shootings. The game has been described as an art game, and Ledonne has become a spokesperson for video games as an emerging art form, producing a documentary in 2008 called Playing Columbine about his game and its impact.|$|E
5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be {{in direct proportion to}} population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book Seduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent</b> (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E
5|$|Street & Smith, one of {{the longest}} {{established}} and most respected publishers, shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, partially {{as a result of the}} success of paperbacks. Standard continued with Startling and Thrilling, but the end came only a few years later. In 1954, Fredric Wertham published Seduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent,</b> a book in which he asserted that comics were inciting children to violence. A subsequent Senate subcommittee hearing led to a backlash against comics, and the publishers dropped titles in response. The financial impact spread to pulp magazines, since often a publisher would publish both. A 1955 strike by American News Corporation, the main distributor in the U.S., meant that magazines remained in warehouses and never made it to the newsstands; the unsold copies represented a significant financial blow and contributed to publishers' decisions to cancel magazines. Startling was {{one of the}} casualties. The schedule had already returned from monthly to bimonthly in 1953, and it became a quarterly in early 1954. Thrilling Wonder published its last issue in early 1955, and was then merged with Startling, as was Fantastic Story Magazine, another companion publication, but the combined magazine lasted only three more issues. Mines left the magazine at the end of 1954; he was succeeded for two issues by Theron Raines, who was followed by Herbert D. Kastle for the last two. The final issue was dated Fall 1955.|$|E

25|$|Seduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent</b> {{is a book}} by American {{psychiatrist}} Fredric Wertham, {{published in}} 1954, that warned that comic books were a negative form of popular literature and a serious cause of juvenile delinquency. The book was taken seriously at the time, and was a minor bestseller that created alarm in parents and galvanized them to campaign for censorship. At the same time, a U.S. Congressional inquiry was launched into the comic book industry. Subsequent to the publication of Seduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent,</b> the Comics Code Authority was voluntarily established by publishers to self-censor their titles.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, even Batman {{fell victim}} to {{contemporaneous}} parodies, {{with the release of}} Captain Nice and Mr. Terrific, which layered extra camp onto the overladen superhero concept. The stylized content of Batman may have possibly jump-started television campiness, to circumvent the strict censorship of comics at this time (after Dr. Fredric Wertham's essay Seduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent</b> which led to the comics' industry-sponsored Comics Code), as the Batman comic books were very dark and noirish until the 1950s and from the 1970s onwards.|$|E

25|$|The fame of Seduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent</b> {{added to}} Wertham's {{previous}} celebrity {{as an expert}} witness and led to his appearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, chaired by Senator Estes Kefauver. In testimony before the committee, Wertham restated arguments from his book and pointed to comics as {{a major cause of}} juvenile crime. The committee's questioning of their next witness, EC publisher William Gaines, focused on violent scenes of the type Wertham had described. Though the committee's final report did not blame comics for crime, it recommended that the comics industry tone down its content voluntarily. Publishers then developed the self-censorship Comics Code Authority.|$|E

25|$|Seduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent</b> also {{analyzed}} the advertisements {{that appeared in}} 1950s comic books and the commercial context in which these publications existed. Wertham objected to not only {{the violence in the}} stories but also the fact that air rifles and knives were advertised alongside them. Wertham claimed that retailers {{who did not want to}} sell material with which they were uncomfortable, such as horror comics, were essentially held to ransom by the distributors. According to Wertham, news vendors were told by the distributors that if they did not sell the objectionable comic books, they would not be allowed to sell any of the other publications being distributed.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the last}} trial {{was held in}} May 1693, public {{response}} to the events continued. In the decades following the trials, survivors and family members (and their supporters) sought to establish the innocence of the individuals who were convicted and to gain compensation. In the following centuries, the descendants of those unjustly accused and condemned have sought to honor their memories. Events in Salem and Danvers in 1992 were used to commemorate the trials. In November 2001, years after {{the celebration of the}} 300th anniversary of the trials, the Massachusetts legislature passed an act exonerating all who had been convicted and naming each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>innocent.</b> The trials have figured in American culture and been explored in numerous works of art, literature and film.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1948, Wertham {{wrote and}} spoke widely, arguing about the {{detrimental}} effects that comics reading had on young people. Consequently, Seduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Innocent</b> {{serves as a}} culminating expression of his sentiments about comics and presents augmented examples and arguments, rather than wholly new material. Wertham's concerns were not limited to comics' impact on boys: He also expressed {{a concern for the}} effect of impossibly proportioned female characters on girl readers. A. David Lewis writes that Wertham's anxiety over the perceived homosexual subtext of Batman and Robin was aimed at the welfare of a child introduced to that sort of family unit, not on some inherent immorality of homosexuality. Will Brooker also points out in Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon that Wertham's notorious reading of Batman and Robin as a homosexual couple was not of his own invention, but was suggested to him by homosexual males whom he interviewed.|$|E
