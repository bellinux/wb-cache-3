500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> school as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979. [...] She {{said at the time}} that she did so with conflicted emotions: [...] "There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem." [...] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court. [...] Working in the trial division, she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders. She also worked on cases involving police brutality. She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses. [...] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate. [...] In 1983 in her highest profile case she helped convict the [...] "Tarzan Murderer" [...] (who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason). [...] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: [...] "No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous." [...] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: [...] "The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other." [...] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time. [...] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness. [...] One of her job evaluations labelled her a [...] "potential superstar". Morgenthau later described her as [...] "smart, hard-working, [...] a lot of common sense," [...] and as a [...] "fearless and effective prosecutor." [...] She stayed a typical length of time in the post and had a common reaction to the job: [...] "After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kelly {{eventually}} {{decided to}} pursue a career as a dance teacher and full-time entertainer, so he dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> school after two months. He increased his focus on performing, and later claimed: [...] "With time I became disenchanted with teaching because the ratio of girls to boys was more than ten to one, and once the girls reached sixteen the dropout rate was very high." [...] In 1937, having successfully managed and developed the family's dance school business, he finally did move to New York City in search of work as a choreographer. Kelly returned to Pittsburgh, to his family home at 7514 Kensington Street by 1940, and worked as a theatrical actor.|$|E

[...] Morse later helped Neuberger, who won his Senate seat in 1954 by only 2,462 votes out of more than a half-million cast, but he also continued to give Neuberger advice that was not always appreciated.

Roosevelt gave up his earlier plan of studying natural science and instead decided to attend Columbia Law School, moving back into his family's home in New York City. Roosevelt was an able law student, but he often found law to be irrational; he spent much of his time writing a book on the War of 1812. Determined to enter politics, Roosevelt began attending meetings at Morton Hall, the 59th Street headquarters of New York's 21st District Republican Association. Though Roosevelt's father had been a prominent member of the Republican Party, the younger Roosevelt made an unorthodox career choice for someone of his class, as most of Roosevelt's peers refrained from becoming too closely involved in politics. Nonetheless, Roosevelt found allies in the local Republican Party, and he defeated an incumbent Republican state assemblyman closely tied to the political machine of Senator Roscoe Conkling. After his election victory, Roosevelt decided to drop <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> school, later saying, [...] "I intended to be one of the governing class." ...|$|E
