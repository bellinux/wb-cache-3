40|$|In {{this work}} we study the Zeeman effect on stratospheric O 2 using {{ground-based}} microwave radiometer measurements. The {{interaction of the}} Earth magnetic field with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>dipole</b> leads to a splitting of O 2 energy states, which polarizes the emission spectra. A special campaign {{was carried out in}} order to measure this effect in the oxygen emission line centered at 53. 07 GHz. Both a fixed and a rotating mirror were incorporated into the TEMPERA (TEMPERature RAdiometer) {{in order to be able}} to measure under different observational angles. This new configuration allowed us to change the angle between the observational path and the Earth magnetic field direction. Moreover, a high-resolution spectrometer (1 kHz) was used in order to measure for the first time the polarization state of the radiation due to the Zeeman effect in the main isotopologue of oxygen from ground-based microwave measurements. The measured spectra showed a clear polarized signature when the observational angles were changed, evidencing the Zeeman effect in the oxygen molecule. In addition, simulations carried out with the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS) allowed us to verify the microwave measurements showing a very good agreement between model and measurements. The results suggest some interesting new aspects for research of the upper atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} around oxygen {{atoms of}} four silicate liquids (silica, rhyolite, a model basalt and enstatite) is evaluated by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Thanks {{to the use}} of maximally localized Wannier orbitals to represent the electronic ground state of the simulated system, one is able to quantify the redistribution of electronic density around oxygen atoms {{as a function of the}} cationic environment and melt composition. It is shown that the structure of the melt in the immediate vicinity of the oxygen atoms modulates the distribution of the Wannier orbitals associated with oxygen atoms. In particular the evaluation of the distances between the oxygen-core and the orbital Wannier centers and their evolution with the nature of the cation indicates that the Al-O bond in silicate melts is certainly less covalent than the Si-O bond while for the series Mg-O, Ca-O, Na-O and K-O the covalent character of the M-O bond diminishes rapidly to the benefit of the ionic character. Furthermore it is found that the distribution of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>dipole</b> moment coming from the electronic polarization is only weakly dependent on the melt composition, a finding which could explain why some empirical force fields can exhibit a high degree of transferability with melt composition.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{electric}} field effects in high temperature superconductors has sparked {{a certain amount of}} controversy. It is a matter of non-negligible technological signifi-cance whether these effects are fundamentally electronic, characterized by a fast time constant, or whether instead or possibly, in addition an oxygen diffusion process, driven by the <b>oxygen</b> electric <b>dipole</b> moments and characterized by a much slower time constant, is involved...|$|R
40|$|The room {{temperature}} Mössbauer spectra of the spinel compounds Fe 2 (1 -y) Mg 1 +yTiyO 4 with compositions y = 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8 and 0. 9 must be {{described by a}} sum of two doublet spectra. The two subspectra are assigned to actahedral and tetrahedral ferric ions. The cation distribution calculated from the doublet intensities, is {{in close agreement with}} the results obtained from other techniques. The isomer shifts of both subspectra remain constant with y, whereas the quadrupole splittings increase with increasing y. Thermal vacancies, introduced by quenching the samples from 1 150 °C, have no influence on the isomer shift but make the quadrupole splitting to incrase. The contributions of monopoles and <b>oxygen</b> <b>dipoles</b> to the electric field gradient (EFG) at the B sites are estimated. From a comparison with the results obtained in the normal spinels ZnFe 2 O 4 and CdFe 2 O 4, it is concluded that the oxygen polarizability depends on the space occupied by the oxygen ion...|$|R

The Tangney-Scandolo interatomic force field for silica takes regard of polarizable <b>oxygen</b> atoms whose <b>dipole</b> moments {{are determined by}} iteration to a self-consistent solution. With Wolf summation, the computational effort scales linearly in the system size and can easily be distributed among many processors, thus making large-scale simulations of dipoles possible.

30|$|In summary, a self-compliance {{resistive}} switching {{property was}} observed in a Pt/HfO 2 /TiN RRAM device after the nitridation treatment. Endurance times reached 109 cycles and a retention time of more than 104  s was achieved at 85  °C. Due to the smaller electron negativity of the nitrogen atom {{when compared to the}} <b>oxygen</b> atom, the <b>dipole</b> of the Hf–N bond is smaller than that of the Hf–O bond, which creates a lower dielectric constant region. During the SET process, the Hf–N–Ox vacancy clusters (Vo+) form the conductive path.

40|$|Our {{combined}} {{experimental and}} theoretical study reveals unusually large cobalt-oxygen covalency in CoO 4 tetrahedral unit of a barium cobalt oxychloride compound. This drives signiﬁcant charge redistribution, resulting into large hole density on tetrahedral oxygens, which effectively behave as “positively charged” anions. These positively charged <b>oxygens</b> form local <b>dipoles</b> with dopant chloride anions, {{situated in the}} same atomic plane, which gets manifested in associated structural distortions. The spatial freezing of these local dipoles below certain temperature is found to produce concomitant effects on dielectric and magnetic responses, coupled via exchange-striction driven spin-phonon interaction. Our study should {{form the basis for}} designing new functional oxide materials using the concept of covalency-driven charge redistribution...|$|R
50|$|The general {{structure}} of an oxocarbenium ion contains an oxygen-carbon double bond, with the oxygen atom attached to an additional group. The ion has a formal positive charge, which {{is placed on}} the oxygen atom. The oxocarbenium cation is stabilized by resonance, which places the positive charge on the carbon. Compared to a ketone, the oxocarbenium ion is more polar, and more reactive with nucleophiles. A common example of this is the activation of a ketone by the addition of a Lewis Acid to the <b>oxygen.</b> An average <b>dipole</b> moment for a general ketone R2CO is δ = 0.51. With the addition of an acidic hydrogen to the oxygen atom to produce R2COH+, the dipole moment increases to δ = 0.61, making the oxocarbenium ion more susceptible to nucleophilic addition than the ketone.|$|R

40|$|Temperature-dependent {{dielectric}} relaxations of (1 - x) BiFeO 3 -x(Bi 1 / 2 K 1 / 2) TiO 3 (BF-BKT) lead-free piezoceramics (0. 4 ≤ x ≤ 0. 8) {{were investigated}} via impedance spectroscopic techniques. Regardless of the compositions, the dielectric maximum temperatures exhibit a frequency-dependent dispersion, originating from a Debye relaxation {{due to the}} presence of oxygen vacancies. It was also observed that there exist local dielectric maxima due to the relaxation of polar nanoregions as a shoulder on the lower temperature side. The onset temperature for the Debye-type relaxation decreased with decreasing BKT content, gradually overlapping with the low-temperature dielectric dispersion from the relaxation of polar nanoregions. It is proposed that the role of BKT in the BF-BKT system is to enhance the random fields that favor a relaxor state and to suppress the Debye-type relaxation of <b>oxygen</b> vacancy related <b>dipoles.</b> clos...|$|R
40|$|D. R. Bates (1951) {{proposed}} that a principle cooling {{mechanism for the}} upper atmosphere is the emission from an atomic <b>oxygen</b> magnetic <b>dipole</b> transition at 63 u. Due to the absorption by water vapor this emission is not seeable at ground level, but at 50, 000 feet conditions are such {{that the existence of}} the line is proveable assuming the existence of a filtering device to isolate the line emiss ion. The design considerations and construction of an interference filter using wire mesh as the reflecting surfaces to operate at 63 u is given. Testing of a completed interference filter that operates in second order at 63 u indicates that such a device would give the necessary characteristics - small bandwidth, high transmission - to isolate the line emission from the background radiation. The testing of two reference interference filters that operate in second order at 60 and 66 u is also given. With interference filters designed to isolate a particular order there must be a means of rejecting all other transmission bands. For the interference filters described above a system is described that will eliminate all radiation below 45 u and above 80 u so that the only energy detectable will be the second order transmissions of the three interference filters. Finally the use of the interference filters in an experiment to detect the 63 u atomic oxygen transmission is described. The expected intensities of the line emission and the emission of water vapor at 50, 000 feet (the background) indicated that the use of the interference filters should have proven the existence of the emission line in the upper atmosphere. The experiment was flown at 50, 000 feet but a failure in the chopper motor and the filters losing their tautness prevented obtaining any useful data...|$|R

40|$|Deliberately oxygen {{deficient}} potassium tantalate {{thin films}} were grown by RF magnetron sputtering on Si/SiO 2 /Ti/Pt substrates. Once they were structurally characterized, {{the effect of}} oxygen vacancies on their electric properties was addressed by measuring leakage currents, dielectric constant, electric polarization, and thermally stimulated depolarization currents. By using K 2 O rich KTaO 3 targets and specific deposition conditions, KTaO 3 -delta oxygen deficient thin films with a K/Ta = 1 ratio were obtained. Room temperature X-ray diffraction patterns show that KTaO 3 -delta thin films are under a compressive strain of 2. 3 % relative to KTaO 3 crystals. Leakage current results reveal {{the presence of a}} conductive mechanism, following the Poole-Frenkel formalism.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which nucleophilic hydroxyls are attracted to activated glycopyranosyl donors is not known. Besides the intrinsic attraction of <b>oxygen</b> centred negative <b>dipoles</b> towards the developing electron deficiency at the anomeric carbon only a few suggestions have been given in the literature. By studying the effect on Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelled glycosylation reactions {{on the presence of}} polar additives as tested with acetonitrile two possible effects have been identified. One was noted in a previous publication (Carbohydr. Res. 2012, 356, 180 - 190) and two further examples discovered here that suggest that a lone pair of a nucleophile approaching a donor with a 3 ̆b 2 -leaving group from the 3 ̆b 1 -face can act as the antiperiplanar lone pair that assists leaving group departure. This interaction starts at just under a nucleophile C- 1 separation of 3. 5 and has an incipient bond angle of O- 5 -C- 1 -Nuc(O or N) of very close to 900 which can be at C- 1 with the p-type orbital at C- 1 -O- 5 of the incipient oxacarbenium ion, that is, the LUMO of the activated donor. The 2 nd interaction is less well studied and is suggested to be a similar bonding interaction which moves 3 ̆b 2 -face nucleophiles to O-Nuc-C- 1 -leaving groups angles close to 1800.
