In comparing the effects of watching Sesame Street with other programs, commercial entertainment and cartoons had a negative effect; watching Sesame Street daily did not increase children's viewing of <b>other</b> <b>categories</b> of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other educational activities.|$|E
