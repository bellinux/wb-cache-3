5|$|The {{story of}} the three bears was in {{circulation}} before the publication of Southey's tale. In 1813, for example, Southey was telling the story to friends, and in 1831 Eleanor Mure fashioned a handmade booklet about the three bears and the <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> for her nephew Horace Broke's birthday. Southey and Mure differ in details. Southey's bears have porridge, but Mure's have milk; Southey's <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> has no motive for entering the house, but Mure's <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> is piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed; Southey's <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> runs away when discovered, but Mure's <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> is impaled on the steeple of St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review {{recently}} published studies on {{stress urinary incontinence}} surgery outcomes in <b>older</b> <b>women.</b> RECENT FINDINGS: Five prospective and two retrospective studies were identified that reported tension-free vaginal tape (n = 6), colposuspension (n = 1) and cadaveric fascia transvaginal sling (n = 1) procedure results. In each study, 21 - 175 <b>older</b> <b>women</b> were included, with mean ages ranging from 71 to 83 years; most studies included younger comparison groups. Mean follow-ups ranged from 3 to 30 months. Subjective stress urinary incontinence 2 ̆ 7 cure/improvement 2 ̆ 7 rates after surgery were significantly lower in <b>older</b> <b>women</b> when compared with younger women in only one study, although similar trends were seen in two additional studies. Intraoperative complications occurred at similar rates in <b>older</b> and younger <b>women.</b> Postoperative complications (urinary tract infection, urgency, voiding dysfunction, and mesh erosion) were more common in <b>older</b> <b>women</b> {{in only a few}} studies. SUMMARY: Recent studies demonstrate that surgery for stress urinary incontinence in <b>older</b> <b>women</b> improves symptoms, although in some reports, not to the extent seen in younger women. It is unclear if some postoperative complications are more common in <b>older</b> <b>women</b> undergoing incontinence surgery. Results from randomized trials focusing on stress urinary incontinence surgery in <b>older</b> <b>women</b> are needed...|$|R

Accordingly, {{it has been suggested}} that these <b>older</b> <b>women</b> should also be offered vaccination.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the predictors of independent living outcomes among community–living <b>older</b> <b>women</b> who received informal care. The central hypothesis was that older women’s level of functioning is influenced by their relationship with their informal caregiver. The study attempted to understand the independence of <b>older</b> <b>women</b> through the perspective of both informal caregivers and the <b>older</b> <b>women</b> themselves. The following eight variables were measured: 1) the older women’s independence (dependent variable); 2) the relationship between <b>older</b> <b>women</b> and their informal caregivers (independent variable); 3) roles of both the informal caregiver and <b>older</b> <b>women</b> (independent variable); 4) the older women’s attitudes toward aging (independent variable); 5) the older women’s age identity (independent variable); 6) the older women’s health (control variable); 7) the older women’s level of social support (control variable); and 8) the older women’s level of depression (control variable). The variables were measured {{from the perspective of}} the <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> herself and her informal caregiver. This study used an ecological and developmental framework along with role theory to understand the interaction among the aforementioned variables through a cross-sectional design. The recruited <b>older</b> <b>women</b> participants of this study were receiving ongoing care and personal assistance from two large home care agencies located in Miami, FL. An analysis was conducted through a mixed-methods incorporated into the study design. The present study aimed to contribute to the understanding of how the relationship between <b>older</b> <b>women</b> and their informal caregivers influences older women’s ability to maintain independent outcomes. The primary finding of this study was that there were both positive and negative experiences within the relationship dynamic of <b>older</b> <b>women</b> and their informal caregivers and that this relationship was either unidirectional or bi-directional...|$|R
40|$|Background: Research has {{demonstrated}} that exposure to life stressors can influence health {{through a number of}} pathways. However, knowledge about the patterns of life stressors and their contributions to health in different populations is limited. Vietnamese <b>older</b> <b>women</b> have attracted little research to date in this area. Methods: This cross-sectional study used an interview-administered-questionnaire to collect data from 440 Vietnamese <b>older</b> <b>women.</b> Descriptive analysis was used to describe life stressors among Vietnamese <b>older</b> <b>women.</b> Binary analysis and Structural Equation Modelling statistical analysis were used to examine the influences of life stressors on modifiable lifestyle factors, depressive symptoms, physical and mental health among Vietnamese <b>older</b> <b>women.</b> Results: Vietnamese <b>older</b> <b>women</b> in this study commonly reported the experience of losing a close person, including a baby/child, serious health or money problems, violence and disaster. Among the study participants, (1) exposure to more life stressors increased their depressive symptoms, and decreased their physical and mental health; (2) exposure to more life stressors also increased their physical health by increasing their physical activity levels. Conclusion: Life stressors influenced health among Vietnamese <b>older</b> <b>women</b> through different pathways. Interventions to manage stress and depressive symptoms are required for Vietnamese <b>older</b> <b>women</b> in the future. Griffith Health, School of Nursing and MidwiferyFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} two participatory projects {{designed to}} engage <b>older</b> <b>women</b> {{in the creation}} of new imagery of old age. While it was hoped that this imagery would offer an ‘alternative’ to mainstream depictions or indeed offer <b>older</b> <b>women</b> a presence amidst the much noted absence of images of <b>older</b> <b>women,</b> the brief left it open to the professional photographers recruited to the project and to the participants themselves to direct the representations. In recent years, critical gerontologists have repeatedly called for artistic challenges to conventional ways of imaging old age. By working with two groups of <b>older</b> <b>women,</b> the intention was that ‘ordinary’ <b>older</b> <b>women</b> (non-celebrity, non-artist) could be included in that challenge and imagery created which would show the lives of <b>older</b> <b>women</b> honestly. In the case of the two projects described here, professional photographers were enlisted to give visual form to the women's views on ageing and their lives as <b>older</b> <b>women</b> and deliver ‘exhibition quality’ images. Important factors in determining the types of images produced included the artistic style and preferences of the photographers and their respective ages, both of which are explored here. In-depth analysis of some of the images produced shows that while they did not succumb to the usual ‘heroes of ageing’/‘bodily decline’ binary (Featherstone &# 38; Hepworth, 2005), they did not escape other dualistic categorisations. The images can be broadly viewed as nostalgic/melancholic or humorously carnivalesque. This finding is evidence of {{how difficult it is to}} create ‘alternative’ images of <b>older</b> <b>women</b> which defy established modes of categorisation...|$|R
