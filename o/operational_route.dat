Introduction In this note we initiate a new direction in the semantics of functional programs. The approach is based on operational semantics; our aims are to provide a <b>operational</b> <b>route</b> to high-level semantic issues, such as program analysis and sourceto -source transformation. We investigate the idea of giving a direct operational semantics to program contexts [...] -that is, "incomplete" programs containing a number of holes in the place of some subexpressions. The idea of providing an operational semantics for contexts has been studied by Larsen (et al) for process algebras [Lar 86][LX 91].

40|$|Abstract An {{important}} {{problem in}} transportation {{is how to}} ensure efficient <b>operational</b> <b>route</b> planning when several vehicles share a common road infrastructure with limited capacity. Examples of such a problem are route planning for automated guided vehicles in a terminal and route planning for aircraft taxiing at airports. Maintaining efficiency in such transport planning scenarios can be difficult {{for at least two}} reasons. Firstly, when the infrastructure utilization approaches saturation, traffic jams and deadlocks may occur. Secondly, incidents where vehicles break down may seriously reduce the capacity of the infrastructure and thereby affect the efficiency of transportation. In this chapter we describe a new approach to deal with congestion as well as incidents using an intelligent infrastructure. In this approach, infrastructural resources (road sections, crossings) are capable of maintaining reservations of the use of that resource. Based on this infrastructure, we present an efficient, context-aware, operational transportation planning approach. Experimental results show that our context-aware planning approach outperforms a traditional planning technique and provides robustness in the face of incidents, at a level that allows application to real-world transportation problems...|$|E

40|$|From a Service-Dominant Logic (S-DL) perspective, {{employees}} constitute operant {{resources that}} firms can draw {{to enhance the}} outcomes of innovation efforts. While research acknowledges that frontline employees (FLEs) constitute, through service encounters, a key interface for the transfer of valuable external knowledge into the firm, the range of potential benefits derived from FLE-driven innovation deserves more investigation. Using a sample of knowledge intensive business services firms (KIBS), this study examines how the collaboration with FLEs along the new service development (NSD) process, namely FLE co-creation, impacts on service innovation performance following two routes of different effects. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) results indicate that FLE co-creation benefits the NS success among FLEs and firm’s customers, the constituents of the resources route. FLE co-creation also has {{a positive effect on}} the NSD speed, which in turn enhances the NS quality. NSD speed and NS quality integrate the <b>operational</b> <b>route,</b> which proves to be the most effective path to impact the NS market performance. Accordingly, KIBS managers must value their FLEs as essential partners to achieve successful innovation from an internal and external perspective, and develop the appropriate mechanisms to guarantee their effective involvement along the NSD process...|$|E
40|$|We analyse the {{benefits}} and limitations of the integration of sourcing decisions into the <b>operational</b> <b>route</b> compilation task of a road-haulage company. A trucking company has to supply several customer sides. The demanded quantities are given. The trucking company has to decide which truck serves which customer location(s) (routing decisions). In contrast to previously reported fleet deployment problems the trucking company can select from several loading positions for each individual transport request (sourcing decisions). We propose a mathematical model for the integrated sourcing and vehicle routing decision problem. For this purpose, we merge a network flow model and a vehicle routing model. The first mentioned model represents the sourcing decision problem and the second model represents the fleet deployment (routing) decisions. We propose a matheuristic approach to solve the proposed integrated model. This matheuristic combines an algorithm for solving the network flow problem part and a metaheuristic that searches for least distance vehicle routes. Both algorithms interchange information through an adaptable distance matrix that is accessed by both algorithms. We use the proposed model-based approach to evaluate {{the benefits}} from integrating sourcing decisions in fleet deployment tasks and execute comprehensive computational experiments...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{characterize}} the dynamics typical of school bus operation, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers set out to gather in-use duty cycle data from school bus fleets operating across the country. Employing a combination of Isaac Instruments GPS/CAN data loggers in conjunction with existing onboard telemetric systems resulted in the capture of operating information for more than 200 individual vehicles in three geographically unique domestic locations. In total, over 1, 500 individual <b>operational</b> <b>route</b> shifts from Washington, New York, and Colorado were collected. Upon completing the collection of in-use field data using either NREL-installed data acquisition devices or existing onboard telemetry systems, large-scale duty-cycle {{statistical analyses were performed}} to examine underlying vehicle dynamics trends within the data and to explore vehicle operation variations between fleet locations. Based on the results of these analyses, high, low, and average vehicle dynamics requirements were determined, resulting in the selection of representative standard chassis dynamometer test cycles for each condition. In this paper, the methodology and accompanying results of the large-scale duty-cycle statistical analysis are presented, including graphical and tabular representations of a number of relationships between key duty-cycle metrics observed within the larger data set. In addition to presenting the results of this analysis, conclusions are drawn and presented regarding potential applications of advanced vehicle technology as it relates specifically to school buses...|$|E
40|$|The battery {{capacity}} of electric buses (EB) used for public transportation {{is greater than}} that of electric cars, and the charging power is also several times greater than that used in electric cars; this can result in high energy consumption and negatively impact power distribution networks. This paper proposes a framework to determine the optimal contracted power capacity and charging schedule of an EB charging station {{in such a way that}} energy costs can be reduced. A mathematical model of controlled charging, which includes the capacity and energy charges of the station, was developed to minimize costs. The constraints of the model include the charging characteristics of an EB and the operational guidelines of the bus company. A practical EB charging station was used to verify the proposed model. The financial viability of this EB charging station is also studied in this paper. The economic analysis model for this charging station considers investment and operational costs, and the operational revenue. Sensitivity analyses with respect to some key parameters are also performed in this paper. Based on actual <b>operational</b> <b>routes</b> and EB charging schemes, test results indicate that the EB charging station investment is feasible, and the planning model proposed can be used to determine optimal station power capacity and minimize energy costs...|$|R

40|$|The aim of Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) is {{to enhance}} the {{capacity}} of the airspace while satisfying Air Traffic Control constraints and airlines requests to optimize their operating costs. This paper presents a design of a new route network that tries to optimize these criteria. The basic idea is to consider direct routes only and to vertically separate intersecting flows of aircrafts by allocating distinct flight levels. This problem is a graph coloring problem that we tackle using Constraint Programming and a greedy algorithm to find cliques of the constraint graph which are used to post global constraints. Through the search for optimal solutions minimizing the number of distinct flight levels allocated, symmetries among equivalent flight levels are dynamically broken, and the variable ordering is guided by the cliques found in the first static step. With an implementation using FaCiLe, our Functional Constraint Library, optimality is achieved for all flow sizes except the smallest one, while the corresponding number of flight levels could fit in the current airspace structure. However, many other constraints should be added to this very simplified model to obtain an <b>operational</b> <b>route</b> network, such that the conclusion is rather the validation of the concept of vertical separation of large flows. This graph coloring technique has also been tested on various benchmarks, featuring good results on real-life instances, which systematically appear to contain large cliques...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{determine}} the prevalence and causes of ocular morbidity among commercial intercity vehicle drivers in Jos, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey of registered commercial intercity vehicle drivers at the Bauchi Road Motor Park Jos. The study instrument was a pretested semi-structured questionnaire. Information obtained included demographic data, <b>operational</b> <b>route,</b> and ocular history. Each participant had a detailed ocular examination. The principal cause of visual loss for each eye {{and for the}} person was documented in accordance with WHO guidelines. Results: Two hundred and sixty eight 268 drivers were recruited and assessed (survey coverage: 82. 5 %). Their age ranged from 20 - 90 years (mean: 44. 2, SD 9. 2). Most 158 (71. 5 %) respondents had ocular symptoms, the most common were difficulty in reading small prints 78 (35. 3 %), itching 56 (25. 3 %), and poor distant vision 17 (7. 7 %). Eight (3. 6 %) drivers complained of glare. Ten (4. 5 %) drivers had a visual acuity of < 6 / 12 and thus did not qualify to possess a driving licence. The prevalence of ocular morbidity was 72. 9 % (161 / 221). The most prevalent ocular morbidities were presbyopia (42. 5 %), allergic conjunctivitis (26. 2 %), cataract (8. 6 %), refractive errors and pterygium (2. 7 %). One (0. 5 %) respondent had advanced chronic glaucoma. Conclusion: A significant number of drivers {{do not have the}} minimum visual requirement for driver′s licensure.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the guidance methodology needed to implement networks of autonomously-flown unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) controlled by centralized ground stations (GSs). The intended operations {{would take place}} within a local area with a diameter of less than 10 km for most applications but potentially as large as 50 - 100 km. UAVs in these networks are envisioned to be potentially quite small and inexpensive but capable of automated flight orientation and stability with guidance updates provided by the GS at 0. 5 to 2 second intervals. The GS also provides GNSS differential corrections and integrity information to support sub-meter-level 95 % navigation accuracy with 10 - 7 error bounds in the 3 - 10 meter range. Position and timing solutions for each UAV are relayed back to the GS and support both <b>operational</b> (<b>route</b> planning) and tactical (path updating) guidance. This guidance needs to insure safe separation between UAVs within the network and (depending on the airspace used) separation from "out-of-network " UAVs as well as manned aircraft. The proposed guidance approach centers around "zones of influence " surrounding each UAV that include allowances for navigation error, UAV guidance error, and ground-system guidance error. The amount of error allocated to each error source depends upon the degree of error correlation between each UAV and its neighbors {{as well as the}} required probabilities of safe separation that must be maintained. The ground system maintains and updates zones of influence for each UAV within its operational area and guides each UAV it controls to remain within a "zone of operations " to insure that all UAV movements it commands avoid collisions with other vehicles or the ground. This paper provides examples of how this is done and how adjustments are made to reflect changes in navigation performance and the influx of UAVs operating outside the network...|$|E
