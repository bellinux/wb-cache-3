The destruction surprised the cast as they were more used to optical effects in the series. Costume designer Robert Blackman created the Vedek costumes. Crew-members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} types and sizes of horse {{were used in}} war, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of warfare. The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply. Throughout history, mules and donkeys as well as horses {{played a crucial role}} in providing support to armies in the field.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as {{the positions of}} sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); {{this can be accomplished}} roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E

5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Betelgeuse—envisioned by McDowell as a winged demon, who takes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> {{of a short}} Middle Eastern man, is also intent on killing the Deetzes rather than scaring them, and wanted to rape Lydia rather than marry her. In {{this version of the}} script, Betelgeuse only needs to be exhumed from his grave to be summoned, after which he is free to wreak havoc; he cannot be summoned or controlled by saying his name three times, and wanders the world freely, appearing to torment different characters in different manifestations. McDowell's script also featured a second Deetz child, nine-year-old Cathy, the only person able to see the Maitlands and the subject of Betelgeuse's homicidal wrath in the film's climax, during which he mutilates her while {{in the form of a}} rabid squirrel before revealing his true form.|$|E
5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations {{goes hand in hand with}} the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E

The Meiji constitution was largely based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of constitutional monarchy found in nineteenth century Prussia and the new Diet was modeled partly on the German Reichstag and partly on the British Westminster system. Unlike the post-war constitution, the Meiji constitution granted a real political role to the Emperor, although in practice the Emperor's powers were largely directed {{by a group of}} oligarchs called the genrō or elder statesmen.|$|E
5|$|They were {{supported}} by architects Anatoliy Krushynskyi, Tamara Tselikovska, and Fedir Zaremba, who were responsible for designing the underground vestibule. While the redesign was taking place, construction on the station's original utilitarian design continued. The new design was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of a Kievan Rus' temple, featuring unique mosaics situated throughout the station. The central hall's height was increased, and the original design's pylons were replaced with much lower columns, finished off with white marble and matte polish. In particular, the white ceiling was divided with diametrical mosaic stripes with brick grouting on the sides, completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko.|$|E
5|$|When Dante next meets Trish, she betrays him {{and reveals}} that she too {{is working for}} Mundus, but when her life is endangered, Dante chooses to save her.

Yet when he finally confronts Mundus, {{who is about to}} kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power, thus allowing him to take <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of Sparda. Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor, suspecting {{that the}} {{wardrobe}} contains the evil George fears, opens {{it to find}} its contents are simply clothes and toys, including a doll house. The Doctor suddenly recalls from Alex's photo album that Claire did not appear pregnant in {{the weeks leading up}} to George's supposed birth, causing Alex to remember the fact that Claire was unable to have children. The Doctor asserts that George is a Tenza child, an empathic alien who took <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of Alex and Claire's desired child through a perception filter, and has the ability to literally lock away his fears in the wardrobe. George begins to panic from this revelation and the Doctor and Alex are pulled into the wardrobe, joining Rory in the dollhouse. As the dolls descend on the three, the Doctor calls out to George to face his fears; George is able to open the wardrobe and appears in the dollhouse, but the dolls turn to advance on him. The Doctor realises that George is still frightened that Alex and Claire plan to send him away, having mistakenly interpreted a conversation they had earlier that night; Alex rushes through the dolls to embrace George as his son. They all soon find themselves back at the estate, restored to normal. Claire returns the next morning to find George no longer scared while Alex and the Doctor make him breakfast. After being thanked, the Doctor rejoins his companions to set off for their next adventure.|$|E

To study the two factors of workpiece displacement and motional electromotive force, a static model, an incomplete motional model {{and a complete}} motional model are created. The incomplete motional model is simulated by the finite element software COMSOL, while the complete motional model is simulated by another finite element software Flux. To ensure the correctness of the model, the static model is created by both softwares. For the specific system treated in this paper, {{the results show that}} when the workpiece velocity is below 100 m/s, the workpiece displacement has only a small effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forming</b> velocity.
