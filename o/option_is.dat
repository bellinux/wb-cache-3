5|$|Debian offers {{different}} network installation methods. A minimal install of Debian {{is available}} via the netinst CD, whereby Debian is installed {{with just a}} base and later added software can be downloaded from the Internet. Another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to boot the installer from the network.|$|E
5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{a challenge for}} cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second <b>option</b> <b>is</b> a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E
5|$|A second <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} spreads in which unequal number of <b>options</b> <b>are</b> {{simultaneously}} purchased and written. When more <b>options</b> <b>are</b> written than purchased, it is a ratio spread. When more <b>options</b> <b>are</b> purchased than written, it is a backspread.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to realign the A2100 {{north of}} the junction, but this <b>option</b> <b>was</b> less {{favourable}} due to environmental concerns.|$|R
40|$|The {{trouble with}} <b>options</b> <b>is</b> {{that too many}} <b>options</b> <b>are</b> granted to too many people. Most <b>options</b> <b>are</b> granted below the top-executive level, and <b>options</b> <b>are</b> often an inefficient way to attract, retain and motivate {{executives}} and (especially) lower-level employees. Why, then, <b>are</b> <b>options</b> so prevalent? We discuss several explanations including changes in corporate governance, reporting requirements, taxes, the bull market and managerial rent-seeking. We also offer an alternative hypothesis that we believe explains the over-use of options and several apparent puzzles: boards and managers falsely perceive stock <b>options</b> to <b>be</b> inexpensive because of accounting and cash-flow considerations. ...|$|R
5|$|A third bore of the tunnel, {{replacing}} the old Victorian northbound bore, was proposed by Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson in 1989, but {{had yet to}} see any progress towards construction over a decade later. This <b>option</b> <b>is</b> not currently favoured by TfL due to technical problems with construction and engineering, difficulty tying in with the existing road network, and concern about increased traffic on the A12.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{to insert}} a small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not}} be as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} use {{a common}} airframe, with three Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise <b>option,</b> <b>is</b> , or six hours. However, range {{can be extended}} further when the five underfloor fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks fitted in the cabin. Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. At least 14 Merlin HM2s will be assigned to the carrier.|$|E
50|$|<b>Options</b> {{contracts}} have <b>been</b> {{known for}} many centuries. However, both trading activity and academic interest increased when, as from 1973, <b>options</b> <b>were</b> issued with standardized terms and traded through a guaranteed clearing {{house at the}} Chicago Board Options Exchange. Today, many <b>options</b> <b>are</b> created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated options exchanges, while other over-the-counter <b>options</b> <b>are</b> written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, {{one or both of}} which may be a dealer or market-maker. <b>Options</b> <b>are</b> part of a larger class of financial instruments known as derivative products or simply derivatives.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Multi-asset <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>options</b> with payoffs {{affected}} {{by at least}} two underlying instruments. These instruments can be assets such as stocks, indices, currencies or commo-dities. An important factor infl uencing values of multi-asset <b>options</b> <b>is</b> correlation among log-returns of underlying assets. Thus the <b>options</b> <b>are</b> also called correlation options. In the paper there are presented description and models for pricing selected correlation options: quotient, product, spread and two-color rainbow <b>options.</b> There <b>are</b> also given some exam-ples of their use on the grain market in Poland...|$|R
5|$|David decides the {{cheapest}} <b>option</b> <b>is</b> for Dunder Mifflin {{to buy out}} the Michael Scott Paper Company. Jim has learned the company's financial situation from Pam, but feigns uncertainty when asked if Michael {{is likely to be}} interested in a buyout. At David and Charles's orders, Jim brings the idea of a buyout to Michael. While there he also reassures Michael that Dunder Mifflin is unaware of his company's financial situation. Dwight learns from a past client that Michael has been begging customers for more money and informs Charles, but Charles refuses to listen, having been embarrassed by Dwight's earlier ideas.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Universal Music {{announced}} that the album would be reissued {{in a number of}} formats in May. The deluxe <b>option</b> <b>is</b> a set of four CDs or 9 LPs containing a new remix of the three concerts in full, a DVD containing previously unseen video footage, a hardback book and other memorabilia. The original LP was reissued in 180g vinyl as per the original release with the original 1972 mix, with the audio available for digital download through popular providers.|$|E
5|$|The remake takes {{advantage}} of the Wi-Fi feature of the Nintendo DS {{in the form of a}} Mail/Mognet system similar to Final Fantasy IX. Various moogles in the game allow the player to send email to others. Players are also able to send mail to various characters in the game as well as to other players. Side quests can also be unlocked using this system, such as the quest to unlock the Onion Knight. An interruption-save <b>option</b> <b>is</b> also available that lets the player turn off the DS and continue when turning it back on. Like in the original, there is no way to make permanent saves while inside a dungeon.|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new test to {{evaluate}} whether <b>options</b> <b>are</b> a redundant asset class. The methodology permits to test between two sets of competing option pricing models: the deterministic volatility models and the stochastic models. In the deterministic volatility framework, <b>options</b> <b>are</b> redundant assets and their payoff can be replicated by dynamic trading in the underlying and the risk-free assets. A stochastic model introduces an additional risk factor and in this setting <b>options</b> <b>are</b> {{needed in order to}} complete the market. The procedure relies on principal components methods. The Monte Carlo simulations reported in the article indicate that the new procedure provides simple and useful diagnostics for detection if <b>options</b> <b>are</b> redundant. We apply the method to S&P 500 index and options with different moneyness. The empirical results suggest that <b>options</b> <b>are</b> not redundant. ...|$|R
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other <b>option</b> <b>is</b> known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the broach machines outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E
5|$|Trevor {{eventually}} {{discovers that}} Michael set him and Brad up, and that Brad {{is not in}} jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael. Near {{the end of the}} game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit a friend that he hates, which Michael accepts. If the second <b>option</b> <b>is</b> chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death. If the first <b>option</b> <b>is</b> chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant. When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him. If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.|$|E
5|$|Undergraduate {{students}} are expected to fulfill most of the core requirements prior to the completion of their sophomore year; a wide variety of courses can be applied to this endeavor. Upon the completion of the Core Curriculum, students choose from approximately 50 major courses of study, in which they will receive their degree. One <b>option</b> <b>is</b> the personalized interdisciplinary major, which allows students to create their own course of study across various disciplines. School of Professional and Continuing Studies also awards bachelor's degrees; the Gabelli School of Business offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.|$|E

5|$|With 7.f4 White stakes {{out even}} more {{space in the}} centre and threatens to overrun Black's {{position}} with a quick e4-e5. After 7...Bg7 White can transpose to the main line of the Four Pawns Attack in the King's Indian Defence with 8.Nf3 0-0 9.Be2. A rarer <b>option</b> <b>is</b> 8.e5, the Mikenas Attack, against which Black can equalize with either 8...Nfd7 or the rarer 8...dxe5 9.fxe5 Nfd7.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to {{classify}} selection by {{the life cycle}} stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{costs and}} {{benefits}} of two Salmonella control options in broiler production were compared. The first <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to control Salmonella as set by Council Directive 92 / 117 /EEC, so-called Zoonosis Directive. The second <b>option</b> <b>was</b> more intense control programme, the so-called Finnish Salmonella control programme. The costs of controlling Salmonella in primary and secondary production and the direct and indirect losses due to Salmonella infection in humans in both <b>options</b> <b>were</b> compared.

5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which <b>option</b> <b>is</b> chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E
5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining <b>option</b> <b>is</b> liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E
