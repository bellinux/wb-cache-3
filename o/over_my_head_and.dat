2500|$|Hayakawa {{was known}} for his {{discipline}} and martial arts skills. While filming The Jaguar's Claws, in the Mojave Desert, Hayakawa played a Mexican bandit, with 500 cowboys as extras. On the first night of filming, the extras drank all night and well into the next day. No work was being done, so Hayakawa challenged the group to a fight. Two men stepped forward. Hayakawa said of the incident, [...] "The first one struck out at me. I seized his arm and sent him flying on his face along the rough ground. The second attempted to grapple and I was forced to flip him <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> let him fall on his neck. The fall knocked him unconscious." [...] Hayakawa then disarmed yet another cowboy. The extras returned to work, amused by the way the small man manhandled the big bruising cowboys.|$|E
60|$|This {{statement}} was curiously slurred over. I dragged the shirt violently <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> emerged staring.|$|E
60|$|Then the bag {{was pulled}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> arms, and in five seconds I found myself a {{prisoner}} and hardly {{able to move}} hands or feet.|$|E
60|$|When I {{took the}} jay {{carefully}} from the trap he played possum, lying limp {{in my hand}} till my grip relaxed, when he flew to a branch <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> squalling <b>and</b> upbraiding me for having {{anything to do with}} such abominable inventions.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; no. I {{wish the}} title could have passed <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> Silverbridge, <b>and</b> gone {{to you at}} once. I think we both should have been suited better. But there are things which one should not consider. Even in this place I may perhaps do something. Shall you attack us very bitterly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll loan you mine, for I {{shall not}} need it. And you must wave it <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> three times <b>and</b> say: 'By my mortal powers I {{transform}} {{you into a}} boy for the space of one year'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it. I {{was carried}} off by some {{students}} who were hazing me. They put a bag <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> took me in a boat, and I got mixed up.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Maid shall burn, {{and not the}} man," [...] and a {{flash of}} light went past me, the whinger flying <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{clipping}} into the water of the moat below.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] he demanded, [...] "how {{to throw}} a man <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> break his neck, for I am going to kill you, and I wish to know this thing before you die." ...|$|E
5000|$|In comments, Cee Lo Green {{called him}} a [...] "soul brother" [...] and said [...] "it was perfect". Levine added: [...] "It was so perfect, it was so tasteful too.. I wanna win this (expletive), so I really need, really need for you to pick me..." [...] Blake added: [...] "I'm clearly <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> here... <b>and</b> I'm already a fan of yours already". Javier {{eventually}} chose Adam Levine as his coach/mentor.|$|R
60|$|I {{was turning}} this <b>over</b> in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{wondering}} what their boorish conduct could mean, when I saw, as I rode from the village, a great T new carved upon a tree. I {{had already seen}} {{more than one in}} my morning's ride, but I had given no thought to them until the words of the beer-drinker gave them an importance. It chanced that a respectable-looking person was riding past me at the moment, so I turned to him for information.|$|R
6000|$|I {{remember}} clearly, at least, the shame, the despair, of {{the next}} morning, when I reviewed what I had done, and how I had swindled the poor honest porter: and, {{as if that were}} not enough, fairly burnt my ships, and brought bankruptcy home to that last refuge, my garret. The porter would expect his money; I could not pay him; here was scandal in the house; and I knew right well the cause of scandal would have to pack. [...] "What do you mean by calling my honesty in question?" [...] I had cried the day before, turning upon Myner. Ah, that day before! the day before Waterloo, the day before the Flood; the day before I had sold the roof <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>my</b> future, <b>and</b> my self-respect, for a dinner at the Café Cluny! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My infirmities must plead my excuse, madam," [...] {{replied the}} Lady; [...] "the life I must lead here ill suits with the years which have passed <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> compels me to waive ceremonial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then," [...] {{continued}} he, [...] "I {{am going}} to get upon some high place, and jump off, and hold the parachute <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> then I shall come down as light as a feather." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, hail {{that falls}} every evening here; and, till it {{comes close to}} me, it's like so much warm rain: but then it turns to hail <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> knocks me about like small shot." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yossi's song [...] "Cuz I'm a Jew" [...] (set to {{the tune}} of Johnny Cash's [...] "I Walk the Line") {{includes}} the line, [...] "Oh once a year I twirl a chicken <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> / <b>and</b> it wouldn't be that bad if it were dead / and there's a time when I go outside and burn my bread / cause I'm a Jew I do that too". Toiv has collaborated with Heshy Walfish on 15 humorous music albums on Orthodox Jewish themes for children. Many songs are parodies of mainstream songs that Toiv has adapted to convey Jewish messages. Toiv created the characters Kivi and Tuki, and the Shteeble-Hoppers, for these albums.|$|R
6000|$|... "Last evening. I {{walked in}} the garden of the hotel and they threw a sack <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I {{resisted}} <b>and</b> tried to cry out. They beat me until I was insensible and then brought me here, together with my travelling cases, which they removed from my room to convey the impression that I had gone away voluntarily. When I awakened from my swoon I was in this room, with the doctor bending over me." ...|$|R
60|$|Certain it is, however, that no alarm {{was raised}} {{even when the}} {{sergeant}} came to my relief, and in silence, save for the rustling of the foliage as we swayed to this side or that, the battle was continued until I felt the cruel fingers about my throat suddenly relax, while a warm liquid of a peculiar, salty odor poured down <b>over</b> <b>my</b> neck <b>and</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} two rough arms encircled my waist, {{and before}} I could attempt to free myself a cloth was thrown <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> I was lifted up and carried away, half suffocated and like an insentient bundle.|$|E
6000|$|... “Easily enough. We {{have but}} {{to fix a}} block to the arm of this tree <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> we can then run them up without difficulty. Come up, captain. You will see at once the {{advantages}} of the position.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{perceived}} we {{must get}} our chains loose, and that before we could do this these Selenites had to be beaten off. I faced towards the group of the three goad-bearers. Instantly one threw his goad at me. It swished <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> I suppose went flying into the abyss behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Conceive a jelly-fish such as sails in {{our summer}} seas, {{bell-shaped}} and of enormous size--far larger, I should judge, than {{the dome of}} St. Paul's. It was of a light pink colour veined with a delicate green, but the whole huge fabric so tenuous that it was but a fairy outline against the dark blue sky. It pulsated with a delicate and regular rhythm. From it there depended two long, drooping green tentacles, which swayed slowly backwards and forwards. This gorgeous vision passed gently with noiseless dignity <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> as light <b>and</b> fragile as a soap-bubble, and drifted upon its stately way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Worn to the stumps, now, {{too many}} of them, sir; and want new-hething, as our broom-squires would say; and I doubt whether {{most of them are}} worth the cost of a fresh bind. Not that I can say that of the young lord. He's {{foremost}} in all that's good, if he had but money; and when he hasn't, he gives brains. Gave a lecture, in our institute at Whitford, last winter, on the four great Poets. Shot <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> a little, <b>and</b> other people's too: but my Mary--my daughter, sir, thought it beautiful; and there's nothing that she don't know." ...|$|R
60|$|Another time, {{one of the}} servants, whose office it was to fill my trough {{every third}} day with fresh water, was so {{careless}} as to let a huge frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail. The frog lay concealed till I was put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I was forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent overturning. When the frog was got in, it hopped at once half {{the length of the}} boat, <b>and</b> then <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> backward <b>and</b> forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious slime. The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be conceived. However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alone. I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last forced it to leap out of the boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{friend of}} mine! oh no. I was hurrying {{back in the}} rain {{when he came up}} to me and held his {{umbrella}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> walked to the door with me. It was kind of him, I thought, because he was a stranger, and I had never seen him before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} get to him, but they held me back and took me down into the cabin. There I met our owner, who, when he saw me, threw a veil <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> bade me sit still. I was too terrified and too despairing about my father to think of disobeying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bother!" [...] said I; {{and when}} I {{got into bed}} I drew the clothes <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> sang that brave song all to myself. Doing it that way the words and tune didn't matter at all, but I felt the spirit of it, {{and that was all}} I wanted, and then I went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|Another {{moment and}} Meeko the {{squirrel}} had forgotten his fright and peril {{and everything else}} save his curiosity {{to find out who}} I was and all about me. He had to pass quite close to me to get to another tree, but anything was better than going back where the marten might be waiting; so he was presently <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> snickering <b>and</b> barking to make me move, and scolding me soundly for disturbing the peace of the woods. In summer Upweekis is a solitary creature, rearing his young away back on the wildest burned lands, where game is plenty and where {{it is almost impossible to}} find him except by accident. In winter also he roams alone for the most part; but occasionally, when rabbits are scarce, as they are periodically in the northern woods, he gathers in small bands for the purpose of pulling down big game that he would never attack singly. Generally Upweekis is skulking and cowardly with man; but when driven by hunger (as I found out once) or when hunting in bands, he is a savage beast and must be followed cautiously.|$|R
60|$|As I drove, I kept {{turning the}} matter <b>over</b> in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{trying to make}} a guess as to what sort of {{employment}} it could be which needed such curious qualifications. A strong physique, a resolute nature, a medical training, and a knowledge of beetles--what connection could there be between these various requisites? And then there was the disheartening fact that the situation was not a permanent one, but terminable from day to day, according to the terms of the advertisement. The more I pondered over it the more unintelligible did it become; {{but at the end of}} my meditations I always came back to the ground fact that, come what might, I had nothing to lose, that I was completely at the end of my resources, and that I was ready for any adventure, however desperate, which would put a few honest sovereigns into my pocket. The man fears to fail who has to pay for his failure, but there was no penalty which Fortune could exact from me. I was like the gambler with empty pockets, who is still allowed to try his luck with the others.|$|R
6000|$|I cannot {{pay this}} letter, because I give {{it at the}} latest moment to the mail-officer, who is going on board the Cunard packet {{in charge of the}} mails, and who is staying in this house. We are now selling (at the hall) the tickets for the four {{readings}} of next week. At nine o'clock this morning there were two thousand people in waiting, and they had begun to assemble in the bitter cold as early as two o'clock. All night long Dolby and our man have been stamping tickets. (Immediately <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> by-the-bye, <b>and</b> keeping me awake.) This hotel is quite as quiet as Mivart's, in Brook Street. It is not very much larger. There are American hotels close by, with five hundred bedrooms, and I don't know how many boarders; but this is conducted on what is called [...] "the European principle," [...] and is an admirable mixture of a first-class French and English house. I keep a very smart carriage and pair; and if you were to behold me driving out, furred up to the moustache, with furs on the coach-boy and on the driver, and with an immense white, red, and yellow striped rug for a covering, you would suppose me to be of Hungarian or Polish nationality.|$|R
60|$|In reply his lance came {{whirling}} {{in the air}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> mortally transfixed poor Foggarty of ours, who {{was behind}} me. Grinding my teeth and swearing horribly, I drew that scimitar which never yet failed its blow, {2} and rushed at the Indian. He came down at full gallop, his own sword making ten thousand gleaming circles in the air, shrieking his cry of battle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just as I {{was almost}} here I heard a twig snap behind me, or thought I did, and I jumped {{so as to}} get here and be safe. I didn't suppose anyone would be frightened by little me," [...] he explained. [...] "It was some jump!" [...] exclaimed Jumper the Hare admiringly. [...] "He went right <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> I was sitting up at that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] She sprang away. Heavy {{footsteps}} {{were coming}} up the path. I had just time enough to fling Miss Gilchrist's shawl <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> resume my seat, when a couple of buxom country wives bustled past {{the mouth of the}} quarry. They saw us, beyond a doubt: indeed, they stared hard at us, and muttered some comment as they went by, and left us gazing at each other.|$|E
60|$|Is was a bleak, uncomfortable day; but at night, by six bells, {{although}} {{the wind had}} not yet moderated, the clouds were all wrecked and blown away behind {{the rim of the}} horizon, and the stars came out thickly overhead. I saw Venus burning as steadily and sweetly across this hurly-burly of the winds and waters as ever at home upon the summer woods. The engine pounded, the screw tossed out of the water with a roar, and shook the ship from end to end; the bows battled with loud reports against the billows: and as I stood in the lee-scuppers and looked up to where the funnel leaned out, <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> vomiting smoke, <b>and</b> the black and monstrous top-sails blotted, at each lurch, a different crop of stars, it seemed as if all this trouble were a thing of small account, and that just above the mast reigned peace unbroken and eternal.|$|R
60|$|In {{the middle}} of the gravel-bank the water was only three inches deep, so I lay down on my back and, once again {{elevating}} my ponderous legs in the air, allowed a cataract of water to flow over me. Somewhat lightened, I advanced into the hole. It was deeper than I thought. I was up to the middle in a moment, and sighed as I thought of the boots-- full again. Before I reached the line the water was up to my shoulders; but it was the still water of the eddy. I soon caught the line and found that it was round a stump, as I had feared. With a heavy heart I eased it off--when lo! a tug sent an electric shock through my benumbed body, and I saw the salmon not three yards off, {{at the bottom of the}} pool! He also saw me, and darting in terror from side to side wound the line round me. I passed it <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> however, <b>and</b> was about to let it go to allow Anders to play it out and finish the work, when the thought occurred that I might play it myself, by running the line through my fingers when he should pull, and hauling in when he should stop. I tried this successfully. In half a minute more I drew him to within a yard of my side, gaffed him near the tail, and carried him up the gravel-bank under my arm.|$|R
500|$|Wan {{pitched the}} idea to Whannell of two men chained to {{opposite}} sides of a bathroom with a dead body {{in the middle of}} the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going <b>over</b> it in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. [...] "It was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," [...] Whannell said.|$|R
