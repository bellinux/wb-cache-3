40|$|The British ‘welfare state’ {{has been}} transformed. ‘Welfare’ has been {{replaced}} by a new ‘workfare’ regime (the ‘Work Programme’) defined by tougher state regulatory practices for those receiving <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits.</b> US-style mandatory community work programmes are being revived and expanded. This article, therefore, considers shifting public attitudes to work and welfare in Britain and changing attitudes to working-age welfare and <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits</b> in particular. It also considers the extent to which recent transformations of the state may be explained by declines in traditional labourist politics and class-based solidarity. Thus, we attempt to develop a richer understanding of changing public attitudes towards welfare and the punitive regulatory ‘workfare’ practices engaged by the modern state in the liberal market economy; reflecting on the nature of the relations between ideology, party policies, popular attitudes and their political impact...|$|R

40|$|When data {{on child}} poverty in 2003 / 04 were released, {{the fall in}} child poverty since 2002 / 03 was smaller than had been expected. Brewer et al.

Brewer et al. (2006), who analyse what happened to child poverty between 1998 / 99 and 2004 / 05, show that estimates of spending on tax credits received by families with children based on the FRS have been getting increasingly inaccurate over time compared with estimates made by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), with around £ 5 billion of spending on tax credits received by families with children going unrecorded by the FRS in 2004 / 05. However, a detailed comparison of {{estimates of the number of}} families with children receiving tax credits (or equivalent in <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits)</b> based on the FRS with the equivalent estimates based on the government's administrative data is confounded by the fact that HMRC estimates that the government is paying the child tax credit and the equivalent in <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits</b> to more lone parents than official statistics suggest live in the UK. ...|$|R

50|$|Shirebrook and Pleasley {{division}} in the east of Bolsover covers the parishes of Shirebrook and Pleasley. The towns {{of the same name}} make up most of the urban nature of the division, split by the more semi-rural area in the centre.In 2012, Shirebrook and Pleasley had a population of 13,300 and a population density almost three times that of Derbyshire as a whole. Whilst the area has a younger age profile than the county as a whole, with a higher proportion of people aged 16-24 years, it has a higher than average percentage of lone pensioner households.The division is the most deprived areas of the county, with higher than average levels of child poverty and children eligible for free school meals. The division's unemployment rate has halved in the past year, but it continues to have a higher rate of <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefit</b> claimants and a lower proportion of economically active residents than elsewhere in the county. Educational attainment levels in the area are low. Although attainment at GCSE level is slightly above the county average, attainment at foundation stage is amongst the lowest in the county and there is a significantly higher proportion of adults without qualifications. Absenteeism at both primary and secondary level is significantly higher than the county averages. Life expectancy in Shirebrook and Pleasley is low and a significantly higher than average proportion of people have their day-to-day activities limited by a health problem or disability. Mortality rates are considerably higher than average, with early deaths from cancer being particularly prevalent. However, the area performs better than Derbyshire overall on the rate of alcohol-related hospital admissions for all ages.|$|E

30|$|How {{does the}} {{previous}} literature explain the decreasing level of adequacy for SA and MIP from around 1994 onwards? Marchal et al.

The current study, rather than revisiting the analysis of the fundamental determinants of <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefit</b> levels, aims instead at exploring the relationship between adequacy of benefits and activation policies at the cross-country level, as explained in the conceptual framework of the previous section.|$|E
30|$|Over {{the past}} few decades many {{countries}} have experienced a sharp increase in recipiency rates for incapacity benefits, lone-parent benefits, non-categorised social assistance benefits or other types of <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefit.</b> While recipients of such benefits may face specific employment barriers, many of them can work, and they have gradually become another target group for labour market policies. 3 Activation strategies for labour-market inactive benefit recipients may involve making benefits for a particular target group conditional on immediate availability for work and acceptance of referrals to job vacancies, either by transferring them to an existing unemployment benefit or converting their benefit de facto into a type of unemployment benefit. For those with limited work capacity, requirements can include participation in “work preparation” or rehabilitation measures.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews how income-support systems affect {{labour force}} {{participation}} in the UK. The UK’s approach to social insurance is “basic security”, with modest, typically flat-rate, benefits; insurance-based benefits are relatively unimportant. Compared with the EU, the UK has high employment rates, but {{a high proportion of}} non-workers say that they are not working through disability. In general, the low generosity of <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits</b> means that positive incentives to work exist for almost all benefit recipients, but weak work incentives exist for those receive Housing Benefit, and for primary earners in couples who have low earnings. Recent reforms to strengthen work incentives have altered the in-work tax credits, rather than the benefit system, and recent reforms to the <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits</b> have involved toughening and extending job-search requirements. The two main political parties seem to agree that future reforms will involve more conditionality, a greater use of the private sector, and a unification of the different labour market programmes.

30|$|The main {{contributions}} of the paper are summarized as follows. Firstly, by employing the dataset on benefit levels of SA and minimum income protection (MIP) in 22 European countries in the period 1990 – 2013, the descriptive empirical analysis indicates a marked reduction as regards the adequacy of income support for inactive low-income individuals in European welfare states since 1994. This stylized fact, seemingly providing initial support for the “disincentive” view, constitutes the ground for the proceeding of the analysis on the interaction of provision of <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits</b> with activation. Second, the paper tests empirically the null hypothesis {{of the presence of}} a trade-off between the adequacy of benefit levels and the aggregate expenditure on ALMPs. The empirical analysis posits different specifications of the fixed effects model, in order to guarantee robustness of the results. The results indicate that the trade-off {{does not appear to be}} significant, in any of the tested specifications. Whenever significant, the sign of the coefficient indicating a covariation between <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits</b> and expenditure on activation is slightly positive. In other words, the “generosity” view seems to receive support from the data, indicating that it is the overall expenditure and degree of generosity of the welfare states that matters. A generous welfare state will provide both high <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits</b> and high expenditure on activation, whilst a less generous one will cut on the benefits without investing in activation. These results are proven robust to the introduction of a set of conventional controls related to the labor market.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the course of unemployment in OECD countries during the recent recession. The severity of the recession {{and the strength of}} macro policy responses varied from country to country. However, even after correcting for these differences, unemployment experiences were various. Unemployment generally rose by less in those countries which had strict employment protection legislation, as it did in those countries with relatively high collective-bargaining coverage. Various forms of work-sharing also helped some countries to dampen the rise in unemployment. So did increasing the generosity of <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefit</b> arrangements. The latter finding suggests that search theoretic approaches need to be modified. Institutions do matter and not just in the short run. Hysteresis effects could project their influence into the medium term...|$|E
30|$|Income Support is an (almost) {{unconditional}} <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefit</b> typically {{received by}} individuals who are not employed or are working fewer than 16 h a week. Entitlement for benefits depends on one’s other income, and its value varies with family size and composition. It is roughly comparable to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programme in the US, although recipients {{are not required to}} look for work. When ERA began, lone parents with children under age 16 could receive Income Support and were not required to look for work; currently, only those with {{children under the age of}} seven are exempt from a work search requirement. Once their children reach age seven, non-employed lone parents who are capable of and available to work must actively seek employment and would receive Jobseeker’s Allowance rather than Income Support.|$|E
30|$|Simple “textbook” {{economic}} {{models of}} labour-supply decisions and job search consider <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefit</b> levels as a de-facto wage floor. In these models, benefit replacement rates assume {{a central role}} since wage floors are the main factor determining people’s decision to work and exert job-search efforts. In reality, benefit receipt {{is not simply a}} choice but is associated with more or less well defined -- and more or less demanding -- eligibility conditions. Some of these conditions exclude certain individuals from the group of potential benefit recipients altogether. These provisions, which are sometimes referred to as entitlement conditions, serve as an initial “filter” that targets support measures to certain groups. For instance, individuals with short or interrupted employment records may not be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, while those with assets may not qualify for means-tested benefits.|$|E

50|$|Halton is a {{suburban}} area of mainly owner-occupied housing of which almost three-quarters is semi detached or detached. The area compares favourably with Leeds {{as a whole}} in relation to indicators of deprivation, with relatively low levels of crime and anti-social behaviour, low levels of households in receipt of means-tested and <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefits</b> {{and high levels of}} educational attainment. The area has a low level of people from BME backgrounds.|$|R
30|$|On one side, the “disincentive” view prescribes that {{benefits}} {{must be kept}} low not to distort work incentives, so that inactive low-income individuals would take part in activation programs {{rather than relying on}} passive benefits. Hence, assuming that the authorities take into account this trade-off for a representative (average) benefit receiver, we should as a result observe a trade-off between benefits and activation at the macro-institutional level as well. Frazer and Marlier (2009) in their overview about the adequacy of MISs across EU member states include a detailed list of the specific disincentives to take up work for inactive individuals. The stylized fact of increased obligations of welfare recipients at the European level, jointly with the erosion of <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefit</b> levels, has been highlighted as the potential realization of a trade-off between activation and benefits in Nelson (2013) for the period 1990 – 2007 in 19 European countries. The current paper aims at testing this hypothesis of trade-off against the following alternative hypothesis.|$|E
30|$|In a first step, I {{present the}} {{strategic}} instruments {{of the national}} policy makers in a stylized way. I illustrate {{the development of the}} welfare state in the different EU member states {{in the aftermath of the}} 2002 decision in Copenhagen. Several indicators characterizing welfare state generosity like the ratio of social expenditures to the GDP level, the social expenditures per capita and the net replacement rate that defines the <b>out-of-work</b> <b>benefit</b> level are described. In addition, the asymmetric application of the 2 [*]+[*] 3 [*]+[*] 2 rule in the different countries is discussed. Secondly, an analysis of the effects of the policies in the EU- 15 member states on the immigration flows is pursued. Using micro data from the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), I estimate the effects of a rich set of determinants that influence the individual migration decision and thus the migrant inflow to a destination country in the EU- 15.|$|E

The paper examines the ways in which such a combination of social security and labour market policies can be understood in political economic terms. The paper uses a theoretical framework drawing upon the ideas of commodification and proletarianizsation to argue that, rather than being concerned with the economic position of disabled people in Britain, the development of the Employment and Support Allowance and the Work Programme was concerned with relationships between the supply of labour and wage inflation, and with developing new welfare (quasi) markets in employment services.
