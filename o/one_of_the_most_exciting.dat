5|$|Harry Elmer Barnes {{called the}} book <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> and {{challenging}} {{in the field}} of education since Émile. (This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The psychoanalyst Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of John Dewey, and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered on moral education, despite Neill's recurrent insistence on the danger of moral teachings. Scholar Richard Bailey agreed with Carr's characterization.|$|E

25|$|The 2000–01 season saw <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> derbies of the Premier League era. Liverpool, {{having won}} the first derby at Anfield, {{completed}} the double with a thrilling 2–3 victory over Everton at Goodison in April, with the injury-time winner by Gary McAllister proving to be crucial {{at the end of}} the season in helping Liverpool qualify for the UEFA Champions League—which replaced the European Cup in 1992—for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The Sixers fifth {{match of}} the tournament proved to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> in BBL03, with the game going to a super over. However it {{was not meant to}} be for the Sixers. The club lost this game in heartbreaking fashion after only being able to conjure up one run from their super over. Scorchers all rounder Adam Voges picked off the run with a {{boundary}} from the first ball of Brett Lee's super over.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{he became}} the no. 2 in the world, owing to his winning the US Open in a five-set final over Arthur Ashe. This tournament was the only event {{of the year in}} which all the best players participated. Two months before at Wimbledon, Năstase {{narrowly}} lost to Stan Smith in an epic five-set final, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> championship matches there. Although Smith took the title, public sympathy lay with the volatile Romanian.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, {{he became}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> and dominant players {{to play in}} the QMJHL. In {{the first half of the}} season, he and rookie Angelo Esposito formed one of the most explosive duos in the League. He became equally renowned for skating in front of the opposing team's bench and twirling his stick around and banging the handle on the ice, as if to put a sword into a sheath, after scoring a goal, something that angered opposing players but captivated and inspired his head coach, Patrick Roy.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch {{travelled}} to the 1990 World Cup {{as one of}} the favourites, but {{the team}} failed to perform as expected. Gullit's knee injuries clearly hampered his play, and his only moment of brilliance was a superb dribble and shot against Ireland which helped the Netherlands qualify for the second round. There they met West Germany in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> games of the tournament, though the game was marred by an altercation between Frank Rijkaard and Rudi Völler. The Germans gained revenge for their defeat at Euro 1988 by beating the Netherlands 2–1 and going on to win the tournament.|$|E

After Trinidad put up a {{formidable}} 176 runs, Guyana answered back with 171 with 2 balls remaining. Narsingh was at the striker's end with Ramnaresh Sarwan at the bowlers end. Narsingh hit a 6 to win it for Guyana, capping <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> comebacks {{in the history of}} 20 over cricket.

Paddy Glackin was later {{replaced}} by Tommy Peoples, who was then replaced by Kevin Burke in May 1976. In the five years the Bothy Band were together, they emerged as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> groups {{in the history of}} Irish traditional music. Much of their repertoire was rooted in the traditional music of Ireland, and their enthusiasm and musical virtuosity set a standard for future Irish traditional performers.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2008 Red Bull Air Race World Championship in Detroit, Michigan, Windsor {{successfully}} {{put in a}} bid {{to become}} the first Canadian city to host the event.

25|$|The Second Test at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 11 March-15 March is {{regarded}} {{by many as}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> games of cricket ever played.

Harbhajan Singh took 7–123, including a hat-trick, {{which was the first}} Test hat-trick by an Indian bowler in 69 years of Indian cricketing history. India's woes continued, being dismissed for only 171, with McGrath taking 4–18 in a brilliant bowling performance. Australia enforced the follow-on, {{and at the end of}} day 3 India were 254/4, still 20 runs behind forcing Australia to bat again. For many spectators, commentators, and even players, the match and the series were as good as lost for India.|$|E

25|$|Herman's other bands {{include the}} Third Herd (1950–56) and various later editions during the 1960's. In the 1950s, the Third Herd {{went on a}} {{successful}} European tour.

In the early and mid 1960s, Herman gained a wider recognition by fronting <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> Herds to date that featured future stellar names like Michael Moore, drummer Jake Hanna, tenor saxophonist Sal Nistico, trombonists Phil Wilson and Henry Southall and trumpeters like Bill Chase, Paul Fontaine and Dusko Goykovitch. By 1968, the Herman library came to be heavily influenced by rock and roll. He was also known to feature brass and woodwind instruments not traditionally associated with jazz, such as the bassoon, oboe or French horn.|$|E
25|$|How do you sum {{up one of}} {{the most}} {{remarkable}} endings any of us will ever be fortunate enough to see? How do you sum up <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> bowl games ever contested? And how do you sum up what will one day be viewed as one of the most significant moments in the history of college football? I’m not exaggerating....Boise State beating Oklahoma in a New Year’s Day bowl game is college football’s equivalent to George Mason reaching the Final Four, with one extremely significant difference: George Mason had its chance to compete for the national title; Boise State does not. Like it or not, Boise State 43, Oklahoma 42 just became the single biggest argument to date for a college football playoff....Not only did they get in the game, they made a major statement on behalf of their mid-major brethren that none of us will soon forget.|$|E
25|$|Team New Zealand won race ten by 16 seconds, in {{what was}} widely {{reported}} as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> America's Cup races of all time. Barker looked to have been left behind by Spithill at the startline, but just managed to hold an overlap as the AC72's entered the three boat length circle at the reach mark. Team New Zealand took the 3 second lead, and increased it to 11 at the second mark. Oracle again showed their new competitiveness during the upwind beat, and the lead changed three times. As the boats approached the top mark on split tacks, Barker cleverly slowed the boat, and then aimed down to pass under Oracle at speed. The top mark split was only 1 second as Oracle rounded {{in front of the}} shore, and Aotearoa rounded the other mark. With the race still too close to call during the downwind leg, Spithill made the call to dip behind Team New Zealand rather than jibe. The gap almost instantly became 100 metres. Barker was able to hold this lead to the finish to take the series to 1–7.|$|E
