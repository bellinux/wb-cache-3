5|$|A {{white dwarf}} {{can also be}} cannibalized or {{evaporated}} by a companion star, causing the white dwarf to lose so much mass that it becomes a planetary mass object. The resultant object, <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> former companion, now host star, could be a helium planet or diamond planet.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> red dwarf Gliese 876. At {{the time of its}} discovery, the planet had the lowest mass of any known extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257+12. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 has {{a notable}} orbital arrangement. It {{is the first}} {{planetary}} system around a normal star to have mutual inclination between planets measured without transits (previously the mutual inclination of the planets <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> pulsar PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions). Later measurements reduced {{the value of the}} mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does not result in significant improvements relative to coplanar solutions.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their <b>orbits,</b> <b>the</b> major planets completely control <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of <b>the</b> other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large}} number of small bodies in its <b>orbit</b> (<b>the</b> Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> Sun twice for every three Neptune <b>orbits.</b> <b>The</b> <b>orbits</b> of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{specialized}} terms for synchronous <b>orbits</b> depending on <b>the</b> body <b>orbited.</b> <b>The</b> {{following are some}} of the more common ones. A synchronous orbit around Earth that is circular and lies in the equatorial plane is called a geostationary <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> more general case, when <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> is inclined to Earth's equator or is non-circular is called a geosynchronous <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> corresponding terms for synchronous orbits around Mars are areostationary and areosynchronous orbits.|$|R
5000|$|If [...] {{for some}} integer , <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> {{is called a}} {{periodic}} <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> smallest such value of [...] for a given [...] is called the period of <b>the</b> <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> point [...] itself is called a periodic point. The cycle detection problem in computer science is the algorithmic problem of finding the first periodic point in an <b>orbit,</b> and <b>the</b> period of <b>the</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|R
5|$|However, that meaning {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the process of accretion forming the planets. In this context, accretion refers to the process of cooled, solidified grains of dust and ice <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> protostar in the protoplanetary disk, colliding and sticking together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|In close {{binary star}} systems {{one of the}} stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass object <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> pulsar PSR J1719-1438. These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-9c {{is one of}} {{the first}} seven extrasolar planets, exoplanets, {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, and one of at least two planets <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> star Kepler-9. Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were the first exoplanets confirmed to be transiting their star. The planet's discovery was announced by the Kepler Mission team on August 26, 2010 after its initial discovery by Kepler. At the time, it was one of 700 planetary candidates noted by Kepler.|$|E
50|$|The {{planet has}} a minimum mass about quarter greater than Jupiter. It <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> {{star in a}} {{slightly}} eccentric orbit in a mean distance 20% further than Earth <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> Sun.|$|R
500|$|Some astronomers counter {{this opinion}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their <b>orbits,</b> <b>the</b> major planets {{completely}} control <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of <b>the</b> other bodies within their orbital zone. Although Jupiter does coexist {{with a large}} number of small bodies in its <b>orbit</b> (<b>the</b> Trojan asteroids), these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Earth accretes or ejects near-Earth asteroids on million-year time scales, thereby clearing its orbit. [...] Similarly, Pluto may cross <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance (i.e., they <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> Sun twice for every three Neptune <b>orbits).</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, Neptune is therefore gravitationally dominant.|$|R
50|$|HD 32518 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} which <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> K-type giant star HD 32518, located {{approximately}} 383 {{light years away}} in the constellation Camelopardalis. It has a minimum mass three times greater than Jupiter and <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> intermediate-mass giant star {{at a distance of}} only 0.59 AU in a very circular <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> <b>orbit</b> takes 10.35 months to complete one round trip around the star. This planet was detected by the radial velocity method on August 12, 2009.|$|R
5|$|Neptune has 14 moons (one {{of which}} is unnamed); the largest, Triton, {{accounts}} for more than 99.5 percent of all the mass <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> planet. Triton is large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, but, uniquely for a large moon, has a retrograde orbit, suggesting it was captured. Neptune also has six known inner regular satellites, and six outer irregular satellites.|$|E
5|$|Planetary {{science is}} the study of the {{assemblage}} of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Mercury {{was struck by a}} large object relatively late in its development, a collision which stripped away much of Mercury's crust and mantle, and explaining the thinness of Mercury's mantle compared to the mantles of the other terrestrial planets. If such an impact occurred, much of the resulting debris might still be <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> Sun in the vulcanoid zone.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>The</b> <b>orbit</b> of Triton (red) is {{different}} from most moons' <b>orbit</b> (green) in <b>the</b> <b>orbit's</b> direction, and <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> is tilted −23°.|$|R

5000|$|For orbital {{rendezvous}} to occur, both spacecraft {{must be in}} {{the same}} orbital plane, and the phase of <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> (<b>the</b> position of the spacecraft in <b>the</b> <b>orbit)</b> must be matched. The [...] "chaser" [...] is placed in a slightly lower <b>orbit</b> than <b>the</b> target. <b>The</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>orbit,</b> <b>the</b> higher the orbital velocity. The difference in orbital velocities of chaser and target is therefore such that the chaser is faster than the target, and catches up with it.|$|R
5|$|A Message from Earth (AMFE) is {{a high-powered}} digital radio signal {{that was sent}} on 9 October 2008 towards Gliese 581c, a large {{terrestrial}} extrasolar planet <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> red dwarf star Gliese 581. The signal is a digital time capsule containing 501 messages that were selected through a competition on the social networking site Bebo. The message was sent using the RT-70 radar telescope of Ukraine's State Space Agency. The signal will reach the planet Gliese 581c in early 2029. More {{than half a million}} people including celebrities and politicians participated in the AMFE project, which was the world's first digital time capsule where the content was selected by the public.|$|E
5|$|As {{he tries}} to {{investigate}} further, Quatermass finds that other figures in high levels of government have gained 'the mark' after coming across meteorites. Quatermass leaves the inquiry, then returns with Fowler to find that Broadhead has been 'marked' and now claims {{there is no problem}} with the project. Fowler takes Quatermass to meet with civil servant Rupert Ward, who has the authority to inspect the plant. Back at the Rocket Group, Leo and Paula deduce and discover with a radio telescope that an asteroid is <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> Earth invisibly and discharging the meteorites when it reaches the near point, 400 000 miles over Southern England every 14 hours.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E
50|$|HD 114783 b is an {{exoplanet}} {{that has}} a minimum mass almost exactly that of Jupiter. However, since the true mass is not known, {{it may be more}} massive, but not likely much.

50|$|HD 104067 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} which <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> star. This planet {{has at least}} 0.16 times the mass of Jupiter and takes 55.8 days to <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> star at a semimajor axis of 0.26 AU.|$|R
50|$|Results {{from the}} {{calculations}} can include the binding energy. In a stable <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> binding energy {{is a local}} minimum relative to parameter perturbation. At the innermost stable circular <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> local minimum becomes an inflection point.|$|R
5|$|Ground-based telescopes in California, Hawaii, the Canary Islands, Arizona, and Texas, {{as well as}} the Spitzer Space Telescope, {{were used}} to conduct these {{follow-up}} observations and verify Kepler-11b's existence. In particular, the detection of an orbital resonance effect between Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c confirmed the find. Kepler-11b's discovery was announced to the public on February 2, 2011. It is part of the first system discovered with more than three transiting planets, and is also part of the most compact and flat system yet discovered. Kepler-11's planetary system is the second known system to have multiple transiting planets, surpassing the three confirmed planets (two transiting) <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> star Kepler-9.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} located {{approximately}} 210 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Ara, <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> metal-rich and aged star HD 154672. This planet has a minimum mass five times that of Jupiter and orbits at about 60% {{the distance between the}} Earth to the Sun. Its orbit is very elliptical, which causes temperatures on the planet to vary significantly as it proceeds along its orbit. This planet was discovered in Las Campanas Observatory on September 5, 2008 using the radial velocity method (Doppler spectroscopy). Along with HD 205739 b, the planets were the first to be discovered by the N2K Consortium using the Magellan Telescopes.|$|E
5|$|HD 28185 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{approximately}} 138 light-years away from Earth {{in the constellation}} of Eridanus.
