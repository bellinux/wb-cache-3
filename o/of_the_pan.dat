40|$|M. A. Pan are {{naturally}} occurring depressions or closed basins {{and play a}} very important role in ecosystems. The East Rand is characterized by more than one hundred pans dotting its landscape. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> urbanisation on these pans is significant. To determine exactly how <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> on <b>the</b> East Rand has changed, a comparison was done between the characteristics and utilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> in 1992, as then described by Le Grange (1992) and the current situation in 2003. Water samples were also collected over a period of three months and analysed in <b>the</b> laboratories <b>of</b> Rand Water. <b>The</b> current utilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> leaves much to be desired. Informal settlements, industries, residential areas and mine dumps are all found on <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> floors. Large waste dumping sites are developing at five out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19 <b>pans</b> in <b>the</b> study area. This has severely negatively affected the water quality within <b>the</b> <b>pans,</b> and <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> bird life at thee pans. Continuous research is needed from government and private organisations on <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> found on <b>the</b> East Rand to improve their current quality and condition. Responsibility and proper management strategies must be implemented to protect <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> from negative human impacts...|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a mineralogical and geochemical study <b>of</b> <b>pans</b> {{situated}} in <b>the</b> Northern Cape Province with {{special emphasis on}} the clay minerals. From east to west the depth and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> increase and associated with this increased maturity <b>the</b> abundance <b>of</b> salt (halite and thenardite) and <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> green sediment are also enhanced. Chemically the sediments are dominated by SiO 2 that also dilutes Fe 2 O 3, K 2 O, Na 2 O, Al 2 O 3 and MgO (when associated with dolomite) concentrations. Authigenic calcite, dolomite, analcime and loughlinite (Na-sepiolite) occur in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> to <b>the</b> west and FTIR spectrometry indicates that all <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> host glauconite and/or celadonite. However, smectite, illite/smectite interstratification, kaolinite and/or chlorite and loughlinite only occur in some <b>pans.</b> <b>The</b> glauconite and/or celadonite does not occur as discrete mineral grains, but forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fine-grained matrix common to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> and {{no evidence of any}} precursor minerals were observed. <b>The</b> <b>pan</b> environment appears to present a closed, saline setting that is conducive for <b>the</b> direct precipitation <b>of</b> a mica with a chemical composition between that of glauconite and celadonite. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water-table on <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> th...|$|R

5|$|Although still {{billed as}} having been the most {{extensive}} television coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> American Games ever broadcast in the country, the CBC faced criticism {{for the amount of}} coverage it produced and broadcast from the 2015 Pan American Games. Only condensed, tape-delayed highlights of events aired on CBC Television, drawing comparisons to the similar practices imposed by NBC's coverage of the Olympics. Most events were streamed online, and pay television channel Sportsnet aired the soccer tournaments on TV, but events in some sports received only limited online coverage, or were not broadcast at all. Part-way through the Games, the CBC expanded its primetime coverage block, while broadcasts of a semi-final game in men's basketball on Sportsnet and the baseball finals online were added at the last minute. Critics perceived these last-minute changes as signs that the CBC had underestimated viewer interest in the Pan-Am Games.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E
5|$|Back in New York, {{executives}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host {{a broadcast}} of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. The executives first introduce him to Alan's work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary, The Last Road to Hell, depicting executions in several war-torn countries. One of the executives tells Monroe that Alan staged such dramatic scenes to get more exciting footage. Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which first follows the group's trek through the jungle. After walking for days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe's leg with a machete to save his life, but he quickly dies and is left behind. The remaining four locate the Yacumo. Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew forces the tribe into a hut and burn it down in order to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe criticizes the staged scenes and poor treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.|$|E

40|$|M. Sc. Owing {{mostly to}} <b>the</b> ephemeral nature, <b>pan</b> {{wetlands}} aren’t afforded {{the attention that}} other (arguably) more attractive or functional wetland types entertain. In the Kruger National Park, <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> its freshwater resources has focused mainly on <b>the</b> water quality <b>of</b> its rivers leaving pans almost entirely unaccounted for, until now. <b>The</b> aims <b>of</b> this study were to determine a baseline assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural, hydrological, physico-chemical and biological characteristics of eight selected seasonal <b>pans</b> in <b>the</b> Kruger National Park. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study show that <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> are relatively small (< 1. 3 hectares), shallow (from 0. 4 to 1. 1 metres), of various shapes and can hold a greater volume of water where greater depth and increasingly concave basin profiles are present. The physico-chemical characteristics typically showed high summer sub-surface water temperatures (up to 38 °C), anaerobic conditions, pH values of 6. 2 to 7, low alkalinity, varied conductivity, turbid conditions and generally {{could be described as}} oligotrophic in terms <b>of</b> nutrients. <b>The</b> dominant anion in most cases was sulphate. Iron was the dominant metal in <b>the</b> water chemistry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans.</b> Several dissolved metals in <b>the</b> water chemistry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> were relatively high in concentration including aluminium, zinc, copper, cadmium, lead and selenium when evaluated against national water quality standards. Overall, limited spatial and temporal similarities were observed between <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physico-chemical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. <b>The</b> sediment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> can be considered as high in organic content, generally moist and comprising of predominantly either very fine sand sediments or coarse sand with appreciable amounts of medium coarse sediments. In general, manganese was the most abundant metal in the sediments, followed by relatively high concentrations of chromium, nickel, copper and zinc when compared with international sediment quality standards. Correlations between metal concentrations, sediment size and organic content were not strong. Lastly, <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> grass cover for some pans show remarkably similar variation in <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> change with distance from <b>the</b> brim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> outward. <b>The</b> trees immediately surrounding <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> however, are diverse and generally correspond with earlier studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vegetation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kruger National Park...|$|R
5|$|From Russia, with Love was {{released}} in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers Jonathan Cape. The American edition was published {{a few weeks later}} by Macmillan. In November 1956 the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press, and the publication of From Russia, with Love was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile. The serialisation of the story in The Daily Express in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book; a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in Life on 17 March 1961, the US President John F. Kennedy listed From Russia, with Love as one of his ten favourite books. This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. There was a further boost to sales following the release of the film of the same name in 1963, which saw the sales <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
