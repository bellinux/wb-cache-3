Based on monofactorial {{comparison}} experiment, {{the following}} two excellent technological formations was derived {{for the production of}} starch-based totally-biodegradable tray via extruding, pelleting, slicing, and sucking molding: The first formulation: 40 % of starch, 12. 5 % of DOP, 5 % of EVA, 15 % of polyvinyl alcohol, 20 % of talc power and calcium carbonate, and 7. 5 % of other materials. The material temperature in high-speed kneader was about 90 ˚C, rotation velocity was 600 r/min, kneading duration was 5 ~ 10 minutes, diameter of <b>screw</b> <b>stem</b> of extruder was 90 mm, ratio of length versus diameter of <b>screw</b> <b>stem</b> (L/D) was 44, rotation velocity of the <b>screws</b> <b>stem</b> was 40 ~ 50 r/min.

30|$|After the {{self-drilling}} screws fractures, the shear connectors failed. However, {{screw caps}} of Group E and <b>screw</b> <b>stems</b> of Group F were still {{embedded in the}} concrete and they kept sliding along with the C-Channels. The parts of these screws were like minor shear connectors until they were secondly cut. This is why the data of specimens with shear connectors is more irregular than it of Group C during this process.|$|R
50|$|Auger {{drilling}} is {{done with}} a helical screw which is driven into the ground with rotation; the earth is lifted up the borehole by the blade of the <b>screw.</b> Hollow <b>stem</b> auger drilling is used for softer ground such as swamps where the hole will not stay open by itself for environmental drilling, geotechnical drilling, soil engineering and geochemistry reconnaissance work in exploration for mineral deposits. Solid flight augers/bucket augers are used in harder ground construction drilling. In some cases, mine shafts are dug with auger drills. Small augers can be mounted {{on the back of}} a utility truck, with large augers used for sinking piles for bridge foundations.|$|R

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} bone remodeling around prostheses, a segmental replacement for the goat tibia was designed, using a conical, screw-threaded, hydroxyapatite-coated stem for fixation. Eight goats were provided with the implant, seven of which loosened within 10 days post-operatively, displaying progressive radiolucency and gross rotational motion. The eighth one also loosened radiographically, but developed a stabilizing callus bridge to prevent motion. A second design of similar shape and coating, but lacking the screw threads, was designed and also applied in eight animals. In this case, no loosening occurred in the first 6 weeks post-operatively. It is concluded that the application of <b>screwed</b> intramedullary <b>stems</b> for prosthetic fixation is not a viable concept, because the threads prevent the stem from subsiding and restabilizing when minor initial interface stress-relaxation and remodeling has occurred...|$|R
60|$|About {{this time}} {{some of the}} more ardent spirits in the village, not {{satisfied}} with an occasional hunt when a deer broke out and roamed over the downs, took to poaching them in the woods. One night, a hunt having been arranged, one of the most daring of the men secreted himself close to the keeper's house, and having watched the keepers go in and the lights put out, he actually succeeded in fastening up the doors from the <b>outside</b> with <b>screws</b> and pieces of wood without creating an alarm. He then met his confederates at an agreed spot and the hunting began, during which one deer was chased to the house and actually pulled down and killed on the lawn.|$|R
40|$|Knee {{revision}} using constrained implants {{is associated}} with greater stresses on the implant and interface surfaces. The present report describes a case of failure of the screw coupling between the stem and the femoral component. The cause of the failure is surmised with outline of the treatment in this case with extensive femoral bone loss. Revision implant stability was augmented {{with the use of}} a cemented femoral <b>stem,</b> <b>screw</b> fixation and the metaphyseal sleeve of an S-ROM modular hip system (DePuy international Ltd) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{suffered a}} major fire in 1765 and was rebuilt again {{according to the}} style of French architecture, that is to say, with large walls composed of rough stone called rubble that had been squared and covered in plaster. The architecture, which is very utilitarian, is rudimentary and has little ornamentation. The gable roof prevents the accumulation of snow in winter. The structure, being less massive and simpler to build meant a lower risk of fire. Finally, esses are used to reinforce the structure with <b>stems</b> <b>screwed</b> into the wood frame.|$|R
30|$|The {{stability}} of the implant-abutment connection comes from both the screw function and the frictional resistance between the conical, contacting metallic surfaces of the connection [10]. An abutment screw provides stability via a clamping force [11, 12]. When rotational torque {{is applied to the}} screw, the screw elongates and causes stress on the stem and threads. After that, elastic recovery of the <b>screw</b> occurs, the <b>stem</b> and threads of the screw are in tension and a clamping force is created, pulling the abutment and the implant together. This clamping force is parallel to the axis of the implant and is also known as preload. The preload value is directly proportional to screw elongation. The more screw elongation remains after elastic recovery, the greater is the preload value.|$|R
40|$|Osseointegration {{is vital}} to the success of total knee arthroplasty. This {{intimate}} bone integration however, mostly occured on the femoral component but not on the tibial component. Failure to achieve sufficient primary fixation of the tibial component has been regarded as the major factor affecting bone growth. The problem would be more apparent under eccentric loading which created complex rocking motions in both flexion and extension during gait. Fixation features in terms of protrusion on the undersurface of the tibial component include flange, <b>screws</b> and <b>stem.</b> In this study, the effect of three fixation features under physiological loading was analysed using non-linear contact finite element analysis. Three dimensional model of a human tibia was reconstructed from CT dataset. Three different tibial compartments â€” the cross-flange, the linear flange and the tapered cylindrical shaft â€” were modeled without the polymeric tibial insert. The component was then positioned on the tibial plateau and bone preparation was virtually simulated. Each model was then meshed with solid tetrahedrals and material properties were assigned to the bone and the prostheses. Coefficient of friction between the bone and the implant was set to 0. 3. Pressure was applied on the medial plateau with magnitude corresponds to an eccentric load of 1250 N. Non-linear contact analysis was performed on each of the three components, together with a validated micromotion algorithm to predict instability at the bone-implant interface. Results showed that the cross flange was the most stable under eccentric load with micromotion values did not exceed the threshold limit for osseointegration...|$|R
5000|$|A screw is a {{mechanism}} that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. [...] It {{is one of}} the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called threads around the <b>outside.</b> [...] The <b>screw</b> passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads {{on the inside of the}} hole that mesh with the screw's threads. When the shaft of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood. In screw mechanisms, either the screw shaft can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object, or a threaded collar such as a nut can rotate around a stationary screw shaft. [...] Geometrically, a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.|$|R
40|$|Screw feeders {{are used}} to remove {{material}} from hoppers and bins at a controlled rate. The evenness of the flow in the bin depends on the drawdown pattern, which in turn depends on the screw and hopper design, shape of the particles and wall friction effects. A key design requirement {{is to ensure that}} a progressive increase in the screws volumetric capacity is achieved along {{the entire length of the}} hopper's opening so as to produce even drawdown. If this is not achieved then compositional variations in the outgoing stream and other operational problems (such as caking) can be created. Screw designs to date have been generally based on analytical models and at times the predicted flow pattern is not achieved. In this study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to predict particle transport in a horizontal screw feeder system for a range of conventional screw designs including a variable screw pitch, variable <b>screw</b> flight <b>outside</b> diameters and variable core diameters. The influence of screw choice on the particle mass flow rate, the evenness of particle drawdown from the hopper, power consumption, screw wear and wall friction variations are all investigated. Important features captured by DEM that are not accounted for by the analytic model and which vary strongly between competing screw designs, include the particle circulation in the hopper, shearing of the particle bed in the trough just <b>outside</b> the <b>screw</b> and the spatially varying particle force along the hopper which leads to non-uniform drawdown and to the existence of large stagnant or slow moving zones. The screw design and consequent flow patterns also strongly affect the power draw with variations up to a factor of three and screw wear with large changes in their distribution and magnitude. Finally, the surface frictional properties of the screw are shown to strongly influence the rate of bed compaction within and along the screw leading to strong variation in mass flow rate, uniformity of drawdown and power draw...|$|R
40|$|Cervical {{pedicle screw}} {{fixation}} {{is an effective}} procedure for stabilising an unstable motion segment; however, it has generally been considered too risky due to the potential for injury to neurovascular structures, such as the spinal cord, nerve roots or vertebral arteries. Since 1995, we have treated 144 unstable cervical injury patients with pedicle screws using a fluoroscopy-assisted pedicle axis view technique. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the efficacy of this technique in accurately placing pedicle screws to treat unstable cervical injuries, and the ensuing clinical outcomes and complications. The accuracy of pedicle screw placement was postoperatively examined by axial computed tomography scans and oblique radiographs. Solid posterior bony fusion without secondary dislodgement was accomplished in 96 % of all cases. Of the 620 cervical pedicle screws inserted, 57 (9. 2 %) demonstrated screw exposure (50 % of the <b>screw</b> <b>outside</b> the pedicle). There was one case in which a probe penetrated a vertebral artery without further complication and one case with transient radiculopathy. Pre- and postoperative tracheotomy was required in 20 (13. 9 %) of the 144 patients. However, the tracheotomies were easily performed, because those patients underwent posterior surgery alone without postoperative external fixation. The placement of cervical pedicle screws using a fluoroscopy-assisted pedicle axis view technique provided good clinical results and a few complications for unstable cervical injuries, but a careful surgical procedure was needed to safely insert the screws and more improvement in imaging and navigation system is expected...|$|R
40|$|Coating {{characteristics}} such as composition, crystallite features and topography collectively impact the cell response. The influence from splats {{has not yet been}} assessed for hydroxyapatite (HAp) thermal spray coatings. The objective of this work is to (a) survey the topography on commercial implants, (b) ascertain topography formation from single splats, and (c) determine the osteoclast resorption pattern on a topographically refined coating compared to dentine. Coatings on dental implants, an orthopedic <b>screw,</b> a femoral <b>stem</b> and a knee implant were studied for reference. The effects of substrate pre-heat, roughness, spray distance and particle size on the coating roughness and topography were studied. Human-derived osteoclasts were placed on a coating with refined topography and compared to dentine, a polished coating and polished sintered HAp. A pre-heat of at least 200 °C on titanium was required to form rounded splats. The greatest influence on coating roughness and topography arose from particle size. A 2 -fold increase in the mean particle size from 30 to 72 μm produced a significant difference (P< 0. 001) in roughness from 4. 8 and 9. 7 μm. A model is shown to illustrate topography formation, nanostructure evolution on single splats, and the topography as seen in commercial implants. Osteoclasts showed a clear preference for activity on coatings with refined topography. A one-way ANOVA test revealed a significantly greater pit depth (P= 0. 022) for dentine (14 μm) compared to the as-sprayed and polished coating (5 μm). Coatings with topography display a similar number of resorption pits with dentine, but a 10 -fold greater number than polished coatings, emphasizing the importance of flattened droplet topography on implant surfaces.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} computer-assisted pedicle screw installation and its clinical benefit as compared with conventional pedicle screw installation techniques. MethodsTotal 176 thoracic pedicle screws placed in 42 thoracic fracture patients {{were involved in the}} study randomly, 20 patients under conventional fluoroscopic control (84 screws) and 22 patients had screw insertion under three dimensional (3 D) computer-assisted navigation (92 screws). The 2 groups were compared for accuracy of screw placement, time for screw insertion by postoperative thin-cut CT scans and statistical analysis by χ 2 test. The cortical perforations were then graded by 2 -mm increments: Grade I (good, no cortical perforation), Grade II (<b>screw</b> <b>outside</b> the pedicle 2 mm). ResultsIn computer assisted group, 88 (95. 65 %) were Grade I (good), 4 (4. 35 %) were Grade II (2 mm) violations. In conventional group, there were 14 cortical violations (16. 67 %), 70 (83. 33 %) were Grade I (good), 11 (13. 1 %) were Grade II (2 mm) violations (P< 0. 001). The number (19. 57 %) of upper thoracic pedicle screws (T 1 -T 4) inserted under 3 D computer-assisted navigation was significantly higher than that (3. 57 %) by conventional fluoroscopic control (P < 0. 001). Average screw insertion time in conventional group was (4. 56 ± 1. 03) min and (2. 54 ± 0. 63) min in computer assisted group (P< 0. 001). In the conventional group, one patient had pleura injury and one had a minor dura violation. ConclusionsThis study provides further evidence that 3 D computer-assisted navigation placement of pedicle screws can increase accuracy, reduce surgical time, and be performed safely and effectively {{at all levels of the}} thoracic spine, particularly upper thoracic spine...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of the {{mechanical}} testing of a new generation modular endoprosthesis, which has been designed to improve the results of mandibular reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The new cementless endoprosthesis consists of a male part, a female part (both with <b>screws</b> on the <b>stems),</b> connected via a dove-tailed connection and secured with a coronal screw. The endoprosthesis was fitted into standardized blocks of synthetic bone (Synbone AG, Malans, Switzerland). The set-up was fixed to an ElectroPuls testing machine at one end and loaded at the other end 25 mm away. Three specimens were loaded continuously until failure to determine the average load to failure of the construct. Five specimens were then loaded cyclically between 10 and 150 N until either failure or 500, 000 cycles. A finite element analysis was also performed on the set-up. RESULTS: Of the five specimens in the fatigue testing, only one survived while the other four either were bent or fractured at the stem of the clamped portion. The specimen that survived had very good bony contact with the prosthesis at the lower border. The connection of the modules via the dove-tailed design did not show any loosening. Finite element analysis showed areas of stress concentration at the superior surface of the stems to 188. 8 MPa. This was well below the yield strength of titanium alloy of 897 MPa. Statistical analysis performed for specimens 1 to 4 to calculated lower tolerance bounds on cycles to failure, representing the estimated minimum achievable cycles to failure at 90, 95, and 99 % of the population at 90 and 95 % confidence levels, showed that the estimated mean cycles to failure was 10, 132 cycles at the mean, minimum and maximum loads of 120 N and 18. 4 N respectively. CONCLUSION: Good bony contact seems to be essential at the lower border for long-term survival of the reconstruction. Small gaps increase the bending forces and thus shear stresses at the stem. The new design of the modular endoprosthesis is prone to stress concentrations at the superior surface of the stems. This is accentuated by the sharp screw threads of the stems. The loosening of the module connection seemed to have been stopped with the dove-tailed design...|$|R
