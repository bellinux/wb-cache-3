5|$|In the comitatus, {{there is}} {{consensus}} that vexillationes were c. 500 and legiones c. 1,000 strong. The greatest uncertainty concerns {{the size of}} the crack auxilia palatina infantry regiments, originally formed by Constantine. The evidence is contradictory, suggesting that these units could have been either c. 500 or c. 1,000 strong, <b>or</b> <b>somewhere</b> in between. If the higher figure were true, then there would be little to distinguish auxilia from legiones, which is the strongest argument in favour of c. 500.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida <b>or</b> <b>somewhere</b> to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
25|$|Although most dialects {{make this}} distinction, the actual realizations vary and are {{generally}} difficult for non-natives to distinguish. In some dialects of Swedish, including those spoken in Finland, this distinction is absent. There are significant {{variations in the}} realization of pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable <b>or</b> <b>somewhere</b> around the syllable boundary.|$|E

25|$|However, if a fielder {{takes up}} {{position}} at square leg <b>or</b> <b>somewhere</b> {{so as to}} block his view, or {{if there is an}} injured batsman with a runner, then the umpire must move somewhere else – typically either a short distance or to point {{on the opposite side of}} the batsman. If the square-leg umpire elects to stand at point, he is required to inform both the batsmen, the captain of the fielding team, and his colleague. He may also move to the point position later in the afternoon if the setting sun prevents a clear view of the popping crease at his end.|$|E
25|$|Candidate {{destinations}} included Guiana, {{where the}} Dutch had already established Essequibo, <b>or</b> <b>somewhere</b> near the existing Virginia settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because {{the presence of}} the older colony might offer better security and trade opportunities. It was thought, however, that they should not settle too near, since that might too closely duplicate the political environment back in England. The London Company administered a territory of considerable size in the region. The intended settlement location was {{at the mouth of the}} Hudson River. This made it possible to settle at a distance which allayed concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still provided the military and economic benefits of relative closeness to an established colony.|$|E
25|$|Infanticide in India, and {{elsewhere}} in the world, is a difficult issue to objectively access because reliable data is unavailable. Scrimshaw states that not only accurate frequency of female infanticide is unknown, differential care between male and female infants is even more elusive data. Reliable data for female infanticide is unavailable. Its frequency, and that of sex-selective abortion, is indirectly estimated from the observed high birth sex ratio; that is, the ratio of boys to girls at birth or 0–1 age group infants, or 0–6 age group child sex ratio. The natural ratio is assumed to be 106, <b>or</b> <b>somewhere</b> between 103 and 107, and any number above or below this range is considered as suggestive of female or male foeticide respectively.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the five}} {{required}} daily prayers, a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims {{are not the}} majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call to prayer (adhan), although {{it is supposed to}} be said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan as it is a recommended practice or sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque <b>or</b> <b>somewhere</b> else on the ground. The iqama, which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach shot silver atoms {{through an}} (inhomogeneous) {{magnetic}} field. In classical mechanics, a magnet thrown through {{a magnetic field}} may be, depending on its orientation (if it is pointing with its northern pole upwards or down, <b>or</b> <b>somewhere</b> in between), deflected a small or large distance upwards or downwards. The atoms that Stern and Gerlach shot through the magnetic field acted in a similar way. However, while the magnets could be deflected variable distances, the atoms would always be deflected a constant distance either up or down. This implied that {{the property of the}} atom which corresponds to the magnet's orientation must be quantised, taking one of two values (either up or down), as opposed to being chosen freely from any angle.|$|E

In Feng Shui Food, it is prepared by rolling a shucked oyster in bacon and skewering it with a cocktail stick, fried and served with a squeeze of lime. Joanna Pruess's book Seduced by Bacon includes a recipe for [...] "Angels and Devils", with the suggestion that [...] "a little hot red pepper sauce can transform them from heavenly to hellishly hot tasting, <b>or</b> <b>somewhere</b> inbetween." [...] Myles Bader, author of The Wizard of Food's Encyclopedia of Kitchen & Cooking Secrets, suggests serving angels on horseback on toast with a lemon wedge or hollandaise sauce.

Its surface is heavily scarred by craters, {{some of which are}} extremely large relative {{to the size of the}} moon: Pan, the largest crater, measures 100km across and is at least 8km deep. Another crater, Gaea, measures 80km across and is likely twice as deep as Pan. Amalthea has several prominent bright spots, two of which are named. They are Lyctos Facula and Ida Facula, with width reaching up to 25km. They are located on the edge of ridges.|$|E
