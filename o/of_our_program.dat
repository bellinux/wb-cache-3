2500|$|The Seattle group (originally the Seattle Artificial Kidney Center, {{later the}} Northwest Kidney Centers) started their home program in July 1964. [...] It was {{inspired}} by the fifteen-year-old daughter of a collaborator's friend, who went into renal failure due to lupus erythematosus, and had been denied access to dialysis by their patient selection committee. [...] Dialysis treatment at home was the only alternative and managed to extend her life another four years. Dr. Chris Blagg has stated that the first training predated the establishment of the home program: the [...] "first home patient wasn’t part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>program</b> at all, he was president of a big Indian corporation, lived in Madras, and he came to Seattle just before I came in ’63.

2500|$|Having lost 20 {{million people}} in the war, {{suffered}} German invasion through Poland twice in 30 years, and suffered tens of millions of casualties from onslaughts from the West three times in the preceding 150 years, the Soviet Union was determined to destroy Germany's capacity for another war. This was in alignment with the U.S. policy which had foreseen returning Germany to a pastoral state without heavy industry (the Morgenthau Plan). On September 6, 1946, James F. Byrnes made a speech in Germany, repudiating the Morgenthau Plan and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. (see Restatement of Policy on Germany) As Byrnes admitted one month later, [...] "The nub <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>program</b> was to win the German people [...] it was a battle between us and Russia over minds [...] " [...] Because of the increasing costs of food imports to avoid mass-starvation in Germany, and with the danger of losing the entire nation to communism, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan in September 1946 with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes' speech Restatement of Policy on Germany.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} new {{deterministic}} linear {{program for the}} network revenue management problem with customer choice behavior. The novel aspect <b>of</b> <b>our</b> linear <b>program</b> is that it naturally generates bid prices that depend on how much time is left until the time of departure. Similar to the earlier linear program used by van Ryzin and Liu (2004), the optimal objective value <b>of</b> <b>our</b> linear <b>program</b> provides an upper bound on the optimal total expected revenue over the planning horizon. In addition, the percent gap between the optimal objective value <b>of</b> <b>our</b> linear <b>program</b> and the optimal total expected revenue diminishes in an asymptotic regime where the leg capacities {{and the number of}} time periods in the planning horizon increase linearly with the same rate. Computational experiments indicate that when compared with the linear program that appears in the existing literature, ou...|$|R
