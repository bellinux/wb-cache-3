2500|$|The Stage 1 engine option used {{cylinder}} heads that, while using raw castings {{of the same}} pattern as {{all of the other}} Buick 455s sharing the same model year, were machined differently in order to accept larger valves (2.13" [...] intake and 1.755" [...] exhaust), and to produce smaller compression chambers for increased static compression ratio. The option also included a more aggressive camshaft, a specially tuned 4-barrel Quadrajet carburetor, more aggressive ignition timing,5/8inch <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> tube and a higher numerical final drive, and was available with either Turbo-Hydramatic 400 3-speed automatic transmission, or a Muncie M-22 4-speed manual transmission (although it was later discovered, and confirmed, that one 1970 GS Stage 1 convertible was produced with a 3-speed manual and a standard 3.64:1 Positraction axle ratio). Stage 1 cars equipped with air conditioning received a 3.42 axle ratio.|$|E

50|$|It {{differed}} from the standard M3 with a deeper, adjustable front splitter, higher rear double wing, doors in aluminium. Forged BMW Motorsport wheels, 17x7,5 in front and 17x8,5 in rear, stiffer suspension in front, x-brace and strut brace. Engine had raised compression (10,8:1), slightly changed intake and camshafts (264 deg duration), motorsport oil pump and double <b>oil</b> <b>pickups</b> in the special oil pan as well as special software for engine and VANOS, producing 295 bhp at 7100 rpm and 323 Nm at 3900 rpm. The M3 GT was around 30 kg lighter than the standard M3 and had a derestricted top speed of 275 kmh.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the wedge, the ball-stud block had two {{additional}} clean-out holes to remove casting sand, because the large bore made coolant {{in the water}} jacket very significant, and an additional oil drainback hole {{at either end of}} the block, due to demand for lubrication of the rocker arms. Suggestions to increase the size of the <b>oil</b> pump <b>pickup</b> to 3/8 in (compared to the 426's 1/2 in) never passed the endurance testing stage.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{non-performance}} SOHC {{version that}} is most easily recognized by its black stamped-steel oil pan. It also features a cast crankshaft, no oil squirters, a plastic <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> tube and less aggressive camshafts. It {{is found in the}} 1995-1998 Mazda Protege ES.|$|E
5000|$|VH45DEs {{made before}} 1994 used plastic timing chain guides, {{and over time}} these {{have been known to}} fail. This results in a noisy valve-train and parts of the plastic guides can end up in the sump and <b>oil</b> <b>pickup,</b> {{resulting}} in engine damage. Nissan changed to metal backed chain guides from 1994 onwards.|$|E
50|$|Even {{after passing}} through the <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> screen and the oil filter, debris can remain in the oil. It is very {{important}} to change the oil and oil filter to minimize the amount of debris flowing through your engine. This harmful debris along with normal engine wear in high mileage engines causes an increase in clearances between bearings and other moving parts.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} pickup makers {{producing}} modern replacements {{based on the}} original design, namely Jason Lollar, Curtis Novak, Seymour Duncan and Telenator in the US, The Creamery from Manchester, UK and <b>Oil</b> City <b>Pickups</b> from London UK are also available. Telenator currently is the only {{company in the world}} to offer actual CuNiFe threaded magnets in two versions of their pickups, with other manufacturers using FeCrCo and some using AlNiCo threaded magnets.|$|R
5000|$|Prevention of {{the engine}} {{experiencing}} oil-starvation during high g-loads, which is particularly useful in racing cars, high performance sports cars, and aerobatic aircraft. Dry-sump designs are not susceptible to the oil movement problems from high cornering forces that wet-sump systems can suffer where {{the force of the}} vehicle cornering can cause the oil to pool {{on one side of the}} oil pan, possibly uncovering the <b>oil</b> pump <b>pickup</b> tube and causing cavitation and loss of oil pressure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{numerical}} model is {{developed for the}} complete oil supply system of a scroll com-pressor. The system includes <b>oil</b> sump, <b>pickup</b> tube, <b>oil</b> gallery, bearings, and associated oil feed holes, vent, and port. There are two fluids, oil and gas, inside the system. The flow is numerically simulated as a heterogeneous Eulerian–Eulerian turbulent multi-phase flow. The investigation covers the entire working process of the scroll compressor from dry-start to steady state. Two design parameters, initial oil sump depth and viscosity, are studied comparatively. The detailed oil–gas flow inside the oil supply system {{is characterized by the}} field quantities. The physical mechanisms controlling oil supply rate are defined. The oil supply rate and the bearing prime time (the time after which oil is flowing through a bearing) are obtained. The results can be used to design and optimize the oil supply system to improve the reliability and efficiency of scroll compressors...|$|R
5000|$|Particles {{in the oil}} {{can also}} cause serious {{problems}} with oil pressure. After oil flows through the engine, it returns to the oil pan, and can carry along a lot of debris. The debris can cause problems with the <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> screen and the oil pump itself. The holes in the <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> screen measure about 0.04 sq in. [...] Holes of this size only pick up bigger pieces of debris and allow a lot of smaller pieces to flow through it. The holes in the screen are so big (relative to debris) because at low temperatures and slow engine speed the oil is very viscous and needs large openings to flow freely. Even with these large holes in the screen, it can still become clogged and cause low oil pressure. A [...]005 in coating on the screen can reduce hole size to about [...]03 sq in, which in turn reduces the flow of oil by 44 percent.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, the ATC200X got a {{complete}} redesign. The machine shared {{nothing in common}} with its predecessor than the name. It got an all new 199 cc four-stroke engine, white plastics which were notably sportier, longer suspension travel, and {{a complete}}ly resigned [...] "box" [...] frame, which was made of square tubing instead of round tubing for a significant strength increase. The ATC350X also got various updates, including white plastics and most notably a revised <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> point in the engine, to help reduce engine oil starvation when riding long wheelies.|$|E
5000|$|The Stage 1 engine option used {{cylinder}} heads that, while using raw castings {{of the same}} pattern as {{all of the other}} Buick 455s sharing the same model year, were machined differently in order to accept larger valves (2.13" [...] intake and 1.755" [...] exhaust), and to produce smaller compression chambers for increased static compression ratio.

50|$|A {{year before}} the {{introduction}} of the MAE, the single overhead cam two valve SCA was introduced. It was a 997 cc engine based on Ford Cortina 116E block that was designed for Formula 2, and featured the first totally Cosworth-designed head, Laystall forged crankshaft, steel main bearing caps and pistons with only one compression ring and one oil scraper ring each. Cylinder head to block sealing was by a head gasket incorporating Cooper Rings. The basic configuration was quite similar to Coventry Climax FWE on Lotus Elite including its SOHC reverse-flow design, except for a series of 7 spur gears (1 on crank, 2 intermediary gears on 2 fixed shafts mounted on the front cover back plate, 1 on the 116E camshaft used as a jackshaft, 2 on a common fixed shaft in the head, 1 on the camshaft) driving a 5 bearing camshaft and the Ford 5 main bearing iron block. The intake ports and the <b>oil</b> scavenge <b>pickup</b> for dry sump lubrication were canted 25 degrees, so they faced straight up and down, respectively, when the engine is mounted 25 degrees from vertical to the right for a lower center of gravity.|$|R
50|$|Several {{different}} types of lubrication systems are used. Simple two-stroke engines are lubricated by oil mixed into the fuel or injected into the induction stream as a spray. Early slow-speed stationary and marine engines were lubricated by gravity from small chambers {{similar to those used}} on steam engines at the time — with an engine tender refilling these as needed. As engines were adapted for automotive and aircraft use, the need for a high power-to-weight ratio led to increased speeds, higher temperatures, and greater pressure on bearings which in turn required pressure-lubrication for crank bearings and connecting-rod journals. This was provided either by a direct lubrication from a pump, or indirectly by a jet of <b>oil</b> directed at <b>pickup</b> cups on the connecting rod ends which had the advantage of providing higher pressures as the engine speed increased.|$|R
40|$|Oil spills have {{a global}} concern {{due to its}} {{environmental}} and economical impact. Various commercial systems {{have been developed to}} control these spills, including the use of fibers as sorbents. However, plant biomass is renewable resource that can be converted into useful materials and energy. Luffa, an agricultural waste, was used as a sorbent material. The present study examines the adsorption capacity of raw luffa fibers for different types of <b>oil</b> and water <b>pickup.</b> The investigation revealed that the efficiency of fibers to remove crude oil from sea water was related to the surface properties of the fibers, concentration of the oil, amount of the fibers, as well as the temperature of the crude oil. The results show high sorption efficiency of luffa fibers for different kinds of oil. This sorbent also exhibited a good reusability since the decrease in sorption efficiency did not exceed 50 % of the initial value after three sorption cycles...|$|R
50|$|Series 1 (2004-2008) RX-8 Renesis {{commonly}} {{suffer from}} engine failures between 80,000 and 120,000 miles due to premature apex seal wear from {{the lack of}} a center/middle oil injector which gets its oil from the oil metering pump. The rotor main bearing can also fail due to various problems like low oil pressure, and a lower viscosity oil was recommended in the North American market. The oil pan has a common problem of being crushed or bent during maintenance and can decrease the <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> tube flow causing main bearing failures as well. Modified Renesis engines can experience side seal failures due to a combination of exhaust back pressure and higher exhaust temperature. Overheating and heat expansion of housings can cause seals in the rotary engine to fail as well. Most of the issues can be circumvented by using a higher viscosity oil and adding 2 cycle oil to the gas.Flooding can occur in the RX-8 as in previous generations of rotary engine cars.|$|E
50|$|The 2.4 L (2389 cc) KA24DE {{was used}} in many Nissan cars and trucks. Most KA24DEs bound for the US {{were built in the}} Mexican city of Aguascalientes, with the {{exceptions}} of the 240SX, 1994-97 Altima (re-badged Bluebird SSS), and the U13 Bluebird released in Australia with FWD configuration, which were manufactured in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The KA24DE is very similar to the KA24E. The KA24E is SOHC with three valves per cylinder actuated by rocker arms, and the KA24DE is DOHC with four valves per cylinder and shim-over-bucket valve actuation. Design improvements of the dual cam engine include the use of a knock sensor, larger diameter girdled main bearings in the Japanese block, different oil pan (not interchangeable between Japanese and Mexican blocks), different <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> (front pickup on Japanese block and side on Mexican block), dipstick location (toward the rear of block on Mexican and mid block on Japanese) and piston oil squirters. In addition to the increased power and torque, the KA24DE has a higher redline than the KA24E.|$|E
