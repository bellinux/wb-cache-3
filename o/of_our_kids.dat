The first two entries of the season in fall 1933, Bedtime Worries and Wild Poses (which featured a cameo by Laurel and Hardy), focused on Spanky McFarland and his hapless parents, portrayed by Gay Seabrook and Emerson Treacy, in a family-oriented situation comedy format similar to the style later popular on television.

40|$|In our thesis we {{primarily}} {{focused on}} how to get our preschool children to eat healthy without having to force them into it. Most adults have at least one negative childhood eating experience, nonetheless they still use inappropriate principles or techniques when it comes to encouraging their children towards a healthy and balanced diet. Parents often forget they have to set a proper example for their children, since they are known to take up eating habits from their parents. Nowadays, a child spends more time on average at a kindergarten than at home, that is why the theoretical part of this thesis will start off with the "Kindergarten Kurikulum (1999) ". We also introduced new findings and trends on eating healthy and general guidelines for children's healthy eating habits. We also focused on child development concerns regarding eating habits. The following segment <b>of</b> <b>our</b> theoretical part focused on the healthy food that we provide to <b>our</b> <b>kids,</b> the importance <b>of</b> a healthy diet, the amount <b>of</b> food that <b>our</b> <b>kids</b> require and other principles that help us maintain a healthy diet. Our last segment focused on issues and concerns regarding feeding, where we talked about food rejection and force feeding. The empirical part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> thesis focused on researching the state <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Kindergartens and whether or not inappropriate ways of feeding can still be found today. We wanted to know how the kindergarten staff reacts when kids decline food and if the kindergarten staff is aware of their improper feeding methods. Our research included three public Kindergartens in three different cities. Findings show that some concealed ways of improper feeding methods can still be found today...|$|R

At Wake Forest, Cummings came off the bench in relief of Milanovich, who had struggled reading the blitz, and played the last 39 minutes. He completed 20 passes on 30 attempts for 222 yards. He led three drives that culminated in a field goal, touchdown, and a final series which used eight minutes of the game clock in the 9 - 6 victory. After the game, head coach Mark Duffner praised Cummings' play, but stopped shy of naming him the starter. Cummings started against Clemson and , but the offense struggled and Milanovich started the last three games, while Cummings nursed a sore shoulder. Duffner said of Cummings, [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids</b> said he's a linebacker playing quarterback.
