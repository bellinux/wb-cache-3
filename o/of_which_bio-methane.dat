40|$|AbstractPhotosynthetic pigments, {{including}} chlorophyll, have {{an important}} role since they provide the oxygen and the source of energy for all living things. Plant and algae growth is affected by the photosynthesis speed which depends on the availability of carbon dioxide (CO 2). This paper reports on the pilot plant scale study of the impact of 20 % to 50 % CO 2 on biogas into the growing medium <b>of</b> microalgae <b>which</b> obtained <b>bio-methane</b> purification results as gaseous bio-fuels. Research material was produced from the Jatropha curcas Linn. husk biogas digester and a 0. 15 m 3 HDPE drum was used as a purification. The purification tank was filled with Catfish (Clarias gariepinus) farm water which grew “wild” microalgae naturally. The water was fed from the top with continuous flow of (16 to 31) L· min– 1 and the biogas was fed from the bottom at (18 to 29) L · min– 1. CO 2 level data of biogas was measured by orsat apparatus and processed with t test. The results achieved average efficiency reduction levels of CO 2 on 50 % in two cycles (24 % in the first and 26 % in the second) ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{sites for}} biogas {{production}} in Latvia currently {{do not have}} sufficient heat load to provide power production in co-generation mode. The alternative to relatively inefficient power production could be production <b>of</b> <b>bio-methane</b> <b>which</b> is {{known as one of}} the most important renewable option for gas supplies. After removal of contaminants bio-methane is of quality of natural gas and can be delivered to power plants and industry using the natural gas supply infrastructure. For analysis of environmental benefit of using bio-methane the environmental impact of the proposed solution has to be assessed. The aim of the study is to make life cycle assessment of the system for bio-methane supply to industrial plant via the natural gas grid. The analysed system includes bio-methane production and transport to the natural gas pipeline including the infrastructure. Functional unit was 1 MWh of bio-methane energy injected into the natural gas transmission pipeline. Life-cycle model was created and analysed with software 'SimaPro'. ReCiPe and Eco-Indicator' 99 were used as characterization methods to analyse the life-cycle environmental impacts. Results show the influence and contribution level expressed in mid-point categories as well as in a single-score indicator. The largest impact is created by use of fossil energy sources in production of bio-methane. The results can be used to design renewable energy supply systems and for the comparison of alternatives...|$|R
40|$|Biogas is a gas {{formed from}} the {{breakdown}} of biomass by microorganisms in an anaerobic environment composed of methane (50 %– 70 %) and carbon dioxide (30 %– 50 %). The upgrading of biogas by the removal of carbon dioxide to increase the percentage of methane to over 92 % produces <b>bio-methane</b> <b>which</b> is a potent versatile clean fuel. This paper represents a study that was carried out at the University of Johannesburg’s Doornfontein Campus (UJ DFC) to ascertain the potential of bio-methane recovery from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) collected at the campus’ cafeteria and student residences.
