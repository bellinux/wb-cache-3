5|$|Belgrano studied {{near the}} {{intellectual}} elite of Spain, {{and by that}} time there were heated discussions about the ongoing French Revolution. The principles <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>and</b> freedom, the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and criticism of the divine right of kings were constant topics of debate. Among the supporters of these ideas it was thought that Spain should be remade under similar principles, and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas. However, the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected religion and the monarchy. Thus, despite the new influences, Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>and</b> other essential human rights.|$|E

The systems <b>of</b> <b>equalities</b> <b>and</b> inequalities are {{transformed into a}} continuous equality constrained optimization solved by the new algorithm. Filter method guarantees global convergence of the algorithm under appropriate assumptions. The second order correction step is used to overcome Maratos effect so that superlinearly local convergence is achieved. Preliminary numerical results are reported...|$|R
40|$|By using slack {{variables}} and minimum function, we first reformulate the system <b>of</b> <b>equalities</b> <b>and</b> inequalities {{as a system}} of nonsmooth equations, and, using smoothing technique, we construct the smooth operator. A new noninterior continuation method is proposed to solve the system of smooth equations.

Some numerical experiments show the feasibility and efficiency of the algorithm...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a filled {{function}} method is suggested for solving nonlinear systems <b>of</b> <b>equalities</b> <b>and</b> inequalities. Firstly, the original problem is reformulated into an equivalent constrained global optimization problem.

Some properties of the filled function are studied and discussed. Finally, an algorithm based on the proposed filled function for solving nonlinear systems <b>of</b> <b>equalities</b> <b>and</b> inequalities is presented. The objective function value can be reduced by half in each iteration of our filled function algorithm. The implementation of the algorithm on several test problems is reported with numerical results. Mathematical subject classification: 65 K 05, 90 C 30...|$|R

25|$|The lack {{of legal}} {{distinction}} among various {{ranks of the}} nobility gave many noblemen a false sense <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>and</b> opportunity. The majority of the nobility of the Lithuanian, Rus', or German origin, had become Polonized and Catholic. Some minority Protestant nobility remained active in Royal Prussia and Greater Poland. After {{the triumph of the}} Counter-Reformation, the Jesuits and other Catholic educators lost incentives to provide competitive high quality education. The backward mentality and close-mindedness of the szlachta masses has become proverbial, and as the nation experienced its greatest decline, the typically uniform szlachta indulged in the sarmatism ideology of a chosen nation and contempt for everything foreign. Nonconformity was not tolerated, corruption was at its highest, while public morale at the lowest.|$|E

It claimed that the common people of India remain unheard and unseen except when it suits the politicians. It wants to reverse the way that the accountability of government operates and has taken an interpretation of the Gandhian concept of swaraj as a tenet. It believes that through swaraj the government will be directly accountable to the people instead of higher officials. The swaraj model lays stress on self-governance, community building and decentralisation.|$|E
