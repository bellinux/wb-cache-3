5|$|Chinese {{population}} size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million people because <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> rice cultivation {{in central and}} southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that they could easily provide to the growing market.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} this drastic {{population}} reduction {{are thought to be}} due to agricultural improvements, abandonment <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> management, and deforestation. As the area of the Gentiana cruciata, the food plant that the P. rebeli depends on, decreases, the P. rebeli population also decreases.|$|E

5|$|Aksum's {{currency}} {{served as}} a vessel of propaganda demonstrating the kingdom's wealth and promoting the national religion (first polytheistic and later Oriental Christianity).

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from various {{sites on the}} Iberian peninsula suggest the domestication {{of plants and animals}} between 6,000 and 4,500 BC. Céide Fields in Ireland, consisting <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> tracts of land enclosed by stone walls, date to 3,500 BC and are the oldest known field systems in the world. The horse was domesticated in the Pontic steppe around 4,000 BC.

Consecutive habitation, spanning thousands of years from the Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods (Old, Middle, and New Stone Age), to the Bronze and Iron Ages had left numerous artefacts behind. Discoveries have included stone knives, flint blades, {{and the head of}} a mace, along with buildings and graves.|$|E
5|$|Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him {{in verse}} survives, {{and may have been}} placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury. Subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of 9 January. Little {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> cult activity exists, however, and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in a St Augustine's calendar. Berhtwald is the first of the continuous series of native-born archbishops in England, although there had been two previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops at Canterbury—Deusdedit and Wighard.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma {{continued}} {{to write about}} both missionary work and the Sundanese language. In 1881, he wrote a series of condemnatory reviews of Sundanese-language schoolbooks offered by the colonial government, arguing that the content had little value and the language was mostly artificial. He published a Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1884, consulting various works of Sundanese literature for his lexemes. In 1901, he published {{a history of the}} mission in the East Indies, titled De zendingseeuw voor Nederlandsche Oost-Indiës (The Century of the Mission in the Dutch East Indies). It described the 19th century as time <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> growth.|$|E

They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.
