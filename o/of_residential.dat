40|$|Even in a {{small country}} such as the Netherlands, spatial {{variations}} in house prices are considerable. This paper addresses {{the question about the}} extent to which these variations in house prices can be explained by differences in physical, social and functional characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>residential</b> environment. Data on the prices and characteristics of houses were linked with a variety of attributes <b>of</b> the <b>residential</b> environment. We used hedonic price modelling to derive different models of property prices from which the contribution of the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>residential</b> environment were estimated. It is demonstrated that regional house price variations can indeed largely be explained by characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>residential</b> environment. An important factor in these regional price differences is the accessibility to employment opportunities. Copyright (c) 2008 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG. ...|$|R
