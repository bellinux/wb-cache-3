5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus <b>on</b> <b>guns</b> over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic feeling in battles. If they had gone with a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout the whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major challenge was {{to strike a balance between}} accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition of strategy elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would have been handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing them properly.|$|E

We gathered data <b>on</b> homicides and <b>gun</b> regulations in different states and performed tests to see whether gun regulation, in the form of mandatory permits and registration, had an effect <b>on</b> <b>gun</b> homicide rates. We obtained mixed results about the significance of effects of regulation <b>on</b> the <b>gun</b> homicide rate. In addition, we sought to produce a model for predicting gun homicide rates based on regulation as well as other influential factor...|$|R

25|$|The Tribal class, or Afridi class, were a {{class of}} destroyers built for the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Australian Navy that saw service in World War II. Originally {{conceived}} during design studies for a light fleet cruiser, the Tribals evolved into fast, powerful destroyers, with greater emphasis <b>on</b> <b>guns</b> over torpedoes than previous destroyers, in response to new designs by Japan, Italy, and Germany. The Tribals were well admired by their crews and the public {{when they were in}} service due to their power, often becoming symbols of prestige while in service.|$|E
25|$|Asianist Kenneth Chase {{offers another}} theory {{as to why}} gun {{development}} stagnated during the Ming dynasty. Chase argues that guns were not particularly useful against China's traditional enemies: horse nomads. Guns were supposedly problematic to deploy against nomads because of their size and slow speed, drawing out supply chains, and creating logistical challenges. Theoretically, the more mobile nomads took the initiative in sallying, retreating, and engaging at will. Chinese armies therefore relied less heavily <b>on</b> <b>guns</b> in warfare than Europeans, who fought large infantry battles and sieges which favored guns, or so Chase argues.|$|E
25|$|As news {{announcements}} {{spread and}} suspects were searched in surrounding counties, the fear crossed over {{to many other}} cities, including Hope, Lufkin and Magnolia, even going as far as Oklahoma City. Residents in other cities were also stocking up <b>on</b> <b>guns</b> and even axes. Every three weeks {{when there were no}} murders, the town's fear began to drop little by little. The hysteria lasted throughout the summer and eventually faded three months later. The Texas Rangers quietly left Texarkana little by little through October. This was not announced to keep the Phantom from attempting another attack.|$|E

25|$|Hitchens philosophically {{supported}} gun {{rights and}} was generally opposed to gun control. On {{the subject of}} the second amendment, Hitchens argued that as both an outright ban <b>on</b> <b>guns</b> and relying on a citizen militia for the national defence were equally as idealistic and utopian, and that as gun control created a duopoly of force between the state and criminals, it would be more desirable to encourage training among average citizens so they might develop a better relationship with firearms. Although Hitchens repeatedly stated a broad support for the right to keep and bear arms, he was not an enthusiastic advocate and he rarely publicly discussed his views.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the logical}} follow through is sound, the corning {{hypothesis}} has been refuted for two reasons. One, the powder makers were probably {{more worried about}} spoilage than the effect of corned gunpowder <b>on</b> <b>guns,</b> and two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s. In Europe corning arose {{as a response to}} the difficulty of obtaining pure saltpeter, specifically saltpeter consisting of potassium nitrate, rather than sodium nitrate or calcium nitrate, the latter two of which absorb water vapor more readily than potassium nitrate. Thus corning was an imperative to producing reliable weaponized gunpowder. Supposedly this was much less problematic in Asia, where pure saltpeter was more readily available and easily manufactured. In China gunpowder corning had been practiced since the 1370s for the purpose of strengthening the explosive power of mines, since gunpowder corns provided more space required for a rapid combustion. Corned powder might also have been used in guns based on a record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, a feet probably only possible with the aid of corned powder at the time.|$|E

500|$|The title [...] "Rust in Peace" [...] was {{inspired}} by a bumper sticker that Mustaine saw {{on the back of a}} vehicle while driving home from Lake Elsinore, California. The sticker read: 'May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace'. Mustaine liked the concept and decided to use it as a title for Megadeth's upcoming album. Rust in Peace was recorded in Rumbo Studios with producer Mike Clink, while the mixing was handled by Max Norman. Clink was brought in for his work on both Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction and UFO's Strangers in the Night. The producer's work dealt mostly with the bass, drums and Friedman's guitar. In a 2002 interview, Mustaine declared that they [...] "really didn’t make the record with [...] " [...] as at the time he was focused <b>on</b> <b>Guns</b> N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and II — which were also being recorded at Rumbo — and stated most of the work in the album was done by himself, Norman, and engineer Micajah Ryan.|$|E

Some live {{performances of the}} song had the line [...] "our little group has always been" [...] changed to [...] "our little tribe has always been," [...] which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] " [...] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit." [...] A notable alternate performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, [...] "Load up <b>on</b> <b>guns,</b> bring your friends" [...] became [...] "Load up on drugs, kill your friends"). [...] Cobain later said {{he was trying to}} sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] as the third greatest in the show's history. This performance {{can be found on the}} 1994 home video Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!.|$|E
