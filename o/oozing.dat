5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood <b>oozing</b> from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{cover was}} done by Dave McMacken as {{somewhat}} in vein of Salvador Dalí's surreal imagery depicting a two-headed man sitting on a waterbed in a Holiday Inn hotel room surrounded by various objects like a Mothers backstage pass and a television set showing Zappa's face with slime <b>oozing</b> out of it. The entire painting is depicted in a frame showing many sexual acts.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{one set of}} twins in particular: Guido and Ina, aged about four. One day, Mengele took them away. When they returned, {{they were in a}} terrible state: they had been sewn together, back to back, like Siamese twins. Their wounds were infected and <b>oozing</b> pus. They screamed day and night. Then their parents—I remember the mother's name was Stella—managed to get some morphine and they killed the children in order to end their suffering.|$|E
50|$|Wave 3 {{featured}} <b>Ooze</b> Launchin' Leo, <b>Ooze</b> Tossin' Raph, <b>Ooze</b> Scoopin' Donnie and <b>Ooze</b> Chunkin' Mikey, featuring backpacks {{which would}} fling Mutagen <b>Ooze,</b> which was sold separately. Leo, Don, Raph and Mikey received deluxe Flinger figures in this wave. Each Flinger figure would fling their weapon when activated. The Turtle Communicator was also released. Vehicles included the MMX Cycle and the Hover Drone. A remote control Shellraiser was also released.|$|R
50|$|In case {{of marine}} sediments, <b>ooze</b> does {{not refer to}} a sediment's consistency, but to its composition, which {{directly}} reflects its origin. <b>Ooze</b> is pelagic sediment that consists of at least 30% of microscopic remains of either calcareous or siliceous planktonic debris organisms. The remainder typically consists almost entirely of clay minerals. As a result, the grain size of <b>oozes</b> is often bimodal with a well-defined biogenic silt- to sand-size fraction and siliciclastic clay-size fraction. <b>Oozes</b> can be defined by and classified according to the predominate organism that compose them. For example, there are diatom, coccolith, foraminifera, globigerina, pteropod, and radiolarian <b>oozes.</b> <b>Oozes</b> are also classified and named according to their mineralogy, i.e. calcareous or siliceous <b>oozes.</b> Whatever their composition, all <b>oozes</b> accumulate extremely slowly, at {{no more than a}} few centimeters per millennium.|$|R
50|$|Gray <b>oozes,</b> {{like most}} <b>oozes,</b> are {{underground}} dwelling, mindless scavengers who drag themselves around caves and sewers and absorb and digest whatever they find. Unlike some other <b>oozes,</b> it cannot move on ceilings or walls, and hence {{is left to}} slide its way along floors. The gray <b>ooze</b> attacks by striking like a snake until prey is either dead or unconscious, and it then moves {{on top of them}} to digest them from within. It is immune to cold and fire. The gray <b>ooze's</b> acidic secretions corrode metal at an alarming rate, and in addition to giving the creature a method of destroying opponent's weapons and armor, blacksmiths also sometimes use jarred gray <b>oozes</b> to meld ore into the right shape. Gray <b>oozes</b> reproduce by breaking small driplets off of themselves after a meal, which later grow into gray <b>oozes</b> themselves.|$|R
25|$|When managed {{according}} to the standards, policies and procedures developed by the CSIRO, lambs are normally mulesed {{a few weeks after}} birth. The operation usually takes less than a minute. Standard practice is to do this operation simultaneously with other procedures such as ear marking, tail docking, and vaccination. Because the procedure removes skin, not any underlying flesh or structure, there is little blood loss from the cut other than a minor <b>oozing</b> on the edges of the cut skin.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{identification}} to genus {{can often}} be accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide. Identification to species, however, requires more effort; one must remember that a mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for {{the identification of the}} species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from <b>oozing</b> liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints.|$|E
25|$|Bite {{symptoms}} include pain, <b>oozing</b> from the puncture wounds, local swelling that may increase {{for up to}} 36 hours, bruising that spreads from the bite site, blisters, numbness, mild fever, headache, bleeding from the nose and gums, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, impaired consciousness and tenderness of the spleen. In untreated cases, local necrosis frequently occurs and may require amputation. In 12 fatal cases, {{the cause of death}} was sepsis (5), intracranial hemorrhage (3), acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis (2) and hemorrhagic shock (1).|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} diatoms and other silica-utilizing organisms are found, as opal sediments within pelagic deep-sea deposits. Pelagic sediments, {{containing}} significant quantities of siliceous biogenic remains, are {{commonly referred to}} as siliceous <b>ooze.</b> Siliceous <b>ooze</b> are particularly abundant in the modern ocean at high latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres. A striking feature of siliceous <b>ooze</b> distribution is a ca. 200 km wide belt stretching across the Southern Ocean. Some equatorial regions of upwelling, where nutrients are abundant and productivity is high, are also characterized by local siliceous <b>ooze.</b> Siliceous <b>oozes</b> are composed primarily of the remains of diatoms and radiolarians, but may also include other siliceous organisms, such as silicoflagellates and sponge spicules. Diatom <b>ooze</b> occurs mainly in high-latitude areas and along some continental margins, whereas radiolarian <b>ooze</b> are more characteristic of equatorial areas. Siliceous <b>ooze</b> are modified and transformed during burial into bedded cherts.|$|R
50|$|Kyrzin is {{a prince}} of slime and <b>ooze</b> who lives beneath the Shadow Marches. Kyrzin has created {{numerous}} types of <b>oozes,</b> including parasitic <b>oozes</b> that may control their host or burst from their host's flesh.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>ooze</b> is an {{amorphous}} or mutable creature {{without a}} single solid form. <b>Oozes</b> are usually mindless and homogeneous, and reproduce by simply splitting into two. The most famous <b>ooze</b> is the gelatinous cube. Many <b>oozes</b> dwell underground, and most secrete an acid from their skin that dissolves flesh and other materials rapidly. <b>Oozes</b> are essentially blind, but an ability called [...] "blindsight", which allows them to discern nearby objects and creatures without needing to see them, more than compensates for this.|$|R
25|$|The railway {{was built}} as single track {{but with a}} {{trackbed}} wide enough to allow upgrading to double track for expansion. Although the work was estimated to take approximately one year, delays including buying land for the line, a cow eating the plans near Oakworth and engineering problems meant the work took nearly two years to complete. In particular the southern tunnel to Ingrow West had quicksand <b>oozing</b> through bore holes that required additional piles to be driven down to the bedrock to support and stabilise the tunnel. Unfortunately the work damaged the foundation to the Wesley Place Methodist Church resulting in the church receiving £1,980 from the railway compnay.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, an {{experimental}} satellite-based weapon that fires miniature black holes, called the Dimension Tide, opens a wormhole through which a prehistoric dragonfly enters {{the present and}} deposits a single egg before exiting through the wormhole. A boy finds the egg and takes it {{with him when he}} moves to Tokyo. The egg starts <b>oozing</b> a strange liquid, so the boy throws the egg in the sewer. The egg, actually a mass of hundreds of eggs, splits up and starts growing when exposed to water, hatching into large dragonfly larva called Meganulon that come out of the sewer to feed. They flood a portion of the city and molt on the sides of buildings, becoming adult Meganula.|$|E
25|$|Dermatitis {{symptoms}} {{vary with}} all {{different forms of}} the condition. They range from skin rashes to bumpy rashes or including blisters. Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes <b>oozing</b> and scarring. Also, {{the area of the}} skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum. Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.|$|E

50|$|Players control Dr. Caine as {{a puddle}} of <b>ooze</b> with a head, who can move around and use two attacks. One is {{stretching}} out a maneuverable sliver of <b>ooze</b> whose length is only limited by how much <b>ooze</b> he currently has to attack. Players can also spit gobs of <b>ooze,</b> which reduces {{the size of the}} <b>ooze.</b> Enemy attacks deplete the size of the <b>ooze</b> puddle as well, and the <b>Ooze</b> will die either if he becomes very small or if his head is attacked directly. He can also die by dropping off the edges of certain areas, or staying on a drain for too long. Numerous puzzles must be completed in order to progress from one level to another. An optional goal of the game is finding and collecting all 50 helices, in order to see the game's good ending.|$|R
50|$|Terrigenous {{sediment}} is {{the most}} abundant sediment found on the seafloor, followed by biogenous sediment. The sediment {{in areas of the}} ocean floor which is at least 30% biogenous materials is labeled as an <b>ooze.</b> There are two types of oozes: Calcareous <b>oozes</b> and Siliceous <b>oozes.</b> Plankton is the contributor of <b>oozes.</b> Calcareous <b>oozes</b> are predominantly composed of calcium shells found in phytoplankton such as coccolithophores and zooplankton like the foraminiferans. These calcareous <b>oozes</b> are never found deeper than about 4,000 to 5,000 meters because at further depths the calcium dissolves. Similarly, Siliceous <b>oozes</b> are dominated by the siliceous shells of phytoplankton like diatoms and zooplankton such as radiolarians. Depending on the productivity of these planktonic organisms, the shell material that collects when these organisms die may build up at a rate anywhere from 1mm to 1 cm every 1000 years.|$|R
500|$|In February 2006, Dan Ford, from Wareham in Dorset, {{received}} permanent scarring to {{his face}} after being sprayed with CS during an arrest by police. Ford was subsequently advised by doctors {{to stay out of}} sunlight for at least 12 months. After the incident, his cousin, Donna Lewis, was quoted as saying, [...] "To look at him, it was like looking at a melting man, with liquid <b>oozing</b> from his face." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{material}} started <b>oozing</b> {{out between the}} outer stones of the first construction period below the 150-foot mark, and was referred to by tourists as [...] "geological tuberculosis". This {{was caused by the}} weathering of the cement and rubble filler between the outer and inner walls. As the lower section of the monument was exposed to cold and hot and damp and dry weather conditions, the material dissolved and worked its way through the cracks between the stones of the outer wall, solidifying as it dripped down their outer surface.|$|E
500|$|The star {{contains}} {{about half of}} a solar mass of matter, compressed into a diameter of about , making its surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth. Its outer crust, compressed to about 7,000kg per cubic centimeter, is mainly iron nuclei with {{a high concentration of}} neutrons, overlaid with about [...] of white dwarf star material. The atmosphere, mostly iron vapor, is about [...] thick. The star shrinks slightly as it cools, causes the crust to crack and produce mountains [...] high. Large volcanos, formed by liquid material <b>oozing</b> from deep cracks, can be many centimeters high and hundred meters in diameters, and will eventually collapse, causing starquakes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{both the}} 3rd and 3.5 editions of Dungeons & Dragons, <b>ooze</b> is a {{creature}} type. The black pudding, the gelatinous cube, the gray <b>ooze,</b> and the ochre jelly {{appeared in the}} third edition Monster Manual (2000) under the [...] "ooze" [...] entry, and the version 3.5 Monster Manual (2003). The green slime appeared in the third edition Dungeon Master's Guide (2000) as a dungeon hazard, {{and again in the}} 3.5 revised Dungeon Master's Guide (2003). The Monster Manual II (2002) contains the bone <b>ooze,</b> flesh jelly, reason stealer, and teratomorph. The Monster Manual III (2004) includes the arcane <b>ooze,</b> living spells (also in the Eberron Campaign Setting), snowflake <b>ooze,</b> and summoning <b>ooze.</b> [...] The white pudding appears in Frostburn (2004). The bloodfire <b>ooze</b> appeared in Monster Manual IV (2006), and the graveyard sludge appeared in Monster Manual V (2007).|$|R
5000|$|Siliceous <b>ooze</b> is a {{siliceous}} {{pelagic sediment}} that covers {{large areas of}} the deep ocean floor.

500|$|My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy {{music has}} been noted by writers for {{incorporating}} elements from West's previous four albums. Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson perceives that such elements [...] "all recur at various points", namely [...] "the luxurious soul of 2004's The College Dropout, the symphonic pomp of Late Registration, the gloss of 2007's Graduation, and the emotionally exhausted electro of 2008's 808s & Heartbreak". Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice writes that West [...] "absorb the gifts of his handpicked collaborators, and occasionally elevat them" [...] on previous studio albums, noting collaborators and elements as Jon Brion for Late Registration ("arranging orchestral majesty"), DJ Toomp for Graduation ("adapted DJ Toomp’s <b>oozing</b> menace"), and Kid Cudi for 808s & Heartbreak ("Cudi’s moaning melodies became elemental").|$|E
500|$|Lynch recalls {{having a}} happy childhood, {{although}} {{he suffered from}} bouts of agoraphobia in his youth, especially after having been scared by a screening of Henry King's 1952 film Wait till the Sun Shines, Nellie, when he was six years old. He would develop a brief habit of wearing three [...] neckties at a time, which he understands {{to have been a}} manifestation of his personal insecurity. He also points to a particular image from his childhood that shaped his understanding of the world—" [...] was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it was supposed to be. But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch <b>oozing</b> out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. So you see, there's this beautiful world and you just look a little bit closer and it's all red ants".|$|E
500|$|Maternal images endure {{as far as}} the epilogue, {{featuring}} the arrival of Jeff, Corin and Roy at the Xeno base. In an allusion to the human menstrual cycle, it is said that 28 days have elapsed since the communications break-down. The destruction of the installation and the deaths of its personnel are attributed to an [...] "internal disturbance of some kind", forming [...] "an ironic phrase which encapsulates the film's vision of pregnancy as an irruption of Otherness from within." [...] Focusing on Larry Miller's 1981 novelisation, described as [...] "imaginative and misogynistic", Wright refers to sequences that are absent from the film and inspire repulsion {{on the part of the}} reader at the distortion of the female form. New transformations that afflict Sandy include <b>oozing</b> sores (which Wright construes as an aberration of natal oil secretion) and pus emanating from the nipples (argued to mirror colostrum, or pre-milk). Sandy accepts such unnatural metamorphoses, which culminate in the onset of labour, with fascination.|$|E

50|$|After burial, most {{siliceous}} <b>oozes</b> remain unconsolidated. However, {{a fraction}} of siliceous <b>oozes</b> dissolve and reprecipitate {{as a result of}} diagenesis to form chert beds or nodules. When siliceous <b>oozes</b> are incorporated into orogenic belts associated with subduction zones, they are also altered by diagenesis, and lithified to form chert, i.e. radiolarian chert.|$|R

500|$|The {{conflict}} between {{the culture of the}} Alds and that of Ansul features through the story. The Alds emphasize their perceived cultural superiority to control the city, a practice commentators have described as common in colonialism. The movement of women, in particular, is very restricted: Memer and Gry must dress as men in order to roam the streets. Yet the prejudices of the Alds also allow Gry and Memer to subvert their laws: Gry suggests that because the Alds see women and [...] "unbelievers" [...] as inferior, they will be unable to recognize her for what she is. The supposed superiority of the Alds' beliefs affects Memer as well. As a child she ventures into {{the far end of the}} secret room, where the Oracle books are kept, and sees one of them <b>oozing</b> blood. Though she tries to rationalize her fear away by likening it to the Alds' fear of books, she also questions her own position as the reader of the Oracle, asking Sulter whether there are in fact demons within the room, as the Alds maintain.|$|E
500|$|The track {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Ken Barnes of USA Today described the song {{as being a}} [...] "hopelessly sappy ballad <b>oozing</b> with fuzzy sentiments. I'd say it's more like caterpillars." [...] Frank Kogan of The Village Voice, citing the lyrics, [...] "I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true/Oh baby you give me butterflies" [...] wrote [...] "so, would he give her, like, caterpillars in exchange? birds?" [...] and added that what grabs his attention about a song like [...] "Butterflies" [...] is not the [...] "melody but the weirdly ringing wrench-against-faucet clang on the backbeat." [...] Christie Leo of the New Straits Times gave the track a more positive review, calling the song a [...] "luxuriant" [...] ballad. Pop music critic Robert Hilburn, writing for the Los Angeles Times, described [...] "Butterflies", and another song from Invincible ("Speechless"), as being [...] "as woefully generic as their titles". A journalist of the same publication felt that track was about romantic [...] "jitters".|$|E
500|$|Many {{felt the}} tone of the album was millennial or futuristic, anticipating {{cultural}} and political trends. According to The A.V. Club writer Steven Hyden in the feature [...] "Whatever Happened to Alternative Nation", [...] "Radiohead appeared to be ahead of the curve, forecasting the paranoia, media-driven insanity, and omnipresent sense of impending doom that's subsequently come to characterise everyday life in the 21st century." [...] In 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon described OK Computer as a [...] "prescient... dystopian essay on the darker implications of technology... <b>oozing</b> [...] a vague sense of dread, and a touch of Big Brother foreboding that bears strong resemblance to the constant disquiet of life on Security Level Orange, post-9/11." [...] Chris Martin of Coldplay remarked that, [...] "It would {{be interesting to see how}} the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead's OK Computer. I think the world would probably improve. That album is fucking brilliant. It changed my life, so why wouldn't it change his?" ...|$|E
