2500|$|Since the vicar is the <b>ordinary</b> <b>judge</b> of the Roman Curia and its territory, {{it follows}} that he has always had and now has his own court, or tribunal. Formerly it took {{cognizance}} of both civil and criminal matters, either alone or concurrently with other tribunals, whether the case pertained to voluntary or to contentious jurisdiction. This court no longer deals with criminal cases, though it still exists for certain matters provided for in the ecclesiastical law, the details {{of which may be}} seen in any of the larger manuals of canon law. The principal officials of the court of the vicariate are the above-mentioned vicegerens, the locum tenens civilia, the promotor fiscalis for cases of beatification and canonization, the promotor fiscalis for other ecclesiastical matters, chiefly monastic vows. In former times the auditor of the vicariate was a very busy person, being called on to formulate or to decide the various processes brought before the vicar; to-day the office is mostly an honorary one. Matrimonial cases are dealt with by two officials who form a special section of the vicariate ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{which was}} not {{pleasing}} {{to some of the}} fair ladies in the last act of it, as I dare not vindicate, so neither can I wholly condemn, till I find more reason for their censures. The procedure of Indamora and Melesinda seems yet, in my judgment, natural, and not unbecoming of their characters. If they, who arraign them, fail not more, the world will never blame their conduct; and I shall be glad, for the honour of my country, to find better images of virtue drawn to the life in their behaviour, than any I could feign to adorn the theatre. I confess, I have only represented a practical virtue, mixed with the frailties and imperfections of human life. I have made my heroine fearful of death, which neither Cassandra nor Cleopatra would have been; and they themselves, I doubt it not, would have outdone romance in that particular. Yet their Mandana (and the Cyrus was written by a lady,) was not altogether so hard-hearted: For {{she sat down on the}} cold ground by the king of Assyria, and not only pitied him, who died in her defence; but allowed him some favours, such, perhaps, as they would think, should only be permitted to her Cyrus[7]. I have made my Melesinda, in opposition to Nourmahal, a woman passionately loving of her husband, patient of injuries and contempt, and constant in her kindness, to the last; and in that, perhaps, I may have erred, because it is not a virtue much in use. Those Indian wives are loving fools, and may do well to keep themselves in their own country, or, at least, to keep company with the Arrias and Portias of old Rome: Some of our ladies know better things. But, it may be, I am partial to my own writings; yet I have laboured as much as any man, to divest myself of the self-opinion of an author; and am too well satisfied of my own weakness, to be pleased with any thing I have written. But, on the other side, my reason tells me, that, in probability, what I have seriously and long considered may be as likely to be just and natural, as what an <b>ordinary</b> <b>judge</b> (if there be any such among those ladies) will think fit, in a transient presentation, to be placed in the room of that which they condemn. The most judicious writer is sometimes mistaken, after all his care; but the hasty critic, who judges on a view, is full as liable to be deceived. Let him first consider all the arguments, which the author had, to write this, or to design the other, before he arraigns him of a fault; and then, perhaps, on second thoughts, he will find his reason oblige him to revoke his censure. Yet, after all, I will not be too positive. Homo sum, humani à me nihil alienum puto. As I am a man, I must be changeable; and sometimes the gravest of us all are so, even upon ridiculous accidents. Our minds are perpetually wrought on by the temperament of our bodies; which makes me suspect, they are nearer allied, than either our philosophers or school-divines will allow them to be. I have observed, says Montaigne, that when the body is out of order, its companion is seldom at his ease. An ill dream, or a cloudy day, has power to change this wretched creature, who is so proud of a reasonable soul, and make him think what he thought not yesterday. And Homer was of this opinion, as Cicero is pleased to translate him for us: ...|$|E

40|$|Dealing with {{a rather}} "lazy" penal law-maker, the Italian Constitutional Court has {{progressively}} consolidated a specific role {{to a point}} that an idea of constitutional legality is emerging alongside that of the traditional rule of law. However, this case law has weakened the standards of legality of penal norms by using a growing number of judicial techniques that aim at binding the interpretation of <b>ordinary</b> <b>judges</b> to the Constitution. Among these techniques one can name the interpretative decisions of dismissal and those of inadmissibility with which the Court requires judges to carry out what should be their primary duty, i. e. interpreting the law in conformity with the Constitution. To what extent this interpretative approach, either by the Court or by <b>ordinary</b> <b>judges,</b> can legitimately expand is still unclear. The foreseeable risk is that of creating norms in conformity with the Constitution, but not with the letter of the written provision. Considering the traditional concept of the rule of law, the author tackles the critical aspects of these techniques through a series of case studies. The latter are examples of how the Court, sometimes in a troubled manner, directly addresses <b>ordinary</b> <b>judges</b> and they show the strength of the "judicial constitution law" produced by a constitutional Court which is increasingly producing laws like a legislator and interpreting them like the judiciary. As a consequence, the principles of constitutional statutory limitation is constantly jeopardized...|$|R
