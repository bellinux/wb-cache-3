500|$|Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is {{approaching}} and this great annual event which {{has done so}} much to promote cycling has given us an idea.

The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, so it would be child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track.

40|$|We analyze two {{versions}} of a simple queuing model of resource allocation in which an impatient citizen of a transition economy or a developing country wishes to purchase a scarce good, namely, bread. In {{the first version of}} the model, <b>our</b> <b>citizen</b> must pay a bribe to obtain bread immediately from a government shop. In the second version of the model, when the government shop is too crowded, <b>our</b> <b>citizen</b> refuses to join the crowd. In other words, he balks and goes instead to a private shop to purchase bread. In this setting, we study three questions from the standpoint of resource allocation. First, in the presence of bribery, what is the expected monetary benefit per citizen to a corrupt government official? Second, in the presence of balking, what proportion of all citizens eventually get bread? Finally, and once again in the presence of balking, what is the expected amount of time a citizen spends waiting to get bread?Balking...|$|R

500|$|Just {{as he had}} as {{baseball}} commissioner, Chandler faced the issue of racial integration during his second term as governor. Among his first actions upon his election was to issue an executive order ensuring that blacks and whites would have equal access to the state park system. He publicly acknowledged the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education as {{the law of the}} land and promised to enforce it. The Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down Kentucky's Day Law—the law proscribing integration—the following year. Some areas of the state resisted the change. Notably, in 1956, when nine black students in Sturgis, Kentucky attempted to enter previously all-white Sturgis High School, they were blocked by 500 opponents of integration. On September 4, 1956, Chandler called out the National Guard—including a force of over 900 guardsmen and several M47 Patton tanks—to disperse the crowd. The confrontation lasted a total of 18 days before the protesters peacefully dispersed. Shortly thereafter, Chandler took similar actions in response to a protest in the town of Clay, which was also resolved without violence. Of his actions, Chandler remarked [...] "We regret it is necessary to use this means of guaranteeing equal rights to <b>our</b> <b>citizens,</b> but that we must do." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The European eel has {{suffered}} severe declines in recruitment across it’s range and {{is listed as}} Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. ZSL field staff have been monitoring the upstream elver migration in London’s rivers for ten years. In 2011, in order to expand the programme, we recruited the help of volunteer citizen scientists in this research. We have so far trained 396 citizen scientists and currently monitor recruitment at 11 sites in partnership with 14 organisations. The presentation will include; {{a description of the}} monitoring methodology, an explanation of how we recruit and work with <b>our</b> <b>citizen</b> scientists, news of how, with <b>our</b> <b>citizen</b> scientists, we are now using monitoring data to advise the installation of eel passes over barriers and therefore enriching the ecology of London 2 ̆ 7 s rivers. Our conclusions are that well designed citizen science programmes can: •Produce valid data {{that can be used to}} guide conservation management decisions. •Enable people to become more informed, active and skilled. •Empower individuals and organisations. •Build much needed capacity in the conservation sector. •Be a very cost effective approach...|$|R
