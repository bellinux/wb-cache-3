By studying meteorites {{he noticed that}} the temperature profile of the tropopause was not constant, as had previously been believed (hence the name stratosphere). In fact there was, he showed, a region where the temperature sharply rose. This, he proposed, was happening because UV radiation was heating ozone in what has become known as the ozone layer.He noted the connection between sunspots and weather, and measured the ultraviolet levels of our star. He built the first Dobson ozone spectrophotometers and studied the results over many years. The Dobson unit, a unit of measurement of vertically integrated atmospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>density,</b> is named after him. The Brewer-Dobson circulation is a semi-eponymous model of atmospheric currents that explains the distribution of ozone by latitude.|$|E

Traditionally, {{the amount of}} radiation a microwave radiometer receives is expressed as the equivalent blackbody temperature also called brightness temperature. In the microwave range several atmospheric gases exhibit rotational lines. They provide specific absorption features shown at a figure on the right which allow to derive information about their abundance and vertical structure. Examples for such absorption features are the oxygen absorption complex (caused by magnetic dipole transitions) around 60 GHz {{which is used to}} derive temperature profiles or the water vapor absorption line around 22.235 GHz (dipole rotational transition) which is used to observe the vertical profile of humidity. Other significant absorption lines are found at 118.75 GHz (oxygen absorption) and at 183.31 GHz (water vapor absorption, used for water vapor profiling under dry conditions or from satellite). Weak absorption features due to ozone are also used for stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>density</b> and temperature profiling.|$|E

Satellite systems {{have been developed to}} measure ozone and other constituents accurately on a global basis. However, within this area there is considerable room for advancement in the techniques used to measure ozone from a satellite platform. The Canadian instrument OSIRIS onboard the Swedish-led satellite Odin contains an optical spectrograph that is used for measuring limb radiance in the atmosphere. There are various proven techniques to convert limb radiance data into <b>ozone</b> <b>density</b> profiles. This work presents a new technique that combines radiance data from both the Chappuis and Hartley-Huggins bands to retrieve <b>ozone</b> <b>density.</b> The new technique extends the current upper limit of Chappuis-only retrievals from 40 km to 60 km. The major portion of this work describes the implementation of this new technique. Briefly, a Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstructive Technique, together with the SaskTRAN radiative transfer model, is used to invert the limb radiance data into <b>ozone</b> <b>density</b> profiles. An overview of the resulting <b>ozone</b> <b>density</b> profiles is presented together with comparisons against other ozone products as a first order verification of the results. This work will be used to produce a new ozone data set from the OSIRIS limb radiance data consisting of <b>ozone</b> <b>density</b> profiles that are valid to 60 km...|$|E

The measured density profiles appear to agree semi-quantitatively with model simulations which includes auroral processes. The influence on <b>ozone</b> <b>densities</b> in the 70 – 90 km region due to such enhanced nitric oxide abundance is found to be still insignificant as compared to that due to transport in the middle of February, one month after the end of polar night and one month before the spring equinox.

Regular altitude profile measurements of ozone, performed at Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC) station Lauder, {{make it possible to}} do a detailed, altitude-resolved, study of the low ozone observations. The measurements show ozone poor air in two altitude regions of the stratosphere: A 'high region', extending from the 600 K to the 1050 K isentrope (25 to 34 km), and a 'low region', below about 550 K (22 km). High resolution reverse trajectory maps of potential vorticity (PV) and ozone mixing ratio, based on the assumption of passive advection by the large-scale three-dimensional winds, show that in the 'high region' the ozone poor air was part of the polar vortex, which was centered off the pole and extended over Lauder for several days, while in the 'low region' the ozone poor air was mixed in from low latitudes. A rapid recovery of the <b>ozone</b> column <b>density,</b> by more than 110 DU within 24 hours, was observed when in the low region an ozone rich filament of the polar vortex moved over Lauder, while in the high region the (ozone poor) high part of the vortex moved away...|$|R

The N-h profile obtained by JA- 2 shows about 3 × 10 ^ 3 - 2 × 10 ^ 4 ele/cm^ 3 higher than that by JA- 1 in the 78 - 87 km height range.

40|$|The {{effects of}} various <b>ozone</b> <b>density</b> {{reductions}} of the zonally averaged circulation are evaluated with a numerical quasi-geostrophic model. If the ozone perturbations {{are confined to}} the polar regions and are minuscule on a global basis as was characteristic of the August 1972 solar proton event, then the calculations indicate a negligible effect on the mean circulation. For global ozone perturbations by predicted halocarbon pollution, about 10 % reduction in the zonal jet strength and less than a 5 % change in global mean stratospheric temperature are calculated. Large, uniform ozone reductions (above 50 %) produce significant effects on the mean circulation: a substantial collapse of the stratosphere due to cooler temperatures, and a weak polar night jet. The reflection and transmission of quasi-stationary planetary waves in the middle atmosphere are computed to be insensitive to solar activity as extreme as the August 1972 solar proton event.

As the <b>ozone</b> <b>densities</b> in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere are mainly controlled by photochemical processes, the asymmetry of irradiation conditions for both hemispheres could result in corresponding asymmetries regarding the ozone content. The present investigation is concerned with this possibility. The investigation takes into account Nimbus- 7 and Nimbus- 4 satellite data. It is found that the hemispheric asymmetries of the ozone distribution in the summer mesosphere and upper stratosphere are fully ascribable to the hemispheric temperature differences due to the combined effects of the earth's orbital ellipticity and its tilted spin axis from the ecliptic plane.
