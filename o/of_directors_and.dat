5|$|Amtrak {{used to run}} its trains through Cleveland Union Terminal (now Tower City Center), {{which was}} built in 1928 and served as the main {{terminal}} for the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit, and in 1955, the crosstown Red Line. By 1976, because of Cleveland Union Terminal's high rent, the massive size of the facility, {{and the need to}} switch to electric locomotives to access its enclosed platforms, Amtrak decided to construct a smaller station. Lakefront Station was built in 1976–1977 and opened for service in 1977 to provide service for the Lake Shore Limited, which had resumed service via Toledo in 1975. The station officially opened on June 29, 1977, with the formal dedication occurring on July 12. According to Amtrak's employee magazine, a crowd of more than 300 gathered for the dedication of the $552,000 depot. Speakers included Mary J.

Johansson replaced him once more in 1927, but Landgren took over more permanently a year later. Landgren's last term as chairman lasted until 1934, when he was suspended {{along with the rest of}} the club's board <b>of</b> <b>directors</b> <b>and</b> several of its players, soon after the side was found to have breached the ban on professional players then active in Swedish football. The team was barred from playing for the rest of the season, and demoted a division.|$|E

5|$|The club {{achieved}} mid-table league {{positions for}} two seasons, {{but they were}} relegated in 1934 as a penalty for breaking amateur regulations. The club had paid their players a small sum of money for each game. Although against the rules, this was common at the time; Malmö FF were the only club to show it in their accounting records. In addition to relegation to Division2, the club suffered bans for the entire board <b>of</b> <b>directors</b> <b>and</b> twenty-six players. The version of events told by Malmö FF and local press suggests that local rival IFK Malmö reported the violation to the Swedish Football Association. This belief {{has contributed to the}} longstanding competitive tensions between the clubs.|$|E
5|$|There {{were those}} {{concerned}} that the theatre was failing in its role {{as one of the}} very few permitted to show legitimate drama. Management of the theatre after it reopened in 1813 fell to Samuel James Arnold, overseen by an amateur board <b>of</b> <b>directors</b> <b>and</b> a subcommittee focusing on the theatre as a centre for national culture. (Lord Byron was briefly on this subcommittee, from June 1815 until leaving England in April 1816.) Actor Edmund Kean was the on-stage highlight; like Macklin before him, he made his reputation as Shylock, premiering in the role in 1814. Kean remained until 1820 through praise and notorious disputes with local playwrights such as Charles Bucke.|$|E
