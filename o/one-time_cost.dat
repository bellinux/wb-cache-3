2500|$|As first {{reported}} by Wired on October 17, 2007, an interesting application of using PlayStation 3 in a cluster configuration was implemented by Astrophysicist Gaurav Khanna, from the Physics department of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, who replaced time used on supercomputers with {{a cluster of}} eight PlayStation 3s. [...] Subsequently, {{the next generation of}} this machine, now called the PlayStation 3 Gravity Grid, uses a network of 16 machines, and exploits the Cell processor for the intended application which is binary black hole coalescence using perturbation theory. In particular, the cluster performs astrophysical simulations of large supermassive black holes capturing smaller compact objects and has generated numerical data that has been published multiple times in the relevant scientific research literature. The Cell processor version used by the PlayStation 3 has a main CPU and 6 SPEs available to the user, giving the Gravity Grid machine a net of 16 general-purpose processors and 96 vector processors. [...] The machine has a <b>one-time</b> <b>cost</b> of $9,000 to build and is adequate for black-hole simulations which would otherwise cost $6,000 per run on a conventional supercomputer. [...] The black hole calculations are not memory-intensive and are highly localizable, and so are well-suited to this architecture. Khanna claims that the cluster's performance exceeds that of a 100+ Intel Xeon core based traditional Linux cluster on his simulations. The PS3 Gravity Grid gathered significant media attention through 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.|$|E

5000|$|Initial {{mortgage}} insurance premium (IMIP): This is a <b>one-time</b> <b>cost</b> paid at closing to FHA {{to insure the}} reverse mortgage and protect both lenders and borrowers. The IMIP protects lenders by making them whole if the home sells {{at the time of}} loan repayment for less than what is owed on the reverse mortgage. This protects borrowers as well because it means they will never have to pay out of other assets to settle up the reverse mortgage if they owe more than the home is worth. How the IMIP is calculated was changed in late 2013 with Mortgage Letter 2013-27. The IMIP is now charged as either 0.50% or 2.50% of the max claim amount (which usually equals the appraised value of the home up to a maximum of $625,500), depending on how much of the principal limit is utilized within the first 12 months of the loan.

Near the sluice, the channel would be 75 ft wide at the top, 12 ft wide at the bottom and 20.5 ft deep. Decreasing sizes were specified for six sections over its 4 mi length, with the final section being 10 ft wide at the bottom and only 1.83 ft deep.
