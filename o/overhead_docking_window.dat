Rotation thrusters were then used to pitch up the CSM 180° and roll it to the proper alignment angle for docking. Translation thrusters were then used to move {{it back to the}} LM.

Version 4.0 drew criticism for problems upgrading from Version 3.0 shortly after its initial release.

The increase of the lengths of the identifications and descriptions of blocks, materials and geometrical norms, {{as well as the}} hierarchical structure for {{the definition}} of the standards and geometrical norms are other capabilities of this module. Moreover, following features must be highlighted: hull structure modeling: an algorithm to represent corrugated parts more accurately, commands for checking the edge preparation of plates and profiles, options for {{the definition of}} face bars and an algorithm to represent more accurately curved shell and deck plates. Regarding profiles and plates nesting, the NEST module allows the nesting of identical parts assigned to different interim products and keeps information to recognize each individual part.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{accumulation}} {{of our knowledge}} on diseases, disease-related genes and drug targets, network-based analysis plays an increasingly import-ant role in systems biology, systems pharmacology and translational science. The new release of VisANT aims to provide new functions to facilitate the con-venient network analysis of diseases, therapies, genes and drugs. With improved understanding of the mechanisms of complex diseases and drug ac-tions through network analysis, novel drug methods (e. g., drug repositioning, multi-target drug and com-bination therapy) can be designed. More specifically, the new update includes (i) integrated search and navigation of disease and drug hierarchies; (ii) integrated disease–gene, therapy–drug and drug–target association to aid the network construc-tion and filtering; (iii) annotation of genes/drugs using disease/therapy information; (iv) prediction of associated diseases/therapies for a given set of genes/drugs using enrichment analysis; (v) network transformation to support construction of versatile network of drugs, genes, diseases and therapies; (vi) enhanced user interface using <b>docking</b> <b>windows</b> to allow easy customization of node and edge properties with build-in legend node to distinguish different node type.

5000|$|Window Maker has a {{reputation}} for being fast, efficient and highly stable. Window Maker has been characterized as reproducing [...] "the elegant look and feel of the NeXTstep GUI" [...] and is noted as [...] "easy to configure and easy to use." [...] A graphical tool called Wprefs is included and can be used to configure most aspects of the UI. The interface tends towards a minimalist, high performance environment directly supporting XPM, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF and PPM icons with an alpha-channel and a right-click, sliding-scrolling application menu system which can throw off pinnable menus, along with window-icon miniaturization and other animations on multiple desktops. Menus and preferences can be changed without restarting. As with most window managers it supports themes and many are available. Owing to its NeXTstep-like design, like the GUI of Apple Inc's OS X, Window Maker has a <b>dock,</b> but <b>Window</b> Maker's look and feel hews mostly to that of its NeXT forebear.|$|R

40|$|A paper {{describes}} the Octanode, a connecting node that facilitates {{the integration of}} multiple <b>docking</b> mechanisms, hatches, <b>windows,</b> and internal and external systems {{with the use of}} flat surfaces. The Octanode is a 26 - faced Great Rhombicuboctahedron Archi medean solid with six octagonshaped panels, eight hexagon-shaped panels, and 12 square panels using three unique, simple, flat shapes to construct a spherical approximation. Each flat shape can be constructed with a variety of material and manufacturing techniques, such as honeycomb composite panels or a pocketed skinstringer configuration, using conventional means. The flat shapes can be connected together and sealed to create a pressurizable volume by the use of any conventional means including welding or fastening devices and sealant. The node can then be connected to other elements to allow transfer between those elements, or it could serve as an airlock. The Octanode can be manufactured on the ground and can be integrated with subsystems including hatches and ports. The node can then be transported to its intended location, whether on orbit or on surface. Any of the flat panels could be replaced by curved ones, turning the node into a copula. Windows may be placed on flat panes with optimal viewing angles that are not blocked by large connecting nodes. The advantage of using flat panels to represent a spherical approximation is that this allows for easier integration of subsystems and design features...|$|R

40|$|The Orion {{spacecraft}} {{was designed}} to rendezvous with multiple vehicles in low earth orbit (LEO) and beyond. To perform the required rendezvous and docking task, Orion must provide enough control authority to perform coarse translational maneuvers while maintaining precision to perform the delicate docking corrections. While Orion has autonomous docking capabilities, {{it is expected that}} final approach and docking operations with the International Space Station (ISS) will initially be performed in a manual mode. A series of evaluations was conducted by NASA and Lockheed Martin at the Johnson Space Center to determine the handling qualities (HQ) of the Orion spacecraft during different docking and rendezvous conditions using the Cooper-Harper scale. This paper will address the specifics of the handling qualities methodology, vehicle configuration, scenarios flown, data collection tools, and subject ratings and comments. The initial Orion HQ assessment examined Orion docking to the ISS. This scenario demonstrates the Translational Hand Controller (THC) handling qualities of Orion. During this initial assessment, two different scenarios were evaluated. The first was a nominal docking approach to a stable ISS, with Orion initializing with relative position dispersions and a closing rate of approximately 0. 1 ft/sec. The second docking scenario was identical to the first, except the attitude motion of the ISS was modeled to simulate a stress case (1 degree deadband per axis and 0. 01 deg/sec rate deadband per axis). For both scenarios, subjects started each run on final approach at a docking port-to-port range of 20 ft. Subjects used the THC in pulse mode with cues from the <b>docking</b> camera image, <b>window</b> views, and range and range rate data displayed on the Orion display units. As in the actual design, the attitude of the Orion vehicle was held by the automated flight control system at 0. 5 degree deadband per axis. Several error sources were modeled including Reaction Control System (RCS) jet angular and position misalignment, RCS thrust magnitude uncertainty, RCS jet force direction uncertainty due to self plume impingement, and Orion center of mass uncertainty...|$|R
