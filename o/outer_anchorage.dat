25|$|In the 1890s the {{priority}} of the fortification works in the Baltic Sea had been {{the protection of the}} ice-free port of Liepāja, and the Kronstadt fortress protecting Saint Petersburg, relegating Viapori to a secondary status. After the losses during the Russo-Japanese War and in light of the rising might of the Imperial German Navy, Liepāja was considered too vulnerable for a main fleet base, and the decision to build Peter the Great's Naval Fortress was made. In the new plans the main line of defence against the enemy was at the Porkkala-Tallinn line with Tallinn also the new main base for the Russian Baltic Fleet. Helsinki was to be a base for torpedo boat flotillas. The construction of the Tallinn naval base was delayed however, and with the new ships being constructed to replace the losses suffered against Japan the Russian Navy was forced to rely more on Helsinki despite the obsolete armament and inadequate fortifications at Viapori. As the threat of war in Europe grew, it became essential to expand the fortress to provide a necessary protection for the naval base. Until 1910, when the first 152mm Canet guns arrived, the only modern weapons at Viapori were 57 mm quick fire guns {{with the rest of the}} artillery designs dating from the Russo-Turkish War. The first new 254mm guns arrived in 1913, but it was not until early 1914 that construction of the first new batteries began on Melkki and Isosaari. During the First World War the new Krepost Sveaborg was built to substantially expand the old fortress. A new main line of defence was constructed on the outlying islands, pushing the defensive line several kilometers southward, thus providing a secure <b>outer</b> <b>anchorage</b> south of the old fortress for larger warships without the need to navigate the narrow straits leading to the inner anchorage at Kruunuvuorenselkä. The older parts of the fortress became a second line of defence and the main storage areas. The rear of the fortress was finally protected by land fortifications, at first field fortifications on the Helsinki peninsula built in 1914, and, later, an outer line of fixed fortifications.|$|E
2500|$|Naval mines {{were also}} used to protect Krepost Sveaborg from an attack from the sea. An outer line of contact mines was laid {{approximately}} [...] outside the main line of defence. Shore detonated controlled mines were used to create an inner mine barrier to protect the entrances to the <b>outer</b> <b>anchorage.</b> These mines were laid typically in three rows with [...] separation between rows and [...] between mines in a row. Controlled mines required an extensive cabling system to the shore stations where the command to detonate the mines was given. Fortified electrical stations provided the necessary electricity for the mine control network. Electricity was also used for communication systems, searchlights, electrical ammunition lifts and in barracks and crew shelters.|$|E

Three days later, she conducted fueling exercises, then spent the remainder of September and October, through 20 October, in the Ito-Jinsen area, delivering passengers and undergoing availability.|$|R
60|$|On {{this last}} plan the duty was commenced, very little {{interrupted}} by the weather. For quite three weeks the wind held from points favourable to the progress of spring, veering from east to west, but not once getting any southing in it. Occasionally it blew in gales, sending down upon the group a swell that made great havoc with the outer edges of the field-ice. Every day or two a couple of hands were sent up the mountain to take a look-out, and to report the state of matters in the adjacent seas. The fleet of bergs had not yet come out of port, though it was in motion to the southward, like three-deckers dropping down to <b>outer</b> <b>anchorages,</b> in roadsteads and bays. As Roswell intended to be off before these formidable cruisers put to sea, their smallest movement or change was watched and noted. As for the field-ice, it was broken up, miles at at a time, until there remained very little of it, {{with the exception of}} the portion that was wedged in and jammed among the islands of the group. From some cause that could not be ascertained, the waves of the ocean, which came tumbling in before the northern gales, failed to roll home upon this ice, which lost its margin, now it was reduced to the limits of the group, slowly and with great resistance. Some of the sealers ascribed this obstinacy in the bay-ice to its greater thickness; believing that the shallowness of the water had favoured a frozen formation below, that did not so much prevail off soundings. This theory may have been true, though there was quite as much against it, as in its favour, for polar ice usually increases above and not from below. The sea is much warmer than the atmosphere, in the cold months, and the ice is made by deposites of snow, moisture and sleet, on the surfaces of the fields and bergs.|$|R
40|$|Background: One of two proapoptotic Bcl- 2 proteins, Bak or Bax, is {{required}} to permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane during apoptosis. While Bax is mostly cytosolic and translocates to mitochondria following an apoptotic stimulus, Bak is constitutively integrated within the <b>outer</b> membrane.

In addition, whether the distinct subcellular distributions of Bak and Bax contributes to their differential regulation during apoptosis remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: To gain insight into Bak and Bax targeting to mitochondria, elements of the Bak C-terminus were mutated, or swapped with those of Bax. Truncation of the C-terminal six residues (C-segment) or substitution of three basic residues within the C-segment destabilized Bak. Replacing the Bak C-segment with that from Bax rescued stability and function, but unexpectedly resulted in a semi-cytosolic protein, termed Bak/BaxCS. When in the cytosol, both Bax and Bak/BaxCS sequestered their hydrophobic transmembrane domains in their hydrophobic surface groove. Upon apoptotic signalling, Bak/BaxCS translocated to the mitochondrial outer membrane, inserted its transmembrane domain, oligomerized, and released cytochrome c.

2500|$|Ironclad was Britain's longest range amphibious {{operation}} of the war. The landing ships were the LSIs Winchester Castle with 14 LCAs, Royal Ulsterman, Keren, and Karanja each carrying 6 LCAs, Sobieski with LCP(L)s, Derwentdale carrying 15 LCM(Mk. 1)s to land tanks and other vehicles, and Bachaquero, the world's first operational LST.

40|$|Background: The Polyflex™ is {{a commercially}} {{available}} silastic airway stent with proven efficacy. Due to a smooth <b>outer</b> surface its <b>anchorage</b> in the airway wall is superficial which {{may lead to}} stent migration. Objective: To study the performance of an newer version of the Polyflex stent with a studded outer surface, which should improve anchorage. Methods: In a 5 -centre international study the new stent was prospectively tested in symptomatic patients with neoplastic central airway stenosis of more that 50 % of normal diameter. Insertion technique, efficacy of stent placement and stent-related complications were recorded before, 1 month and 3 months post stent placement. Results: Under general anaesthesia and rigid bronchoscopy 27 stents were inserted in 26 patients, mean age: 62 years (range: 37 - 83), 16 men. Diagnoses were 18 bronchogenic carcinoma, 4 oesophageal carcinoma, 2 metastases, 1 tracheal carcinoma, and 1 schwannoma. The stents were inserted in the following locations: 10 right main bronchus, 8 left main bronchus, 7 trachea, and 2 tracheo-bronchial. There was significant improvement in all functional parameters assessed from before (A), to 1 month (B) and 3 months (C) after stent placement. The measured values (mean ± SD) were for the WHO scale: A: 2. 7 (0. 8), B: 1. 5 (0. 9), C: 1. 6 (1. 0); for the Karnofsky scale: A: 44 (19), B: 72 (18), C: 71 (21); for the Dyspnoea Index: A: 3. 3 (0. 7), B: 1. 5 (0. 8), C: 1. 9 (1. 2); for FEV 1 : A: 1. 2 (0. 5), B: 1. 9 (0. 6), C: 1. 5 (0. 5), and for FVC: A: 2. 1 (0. 7), B: 2. 8 (0. 7), C: 2. 5 (1. 0). Stent-related complications were 4 reversible stent obstructions by secretions, 1 migration. The observation period was mean 4. 3 months (range 2 days to 23 months). Conclusion: The studded Polyflex showed excellent efficacy, was very well tolerated, and had a very low migration rate. It presents an improvement over the older smooth model and {{can be considered a}} true alternative to the most widely used silastic stent, the Dumon stent. Copyright © 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master in Disaster Management, 2006. Cataloged from PDF version of Dissertation. Includes bibliographical references (page 132 - 134). The natural disasters have been regularly taking toll on {{the people and the}} resources of Bangladesh. Natural disaster causes inexpressible damage to lives, properties, livestock, life support systems and infrastructures. The coast of Bangladesh is known as a zone of multiple vulnerabilities as well as opportunities. It is prone to severe natural disasters such as cyclones, storm surges, floods, erosion, soil salinity etc. In combination with other natural hazards various forms of man made pollution made the coastal dwellers very vulnerable and ultimately slowed down their socio-economic development. This study will seek to analyze the vulnerabilities and risk of coastal water and suggest adopting appropriate measures for mitigation and management of coastal environmental pollution to the extent of generating environmental awareness among people. The coastal region gets polluted as the pollutants are carried through different rivers and canals to the sea. Water channels are used for dumping industrial wastes that ultimately end up in the sea. There is no facility for waste treatment in densely populated urban areas. As a result, water pollution is increasing. About three thousand ships including oil tankers come to our ports every year. There are several thousand mechanized trawlers and boats that spill oil. Sea is also polluted by oil spill because of accidents in ships. The authority fails to check pollution as they have no receiving or collecting vessels to face the emergency situation during oil spillage. Even our Port Authority has no laboratory to measure the extent of the pollution. Foreign and local ships find the Chittagong Port and its <b>outer</b> <b>anchorage</b> a safe dumping area for their waste, taking advantage of poor laws and their lax implementation due to logistic support. The authority fails to take action against the ships as they flee very quickly after dumping waste in the sea. Besides, ship¬breaking industry is located in Chittagong. Incidents like dumping of wastes into the sea by foreign vessels are also happening. A number of industries namely fertilizers, cement, pulp and paper, food processing, pharmaceuticals, metal, textile, chemical, petroleum and lubricant plants, etc, discharge heavy metals into the coastal water. The use of antibiotics and other chemicals used in shrimp fields is causing pollution in the water, which may harm other aquatic lives. Plastic bottles and other plastic products are most common forms of litter in the coastal water. The rapid and unplanned increase in shrimp culture is also becoming a concern. Shrimp culture in Cox's Bazar uses 620 tons of urea annually. It also generates 15 tons of waste daily, which comes into sea. The government has already signed a number of international treaties and conventions to check environmental degradation. Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) activities in Bangladesh were initiated first in the year 1999; thereafter on 17 January 2005 the Coastal Zone Policy has been approved by the Government. This ICZM policy would be followed by its implementing strategy. The proper implementation of this strategy would lead the Coastal Zone Management in a sustainable way. Under the objectives of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (ICZM project), Priority Investment Programs (PIP) are being developed as the operational arms of this strategy. It is possible to address the pollution in the coast through development of partnerships. Pollution in the coast may not be arrested in short term approaches, like experiences from other countries showed that {{it is a matter of}} time. Long term vision would be considered in designing the PIP, where the pollution issues to be addressed and its severity would be minimized. Priority actions may include in district development plan as a basis to start a long term investment program to limit the pollution level in the coast. Mohammad Mizanur RahmanM.
