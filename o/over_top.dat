5|$|Murray won {{his first}} ATP clay court title at the 2015 BMW Open. He {{defeated}} German Philipp Kohlschreiber in three close sets {{to become the first}} Briton since Buster Mottram in 1976 to win a tour level clay court event. The following week he reached his second final on clay, at the Madrid Open after recording only his second and third victories <b>over</b> <b>top</b> 10 opposition on clay, against Raonic and Nishikori. In the final, he defeated Rafael Nadal in straight sets for his first Madrid title on clay, and first ever clay court Masters 1000 title. The win was Murray's first over Nadal, Federer or Djokovic since Wimbledon 2013, and his first over Nadal on a clay court.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} {{were required to}} swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler; a similar oath had been required of members of the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who also had a veto <b>over</b> <b>top</b> civil service appointments.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Rockies are {{composed}} of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff {{range in age from}} Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600–145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145–66 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east and <b>over</b> <b>top</b> younger rocks during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Glenda (JTWC designation: 20S, {{also known}} as simply Cyclone Glenda) of March 2006 was among the strongest {{tropical}} cyclones to threaten Western Australia, though it weakened considerably before landfall and moved ashore in a lightly populated region. It began as a tropical low on 15 March in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The precursor disturbance drifted <b>over</b> <b>Top</b> End and later across the northeastern portion of Western Australia, and after emerging into the Indian Ocean it strengthened into a tropical storm. Aided by favourable environmental conditions, Glenda rapidly intensified to reach Category5 status on the Australian cyclone scale, and with a peak intensity of 910mbar it was among the strongest cyclones on record within the Australia region. On 30 March it moved ashore near Onslow as a Category3 cyclone, {{and the next day}} it degenerated into a remnant tropical low over land.|$|E

25|$|Around 400 {{million years}} ago, a small {{continent}} {{that was long}} and thin collided with proto North America.

The quartzite lifted, thus the Kittatinny Mountain was born.|$|E

Tazz left, and Raven pinned Regal after performing a Raven Effect DDT.|$|E
