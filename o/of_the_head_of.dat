5|$|In Star Wars and History {{published}} by Lucasfilm, it describes Palpatine's consolidation of power as being {{similar to the}} Roman political figure Augustus, named Octavian before renaming himself.

5|$|In most countries, the {{protocol}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state comes before all others; however, in the EU the Parliament {{is listed as}} the first institution, and hence {{the protocol}} of its President comes before any other European, or national, protocol.
