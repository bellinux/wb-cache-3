The name 'Tetrarch' was given to the Mk VII, on 22 September 1941, on the orders of the War Office.

5|$|The {{presence}} of foreign residents in Cortina d'Ampezzo {{is a fairly}} recent phenomenon, accounting for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> inhabitants in what in any case is a fairly small town. There are 298 resident foreigners in the town, representing 4.9% of the total population. This compares with 7.0% in the town Belluno, 6.4% in the entire province of Belluno, and 10.2% in the Veneto region.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 5 was {{designated}} in 1926 along the Route 2 alignment. Between 1926 and 1932, U.S. Route 5 and Route 2 were co-signed throughout {{the length of}} the route. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, the Route 2 designation was removed, leaving only the US 5 designation. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> changes have been made since then, the most prominent being in the cities of New Haven and Hartford.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E

5|$|Bogbean and Water Lobelia {{are common}} plants of moorland pools and lochans. The Least (Nuphar pumila), Yellow and White Water-lilies are also widespread. Pipewort has {{generated}} some botanical controversy regarding its discovery, classification and distribution. It was found growing on Skye in the 18th century, {{although there was}} subsequent confusion as to both the discoverer and the correct scientific name – now agreed to be Eriocaulon aquaticum. The European range of this plant is confined to Scotland and western Ireland {{and it is one}} of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> species which is common in North America, but very restricted in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, {{the leading edge of}} the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported that <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> randomized controlled trials had been conducted {{at the time of}} the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E

5|$|Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, {{a three-part}} body (head, thorax and abdomen), {{three pairs of}} jointed legs, {{compound}} eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including {{more than a million}} described species and representing {{more than half of all}} known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This was one of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here {{has been seen as}} part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E
5|$|The verbal prefix {{contains}} {{information about}} the person and number of the subject, sometimes also the person and number of the object, as well as obligatory {{information about the}} tense of the clause. Furthermore, a verbal suffix conveys further information regarding tense and aspect. While <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tense and aspect affixes exist, the interplay between those in the verbal prefix and in the suffix, can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, many units of the 4th Army were still at their {{mobilisation}} centres or in their concentration areas, and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> units had actually deployed into their planned positions to defend the border. A significant number of conscripts did not report to their mobilisation centres. The logistics of the 4th Army were in a poor state, mainly {{due to a lack of}} livestock and vehicles for transport, but also due to fifth column sabotage by the Ustaše and their sympathisers, to the extent that many units did not even have 10 per cent of their transport needs. It was also equipped poorly, lacking in many tools of modern warfare, including tanks, light artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and air support. These deficiencies affected both its fighting power and morale.|$|E
5|$|Australian aircrew {{supported}} the fighting on 6 June. No.453 Squadron {{was one of}} 36 Allied squadrons that provided low-altitude air defence for the invasion fleet and landing force. Many of the squadron's pilots flew several sorties during the day, though they did not encounter any German aircraft. No.456 Squadron also formed part of the force that provided air defence for the invasion area at night. In addition, about 200 Australian pilots were spread across the dozens of RAF fighter and fighter-bomber units that {{supported the}} landings. A small number of Australian aircrew also served in RAF reconnaissance units and 2TAF's light bomber squadrons, which also saw combat over France on D-Day. The three Australian squadrons assigned to Coastal Command flew <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sorties on 6 June as few German submarines or E-boats put to sea.|$|E

5|$|Both ships {{served with}} the fleet {{following}} their commissioning in 1875, though they spent {{a significant part of}} their career in reserve, as Germany maintained <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ships on active duty for training cruises in the period. The ships were substantially rebuilt in the 1890s into armored cruisers and stationed in Asia for three years. Kaiser was the flagship of Otto von Diederichs's East Asia Squadron during the Kiautschou Bay concession seizure in November 1897. Following their return to Germany in 1899–1900, the ships were used in several secondary roles, including as harbor and barracks ships. The ships were stricken from the naval register in 1906; Deutschland was used as a target ship before being sold for scrap in 1908, though Kaiser served on as a floating barracks until she was sold in 1920.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> instances, but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! is {{credited}} {{as being a}} defining moment in Hindi cinema's box office history, {{and the beginning of}} a revolution in the Indian film distribution system. When it was released, cinema was in decline in India due to improved cable television, home video, and film piracy. The film was originally released in <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> theatres that agreed to upgrade their facilities. Due to widespread demand for the film, many other theatres upgraded {{in order to get the}} film. Although ticket prices were raised, the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television. Also, the film's lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle-class family patrons that they could return to the theatre. This film, in addition to the following year's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, contributed to an increase in Indian cinema attendance of 40% in just two years.|$|E
