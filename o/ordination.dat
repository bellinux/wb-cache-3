5|$|Debate {{on church}} {{officers}} began on 19 October. The Assembly {{began with the}} issue of <b>ordination,</b> as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for <b>ordination</b> of ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think <b>ordination</b> necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the sacraments without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without <b>ordination</b> unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of <b>ordination.</b> There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.|$|E

5|$|When Bede {{was about}} 17 years old, Adomnán, the abbot of Iona Abbey, visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. Bede would {{probably}} have met the abbot during this visit, {{and it may be}} that Adomnan sparked Bede's interest in the Easter dating controversy. In about 692, in Bede's nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a deacon by his diocesan bishop, John, who was bishop of Hexham. The canonical age for the <b>ordination</b> of a deacon was 25; Bede's early <b>ordination</b> may mean that his abilities were considered exceptional, but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded. There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices. In Bede's thirtieth year (about 702), he became a priest, with the <b>ordination</b> again performed by Bishop John.|$|E
