Because the infrastructure costs dominate the total costs, the costs per passenger km are high compared to those for HSR and APT.

40|$|The {{current fiscal}} policy does not {{differentiate}} capital expenditure from current expenditure. Since the global deficit target is fixed {{according to the}} present fiscal policy rule, the non financial expenditure becomes pro cyclical, and the public investment is adjusted to meet the targeted deficit. As a result, the public investment has dramatically decreased which, in turn, has affected the international competitiveness and {{the economic and social}} development of the Peruvian society. This paper proposes: 1) change the public expenditure policy public investment by eliminating its pro cyclical bias; and 2) redefining the system of fiscal accounting. To meet this purposes the budget must be divided in two parts: the current budget with a saving or primary surplus target, and the investment expenditure based on a rule of directing the public debt only to finance this kind of expenditure over the economic cycle. This is the so called Public Investment Golden Rule. To this Golden Rule is added other according to which the ratio of public net debt must be sustainable during the economic cycle. Finally, it´s proposed to adopting the new IMF accounting system. The Golden Rule becomes pretty velar {{in the context of this}} new system. When the <b>operational</b> <b>result</b> becomes equal to cero, the net investment becomes equal to the public debt. Hence, the null <b>operational</b> <b>result</b> according to the new accounting system, is the only one which is consistent with the Golden Rule. ...|$|R

50|$|In July 1971, the USAF and Hughes {{signed a}} $69.9 million {{contract}} for 2,000 missiles, {{the first of}} which was delivered in 1972. Although early <b>operational</b> <b>results</b> were favorable, military planners predicted that the Maverick would fare less successfully in the hazy conditions of Central Europe, where it would have been used against Warsaw Pact forces. As such, development of the AGM-65B began in 1975 before it was delivered during the late 1970s. When production of the AGM-65A/B was ended in 1978, more than 35,000 missiles had been built.|$|E

50|$|The first {{prototype}} of class LV entered {{service on the}} Moscow-Kursk-Donbass line, operating out of Lublin Depot from August 1953 to April 1954 in testing. Once the type entered production, {{they were no longer}} used on this line as they were more powerful than needed. Production locomotives entered service on the South Urals, East Siberian and Krasnoyarsk railway lines, where following their introduction train weights increased by 25-30% and coal consumption fell 12-14% on average. Despite good <b>operational</b> <b>results</b> there were obstacles in introducing the locomotives, including the length of locomotives with six-axles tenders, which made it impossible to turn them at depots with turntables smaller than 30 meters.|$|E

50|$|In 2008 the 'false positives' scandal was uncovered, {{referring}} to revelations concerning extrajudicial executions {{carried out by}} members of the military in order to artificially increase the number of guerrillas killed by the Army and claim rewards from the government. On 4 November 2008, Santos admitted that the military had carried out extrajudicial executions and he pledged to resolve the issue. Twenty-seven military officers, including three generals and eleven colonels, were sacked after an internal army investigation concluded that they were responsible for administrative failures and irregularities in reporting enemy casualties and <b>operational</b> <b>results.</b> The Commander of the Colombian National Army, General Mario Montoya, resigned. By May 2009, 67 soldiers had been found guilty and over 400 were arrested pending trial.|$|E
50|$|Some 3,000 men entered Burma {{in seven}} columns. They caused some {{damage to the}} {{communications}} of the Japanese in northern Burma, cutting the railway for possibly two weeks. However, they suffered heavy casualties: 818 killed, wounded or missing, 27% of the original force. Those who did return were wracked with disease and quite often in dreadful physical condition. Though the <b>operational</b> <b>results</b> were questioned, both {{at the time and}} subsequently, the raid was used to great propaganda effect to prove to British and Indian soldiers that they could live, move and fight as effectively as the Japanese in the jungle, countering the impression created after the battles of early 1942 that the Japanese could not be beaten in such terrain.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{the call}} {{will begin with}} a company official, {{typically}} the Investor Relations Officer (IRO), reading a safe harbor statement to limit the company's liability should actual results prove different from expected indicators reported in the discussion. Then one or more company officials, often including the Chief executive officer and Chief financial officer, will discuss the <b>operational</b> <b>results</b> and financial statements for the period just ended and their outlook for the future. The teleconference will then be opened for questions by investors, financial analysts, and other call participants. Management will answer many of these questions, although if the data is unavailable to them they may decline or defer response.

5000|$|In finance, risk is {{the chance}} that the return {{achieved}} on an investment will be different from that expected, and also {{takes into account the}} size of the difference.

In a view advocated by Damodaran, risk includes not only [...] "downside risk" [...] but also [...] "upside risk" [...] (returns that exceed expectations). Some regard the standard deviation of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment as providing some historical measure of risk; see modern portfolio theory. Financial risk may be market-dependent, determined by numerous market factors, or <b>operational,</b> <b>resulting</b> from fraudulent behavior (e.g. Bernard Madoff).

The company had an extraordinarily high exploration success rate under British management with exploration activity on all blocks, in particular block 80 {{to the north of}} the river Ob, where a significant new Cretaceous play was discovered in June 2008. However, recent exploration results under the new Indian management have been disappointing. In addition, new investment aimed at boosting production has not materialised causing production levels to drop below targets. The parent company ONGC have recently run into trouble with the Government over poor <b>operational</b> <b>results,</b> unpaid salaries, legal confrontations with staff and outsourcing of valuable contracts to foreign companies resulting in a warning that future projects involving ONGC depended on better results from this current project.|$|E
50|$|The Northwestern Front was {{defending}} Leningrad against approaches by the German Army Group North, {{spearheaded by}} armored corps led by Erich von Manstein. Vatutin took {{command of the}} Soviet forces near Novgorod and rallied them for offense, attempting to encircle a large German force. He surprised Manstein, {{put him on the}} defensive, and forced the entire German Army Group North to regroup its troops to halt the Soviet offensive. The Wehrmacht lost the precious summer season needed for an effective attack on Leningrad, while the Red Army got additional time to strengthen the fortifications of the city. Due to this, the Germans failed in their best shot to capture Leningrad, one of the key German strategic failures during the early phase of war. Vatutin's immediate <b>operational</b> <b>results</b> were far less impressive. Vatutin overestimated the capacities of his troops and created overly ambitious objectives, while his coordination of his forces and control over the unfolding of the battle were poor. Additionally, he did {{not take into account the}} difficult terrain which benefited German defenses and slowed his attack. Vatutin's casualty figures were staggering, in one army nearly reaching 60%. The ineptitude of his subordinate commanders exacerbated Vatutin's own shortcomings. One striking exception to this pattern of deficiency was the brilliance of Ivan Chernyakhovsky, an obscure young Colonel in command of the 28th tank division. The men had much in common, most prominently their penchant for unorthodox approaches to military art; they soon became close friends.|$|E
