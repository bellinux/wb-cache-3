5|$|The {{cemetery}} consists <b>of</b> <b>neat</b> {{lines of}} graves arranged on an east–west alignment, covering a nearly square area of about , in a layout {{not seen in}} any other known Anglo-Saxon cemetery. The enclosure within which the cemetery was laid out was many centuries older, dating to about 200BC; {{the establishment of a}} cemetery within its boundaries was probably intended to serve as a deliberate link to the past. It would still have been clearly visible in Saxon times. The layout of the cemetery seem to have consciously reflected that of the earlier enclosure, with its apparent main entrance aligned with that of the enclosure.|$|E
5|$|Bond's {{drinking}} habits run {{throughout the}} series of books. During the course of On Her Majesty's Secret Service alone, Bond consumes forty-six drinks: Pouilly-Fuissé, Riquewihr and Marsala wines, most of a bottle of Algerian wine, some 1953 Château Mouton Rothschild claret, along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters, half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon, Jack Daniel's whiskey, two double bourbons on the rocks, two whisky and sodas, two neat scotches and one glass <b>of</b> <b>neat</b> whisky; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis; other spirits included two double brandies with ginger ale, a flask of Enzian Schnaps and a double gin: he also washed this down with four steins of German beer. Bond's alcohol intake {{does not seem to}} affect his performance.|$|E

25|$|Production {{and sales}} <b>of</b> <b>neat</b> ethanol {{vehicles}} tumbled beginning in 1987 owing to several factors, including a {{sharp decline in}} gasoline prices {{as a result of the}} 1980s oil glut, and high sugar prices in the world market, shifting sugarcane ethanol production from fuel to sugar. By mid-1989, a shortage of ethanol fuel supply in the local market left thousands of vehicles in line at gas stations or out of fuel in their garages, forcing consumers to abandon ethanol vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} titled Systematic Chaos after Portnoy and Petrucci picked phrases from song lyrics {{that they felt}} would be a fitting title, in similar fashion to {{previous}} albums like Images and Words (1992) or Awake (1994). The pair selected the word [...] "chaos", which appears in [...] "The Dark Eternal Night". Petrucci and Portnoy were also attracted to the phrase [...] "Random thoughts <b>of</b> <b>neat</b> disorder" [...] which appears in [...] "Constant Motion". Inspired by the [...] "duality" [...] of the phrase, opposites of the word [...] "chaos" [...] were discussed, resulting in the word [...] "systematic". Portnoy said {{that in addition to}} the album, [...] "systematic chaos" [...] is also a [...] "fitting description of the band in general".|$|E
500|$|The album debuted on the Billboard 200 {{at number}} 144. Geffen shipped {{about half of}} the initial US {{pressing}} to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song's video had received a world premiere on MTV's late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified Gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, [...] "Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was kind <b>of</b> <b>neat.</b> But I don't give a shit about some kind of achievement like that. It's cool—I guess." ...|$|E

500|$|Giving {{the episode}} a 7.5 out of 10, Eric Walters of Paste stated, that [...] "Unlike last year, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{did not feel}} like a Flash episode {{featuring}} Team Arrow." [...] He expected the 2015 crossover would be bigger than previous years' noting: [...] "It is, but it's also far from complete." [...] He felt that [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{was not so much}} a The Flash episode, but more like [...] "the first half of something much larger". In the end, he wished [...] "the show had embraced it fully". Den of Geek's Mike Cecchini gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, saying: [...] "I'm really kind of amazed at just how much work [...] "Legends of Today" [...] gets done without just becoming a massive mess." [...] He described it as [...] "a proper two-parter this year" [...] and concluded: [...] "Amidst all the Legends of Tomorrow hooplah and the fun of getting the teams together, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] still manages to move the main Flash season 2 storyline forward in a couple <b>of</b> <b>neat</b> ways." ...|$|E
