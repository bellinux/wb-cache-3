5|$|A {{midazolam}} <b>overdose</b> {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine <b>overdose</b> in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine <b>overdose</b> and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the <b>overdose.</b> The antidote for an <b>overdose</b> of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in <b>overdose</b> than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause {{problems}} in <b>overdose.</b> Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in <b>overdose</b> and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine <b>overdose</b> may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin <b>overdose</b> can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute <b>overdose</b> has a {{mortality}} rate of 2%. Chronic <b>overdose</b> is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic <b>overdose</b> may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute <b>overdose.</b> Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E
40|$|WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES Paracetamol is a {{frequently}} used antipyretic and analgesic drug, {{but also a}} dose-dependent hepatotoxin. Unintentional paracetamol <b>overdosing</b> is a common medication error in hospitals. The present study aimed at (i) analysis of unintentional paracetamol <b>overdosing</b> in hospitalized patients; (ii) development, implementation and outcome analysis of an alert algorithm {{for the prevention of}} relevant paracetamol <b>overdosing.</b> METHODS All patients who received paracetamol in a Swiss tertiary care hospital during 2011 to 2014 were analysed to detect cases of paracetamol <b>overdosing</b> in a local pharmacoepidemiological database. In 2014, an automated algorithm screened the hospital's electronic prescribing system for patients at risk of <b>overdosing,</b> followed by expert validation. When imminent relevant <b>overdosing</b> was confirmed, alerts were issued to prescribers. Relevance was defined as prescriptions that permitted repeated daily paracetamol exposure of ≥ 5 g. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION From 2011 to 2013, relevant <b>overdosing</b> occurred in 11 patients (5 - 8 g/day for 3 to 5 days), which corresponds to 0 · 4 % of all patients exposed to any paracetamol <b>overdosing</b> (mean n = 988 per year). In 2014, alerts were issued by experts in 23 cases with subsequent changes to prescriptions in 21 (91 · 3 %) thereof. Although the occurrence of any paracetamol <b>overdosing</b> declined only marginally in 2014 (n = 914), no relevant <b>overdosing</b> occurred anymore. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Unintentional paracetamol <b>overdosing</b> was frequent but only a small fraction thereof was deemed relevant. This proof of concept study analysed local hospital data and developed a preventive system combining sensitive automated detection with subsequent specific expert validation. The resulting alerts achieved high compliance and prevented relevant paracetamol <b>overdosing...</b>|$|R
5|$|Intentional <b>overdosing</b> (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is {{frequently}} implicated in paracetamol toxicity. In a 2006 review, paracetamol {{was the most}} frequently ingested compound in intentional <b>overdosing.</b>|$|R
25|$|As of 2013 {{eighteen}} {{cases of}} <b>overdoses</b> {{had been reported}} with doses of up to 14.4 g without any reported fatalities. No specific antidote for <b>overdoses</b> exists and treatment is purely supportive.|$|R
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{method of}} prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, <b>overdose</b> is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol <b>overdose</b> each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in <b>overdose,</b> whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effect}} of {{warfarin}} use is bleeding. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate <b>overdose</b> or due to interactions). Many drug interactions can increase the effect of warfarin, also causing an <b>overdose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in <b>overdose.</b> For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an <b>overdose,</b> fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} drugs, <b>overdoses</b> of heparin can be fatal. In September 2006, heparin {{received}} worldwide publicity when three prematurely born infants died {{after they were}} mistakenly given <b>overdoses</b> of heparin at an Indianapolis hospital.|$|R
30|$|Through this study, {{we could}} {{identify}} {{the need for}} renal replacement therapy as a major risk factor for <b>overdosing.</b> In spite of a reduction in dosage in case of renal failure, it did {{not allow us to}} avoid <b>overdosing</b> in our intensive care population. Even if the severity of our patients’ condition may be an additional risk factor for <b>overdosing</b> in an ICU context, the proposed reduction by half of the dosage when the creatinine clearance is less than 30  mL/min is far from satisfactory. Further pharmacokinetic study is needed to clarify the mechanisms of this <b>overdosing</b> and to provide guidelines for dosage when facing renal function impairment.|$|R

50|$|Opioid <b>overdoses</b> kill through apnea and fatal hypoxia, often {{caused by}} {{combination}} with ethanol, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates. Substantial tolerance to respiratory depression develops quickly, and tolerant individuals can withstand larger doses. However, tolerance to respiratory depression is lost {{just as quickly}} during withdrawal. Many <b>overdoses</b> occur in people who misuse their medication after being in withdrawal long enough to lose the tolerance to respiratory depression. Less commonly, massive <b>overdoses</b> {{have been known to}} cause circulatory collapse.|$|R

5|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking aspirin can result in {{symptoms}} resembling an allergic reaction, including hives, swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy, but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an <b>overdose.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol <b>overdose,</b> then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol <b>overdose,</b> then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} reduce fatal self-poisoning {{legislation}} {{was introduced in the}} UK in 1998 to restrict pack sizes of paracetamol sold in pharmacies (maximum 32 tablets) and non-pharmacy outlets (maximum 16 tablets), and in Ireland in 2001, but with smaller maximum pack sizes (24 and 12 tablets). Our aim was to determine whether this resulted in smaller <b>overdoses</b> of paracetamol in Ireland compared with the UK. METHODS: We used data on general hospital presentations for non-fatal self-harm for 2002 - 2007 from the Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England (six hospitals), and from the National Registry of Deliberate Self-harm in Ireland. We compared sizes of <b>overdoses</b> of paracetamol in the two settings. RESULTS: There were clear peaks in numbers of non-fatal <b>overdoses,</b> associated with maximum pack sizes of paracetamol in pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets in both England and Ireland. Significantly more pack equivalents (based on maximum non-pharmacy pack sizes) were used in <b>overdoses</b> in Ireland (mean 2. 63, 95 % CI 2. 57 - 2. 69) compared with England (2. 07, 95 % CI 2. 03 - 2. 10). The overall size of <b>overdoses</b> did not differ significantly between England (median 22, interquartile range (IQR) 15 - 32) and Ireland (median 24, IQR 12 - 36). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in paracetamol pack size legislation between England and Ireland {{does not appear to have}} resulted in a major difference in sizes of <b>overdoses.</b> This is because more pack equivalents are taken in <b>overdoses</b> in Ireland, possibly reflecting differing enforcement of sales advice. Differences in access to clinical services may also be relevant...|$|R
