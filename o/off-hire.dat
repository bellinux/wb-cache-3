A term in the charterparty agreement required the ship to be seaworthy and to be [...] "in every way fitted for ordinary cargo service." [...] However the crew were both insufficient in number and incompetent to maintain her old-fashioned machinery; and the chief engineer was a drunkard. On the voyage from Liverpool to Osaka, the engines suffered several breakdowns, and was <b>off-hire</b> {{for a total of}} five weeks, undergoing repairs. On arrival at Osaka, a further fifteen weeks of repairs were needed before the ship was seaworthy again. By this time, barely seventeen months of the two-year time-charter remained. Once in Osaka, market freight rates fell, and Kawasaki terminated the contract citing Hong Kong's breach. Hong Kong responded that Kawasaki were now the party in breach for wrongfully repudiating the contract.|$|E
40|$|The inland {{repositioning}} {{of empty}} containers {{is a crucial}} problem for shipping companies providing door-to-door transport services to customers. This activity consists of the allocation of heterogeneous fleets of empty containers between inland depots and ports, {{so that they can}} be properly positioned in anticipation of future customer requests. This article describes how shipping companies perform this complex activity and its links with truck routing problems and the repositioning of empty containers on maritime networks. To address the inland repositioning of empty containers, we propose a time-extended optimization model, whose innovative elements are decision variables and constraints on the so-called flexible leased containers, which can be on-hired and <b>off-hired</b> according to a number of clauses, and substitution options between container types. The experimentation shows that the model is an effective instrument to support the current decision-making process on this issue, because realistic size instances can be solved within time limits imposed by planning operations...|$|R

Furthermore I will then look at one particular situation in <b>off-hire</b> where the law is not yet completely settle, the matter of when vessel is delayed by an <b>off-hire</b> situation but for some reason the charterer are prevented from using the vessel as intended during that <b>off-hire</b> period.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the scope}} of {{carriage}} of goods by sea, the central issue is the vessel. Obviously, {{the efficiency of the}} vessel is of utmost importance not only to the shipowner who render the vessel to earn hire but also the charterer who pay the hire in the purpose to utilize the vessel. Sometimes, the vessel might be out of order or cannot work efficiently. Therefore, there must be the collision of interests between the parties on whether paying the hire continuously in this situation. In other words, it is the problem of triggering <b>off-hire</b> clause in the charterparty. Though the standard forms, such as NYPE and Baltime form have the <b>off-hire</b> clause, however, the utilization of the clause is ambiguous according to different situation. Therefore, the critical challenge faced by the Court is how to trigger the <b>off-hire</b> clause more reasonable so that the interests of parties can be balanced...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative dynamic route management model for direct on-demand transportation services. In these scenarios, a carrier is hired for a transportation service from an origin to a destination point and then released. Subsequently, {{being in the}} <b>off-hire</b> condition, the carrier can wait in the destination point or move towards another loading dock. The aim of the approach is to identify the best route and the optimal waiting strategy of the carrier while in the <b>off-hire</b> condition, minimizing the dead-head movement costs and maximizing the expected profit originating from the forecasted demand. This model has been tested in the industry of the oil tankers fleet. So far this problem has been partially fronted with models which {{are focused on the}} evaluation of each loading dock profitability, lacking however to consider the opportunity of a continuous-moves routing in the <b>off-hire</b> condition. This analysis defines instead a dynamic strategy which estimates the future demand and is continuously updated by the other carriers movements and by the variation in the scenario. A set of Deviation Points and Waiting Areas are identified respectively as alternatives for the carrier <b>off-hire</b> movements and as areas in which the carrier has the possibility to stop and wait for a new order. These points are determined on a geographical map on behalf of statistical and economical considerations. Time constraints are also considered, especially in terms of Time Windows in which the carrier has to react to the demand and to reach the origin of the order...|$|E

40|$|The {{freight rates}} across {{geographical}} {{regions in the}} drybulk segment may experience substantial differences on a short-term basis, but generally move in tandem in the long-term. If these temporary differences cannot be exploited financially by applying trading rules based on publicly available information, then the market {{can be viewed as}} spatially efficient. This paper uses cointegration analysis to establish the long-term relationship between supramax tripcharter rates, and moves on to evaluate the financial profitability of trigger based trading rules. These rules are based on spreads between certain tripcharter rates. The trading rules are applied in order to investigate whether the short-term differences allowed under cointegration are transient enough to coincide with a spatially efficient market. The results provide evidence of a profitable trading strategy, but when accounting for potential <b>off-hire</b> ballasting activity these profits are zeroed out. Thus, the conclusion points towards a spatially efficient dry bulk supramax market. nhhma...|$|E
40|$|Contracts used by marine {{contractors}} in {{the offshore}} installation business are normally detailed and large in size. The contracts deals with complex projects and regulates obligations and economic risk between the parties. This thesis is {{a presentation of}} the frequently used contracts, SUPPLYTIME 05 and NSC 05, and an identification of contractual economic risks exposed to marine contractors through these two contracts. I am doing a practical contractual economic risk analysis of central clauses in the contracts from the marine contractors’ point of view. The analysis is an identification of differences and a comparison of chosen clauses in these two contracts. Problems of particular interest is late delivery of vessels, <b>off-hire,</b> and pollution. SUPPLYTIME 05 and NSC 05 treat these particular problems differently. Therefore, these problems can be of great interest for marine contractors. Other problems of interest are damage, and variations to the Work. Both contracts have similar, so called knock-for-knock clauses regarding damage. Rules regarding variations to the Work are only covered in NSC 05.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with ship management. It starts by defining, it shows why these services are needed {{and what are the}} purposes and objective. Purpose, ethos and means are distinguished; method of taking internal and external appraisals and adopting the effective strategic plan is explained. Organization and strategy being interdependent requires the organization to suit the strategy which in turn is suitable for achieving these objectives. The point of providing the services to the requirements and standards (up to a certain extent) of the owners (and not enforcing the standards of managers) is stressed. The aim is to optimise the resources at hand and achieve the objectives of both owner and manager. Then ship management and its components are examined in detail giving consideration to both theoretical and practicl aspects. Weak areas in ship management are exposed and theoretical principles applied to achieve improved results. Important and modem techniques for controlling budgets and reducing breakdowns which in turn reduces the <b>off-hire</b> time are explained as is the utmost importance of having an efficient communication system to speed up the operations. Various types of shipowners and institutions who require their ships to be managed, are examined so that an effective system can be formulated to suit the requirements of individual owners. Then six British ship management companies are investigated and results are compared. This highlights the strong and weak points of ship management. Better ideas are developed in order to form an effective strategy which can attract more business even in a depressed and competitive market...|$|E
40|$|A {{conversion}} {{describes the}} process in which a ship undergoes large modifications. For cruise ships, conversions are costly processes that often require drydocking and lengthy <b>off-hire</b> periods. There are many drivers that necessitate such large investments, including technical considerations such as a vessel’s age or operational efficiency, as well as strategic ones such as market competition and revenue. Regardless of the reason, conversions demand large workloads, {{both in terms of}} the drydock process and the planning period beforehand. The primary aim of this thesis is to investigate what can be done during a vessel’s initial design stage to reduce the length, planning, and cost of future conversions. Ideally, recommendations should be straightforward, simple to implement, and cost-effective. By identifying potential initial design improvements, a provident approach is established for a ship’s entire lifecycle. In order to develop this outline, current conversion trends are studied at a broad, industry-wide and narrowed vessel level in order to identify today’s conversion drivers and tasks. Using this information, four common conversion cases are selected as the foundation for the initial design solutions. These cases are broad enough to cover all relevant conversion tasks yet narrow enough to yield specific design solutions. A rules-based approach is then adopted to identify the technical challenges and initial design implications of each case, with a focus on SOLAS regulations. The cases are studied with respect to three disciplines, chosen due to their respective impacts on conversion processes. Namely, these are structural fire protection, means of escape and evacuation, and stability. Each discipline carries significant weight both in initial design and conversion engineering and the final recommendations therefore have broad influences. The final list of initial design recommendations covers the three disciplines through arrangement principles and conservative margin allowances. Structural fire protection methods primarily focus on the classification of perimeter bulkhead and deck boundaries. Those for means of escape and evacuation are presented as both arrangement and margin solutions. The dimensioning of escape ways, lifesaving capacity, and evacuation routing are the bases for recommendations within this discipline. Finally, stability concerns are addressed through allowances and planning aimed at both the construction period and entire service life of a ship. The thesis concludes with a case study and a discussion of the results and future implications of the research. The goal of the case study is to illustrate the methods identified and identify the prevalence and impact of the various conversion cases by considering a recently built cruise ship. The emphasis of the case study is on structural fire protection, since it is the most tangible of the three disciplines. The following discussion highlights the limitations and future considerations of both the study itself and the topic as a whole...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} dealing with legal issues that may arise in a course of {{chartering}} of vessels for the offshore special surveys (data collection). The offshore seismic data acquisition is used as the main example. However, {{a large part of}} the discussion can be equally relevant for the charter parties intended for other survey types (e. g., pipeline surveys, electromagnetic seabed sounding, and many others). The special survey operations are distinguished by use of the high technologies and, thus, expensive equipment. Most of these technical features are essential for fulfilling such tasks, and many of them are interrelated with issues of chartering a survey ship. Such agreements are most often based on the standard BIMCO’s (The Baltic International Maritime Conference) SUPPLYTIME 89 or SUPPLYTIME 2005 forms. The aim of the current research is, in general, to develop an understanding of possible legal implications of the use of SUPPLYTIME 2005 when chartering the special survey vessels The survey is typically run for a client (e. g., an oil company), and the relationship between the entity acquiring the data and the client are regulated by the data acquisition contract. In turn, the entity acquiring the data is the charterer with respect to the discussed charter parties. The data acquisition contract always prescribes minimum “standards of work”, which set strict requirements on the work of the ship and the equipment (both belonging to the shipowner and to the charterer). The problems considered in the paper could be provisionally divided into two categories. Issues attributed to the first category are related to the essence of the charter party of survey ships and the notion of “vessel’s work”. The second category embraces the issues related to the “equipment”. In general, it has been shown that the terms of SUPPLYTIME 2005 became less favorable to charterer in comparison to SUPPLYTIME 89. Considerable part of the outcomes of this research comprised of the findings related to the off hire. Firstly (i), it has been shown that in certain circumstances it is very difficult to fulfill the condition of “being prevented from working” under survey charters based on SUPPLYTIME 2005. Secondly (ii), it has been argued that such a cause for the vessel going off hire as failings and/or breakdown of equipment will be hardly found as a relevant cause to award the charterer to an <b>off-hire,</b> since such causes are not included in the wording of cl. 13 (a). It was demonstrated that the possibility that a court will find the condition (i) fulfilled and, at the same time, the cause (ii) falling within the scope of cl. 13 (a) is very questionable. This makes the charterer a vulnerable party in relation to the off hire. Possible ways to develop the standard form in connection with these and other issues were suggested...|$|E
40|$|A {{lengthening}} of {{a specialized}} reefer ship {{has been investigated}} {{in order to determine}} if it is economically viable or not. The ship type considered is the Crown class specialized reefer ships, where the Crown Topaz and the Crown Ruby are used as reference ships for this study. In order to determine whether a lengthening is economically viable or not, a conceptual design of the lengthened ship has been done. Costs related to the conversion and income due to the increased cargo capacity are calculated and compared in order to determine when the investment for the conversion reaches break-even. The ship is lengthened by an open-top section of 28 m, a lengthening from 152 m to 180 m. This results in an increased displacement of the ship which results in a greater cargo capacity. The extension allows for 108 extra FEU high cube refrigerated containers with a gross weight of 30 tonnes. The open-top section and necessary reinforcements are dimensioned according to the requirements of the Classification Society NKK in order to calculate the added weight and costs for the conversion. The result shows an increase in resistance of about 15 % for a cruising speed of 19 knots and loaded to 80 % of DWT, which is the most common load case for the reference ship. The fuel consumption thereby increases by 15 % for a cruising speed of 19 knots. The extra cargo capacity of 108 containers corresponds to an increase in container capacity of 154 % and about 31 % of the total paying cargo capacity, while the increase in fuel consumption for the main machinery is about 15 % for a cruising speed of 19 knots and the extra auxiliary engine contributes to an increase of 40 % in fuel consumption for the auxiliary engines. Costs for the conversion and loss due to <b>off-hire</b> time are summarized to 5. 025 M. USD. The extra income for the containers is calculated to 7715 USD per day with a freight rate of 2500 USD per container. With the fuel oil price of today of 595 USD/tonne and the increased port tariffs due to the conversion, the investment will reach break-even in 4 years. Even if the fuel oil price increases about 8. 7 % to 647 USD/tonne the investment will reach break-even after 4 ½ years in operation. If the ships operates within a trade similar to the Coman-trade and with an income of 3000 USD per container the investment will reach break-even after about 2 ½ years with a fuel oil price of 595 USD/tonne and 3 years with a fuel oil price of 647 USD/tonne. Since the Crown class fleet has an average age of 16 years today, the conversion has to be implemented early to make the investment profitable before the ships are ready to be scrapped...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{failures}} of bulk carriers continue {{to account for}} the loss of many lives every year. Capes are particularly vulnerable to cracking because of their large length, their trade in high density cargos, and the high rates of cargo operations. Rapid loss often occurs allowing little reaction time which has alarmed the industry. The Cape market is extremely volatile with ship values appreciating in some cases by over 500 % and then returning to original levels, all within a few years. Recent market changes have rendered conventional pricing methods inaccurate and often inapplicable, resulting in a pressing need for alternate valuation models. Very little research combines the closely interlinked technical and financial elements which are crucial for valuation and decision making by various parties in the shipping industry. The present research involves the collection and analysis of one of the largest ship cracking surveys. It is focused specifically on capes which lie {{at the core of the}} problem and is based on the records of ship owners, classification societies and shipyards. A location coding system was specifically designed to analyze the data and present the frequency, size and estimated crack growth rates with respect to location and ship age. The results were compared with existing knowledge based on surveys conducted over the past 50 years, the stress distribution based on an investigation of loading patterns, and theoretical fracture mechanics predictions. They were then combined with the frequency of crack failures, derived from an investigation of an extensive fleet sample, to develop a reliability model which yields the hazard function throughout the ship's life. Repair procedures and design modifications were also examined and a model was designed to assess their cost effectiveness based on the present value of projected crack costs. The crack repair costs were calculated as a function of ship age to be used in conjunction with the safety assessment for decision making by ship owners, insurance companies, classification societies and others. A new state of the art valuation model was developed combining both technical and financial aspects in a fundamental valuation based on risk-adjusted discounting of expected cash flows. A forward view of the main parameters was obtained from derivatives and financial securities that include shipping futures, FFAs, options, interest rate swaps and inflation protected bonds. The inherent risk of cracks is treated as a fictitious credit risk, derived from the reliability model, and is incorporated into the discount rate along with other risk premiums. Other inputs include repair costs and <b>off-hire</b> time, which were calculated with respect to ship age using a database of repairs, while the records of public and private companies were used along with surveys to estimate operating expenses. The resulting valuations were found to be in very close alignment with recent transaction prices across all ship ages. The model also estimates the volatility of the ship value and uses it to price optionalities that are often included in ship transactions. The combination of technical and financial analysis of this thesis is valuable to many involved in the shipping industry including brokers, accountants, analysts, shipping banks and investors interested in valuation; ship owners when making managerial or investment decisions; shipyards when designing ships, setting prices and deciding payment structures and options; insurance companies when covering total loss or emergency repairs; the IMO when setting regulations; and classification societies when scheduling inspections and deciding which areas to focus on. by Nicholas Andrew Hadjiyiannis.

40|$|Quickly {{adapting}} to changing market conditions {{is crucial for}} every firm, especially in volatile and capital intensive markets. These are two characteristics of the maritime industry. Incorporating flexibility in design have gathered an increased focus as means to cope with such a dynamic context. To be flexible is not always enough, partially because exploiting this flexibility causes a time delay. This time delay causes more uncertainty, which could make a good investment decision into a bad one. Hence, this master thesis investigates the contribution from investment lags in engineering systems by the following: (i) Structuring and presenting a real option framework for identification of possible design solutions that reduces investment lag (ii) Propose value models for system design changes that are exposed for investment lag (iii) Propose design solutions that limits the investment lag. For this, an elongation of a dry bulk vessel is a thorough example. Agility represents {{the ability of a}} system to change quickly, and investment lag is the time from the decision is made until the system has changed capabilities. All investments have lags to some degree, which is often disregarded in traditional real options analyses. For systems with relatively long time lags, {{there is a need to}} better understand the impact of these investment lags. To identify design solutions that enables agility, a further separation in the real options framework has been proposed as a contribution to the existing literature. On options is seen as the superior option, which is the operational option on a projects future cash flow. This is often related to changes in value enabling variables, and as this is the conventional real option, there exist an established valuation framework for it. Further, on options are separated in two classes, Built-in-Design options and Design Change options. The former is multifunctionality that are implemented in the system from the initial design stage, the latter are options that make changes in the design, often referred to as in options, which comes with an investment lag due to <b>off-hire</b> when performing the design change. By this separation of on options, path enablers could be tied to real options. Path enablers are features that enables easier change in value enabling variables, making it easier to exercise options. Design path enablers are design features that enables easier exercise of design change option, thereby reducing the investment lag and cost of exercise. Thus, Design Change options could be seen as operational path enablers, that enables change of operation, which by definition is an on options. The relation between the option value of a capacity expansion/market entry, and the investment lag is defined to value agility. This gives a possible value for investment lag reducing path enablers. A design neutral capacity expansion in the dry bulk freight market is used as an illustrative case, and by introducing the investment lag as a parameter in the real option model, the value of a capacity expansion option could be considered as a function of investment lag. For this, the cost of investment lag is defined as the opportunity cost of operating in the market. The analysis is conducted in several steps, by three models with increasing degree of complexity. Qualitative and quantitative time series analysis on dry bulk freight rates in the Capesize segment in the time span between 1990 and 2017 resulted in freight market replications for two of the models using the geometric Mean Reversion model, and the last with market rates and asset prices as correlated mean reversion paths. Then, by Monte Carlo simulation, a now-or-never investment analysis determines the value of agility by simulation of the projects cash flows, thereafter through including investment timing flexibility based on the Least Squares Monte Carlo algorithm, which gives the value of agility through an established option valuation framework. For this model two approaches were taken, one with correlated vessel values and freight rates, and one with vessel values as a value of underlying freight rates. The option value reflects a premium of second hand vessel prices with different investment lags, and with no investment lag the maximum value will be respectively 147, 60 and 12. 2 USD/dwt for the now-or-never approach, LSMC and LSMC and with correlated asset paths, which is reduced to 85 %, 65 % and 55 % of maximum value for an investment lag of 6 months. The results of the different models are quite consistent in their form, and the spread between the maximum value can be explained through different approaches and different underlying stochastic processes. The LSMC model with vessel values as function of freight rates is seen as the most realistic, as it includes investment timing flexibility and geometric Mean Reversion as underlying stochastic process for freight market dynamics. Further, design path enablers for the illustrative case is proposed, an elongation of a dry bulk carrier which gives a capacity expansion. Design path enablers for this elongation is elements that make the vessel ready for elongation, examples of this can be thickness of plates and visibility. As the design still water bending moment and wave bending moment is a function of L^ 3, a greater thickness is required. Further, the visibility of water surface shall not be obscured by more than 1 xLOA forward of the bow. Hence, path enablers for an elongation from 150 m to 200 m could be to build the initially 150 m long vessel with bottom plate thickness of 12 mm instead of the required 11 mm and a higher bridge. This will make the initial structure ready for 200 m LOA. By implementing design path enablers one increases the design freedom over the systems lifetime. In conventional design thinking, a design is often optimised for a base case. Though, by implementing design path enablers, one admit that the future is uncertain and partly unpredictable, and enables easier future design changes. This will increase the design freedom over the systems lifetime, which again is reflected by flexibility in operations at a strategic level. By implementing such design path enablers, together with Built-in design options, agility is enabled through design, thus, Agility by Design...|$|E
