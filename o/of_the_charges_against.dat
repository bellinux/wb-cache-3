5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed psychologists to be competent to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> her, rather than be tried separately on each.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Pechersky {{returned}} to Rostov-on-Don, where he lived before the war, and started working as administrator in an Operetta theater.

The International Tribunal at Nuremberg wanted to call Pechersky as a witness, but the Soviet government wouldn't allow him to travel to Germany to testify.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann's trial {{before the}} Jerusalem District Court began on 11 April 1961. The legal basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Eichmann was the 1950 Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law, under {{which he was}} indicted on 15 {{criminal}} charges, including crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, and membership in a criminal organisation. The trial was presided over by three judges: Moshe Landau, Benjamin Halevy and Yitzhak Raveh. The chief prosecutor was Israeli Attorney General Gideon Hausner, assisted by Gabriel Bach of the Department of Justice and Tel Aviv District Attorney Yaakov Bar-Or. The defence team consisted of German lawyer Robert Servatius, legal assistant Dieter Wechtenbruch, and Eichmann himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{family members}} are afraid to testify at the mock trial and at the real deposition; Buster fakes a coma, Lindsay and Lucille fake {{entering}} rehab, and Gob flees the country to perform in a USO Tour in Iraq. The deceptions are all uncovered by the prosecution, and in Iraq Gob is arrested for inadvertently inciting an anti-US riot. Buster and Michael travel to Iraq to rescue Gob, and while there, uncover evidence that the mini-palaces George Sr. built in Iraq were actually ordered and {{paid for by the}} CIA for wiretapping purposes. After this discovery, the US government drops all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> George Sr. In the general confusion, everyone except George Michael forgets Maeby's sixteenth birthday.|$|E

On 24 September 2012, Tạ Phong Tần was sentenced to ten years in prison. Her arrest was protested by groups including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the US State Department, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch.|$|E

On the same day, Wyatt {{sent a message to}} Ike Clanton that he wanted to reconcile their differences, which Clanton refused. Clanton was also acquitted that day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> him in the shooting of Virgil Earp, when the defense brought in seven witnesses who testified that Clanton was in Charleston {{at the time of the}} shooting.|$|E
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E

Mackay Radio's claim, Roberts said, largely turned on whether the Board had failed to define a current labor dispute.
