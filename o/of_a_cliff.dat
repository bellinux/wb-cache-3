5|$|In 2004, three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were {{discovered}} in rock formed from late Devonian river sediments on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, in northern Canada. Estimated ages reported at 375 MYA, 379 MYA, and 383 MYA. At {{the time of the}} species' existence, Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia (modern eastern North America and Greenland), which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate. When discovered, one of the skulls was found sticking out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff.</b> Upon further inspection, the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.|$|E

5|$|The Old Man of Hoy is a 449-foot (137m) sea stack on {{the island}} of Hoy, part of the Orkney {{archipelago}} off the north coast of Scotland. Formed from Old Red Sandstone, {{it is one of the}} tallest stacks in Britain. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and may soon collapse into the sea.|$|E

5|$|He {{returns to}} Gastown and learns Scrotus' {{location}} from Scab. Max and Chumbucket find Scrotus driving around the Purgatory Flatlands an area {{far away from}} the Great White and use the Magnum Opus to crash the Land Mover, which is pushed to the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff.</b> Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car {{at the start of the}} game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him.

5|$|If {{the player}} instead waits, the cabin gets transported to Aosagi Island. Yomogi, Mayuzumi, and Cocoro avoid the {{avalanche}} that was {{mentioned in the}} newspaper. The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; he thinks that she, too, was experiencing the transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child over the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who says she does not recognize him.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Irwin was {{filming a}} {{documentary}} on sea lions {{off the coast of}} Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's radio that two scuba divers were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On {{the second day of the}} search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff.</b> Irwin and a crew member escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid over the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at {{the summit of the}} Hut Point promontory.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 (2009) {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} African town of Kijuju in 2009, where a {{biological}} agent has turned local residents into zombies. Valentine has been missing since a fight with her commander-turned-double agent Albert Wesker, years before the game's events. The fight is shown in the game's Lost in Nightmares downloadable content (DLC), in which Redfield and Valentine search for Umbrella's founder, Ozwell E. Spencer, inside a mansion on the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff.</b> Instead they find Wesker, who overpowers them. To save Redfield, Valentine tackles Wesker, and they both crash through a window and over the cliff. Their bodies are not recovered, and Valentine is declared dead. In fact she was injured by the fall and saved by Wesker, who then used her as a test subject in his experiments on mutagenic viruses.|$|E
5|$|Thanatos– The former God of Death, {{father of}} Erinys, and main {{antagonist}} of Ghost of Sparta.

While Kratos and Deimos were battling, Thanatos snatched Deimos from the battle and dropped him on the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff.</b> Deimos was saved by Kratos, who united with his brother to fight the God of Death, who transformed into a winged beast. Thanatos mocked Kratos for Ares' mistaken decision and eventually killed Deimos, but was killed in turn by an angered Kratos. The character was voiced by Arthur Burghardt in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E

5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped at the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff,</b> over which the deer and hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan when he heard a voice from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E

5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E
