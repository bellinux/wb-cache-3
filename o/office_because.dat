5|$|Jewell was the 51st Secretary of the Interior, and {{the second}} woman to hold the position. Unlike many of her predecessors, Jewell never held elected <b>office.</b> <b>Because</b> she {{acquired}} her U.S. citizenship by naturalization rather than being a natural-born citizen, Jewell was not eligible to hold a place within the presidential line of succession.|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{remained}} in <b>office</b> <b>because</b> the new electoral register {{was not yet}} ready; neither party wished a poll under the old roll. Gladstone began using the Liberal majority in the House of Commons to push through resolutions and legislation. Disraeli's government survived until the December general election, at which the Liberals were returned to power with a majority of about 110.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} last girl, Yogesh's mother beseeches him to choose with his heart {{instead of his}} mind. Yogesh sees all of the girls in a dream, {{and in the morning}} decides who he will marry. He goes to Rajni's <b>office</b> <b>because</b> she offered a 50-million-rupee dowry, and is {{relieved}} to discover that she is marrying someone else. Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He says {{there is no need for}} Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E
5000|$|The {{town has}} three post <b>offices</b> <b>because</b> it {{contains}} four different unincorporated townships under municipal {{jurisdiction of the}} town of Fairfield: ...|$|R
25|$|Long {{distance}} switches may use a slower, {{more efficient}} switch-allocation algorithm than local central <b>offices,</b> <b>because</b> they have near 100% utilization of their {{input and output}} channels. Central offices have more than 90% of their channel capacity unused.|$|R
50|$|Class C licensees had {{the same}} {{privileges}} as Class B licensees, but took their examinations from other licensees rather than from Commission field <b>offices.</b> <b>Because</b> examination requirements were somewhat stiffened, Temporary Amateur licensees were not grandfathered into this class but had to be licensed anew.|$|R
5|$|Morrow also demanded {{consistency}} {{from local}} law enforcement officials. In 1921, he removed the Woodford County jailer from <b>office</b> <b>because</b> he allowed a black inmate to be lynched and offered a reward of $25,000 {{for information leading to}} the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. Citizens of Versailles were more outraged that the jailer had been removed from office than that the prisoner had been lynched. The locals refused to aid in the investigation, and the lynchers were never arrested or charged. Local officials appointed the jailer's wife to finish his term in an attempt to skirt the removal.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, {{a formal}} opinion by the Attorney General {{concluded}} that resignation from Congress does not free a member {{to be appointed}} to civil <b>office</b> <b>because</b> the Clause speaks to the term for which a member was elected, and that term still exists, even if a member resigns. Therefore, as in the Paterson matter nine decades earlier, Iowa Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood, who had resigned a Senate seat with a term that did not expire until March 1883, was ineligible for appointment {{to the position of}} United States Tariff Commissioner. In 1896, the Comptroller of the Treasury determined, after the fact, that former Senator Matthew Ransom's appointment as Minister to Mexico was invalid, as that office's salary had been increased during Ransom's term; the belated discovery precluded Ransom from drawing a salary.|$|E
5|$|In late 1985, Jones {{announced}} his candidacy for lieutenant {{governor in the}} 1987 election, conceding that he sought the <b>office</b> <b>because</b> {{he would like to}} serve as governor in the future. He convincingly won in the Democratic primary against Paul E. Patton, who later became governor, and David L. Armstrong, the sitting Attorney General and later Mayor of Louisville. Wallace G. Wilkinson, winner of the Democratic gubernatorial primary, praised Jones and said that, if elected, he would make Jones the head of a blue-ribbon economic development council. Wilkinson and Jones {{went on to win the}} general election; Jones defeated Republican nominee Lawrence R. Webster by a convincing vote of 517,811 to 186,321.|$|E
50|$|He was a {{frequent}} festival orator at great academic ceremonies, including the memorial service in honor of Melanchthon in 1560, and at the university jubilee in 1578. On 5 January 1599 he resigned his <b>offices</b> <b>because</b> of infirmity. He died at Tübingen on 22 May 1600.|$|R
60|$|Officers of {{the regular}} and {{volunteer}} forces headed the ultra-Spanish element in an attack upon the leading liberal newspaper <b>offices,</b> <b>because,</b> as alleged, of Captain-General Blanco’s refusal to authorise {{the suppression of the}} liberal press. It was evidently a riotous protest against Spain’s policy of granting autonomy to the Cubans.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Republic Act No. 6516 {{was enacted}} authorizing the {{district}} land officers in every province to sign patents not exceeding five hectares thereby fully devolving the functions {{to the district}} <b>offices.</b> <b>Because</b> of the devolution, {{more than two million}} hectares of agricultural land was distributed by the Bureau of Lands from 1970 to 1980.|$|R
5|$|Rubin {{studied for}} her Ph.D. at Georgetown University, the only {{university}} in Washington, DC that offered {{a graduate degree}} in astronomy. She was 23 years old and pregnant when she began her doctoral studies, and the Rubins had one young child at home. She began to take classes with Francis Heyden, who recommended her to George Gamow, her eventual doctoral advisor. Her dissertation, completed in 1954, concluded that galaxies clumped together, rather than being randomly distributed through the universe, a controversial idea not pursued by others for two decades. Throughout her graduate studies, she experienced discouraging sexism, including an incident where she {{was not allowed to}} meet with her advisor in his <b>office,</b> <b>because</b> women were not allowed in that area of the university.|$|E
5|$|To market Radioland Murders, Universal {{attached}} a film trailer to The Flintstones in May 1994. The studio believed both films would specifically {{appeal to the}} Baby Boom Generation. Radioland Murders was originally set to be theatrically released in September 1994 before it was pushed back. The film was released in the United States on October 21, 1994 in 844 theaters, only grossing $1.37 million. Ultimately the film bombed at the box <b>office</b> <b>because</b> it did not recoup its $15 million budget. It ranks among the top ten widely released films for having the biggest second weekend drop at the box office, dropping 78.5% from $835,570 to $179,315.|$|E
25|$|On 12 March 2009, Romanov {{announced}} {{that he intended to}} stand for election to become President of Lithuania. The Lithuanian electoral commission then advised Romanov that he is ineligible for that <b>office</b> <b>because</b> he was born in Russia.|$|E
50|$|Ironically, when Potsdamer Platz was rebuilt after German reunification, {{the site}} of Haus Vaterland was the only parcel on which no {{entertainment}} facility was sited, only <b>offices,</b> <b>because</b> it was felt to be too small. The building abutting the square was given a semi-circular façade in homage to the round section of the building which had once stood there.|$|R
25|$|Inefficient bureaucracies were {{frequently}} created, with for instance, Bulgarian farms having {{to meet at}} least six hundred different plan fulfillment figures. Socialist product requirements produced distorted black market consequences, such that broken light bulbs possessed significant market values in Eastern Bloc <b>offices</b> <b>because</b> a broken light bulb was required to be submitted before a new light bulb would be issued.|$|R
25|$|Because it {{does not}} require two {{separate}} votes, IRV is assumed to cost less than two-round primary/general or general/runoff election methods. However, in 2009, the auditor of Washington counties reported that the ongoing costs of the system were not necessarily balanced by the costs of eliminating runoffs for most county <b>offices,</b> <b>because</b> those elections may be needed for other offices not elected by IRV. Other jurisdictions have reported immediate cost savings.|$|R
25|$|The PUP {{were seeking}} a second {{consecutive}} {{term in office}} after recording significant development in the economy from 1998 to 2003. Their opponents, the UDP, sought to replace them in <b>office</b> <b>because</b> of charges of corruption and mismanagement of public funds. Previous to this election, the parties had alternated their time in office since independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{same day}} that Hurtado arrived in Manila, the cabildo (city council) of that city {{confirmed}} Hernando Guerrero as Archbishop of Manila. Guerrero {{had been in the}} city, with a royal appointment to the position, since 1632, but had not taken possession of his <b>office</b> <b>because</b> the necessary papal bull had not been received. The cabildo had therefore refused him recognition. Almost immediately disputes arose between Governor Hurtado and Archbishop Guerrero.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{judicial}} responsibilities, the Great Seneschal {{was also}} in charge of convening local nobility in New France, as well as issuing declarations of war if necessary. However, such alternative role of the Great Seneschal was much weakened soon after by having the rights to declare war and to administer finances stripped off from the <b>office</b> <b>because</b> the French crown feared that colonial officers held too much authority.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party also {{divided on}} a {{strategy}} for contesting the general election. Most Democrats heading into the May convention decided to not oppose the governorship and other state <b>offices</b> <b>because</b> Governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain had implemented many favorable reforms. Known as fusionists, they also felt that any effort spent on state offices would be wasted and better served by trying to acquire {{a majority in the}} General Assembly.|$|R

25|$|Upon the {{abolition}} of the board in 1802, President Jefferson appointed Thornton the first Superintendent of the Patent Office. When Washington was burned by the British in 1814, Thornton convinced them not to burn the Patent <b>Office</b> <b>because</b> of its importance to mankind. He held the position from June 1, 1802 until his death in 1828 in Washington, DC. During his tenure, he introduced innovations including the patent reissue practice, which survives to this day.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 2002 Queen Beatrix asked Balkenende {{to form a}} new {{government}} after the general elections following the resignation of Prime Minister Wim Kok. This cabinet is known as Balkenende I. The coalition cabinet included the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) party, whose leader (Pim Fortuyn) was assassinated just days before the election. It collapsed after just 87 days in <b>office</b> <b>because</b> of internal conflicts within the LPF that destabilised the government.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 1950s, Southern Rhodesia had a vibrant {{political}} life with {{right and left}} wing parties competing for power. The Rhodesian Labour Party held seats in the Assembly and in municipal councils throughout the 1920s and 1930s. From 1953 to 1958, the prime minister was Garfield Todd, a liberal who did much to promote {{the development of the}} Black community through investment in education, housing and healthcare. However, the government forced Todd from <b>office</b> <b>because</b> his proposed reforms were seen by many whites as too radical.|$|E
50|$|Shared cable Ethernet {{is always}} hard to install in <b>offices</b> <b>because</b> its bus {{topology}} is {{in conflict with}} the star topology cable plans designed into buildings for telephony. Modifying Ethernet to conform to twisted pair telephone wiring already installed in commercial buildings provided another opportunity to lower costs, expand the installed base, and leverage building design, and, thus, twisted-pair Ethernet was the next logical development in the mid-1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Dominic Candeloro stated that, in the City of Chicago, few Italians {{have been}} elected to major <b>offices</b> <b>because</b> [...] "The number of Italians in the larger electoral units has never been great enough to {{challenge}} successfully other ethnic groups, and the Mafia image has {{made it difficult for}} Italian politicians in larger districts" [...] Candeloro added, [...] "There has never been even a serious Italian candidate for mayor of Chicago." ...|$|R
30|$|Nowadays {{semi-rigid}} {{connections are}} of considerable interest to researchers and design <b>offices</b> <b>because</b> {{they are easy}} to install in steel frames and have considerable energy dissipating capacity under seismic excitation. Recognizing the importance of these connections in practice, AISC (2001, 2005) specifications recommend inclusion of this group of connections in the Partially Restrained (PR) construction category. However, detail design guidelines for this group of connections, especially for angle type of connections, are not developed yet.|$|R
25|$|British Prime Ministers {{have never}} been elected {{directly}} by the public. A Prime Minister {{need not be a}} party leader; David Lloyd George was not a party leader during his service as prime Minister during World War I, and neither was Ramsay MacDonald from 1931 to 1935. Prime Ministers have taken <b>office</b> <b>because</b> they were members of either the Commons or Lords, and either inherited a majority in the Commons or won more seats than the opposition in a general election.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, {{the year}} after Walton’s removal from office, U.S. Senator Robert L. Owen retired; he had {{represented}} Oklahoma in the Senate since it became a state in 1907. Walton promptly entered the primary for Senator and won the Democratic nomination. Walton may have won the nomination so soon after his removal from <b>office</b> <b>because</b> {{he was the only}} Democratic candidate to criticize the Klan publicly. However, Walton lost in the general election in a landslide (62% to 35%) to Republican William B. Pine.|$|E
25|$|But in function, the Australian Parliament {{follows the}} Westminster system. The Prime Minister holds <b>office</b> <b>because</b> they can command {{the support of}} the {{majority}} of the House of Representatives, and must resign or advise an immediate election if the house passes a vote of no-confidence in their administration. If they fail to do so, they risk dismissal by the Governor-General. All ministers are required to be members of Parliament (although the Constitution permits a person who is not currently a member of parliament to hold a ministerial portfolio for a maximum period of three months).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{his rise}} in prominence, Briggs {{was at first}} ineligible for state <b>offices</b> <b>because</b> he did not own property. In 1830 he {{decided to run for}} Congress, for which there was no such requirement. He was elected to the twenty-second through the twenty-fourth Congresses as an Anti-Jacksonian, and as a Whig to the twenty-fifth through twenty-seventh Congresses, serving from March 4, 1831 to March 3, 1843. He decided not to run for reelection in 1842.|$|R
50|$|His {{office is}} {{connected}} to the Regional Council, which is elected contextually: a majority bonus hugely increases the number of his supporters in the assembly. The Council and the President are linked by an alleged relationship of confidence: if the President resigns or he is dismissed by the Council, a snap election is called for both the legislative and the executive <b>offices,</b> <b>because</b> in no case the two bodies can be chosen separately.|$|R
50|$|The {{company had}} 475 {{employees}} {{working in the}} home office in 1964, when this building opened. In 1978, the company had 850 employees, with some working in nearby <b>offices</b> <b>because</b> the main building had been occupied to capacity. In 1978, Northwestern National Life announced {{plans to build a}} 20-story office tower across Marquette Avenue, which became 100 Washington Square. The building was designed to have two-thirds of its space available to rent to other tenants.|$|R
