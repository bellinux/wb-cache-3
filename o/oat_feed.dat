40|$|In a 1 -yr experiment, {{nutritional}} treatments {{were used}} to produce different combinations of BW and BCS in lambs. The experiment served to quantify the effects of BW and BCS on ADFI by sheep. Ewe lambs (n = 78) were assigned to treatment groups that had ad libitum access to one feed at a time. Three feeds were used: a medium-quality chopped hay (L), a pelleted feed based on <b>oat</b> <b>feed</b> (M), and a pelleted feed based on barley (H). Three groups received {{only one of these}} feeds throughout. Two groups first received H and then were switched to M when they reached a BW of 45 or 65 kg. Two groups first received L and then were switched to M or H after reaching a BW of 45 kg. Three groups first received H or M but were switched to L after reaching a BW of 45, 65, or 95 kg. Daily feed intake, BW, and BCS were recorded, and ME content of the feeds was estimated in a separate digestibility experiment. The lambs consuming M ate more (P < 0. 001) feed than lambs consuming H, but this had no significant effects on ME intake or gain in BW or BCS. Animals that had had access to L were lean for their BW when switched to H or M and showed compensatory intake and gain. Animals switched from M or H to L all lost BCS; BW change depended on the BW at the switch. The treatments produced different combinations of BW and BCS for animals with access to the same feed. The ADFI of a given feed varied systematically with BCS for animals of a given BW. The model ADFI = a x BW x [1 - (b x BCS) ] gave a reasonable description of the data in all treatments. A model using BW, BCS, and their interaction gave a slightly better fit but explained little more of the variation in ADFI than the simpler model. The implications of the collected data are that BW alone is an insufficient descriptor of the animal to correctly predict feed intake and that intake predictions can be improved by taking BCS into account...|$|E
40|$|Oat, a {{rich source}} of soluble fiber, was {{considered}} to have a possible preventive effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The present study aimed to assess this preventive activity in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy. Adult Wister rats were injected by streptozotocin (65 [*]mg/kg). Animals were fed with normal diet or with a diet containing 20 % oat (W/W) for 21 weeks. At the end of 21 weeks, all the kidney tissues were collected for various examinations. Our results suggested that oat could decrease the Scr and glucose level in blood of diabetic rats significantly (), and increase the creatinine clearance (). In histopathological examination, oat-fed rats showed a significant decrease in glomerulus segmented sclerosis and incidence of tubule vacuolar degeneration. By ELISA, we reported that <b>oat</b> <b>feeding</b> resulted in decreasing the levels of IL- 6 and AGE in serum and kidney homogenate. In addition, the levels of oxidative stress markers were markedly improved as a result of <b>oat</b> <b>feeding.</b> Furthermore, using EMSA, we showed that oat attenuated the activation of NF-B. Using RT-PCR, we found that oat could downregulate the TGF- 1 and RAGE expression at mRNA levels. This study suggests that oat can suppress diabetic nephropathy in rats effectively and may slow down the renal fibrosis by the disruption of the detrimental AGE-RAGE-NFB axis...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{we have discovered}} that hulling of oats considerable improves its digestibility in equine diets (Särkijärvi & Saastamoinen 2003). However, hulling methods are variable and may lead to various outcomes. The more intensive the hulling is, the better the end product, but also the higher {{is the level of}} costs. In order to evaluate the appropriate hulling intensity, we wanted to study the effect of oat hulls on the diet digestibility. Eight mature Finnhorse mares were used in a study where effects of oat hulls on the apparent digestibility of nutrients was studied. Diets were based on dry hay and four different <b>oat</b> <b>feeds</b> (71 : 29 on dry matter basis). <b>Oat</b> <b>feeds</b> were based on hulled oats where four different amounts of oat hulls were added. The oat hull additions were: 1) 0 % hulls, 2) 8 % hulls, 3) 16 % hulls and 4) 24 % hulls. The last treatment represented the hull content of regular oats. Both, hulled oats and oat hulls, were first ground separately to a fine meal and then pressed into pellets, in order to prevent feed selection by horses. Treatments were assigned in a duplicated 4 x 4 Williams square design. A preliminary feeding of 16 days was followed by 5 day collection in each period. Faecal samples were taken twice a day during the collection period. Chromium mordanted straw was a marker for the estimation of digestibility. The inclusion of oat hulls did not affect digestibilities of diet nutrients statistically significantly. The digestibilities of nitrogen free extract and crude protein were slightly higher at 0 % inclusion, and the digestibilities of crude fat and crude fibre were better for 16 and 24 % inclusion rates, but as mentioned, the differences were not statistically significant. Probably the fine milling of the grain material has improved the digestibility of fibre of the oat hulls so tremendously, that the impairing effect of fibre did not show in diet digestibilities.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (i) investigate the impact of <b>feeding</b> <b>oat</b> on the population of bifidobacteria and (ii) evaluate their probiotic potential. In this study, we investigated the effects of supplementing sows’ gestation and lactation feed with 15 % oat (prebiotic source) on the levels of probiotic population in milk. We found that dietary inclusion of oat during lactation and gestation resulted in increased levels of bifidobacteria compared to lactobacilli in sow milk. Furthermore bifidobacteria within the sow milk samples were further evaluated for probiotic potential based on aggregating properties, and acid- and bile-tolerance after exposure to hydrochloric acid (pH 2. 5) and bile salts (0 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 50 %, 1. 0 % and 2. 0 %). All isolates survived under the condition of low pH and bile 2. 0 %. Autoaggregation ability ranged from 17. 5 % to 73 %. These isolates also showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli O 157 :H 7. Together our results suggest that inclusion of <b>oat</b> in <b>feeding</b> systems could have the potential to improve the intestinal health of piglets by increasing the population of bifidobacteria...|$|R

25|$|The oat (Avena sativa), {{sometimes}} called the common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural, unlike other cereals and pseudocereals).

40|$|AbstractIn {{addition}} to their fermentable dietary fiber and the soluble β-glucan fiber, oats have unique avenanthramides that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that reduce coronary heart disease in human clinical trials. We hypothesized that oat consumption will increase insulin sensitivity, reduce body fat, and improve health span in Caenorhabditis elegans through a mechanism involving the daf- 2 gene, which codes for the insulin/insulin-like growth factor- 1 –like receptor, and that hyperglycemia will attenuate these changes. Caenorhabditis elegans wild type (N 2) and the null strains sir- 2. 1, daf- 16, and daf- 16 /daf- 2 were fed Escherichia coli (OP 50) and oat flakes (0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, or 3 %) with and without 2 % glucose. <b>Oat</b> <b>feeding</b> decreased intestinal fat deposition in N 2, daf- 16, or daf- 16 /daf- 2 strains (P <. 05); and glucose did not affect intestinal fat deposition response. The N 2, daf- 16, or sir- 2. 1 mutant increased the pharyngeal pumping rate (P <. 05), {{a surrogate marker of}} life span, following oat consumption. Oat consumption increased ckr- 1, gcy- 8, cpt- 1, and cpt- 2 mRNA expression in both the N 2 and the sir- 2. 1 mutant, with significantly higher expression in sir- 2. 1 than in N 2 (P <. 01). Additional glucose further increased expression 1. 5 -fold of the 4 genes in N 2 (P <. 01), decreased the expression of all except cpt- 1 in the daf- 16 mutant, and reduced mRNA expression of the 4 genes in the daf- 16 /daf- 2 mutant (P <. 01). These data suggest that oat consumption reduced fat storage and increased ckr- 1, gcy- 8, cpt- 1, or cpt- 2 through the sir- 2. 1 genetic pathway. Oat consumption may be a beneficial dietary intervention for reducing fat accumulation, augmenting health span, and improving hyperglycemia-impaired lipid metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Milling {{and feed}} grain quality {{improvement}} are cornerstones of the Crop Development Centre oat improvement program. Oat quality improvement focuses on food use, {{but the majority}} of world production is fed to ruminant livestock, thus feed quality improvement deserves consideration. This is especially true in western Canada where the feed market sets the base price for oat, and without assurance of an alternative feed market, growers cannot economically consider growing oat. While what makes a good food oat generally makes a good <b>feed</b> <b>oat,</b> specific <b>feed</b> value improvements can be made. Breeding to improve feed quality must consider physical and chemical traits, target livestock class and quality of competing grains. This generally means improving oat energy density for ruminants (especially cattle in Canada) versus that from barley, maize or wheat. Oat is considered the poorest grain because of high levels of indigestible fibre (hull) and low energy density. Improved physical quality, concentrating on increased groat/hull, is a major goal and has greatly improved the feed value of recent CDC varieties. Simultaneous selection for low % hull and greater uniformity, plumpness, bulk density (Test wt.) and size (MKW) resulted in varieties like CDC Dancer with significant genetic improvement in % groat and uniformity resulting in lower ADF, NDF, lignin and crude fibre and increased starch. Combining this improved physical quality with the LLH (low acid detergent hull) trait reported in 2000 (Thompson et al, 2000), where hull digestibility for ruminants is doubled, and increasing energy density by introducing greater groat fat (HOG), the LLH-HOG <b>feed</b> <b>oat</b> project to produce a whole grain oat for cattle with feed value of barley and approaching that of maize has been developed. Initial feed trial results demonstrate that LLH adds 6. 5 7. 5 % energy and HOG adds 2. 0 2. 5 % versus regular oat, with a total LLH-HOG energy of 84 84. 5 % TDN versus 82. 5 % for barley. On an economic basis this translates to LLH-HOG oat valued at $ 129 /tonne in western Canada versus barley at $ 103 and maize at $ 110. LLH-HOG selections, entered in the 2004 Western Canadian Co-operative Oat trials, should be considered for registration and release in 2006. Thompson, R. K., et al. 2000.

40|$|Oat {{is still}} the most used grain in horse nutrition, but the options of {{processing}} are extended. Extruded oat shows an alternative to feeding whole or flaked oats. Its advantage is better utilization, so it is possible to feed smaller amount of feed. Literary part of this writing contains general information about oats, horse nutrition and extrusion. In the oat part we focus on composition and utilization. Chapter horse nutrition is aimed on parts of digestive system, which is related to intake of feed. Chapter extrusion is mostly about the oportunity to use grain, extra attention is laid on trasformation of starch during extrusion. The last part is dedicated to suitability of <b>oat</b> as horse <b>feed</b> and on features of extruded oat and its utilization in horse nutrition. During experiment was made measurement of time needed to intake 500 g od whole or extruded oat in 5 mature warm-blood horses in JK Počin Dolní Počenice. Each form of feed was measured for 7 days. Time of intake of this amount od whole oat was 3 minutes and 18 seconds +- 8, 9 seconds.

30|$|The {{second part}} of the {{questionnaire}} delved into grazing site condition and yak feeding practices. To simplify information, we used a three-point Likert scale (Likert 1932) against the commonly used five-point scale, since reliability and validity of information was found to be independent of the scale points employed by Likert-type items (Jacoby and Miichael 1971). The scale was used to gather information on whether the informants agreed, disagreed or did not know about the changes in grazing site condition, extent of forage <b>oat</b> cultivation and <b>feeding</b> of commercial animal feeds to yak, before and after the legalization of Cordyceps collection. We requested information on migratory practices, mainly on the time of migration to summer and winter grazing lands. This part of the questionnaire captured information on the yak mortality rate and its main causes, before and after the legalization of Cordyceps collection. The third part of the questionnaire included questions aimed at identifying the major constraints to yak farming.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the nutritional value of oats and oat products in diets of weanling pigs. In Exp. 1, 115 weanling pigs (avg initial body wt of 12. 4 lb and avg age of 19 d) were used in a 38 -d growth assay. Treatments were 1) a corn-soybean meal-based control, 2) ground oats, 3) oat groats, and 4) oat flour. Phase I diets were formulated to 1. 55 % lysine, and at d 10 postweaning the pigs were switched to a Phase II diets formulated to 1. 3 % lysine. At d 24 postweaning, all pigs were changed to a sorghum-based Phase III diet. The diets were fed in pelleted form. For Phase I, pigs fed the oat products tended to have greater efficiencies of gain compared to pigs fed corn. Pigs fed the reduced fiber oat products (groats and flour) were more efficient than pigs fed ground whole oats, and the most refined oat product (oat flour) tended to support the greatest efficiencies of gain (8 % greater ADG and 13 % greater F/G than the corn control). These same trends for pigs fed oat flour were noted in Phase II and for the overall experiment (I. e., d 0 to 38). In Exp. 2, 172 weanling pigs (avg initial body wt of 12. 5 lb and avg age of 19 d) were used in a second 38 -d growth assay. Treatments were 1) a com-soybean meal-based control, 2) ground oats, 3) roasted oats, 4) oat groats, 5) steam-flaked oat groats, and 6) oat flour. The data indicated that roasting decreased the nutritional value of ground oats. However, steam-flaking improved the nutritional value of <b>oat</b> groats. <b>Feeding</b> diets formulated with processed oat products (i. e., steam-flaked oat groats and oat flour) improved F/G through Phase II (e. g., 6 % greater efficiency of gain compared to the corn-based control), but much of that advantage was lost during Phase III while the pigs were fed the same sorghum- based diet. In conclusion, the most refined oat products (steam-flaked oat groats and oat flour) supported better F/G than com in Phases I and II. However, cost must be continuously balanced against the improved performance to ensure that use of these oat products is economically viable...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of {{agricultural}} landuse change in the observed increase in extreme precipitation during the 20 th century. Landuse input was constructed for the Community Land Model in the WRF-ARW using county-level planting data from the USDA for two periods: the 1940 s and 2010. Crops were separated into small grains, winter wheat, soybean, and maize. When simulations are run using these two land datasets for the 1949 - 2010 period, the 2010 landuse has higher frequencies of extreme precipitation above 24 - 26 mm day- 1 or 1 in day- 1. This indicates that cropland shifts in the 20 th century when society shifted from large <b>oat</b> cultivation to <b>feed</b> work animals on traditional farms to soybean and maize following the industrial revolution have contributed to increases in extreme precipitation across the central U. S. Additionally, this study makes simple changes to convective parameterizations to allow grid-scale microphysics to have {{a larger role in}} producing precipitation with the goal of improving MCC production. Using an objective MCC detection algorithm that uses only the precipitation field, no scheme is presented as the best performer, although modifications we made performed on par with unmodified schemes. We also examined MCC production and trends in the Can-RCM 4, CRCM 5, HIRHAM, and RCA 4 models under the CORDEX framework.

40|$|The {{technological}} process of cereals production {{used in the}} production of feed stuff, which includes the following basic steps: grain moistening; binning of moistened grain for redistribution of moisture in the bulk of kernel; steaming of moistened grain; rolling of steamed grain; drying and cooling of flakes – is developed. In the production of flakes from scoured barley and <b>oat</b> grain before <b>feeding</b> to the rolling line film removal from the grain of these crops and the separation of the husks is carried out by one the existing methods: the method of grinding, followed by sifting and eventilation of films from tail fractions or a method of peeling on special machines with a separation of films. Wet-heat treatment of grain, followed by rolling helps to improve taste and palatability of feed, improves the nutritional value of carbohydrate and protein complexes, reduces the exertion of the body to digest food nutrients, allows to inactivate antinutritional substances and free the grain from the pathogenic and other microorganisms. In the duration of rolling process splitting of complex carbohydrates occurs, starch loses its original structure and is easier exposed to enzymes. The dried and cooled flakes have satisfactory flowability, do not set up. Humidity of flakes is not more than 14 %, the temperature is not more than 10  °C above the ambient temperature, bulk density is 350 – 400 kg/m 3. Developed set of equipment allows producing cereal flakes, the use of which in feed stuff and rations of young cattle and pigs increases the productivity of animals by 15 – 20 % while reducing feed costs by 12 – 15 %. Cereal flakes are used in the manufacture of complete feed for piglets (pigs at the age of 10 to 60 days), feed concentrates for pigs under the age of 4 months, the calves under the age of 115 days, high-producing cows, sporting and trained horses and lactating mares...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} some forage feeds of ruminants {{in terms}} of their carbohydrate (CHO) and protein fractions using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS). Materials and Methods: Eleven ruminant feeds (six green fodders - maize, oat, sorghum, bajra, cowpea, berseem and five range herbages - para grass, guinea grass, hedge lucerne, setaria grass and hybrid napier) were selected for this study. Each feed was chemically analyzed for proximate principles (dry matter, crude protein [CP], ether extract, organic matter and ash), fiber fractions (neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose), primary CHO fractions (CHO, non-structural CHO, structural CHO and starch) and primary protein fractions (neutral detergent insoluble CP, acid detergent insoluble CP, non-protein nitrogen and soluble protein). The results were fitted to the equations of CNCPS to arrive at various CHO (CA - fast degrading, CB 1 - intermediate degrading, CB 2 - slow degrading and CC - nondegrading or unavailable) and protein (PA - instantaneously degrading, PB 1 - fast degrading, PB 2 - intermediate degrading, PB 3 - slow degrading and PC - non-degrading or unavailable) fractions of test feeds. Results: Among green fodders, cowpea and berseem had higher CA content while except hedge lucerne all range herbages had lower CA values. CB 1 content of all feeds was low but similar. All feeds except cowpea, berseem, and hedge lucerne contained higher CB 2 values. Oat among green fodders and hybrid napier among range herbages had lower CC fraction. Feeds such as bajra, cowpea, berseem and the setaria grass contained lower PA fraction. All green fodders had higher PB 1 content except maize and cowpea while all range herbages had lower PB 1 values except hedge lucerne. Para grass and hybrid napier contained exceptionally low PB 2 fraction among all feeds. Low PC contents were reported in oat and berseem fodders. Conclusion: Based on our findings, it was concluded that feeds with similar CP and CHO content varied significantly with respect to their CHO and protein fractions. Due to lower CC fraction, oat and hybrid napier were superior feeds {{in terms of}} CHO supply to ruminants. Similarly, among all <b>feeds</b> <b>oat</b> and berseem had a lower PC fraction, thus were considered good sources of protein for ruminants...|$|R
