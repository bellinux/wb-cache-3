5000|$|In such cases, {{the burden}} of proof lies on the first of said parties (e.g. the government, parent, or doctor) to {{disprove}} undue influence on the second party. This requires the dominant party to establish that the second party [...] "knew and understood what he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing, and that he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> acting independently of the influence of the dominant party". One influential factor in deciding whether the second party was acting independently <b>is</b> whether he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> given an independent advice, while such an advice is not indispensable for rebutting the presumption.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} private Acts {{establishing}} religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions.

He <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> to be served {{with a copy of}} the detention order as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which the detention order was made.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} for review of {{detention}} is a remedy for establishing the legality of detention, {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful. Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not if he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> merely under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.|$|E

Specifically, members must be {{over the age of}} 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK. Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified. An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament if he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> judged to be insane {{under the terms of the}} Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even if he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the parties is presided over by the Speaker of the House. When the party with the most seats has {{less than half of the}} total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa. The current assembly is the first session of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, since the confederation of Canada in 1867.|$|E
5|$|Educational {{attainment}} varied greatly {{depending on}} occupational field with 68% {{of those in}} the professional and professional support fields having a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to only 31.6% of those employed in sales and 11.6% {{of those in the}} service sector. Considering the fact that the average American does not have a bachelor's degree, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> most likely employed in the service, sales, and office support fields with many working in the professional support and business fields as well. All together the American economy and labor force have changed greatly since the middle of the 20th. century with most workers today being employed in office and service occupations.|$|E

5|$|Every so often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} a point where he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E
5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select {{candidates}} who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Gulfton and Sharpstown were together in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, whether he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E
