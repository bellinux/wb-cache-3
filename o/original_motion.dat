40|$|Head motion occurs {{naturally}} and {{in synchrony}} with speech during human dialogue communication, and may carry paralinguistic information, such as intentions, attitudes and emotions. Therefore, natural-looking head motion by a robot {{is important for}} smooth human-robot interaction. Based on rules inferred from analyses {{of the relationship between}} head motion and dialogue acts, this paper proposes a model for generating head tilting and nodding, and evaluates the model using three types of humanoid robot (a very human-like android, “Geminoid F”, a typical humanoid robot with less facial degrees of freedom, “Robovie R 2 ”, and a robot with a 3 -axis rotatable neck and movable lips, “Telenoid R 2 ”). Analysis of subjective scores shows that the proposed model including head tilting and nodding can generate head motion with increased naturalness compared to nodding only or directly mapping people’s <b>original</b> <b>motions</b> without gaze information. We also find that an upwards motion of a robot’s face can be used by robots which do not have a mouth in order to provide the appearance that utterance is taking place. Finally, we conduct an experiment in which participants act as visitors to an information desk attended by robots. As a consequence, we verify that our generation model performs equally to directly mapping people’s <b>original</b> <b>motions</b> with gaze information in terms of perceived naturalness...|$|R
