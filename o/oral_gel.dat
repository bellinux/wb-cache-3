50|$|Treatment of mucositis {{is mainly}} supportive. Oral hygiene is the {{mainstay}} of treatment; patients are encouraged to clean their mouth every four hours and at bedtime, more often if the mucositis becomes worse. Water-soluble jellies {{can be used to}} lubricate the mouth. Salt mouthwash can soothe the pain and keep food particles clear so as to avoid infection. Patients are also encouraged to drink plenty of liquids, at least three liters a day, and avoid alcohol. Citrus fruits, alcohol, and foods that are hot are all known to aggravate mucositis lesions. Medicinal mouthwashes may be used such as Chlorhexidine gluconate and viscous Lidocaine for relief of pain. Palifermin is a human KGF (keratinocyte growth factor) that has shown to enhance epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Experimental therapies have been reported, including the use of cytokines and other modifiers of inflammation (e.g., IL-1, IL-11, TGF-beta3), amino acid supplementation (e.g., glutamine), vitamins, colony-stimulating factors, cryotherapy, and laser therapy. Symptomatic relief of the pain of oral mucositis may be provided by barrier protection agents such as concentrated <b>oral</b> <b>gel</b> products (e.g. Gelclair). Caphosol is a mouth rinse which has been shown to prevent and treat oral mucositis caused by radiation and high-dose chemotherapy. MuGard is a FDA-cleared mucoadhesive oral protectant, developed by Access Pharmaceuticals, Inc., that is designed to form a protective hydrogel coating over the oral mucosa while a patient is undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy cancer treatments to the head and neck. Additionally, the efficacy of MuGard for the prevention or treatment of mucositis has been tested by a prospective, randomized clinical trial in which 43% of head and neck cancer patients using MuGard prophylactically never got oral mucositis.NeutraSal is an FDA-cleared calcium phosphate mouth rinse which has been shown in an open-label, observational registry trial to prevent and reduce the severity of oral mucositis caused by radiation and high-dose chemotherapy. In the trial, 56% of the radiotherapy patients reported 0 (WHO score) or no mucositis, which is significantly lower than historical rates.

Materials and Methods: Diabetes in rats was induced by an intra-muscular administration of protamine sulfate for 10 days. As ADM there were used lysozyme, quercetin, flour, mucosin and flour from vine leaves, which were applied in form of <b>gels</b> on the <b>oral</b> mucosa of rats for 2 weeks. In the gums' homogenates there were determined the activities of urease, lysozyme, elastase, catalase and the MDA content. The degree of dysbiosis by Levitsky was calculated as the ratio of the relative activities of urease and lysozyme. The antioxidant-prooxidant index API was calculated as the ratio of the catalase activity and the MDA content. Results: The urease activity, the degree of dysbiosis, the elastase activity and the MDA content were increased while the lysozyme activity and the index API were reduced in rats with diabetes type 2 in the periodont. Applied gels containing ADM showed therapeutic and preventive effects. Conclusion: At diabetes type 2 in the periodont of rats there were developing dysbiosis and inflammation.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{people suffer}} from dry mouth (xerostomia) due to {{radiotherapy}} treatment of {{head and neck}} cancer, diseases like Sjogren’s syndrome or as adverse effects to prescribed medications. Salivary substitute products like gels or sprays are often used for treatment. Efficacy of those oral care products are regularly assessed by validated or even not validated questionnaires. To determine the adhesion effect over time more objectively a new and sensitive method was established. The following {{study was designed to}} assess the dwell time of different oral care products in vitro. Method Two different types of surfaces were covered with oral care products and washed using a definite protocol with artificial saliva salt solution. First, <b>oral</b> care <b>gels</b> or <b>oral</b> care sprays were spread to a polystyrene surface of 2. 25  cm 2, then onto cell based three-dimensional gingiva models. The surfaces were washed ten times with artificial saliva salt solution. The resulting washing solutions were examined using mid infrared spectroscopy in order to detect ingredients of the oral care products. Results All assessed <b>oral</b> care <b>gels</b> or <b>oral</b> care sprays and their components were detected very sensitive. Even traces of the products were detected in the eluent and thus enabled to differentiate the dwell times of the different products. In general, the dwell time of <b>oral</b> care <b>gels</b> on polystyrene or gingiva models was longer than that of oral care sprays. The use of gingiva models improved the differentiation between different products. Conclusions MIR spectroscopy {{turned out to be a}} sensitive method to detect salivary substitutes. Differences between single components and different products can be detected. The described method is a simple, reliable and easy process to evaluate the dwell time of oral care products in vitro and thus a useful tool to design optimised salivary substitute products.

Results: It was established lowering of levels of elastase and MDA, but raise of lysozyme by adrenalin action. The introduction of adrenalin background dysbiosis was raised elastase and urease activities. The oral application of quertulin normalized the levels of elastase, MDA, urease, lysozyme, but raised the activity of catalase. Conclusion: The oral applications of adrenalin has gastroprotective action at the expense of the activity of lysozyme and catalase rise. The oral applications of quertulin make gastroprotective action at introduction of adrenalin background dysbiosis at the expense rise level of antioxidant system and lowering the dysbiosis degree.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{incidence}} and severity of radiation-induced oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancers, an <b>oral</b> <b>gel</b> product was added to the mouth care regimen in a regional northern Australian facility. An audit of the medical records of 20 patients who underwent radiation therapy was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of this more comprehensive mouth care regimen. All patients in this sample developed oral mucositis by the end of their radiation treatment: 21 % had a low grade, 79 % progressed to the higher Grade III. All patients who did not adhere with the full mouth care regimen experienced a Grade III oral mucositis; only half of the patients who adhered with the full mouth care regimen experienced the more severe Grade III mucositis. It is imperative that nurses actively support patients to follow the prescribed mouth care regimens to minimise oral complications associated with radiation therapy...|$|E

Materials and methods: We used a mucous-adhesive phytogel containing cardioarginin (14 % on a 4 % CMC). Intestinal dysbiosis was obtained using lincomycin (60 mg/kg). HFD was prepared by addition of palm oil to the feed (final fat content in the diet 25 %). Dysbiosis was calculated according to the levels of urease and lysozyme, inflammation was expressed in terms of inflammatory markers (MDA and elastase). In the gums there were determined the content of hyaluronic acid and the degree of atrophy of periodontal by Nikolaeva. Gel applications were performed at the dose 0. 3 ml / rat daily. Results: Intestinal dysbiosis on the HFD background causes in the development of periodontal dysbiosis, inflammation and tissue recession. Oral gels containing arginine have parodont-protective action. Key words: periodontal, dysbiosis, fatty food, inflammation, arginine, oral gels.

40|$|Abstract Background Oral {{lichen planus}} (OLP) {{decreases}} {{the quality of}} life because it can cause spontaneous pain during eating and tooth-brushing and an uncomfortable feeling in the mouth. In addition, OLP may be associated with HCV-related liver disease. We investigated the visual analogue scale (VAS) and effects of <b>oral</b> care <b>gel,</b> REFRECARE-H ®, on patients with OLP associated with HCV infection. Results Nine OLP patients (mean age 67. 9 ± 7. 6 years) with HCV-related liver diseases were recruited and their VAS score determined along with a biochemical examination of the blood. Types of OLP included erosive (6 patients) and reticular (3). REFRECARE-H ®, an <b>oral</b> care <b>gel</b> (therapeutic dentifrice) containing hinokitiol, was applied by each patient as a thin layer on the oral membrane, after each meal and at bedtime for 30 days. Application of REFRECARE-H ® improved {{the quality of life}} in all terms of dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness, oral pain during rest, oral pain at a mealtimes, taste disorder, loss of appetite, sleep disorder, depressive mood and jitteriness. VAS scores of dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness, and sleep disorder were significantly increased 30 days after application of REFRECARE-H ® (P = 0. 01, P = 0. 05, P = 0. 03, P = 0. 04). VAS scores of oral pain at a mealtimes and taste disorder were increased 30 days after application of REFRECARE-H ® (P = 0. 06). There was an absence of side effects. Conclusions REFRECARE-H ® improved the quality of life for OLP. It is necessary for the hepatologist to educate patients regarding oral hygiene, as well as provide treatment of liver disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Background: Tenofovir is {{a potent}} anti-HIV agent with {{efficacy}} in studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis when taken orally or used as an intravaginal gel. Recent studies suggest that tenofovir also {{reduces the risk of}} HSV- 2 acquisition. Whether <b>oral</b> or <b>gel</b> tenofovir may be useful in HSV disease management, or prevention of HSV- 2 transmission, is unclear. Methods: We randomized immunocompetent women with symptomatic HSV- 2 infection 2 : 2 : 1 to <b>oral</b> tenofovir/placebo vaginal <b>gel,</b> <b>oral</b> placebo/tenofovir vaginal <b>gel,</b> or double placebo in a one-way cross-over clinical trial. Women collected twice daily genital swabs for HSV PCR and completed symptom diaries during a 4 -week lead-in and 5 weeks of treatment. We compared of shedding rates and genital lesions with Poisson mixed models and shedding quantity with linear mixed models. Results: 73 women were enrolled and 64 completed the lead-in observation phase and were randomized: 24 women to oral tenofovir, 27 to tenofovir vaginal gel, and 13 to placebo. Relative to baseline, genital HSV shedding showed a trend toward a small decrease from 22. 9 % to 19. 5 %, (RR= 0. 86 p= 0. 09), in the oral tenofovir arm, but did not differ in the tenofovir vaginal gel arm (13. 8 % versus 12. 0 %; RR= 0. 94, p= 0. 54) or in the placebo arm (21. 3 % versus 20. 4 %; RR= 0. 90, p= 0. 45; Table 1). Asymptomatic shedding decreased in the oral tenofovir arm only (RR= 0. 74, p= 0. 01). There was no change in days with HSV lesions or number of shedding episodes. Shedding quantity decreased by 0. 50 log 10 copies in the vaginal gel arm (p= 0. 008), but remained consistent in the oral tenofovir (p= 0. 18) and placebo arms (p= 0. 45). The per-protocol analysis included 20 women in the oral tenofovir arm, 20 in the vaginal gel arm, and 9 in the placebo arm who completed ≥ 33 days of study product with ≥ 90 % adherence. Relative to baseline, the shedding frequency was reduced in the oral tenofovir arm (RR= 0. 74, p= 0. 006), and shedding quantity was reduced in the oral (0. 41 log) and gel tenofovir arms (0. 6 log); otherwise the results were {{similar to that of the}} full cohort. The <b>gel</b> and <b>oral</b> tenofovir were both well tolerated, and overall adherence was high (97 %) and equivalent in all arms. Discussion: When used as directed, oral tenofovir causes small decreases in shedding and lesion rate, and quantity of virus shed. Vaginal tenofovir decreases shedding quantity minimally. In contrast to evidence that tenofovir reduces HSV acquisition by half, similar benefits in treatment of established HSV- 2 infection were not seen...|$|R
