5|$|The {{population}} growth rate was higher {{during the decade}} of 1981–90 due to increased provision of social, economic and recreational facilities that caused the rural population to migrate to urban areas. The overall growth rate had declined <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> due to poor returns in agriculture and increased migration of agricultural labourers to other urban centres. The population density of the town is high in the centre and low in the peripheral regions.|$|E

25|$|Although {{few studies}} on water quality {{have been carried}} out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> and there is a crucial lack of {{adequate}} and consistent monitoring, scattered evidence suggests that the levels of nutrients, organic matter, and bacteriological contamination in water are high. For example, the proportion of samples with coliforms in aqueducts served by INAPA (the main water company, supplying 40 percent of the population) increased from 17 percent in 1994 to 23 percent in 1998. This is particularly striking because according to DR standards, presence of coliforms in more than 5 percent of samples indicates that water is no longer potable.|$|E

Ettinger's art was recently analysed at length in the book Women Artists at the Millennium, in Griselda Pollock's Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum and in Catherine de Zegher's anthology Women's Work is Never Done. Her ideas in cultural theory, psychoanalysis, and French feminism (see Feminist theory and psychoanalysis) achieved recognition after the publication of Matrix and Metramorphosis (1992), fragments from her notebooks (Moma, Oxford, 1993) and The Matrixial Gaze (1995). <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> her work has been influential in art history, film studies (including feminist film theory), psychoanalysis, aesthetics and gender studies.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2000, Iran ranks 58 in {{healthcare}} and 93 in health-system performance. In 2016, Bloomberg News ranked Iran 30th most efficient healthcare system ahead of United States and Brazil.

The {{health status of}} Iranians has improved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> Iran {{has been able to}} extend public health preventive services through the establishment of an extensive Primary Health Care Network. As a result, child and maternal mortality rates have fallen significantly, and life expectancy at birth has risen remarkably. Infant (IMR) and under-five (U5MR) mortality have decreased to 28.6 and 35.6 per 1,000 live births respectively in 2000, compared to an IMR of 122 per 1,000 and a U5MR of 191 per 1,000 in 1970.

25|$|Leading {{constitutional}} law scholar Erwin Chemerinsky {{participated in the}} same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and—from a First Amendment perspective—highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, {{that it could be}} seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that Morse v. Frederick is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.|$|E
