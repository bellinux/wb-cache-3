In the Iberian Peninsula, the goose barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes is the intertidal biological resource most heavily exploited by man, resulting on overexploitation of stocks. In the MPA of BNR P. pollicipes harvesting is however strictly regulated, making it a good example of marine resources management. Analytical methods able to identify the origin of goose barnacle would be an important tool to help the management of the trade. For such purpose, we investigated whether P. pollicipes have site-specific differences based on its elemental microchemistry (EM), fatty acid profile (FA) and capitulum shape (CS). The analysis was performed on specimens collected from 3 sites in the BNR and 7 along a 300 km stretch of the Portuguese coast. For each individual we analysed the largest lateral shell for EM using ICP-MS, the FA content of the muscle using GC-FID, and the CS using geometric morphometrics. Discriminant function analyses (DFA) for both EM and FA separately provided a high reclassification success (77. 6 % and 99 % respectively, of cross-validated cases correctly classified), while for EM combined with FA allowed for a 100 % reclassification success. DFA analysis based only on CS, revealed a low classification success (29. 6 %). These results show that EM and FA signatures can be a powerful tool to infer goose barnacles origin. Such “fingerprinting” approach can be used to track and identify goose barnacles origin, helping in establishing an <b>origin</b> <b>certificate</b> and increasing the potential value of biological resources from Portuguese MPAs...|$|E

The aim of this research is to examine one type of innovation, the use of PDO products as ingredients, as a part of a strategy to re-launch PDO products which have a mature market. The evolution of the concept of innovation is discussed; innovation is then considered in relation to product life cycle and information asymmetry. There is then a case study on the use of PDO Parmigiano Reggiano cheese as an ingredient in industrial processing. This case shows that even incremental innovation can have serious effects for the market when it is applied on production phases which lie outside the direct control of the PDO producers. In order to protect the consumer as well as the PDO producer, it would be advisable for new legislation to regulate in more detail innovation involving products bearing <b>origin</b> <b>certificates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Client {{authentication}} {{on the web}} {{has remained}} in the internet-equivalent of the stone ages {{for the last two}} decades. Instead of adopting modern public-key-based authentication mechanisms, we seem to be stuck with traditional methods like passwords and cookies. These authentication methods are vulnerable {{to a wide range of}} attacks from simple password reuse to strong man-in-the-middle attackers that can inject themselves into the middle of encrypted communication channels. While many potential solutions have been proposed to sole the issues with the use of passwords and cookies for web authentication, most have failed to take hold. This lack of adoption stems from two issues. First, traditional password based authentication provides a very simple user experience. Any new technique must not increase user friction during login and provide a reasonable user experience. Secondly, a new authentication technique must not be difficult to implement in existing browsers and web applications or deploy to users. This thesis presents three techniques that provide protection against strong attackers while providing a low friction user experience. The first, <b>Origin</b> Bound <b>Certificates,</b> is a session hardening technique that cryptographically binds the user's authentication cookie to the TLS channel the cookie is presented over. This technique protects a user's session against strong attackers, requires no additional user interaction, requires little (or no) modification to existing web applications, and is compatible with existing data center infrastructure like TLS terminators. The second, Opportunistic Cryptographic Identity Assertions, is a technique in which the web browsers communicates with a user's cell phone in order to establish it as an opportunistic second factor in the initial login operation. This technique provides security assurances comparable or greater than conventional two factor authentication (i. e. phishing and password reuse prevention) while offering a simple user experience. Finally, I discuss a new federated login system that makes use of a new browser provided construct called the PostKey API. This interface allows the browser to create a cross certification that asserts ownership of client side keys to a trusted third party. The these cross certifications can be verified by an identity provider and used to harden existing federated login protocols as well as to create a new federation protocol that is resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks and leaked authentication tokens and provides relying parties with the means the better secure communication with the user...|$|R
40|$|Olive oil is a {{fundamental}} component of the Mediterranean area diet and it is widely used as a condiment, cooking medium, emulsion component and in the storage of vegetable and animal food [1]. Olive oil cultivation originated in Asia Minor and has spread to Greece, Italy, Spain and North Africa. Recently it was also extended in other countries with temperate climate like France. In contrast to other vegetables oils, {{extra virgin olive oil}} (EVOO), produced by modern milling technologies, can be directly consumed without any further manipulation. Once a year, the International Olive Council (IOC) updates statistics on production, imports, exports and consumption of olive oil. The statistics of 2013 shows that EU is the responsible for 71. 9 % of world production of olive oil and Spain produces the 59. 1 % of Europe’s olive oil. Many areas where high-quality olive oils are produced are located in Spain. The characteristics of these oils are determined by a series of factors: the nature of the soil, the climate variety of the plant, cultivation and oil extraction techniques [2]. The Food Quality Certification are products that are protected by a European Union legislation ensuring compliance of higher requirements than those required for other products. Protected Designations of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) and others are official EU classifications, and a system used in Spain for the recognition of distinct quality [3]. Only some works have been conducted on the identification of markers for the origin of oils by analytical methods [4 – 6]. Metabolomics (or more precisely metabolic fingerprinting) is a feasible approach for the discovering of those markers. In the Universidad Jaime I (UJI) some metabolomics projects have been carried out in the field of Food Authenticity. Very recently an article was published in Food Chemistry where some biomarkers were identified for correct authentication of Spanish (Valencian) oranges. In this project, 91 Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) samples from different regions of Spain with Protected Designation <b>Origin</b> (PDO) <b>certificate</b> have been analyzed using multivariate analysis from the data obtained by UHPLC-QTOF MS with the objective to discover useful biomarkers for origin differentiation. QTOF MS has been used under MSE mode, i. e. simultaneous acquisition at low (LE) and high collision energy (HE), which provides useful information on the molecular mass (commonly at LE) and on the main fragments ions (commonly at HE). The non-lipidic (unsaponifiable) and lipidic (saponifiable) portion of the oil (see in Figure 1 the olive oil composition) were analyzed separately because of the difference in polarity, that means, two separation methods were performed in UHPLC under reversed phase conditions but using different mobile phases. Furthermore, the samples were analyzed in both positive and negative electrospray ionization mode in the QTOF MS. This work only deals on the analysis of lipidic portion of the EVOO, composed mainly by triglycerides (a triglyceride is an ester derived from glycerol and three fatty acids). A freeware R-package has been used to extract and integrate peaks from the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC), and to al techniques have been employed to classify samples according to their origin significant biomarkers have been highlighted in order different Spanish Regions...|$|R
