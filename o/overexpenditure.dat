40|$|In this study, {{the costs}} and cost savings {{associated}} with departmentwide implementation of a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) {{as compared to the}} projected budget at the time of inception were evaluated. An average of $ 214, 460 was saved each year with a total savings of $ 1, 072, 300 from 1999 to 2003, which is significantly less than the $ 2, 943, 750 projected savings. This discrepancy can be attributed to four different factors: (1) <b>overexpenditures,</b> (2) insufficient cost savings, (3) unanticipated costs, and (4) project management issues. Although the implementation of PACS leads to cost savings, actual savings will be much lower than expected unless extraordinary care is taken when devising the budget...|$|R
40|$|In {{economic}} practice, {{decisions are}} frequently taken {{to reduce the}} time required to produce a given effect even though this entails a certain increase in expenditures. In such cases, the apparent material advantage must be abandoned in favor of the gain in time. On the other hand, {{it is clear that the}} ahead-of -schedule fulfillment of production and construction targets, without regard to expenditures, is inexpedient. In a word, economic practice very frequently confronts us with the necessity of choosing between a time gain and material <b>overexpenditures.</b> The same practice also shapes certain - sometimes intuitive - conceptions as to the circumstances and dimensions in which an additional expenditure can be justified by reducing the time required for the realization of a given economic measure. One might ask: is there a scientific basis for making an objective comparison of the time gain with the expenditure of resources (or of material savings against time losses) ? In other words, is it possible to compare time in any sense with material and labor inputs?...|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, Timothy Tong {{was found}} have overspent on {{entertaining}} and gifts for mainland and other overseas officials during his 5-year tenure as Commissioner. An independent committee {{found that he}} had authorised entertaining expenses at banquets that exceeded internal guidelines. There {{was an example of}} an airline upgrade for two officers to business class costing HK186,000 that had no record of approval, and one gift costing HK$4140 ($530) that had been reportedly offered to a senior mainland official. Tong was criticised by a Legislative Council committee for his 35 work trips which cost taxpayers almost HK$4 million ($513,000) and gifts to both mainland and overseas officials costing HK$282,000 ($36,100). The LegCo committee expressed its concern as to [...] "whether Mr Tong had thoroughly considered that unduly close contacts between him and mainland officials in Hong Kong during his tenure might have shaken public confidence in the impartiality of the ICAC". Tong had recently been appointed delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference when the scandal broke. Chief Secretary Carrie Lam admitted that the controversy surrounding the <b>overexpenditures</b> [...] "inevitably undermined the ICAC's image and Hong Kong's reputation as a corruption-free society." ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{warnings}} of a budget overspend came on 25 September 1987, when the over-expenditure {{was estimated at}} NOK 3,8 billion. On 20 November most {{of the board of}} directors had to resign. The board was led by chairman Inge Johansen and deputy chairman Vidkunn Hveding since 1984. The other board members who also resigned were Thor Andreassen (member since 1978), Fredrik Thoresen (member since 1984), Guttorm Hansen (member since 1986) and Toril V. Lundestad (member since 1986). The only board members not to resign were the three employee representatives. Two days later chief executive officer Arve Johnsen also resigned, at the time the only CEO in the history of the company to resign. In January 1988 reports of a possibility of the <b>overexpenditure</b> accumulating another billion NOK were presented. By April the anticipated overspend was believed to be in the order of NOK 8 billion, although the final sum came to NOK 6 billion.|$|E

40|$|Background and objectives: {{alcohol use}} {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} a greater incidence of certain comorbidities in patients with celiac disease. Currently there is no available information about the impact that these disorders may have on length of hospital stays, <b>overexpenditures</b> during hospital stays, and excess mortality in these patients. Methods: a case-control study was conducted with a selection of patients 18 years and older hospitalized during 2008 - 2010 in 87 hospitals in Spain. Estimations of excess length of stays, costs, and attributable mortality were calculated using a multivariate analysis of covariance, which included age, gender, hospital group, alcohol use disorders, tobacco related disease and 30 other comorbidities. Results: patients who had both celiac disease and alcohol use disorders had an increased length of hospital stay, an average of 3. 1 days longer in women, and 1. 7 days longer in men. Excess costs per stay ranged from 838. 7 euros in female patients, to 389. 1 euros in male patients. Excess attributable mortality was 15. 1 % in women, 12. 2 % in men. Conclusions: apart from a gluten-free diet and other medical measures, the prevention of alcohol abuse is indicated in these patients. Patients hospitalized who present these disorders should receive specialized attention after leaving the hospital. Early detection and treatment should be used to prevent the appearance of organic lesions and should not be solely focused on male patients...|$|R

40|$|Unified {{schedule}} for multiple parallel solid-phase synthesis of so-called “difficult” peptides on polypropylene pins was developed. Increase in {{the efficiency of}} 9 -fluorenyl(methoxycarbonyl) N-terminal amino-protecting group removal was shown {{to have a greater}} influence on the accuracy of the “difficult” peptide synthesis than the use of more efficient amino acid coupling reagents such as aminium salts.

40|$|For {{many years}} {{there has been}} {{increasing}} emphasis on economic evaluation of health care interventions (Elixhauser et al., 1993). Delivery of equitable health care in a cost-effective environment requires assessment of the economic implications of different interventions (Kumar et al., 2006). With limited resources in the health sector (personnel, time, facilities, equipment, and expertise); failure to apply the principles of cost-effectiveness may bring an ‘ opportunity cost ’, manifested as unsustainable nancial <b>overexpenditure,</b> or reduced services in other areas of health care (Drummond et al., 2005; Tickle, 1997). In future, economic evaluations are expected to assume increasing importance in the delivery of publicly funded orthodontic services: When allocating resources, health service planners will require evidence not only of the clinical effectiveness of treatment but also data disclosing ‘ value for money ’ (Buck, 2000). Economic evaluation is de ned as ‘ the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of their costs and consequences ’ (Drummond et al., 2005). Depending on {{the way in which the}} consequences are analyzed, four types of evaluations can be used to gather evidence and compare the expected costs and consequences of different procedures. A ‘ cost-effectiveness analysis ’ is characterized by analysis of both costs and outcomes, where the outcomes of alternative methods might differ in Early c orrection of p osterior c rossbite ಧ a c ost- m inimization analysi...|$|E
