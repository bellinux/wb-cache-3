40|$|This {{document}} {{is available to}} the public through the National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161 This {{document is}} disseminated under the sponsorship of the Department of Transportation in the interest of information exchange. The United Thunderstorm activity and associated low-altitude wind shear constitute a significant safety hazard to aviation, particular during operations near airport terminals where aircraft altitude is low and flight routes are constrained. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has procured several dedicated meteorological sensors (Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR), Network Expansion Low Level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS)) at major airports to enhance the safety and efficiency ofoperations during convective weather. A hardware and software modification to existing Airport Surveillance Radars (ASR- 9) -the Weather Systems Processor (WSP) -will provide similar capabilities at much lower cost, thus allowing the FAA to extend its protection envelope to medium density airports and airports where thunderstorm activity is less frequent. Following successful <b>operational</b> <b>demonstrations</b> of a prototype ASR-WSP, the FAA has procured approximately 35 WSPs for nationwide deployment. Lincol...|$|R

Altimeter data {{have been used}} to produce maps of sea surface height, geostrophic velocity, significant wave height, and wind speed. This information is of proven use to mariners {{as well as to the}} scientific community. Uses of the data include commercial and recreational vessel routing, ocean acoustics, input to geographic information systems developed for the fishing industry, identification of marine mammal habitats, fisheries management, and monitoring ocean debris.

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) {{system was}} {{primarily}} {{designed to address}} the operational needs of pilots in the avoidance of low-altitude wind shears upon takeoff and landing at airports. One of the primary methods of wind-shear detection for the TDWR system is the gust-front detection algorithm. The algorithm is designed to detect gust fronts that produce a wind-shear hazard and/or sustained wind shifts. It serves the hazard warning function by providing {{an estimate of the}} wind-speed gain for aircraft penetrating the gust front. The gust-front detection and wind-shift algorithms together serve a planning function by providing forecasted gust-front locations and estimates of the horizontal wind vector behind the front, respectively. This information is used by air traffic managers to determine arrival and departure runway configurations and aircraft movements to minimize the impact of wind shifts on airport capacity. This paper describes the gust-front detection and wind-shift algorithms to be fielded in the initial TDWR systems. Results of a quantitative performance evaluation using Doppler radar data collected during TDWR <b>operational</b> <b>demonstrations</b> at the Denver, Kansas City, and Orlando airports are presented.
