50|$|The {{ownership}} of the airport has been remarkably steady since the buy-out, a testimony to how well the original ownership structure was conceived and assembled.

The ownership structure of the airport is unique in that most of the hangars are owned with full freehold title. Some of the tenants elected not to buy their hangars and so these are owned by the Airport Holding company and are leased to tenants, which provides essential long term income for the airport and additional revenue to maintain and improve the facilities.|$|R
