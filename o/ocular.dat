5|$|<b>Ocular</b> (retinopathic conditions), characterised by {{alterations}} to the eyes, occurring when breathing increased {{pressures of}} oxygen for extended periods.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ocular</b> hypertelorism: Wideset eyes, {{which lead}} to a similar facial {{resemblance}} between patients. Facial abnormalities are the second highest occurring symptom after the lentigines. Abnormalities also include: broad nasal root, prognathism (protruding lower jaw), or low-set, possibly rotated, ears.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{around the}} eye are called circumorbital scales and are named as <b>ocular</b> scales but with {{appropriate}} prefixes. The <b>ocular</b> scale proper is a transparent scale covering the eye {{which is called}} the spectacle, brille or eyecap. The circumorbital scales towards the snout or the front are called preocular scales, those towards the rear are called postocular scales, and those towards the upper or dorsal side are called supraocular scales. Circumorbital scales towards the ventral or lower side, if any, are called subocular scales. Between the preocular and the postnasal scales are one or two scales called loreal scales. Loreal scales are absent in elapids.|$|E
5|$|Two coat color genes {{found in}} Morgans {{have also been}} linked to genetic disorders. One is the genetic <b>ocular</b> {{syndrome}} multiple congenital <b>ocular</b> anomalies (MCOA), originally called equine anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). MCOA {{is characterized by the}} abnormal development of some <b>ocular</b> tissues, which causes compromised vision, although generally of a mild form; the disease is non-progressive. Genetic studies have shown that it is closely tied to the silver dapple gene. A small number of Morgans carry the silver dapple allele, which causes cysts but no apparent vision problems if heterozygous, but when homozygous can cause vision problems. There is also the possibility of lethal white syndrome, a fatal disease seen in foals who are homozygous for the frame overo gene. At present, there is one mare line in the Morgan breed that has produced healthy heterozygous frame overo individuals. The American Morgan Horse Association advocates genetic testing to identify carriers of these genetics, and advises owners to avoid breeding horses that are heterozygous for frame overo to each other.|$|E
5|$|Built of limestone, {{in classic}} Palladian style, the {{southern}} façade {{takes the form}} of a temple-like central bay with symmetrical wings connecting to two flanking, terminating pavilions. The central bay is given eminence by a broken pediment supported by austere Doric pillasters. It in turn is flanked by two small bays, each with a small pointed pediment supported by shallow pilasters, which further emphasise and complement the central broken pediment sitting above a large Palladian window– the focal point of the building. On this southern side the structure comprises a principal floor at street level, with a low mezzanine separated by stone banding above. Beneath the principal floor is a sub-floor constructed in the masonry between the spans of the bridge, its presence indicated by <b>ocular</b> windows placed symmetrically beneath the span of each arch. This <b>ocular</b> motif, on a reduced scale, is repeated symmetrically at mezzanine level beneath the central broken pediment. The two terminating pavilions, in reality slight projections, have shallow saucer domes concealed behind their pointed pediments. The roof is pitched and of Welsh slate.|$|E
5|$|Millipede eyes {{consist of}} several simple flat-lensed ocelli {{arranged}} in a group or patch {{on each side of}} the head. These patches are also called <b>ocular</b> fields or ocellaria. Many species of millipedes, including the entire order Polydesmida and cave-dwelling millipedes such as Causeyella and Trichopetalum, had ancestors that could see but have subsequently lost their eyes and are blind.|$|E
5|$|Protocols for {{avoidance}} {{of the effects}} of hyperoxia exist in fields where oxygen is breathed at higher-than-normal partial pressures, including underwater diving using compressed breathing gases, hyperbaric medicine, neonatal care and human spaceflight. These protocols have resulted in the increasing rarity of seizures due to oxygen toxicity, with pulmonary and <b>ocular</b> damage being mainly confined to the problems of managing premature infants.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of all of}} these hallmarks is not needed for a diagnosis. A clinical diagnosis is considered made when, with lentigines present there are 2 other symptoms observed, such as ECG abnormalities and <b>ocular</b> hypertelorism, or without lentigines, 3 of the above conditions are present, with a first-degree relative (i.e. parent, child, sibling) with a clinical diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|In an {{epidemiologic}} study, 56 {{percent of}} patients with Behçet's disease developed <b>ocular</b> involvement at {{a mean age of}} 30. <b>Ocular</b> involvement was the first manifestation of Behçet's disease in 8.6 {{percent of patients}}. <b>Ocular</b> Behçet's disease with involvement of the optic nerve is rarely reported. Among patients with <b>ocular</b> Behçet's disease funduscopic findings of optic atrophy, and optic disc paleness have been identified with a frequency of 17.9 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Other fundoscopic findings include vascular sheathing (23.7%), retinal hemorrhage (9%), macular edema (11.3%), branch retinal vein occlusion (5.8%), and retinal edema (6.6%). However, optic atrophy was the most significant cause of visual impairment identified in 54 percent of patients with <b>ocular</b> Behçet's disease and permanent visual impairment.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the several}} causes for glaucoma, <b>ocular</b> {{hypertension}} (increased pressure within the eye) {{is the most}} important risk factor in most glaucomas, but in some populations, only 50% of people with primary open-angle glaucoma actually have elevated <b>ocular</b> pressure.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological {{studies suggest}} an {{association}} between <b>ocular</b> cortical cataracts and UVB exposure, using crude approximations of exposure and various cataract assessment techniques. A detailed assessment of <b>ocular</b> exposure to UVB {{was carried out in}} a study on Chesapeake Bay Watermen, where increases in average annual <b>ocular</b> exposure were associated with increasing risk of cortical opacity. In this highly exposed group of predominantly white males, the evidence linking cortical opacities to sunlight exposure was the strongest to date. Based on these results, ozone depletion is predicted to cause hundreds of thousands of additional cataracts by 2050.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ocular</b> {{oncology}} is {{the branch}} of medicine dealing with tumors relating to the eye and its adnexa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ocular</b> {{oncology}} {{takes into}} consideration {{that the primary}} requirement for patients is preservation of life by removal of the tumor, along with best efforts directed at preservation of useful vision, followed by cosmetic appearance. The treatment of <b>ocular</b> tumors is generally a multi-specialty effort, requiring coordination between the ophthalmologist, medical oncologist, radiation specialist, head & neck surgeon/ENT surgeon, pediatrician/internal medicine/hospitalist and a multidisciplinary team of support staff and nurses.|$|E
25|$|Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts is {{alternatively}} {{known as}} the Coats plus syndrome, a reference to its most typical <b>ocular</b> phenotype.|$|E
25|$|Gopher {{tortoises}} {{are known}} to contract upper respiratory tract diseases (URTDs) caused by various microorganisms, including the bacterium Mycoplasma agassizii and iridovirus and herpes viruses. Symptoms of URTDs include serous, mucoid, or purulent discharge from the nares, excessive tearing to purulent <b>ocular</b> discharge, conjunctivitis, and edema of the eyelids and <b>ocular</b> glands. M. agassizii is known to exist in tortoises without showing obvious symptoms. The antibiotic enrofloxacin {{has been used to}} treat bacterial URTDs in G. polyphemus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ocular</b> {{abnormalities}} of CDG-Ia include: myopia, infantile esotropia, delayed visual maturation, low vision, optic disc pallor, and reduced rod function on electroretinography.|$|E

25|$|To date {{there is}} no {{treatment}} for <b>ocular</b> albinism, probably because {{little is known about}} the receptor function and its role in the pathophysiology of the condition. Though surgery for strabismus is sometimes helpful, there does not seem to be a sure remedy for it until the cause of <b>ocular</b> albinism is well established. However, with the recent discovery of the upstream ligand (L-DOPA) and the discovery of Oa1's possible downstream G alpha partner (Gai3) the Oa1 pathway is becoming clearer and future of Oa1 research looks promising.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{eye disease}} can develop {{early in the}} disease course and lead to {{permanent}} vision loss in 20 percent of cases. <b>Ocular</b> involvement {{can be in the}} form of posterior uveitis, anterior uveitis, or retinal vasculitis. Anterior uveitis presents with painful eyes, conjuctival redness, hypopyon, and decreased visual acuity, while posterior uveitis presents with painless decreased visual acuity and visual field floaters. A rare form of <b>ocular</b> (eye) involvement in this syndrome is retinal vasculitis which presents with painless decrease of vision with the possibility of floaters or visual field defects.|$|E
25|$|Some {{examples}} include pacemakers, infusion pumps, the heart-lung machine, dialysis machines, artificial organs, implants, artificial limbs, corrective lenses, cochlear implants, <b>ocular</b> prosthetics, facial prosthetics, somato prosthetics, and dental implants.|$|E
25|$|OA1 is {{recognized}} by many different symptoms. Reduced visual acuity {{is accompanied by}} involuntary movements of the eye termed as nystagmus. Astigmatism is a condition wherein there occurs significant refractive error. Moreover, <b>ocular</b> albino eyes become crossed, a condition called as ‘lazy eyes’ or strabismus. Since very little pigment is present the iris becomes translucent and reflects light back. It appears green to blueish red. However, {{the most important part}} of the eye, the fovea which is responsible for acute vision, does not develop properly, probably indicating the role of melanin in the development stages of the eye. Some affected individuals may also develop photophobia/photodysphoria. All these symptoms are due to lack of pigmentation of the retina. Moreover, in an <b>ocular</b> albino eye, nerves from back of the eye to the brain may not follow the usual pattern of routing. In an <b>ocular</b> albino eye, more nerves cross from back of the eye to the opposite side of the brain instead of going to the both sides of the brain as in a normal eye. An <b>ocular</b> albino eye appears blueish pink in color with no pigmentation at all unlike a normal eye. Carrier women have regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation due to X-inactivation and partial iris transillumination and do not show any other symptoms exhibited by those affected by OA1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ocular</b> {{albinism}} {{results from}} defects in the melanin system, which {{may arise from}} either defects in the OA1 receptor, or mutations of either the Tyr gene or P transporter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ocular</b> {{albinism}} type 1 (OA1), {{also called}} Nettleship–Falls syndrome, {{is the most}} common type of <b>ocular</b> albinism, with a prevalence rate of 1:50,000. It is an inheritable classical Mendelian type X-linked recessive disorder wherein the retinal pigment epithelium lacks pigment while hair and skin appear normal. Since it is usually an X-linked disorder, it occurs mostly in males, while females are carriers unless they are homozygous. About 60 missense and nonsense mutations, insertions, and deletions have been identified in Oa1. Mutations in OA1 have been linked to defective glycosylation and thus improper intracellular transportation.|$|E
25|$|Management for <b>ocular</b> {{congenital}} rubella syndrome (CRS) {{is similar}} to that for age-related macular degeneration, including counseling, regular monitoring, and the provision of low vision devices, if required.|$|E
25|$|Dentures {{are often}} made of PMMA, {{and can be}} color-matched to the patient's teeth & gum tissue. PMMA is also used in the {{production}} of <b>ocular</b> prostheses, such as the osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis.|$|E
