5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{recollections}} {{throw some}} light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel {{was in love with}} Misia Edwards, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.|$|E

The download service faced some criticism from consumer groups due to its incompatibility with the popular iPod music player. The service has since been discontinued. Around the world there were other Virgin branded digital music retail websites, such as VirginMega.fr, France's number 2 music download website.|$|E
25|$|The {{islands are}} home to a notable {{independence}} movement that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of World War II, some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946 an independence referendum was held {{on the question of}} secession. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote.

This scenario can only be explained with the possible distortion of cultural and ethnic identity of native Romanized population that happened after the fall of West Roman Empire, and that the new Slavic language and culture was seen as a prestigious idiom they had to, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> to accept.|$|E

25|$|He began a {{campaign}} {{to raise money for}} the work. The estimated cost of everything needed <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> was $10 million, at first. Ultimately the diocese raised about two-thirds of that amount, and closed the cathedral for a year and a half while rotten structural lumber was replaced, plaster restored, electrical wiring replaced and the walls repainted to, as much as possible, their original colors. The altar was moved closer to the pews and placed on a raised concrete platform, and the baptismal font moved to the rear of the church. The pews themselves were widened and their backs reclined further to make them more comfortable to sit in.|$|E
25|$|There {{was much}} debate {{regarding}} {{the future of}} Ground Zero following {{the destruction of the}} World Trade Center. Disagreement and controversy regarding who owned the property and what would be built there hindered construction at the site for several years. Many wanted the Twin Towers to be rebuilt, but stronger and taller. The project for new Twin Towers was called Twin Towers II which was led by the informal organization, Twin Towers Alliance. Others did not want anything built there at all <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> the entire site to become a memorial. Finally, a master plan was agreed upon, which would feature a memorial and museum where the original Twin Towers stood and six new skyscrapers surrounding it.|$|E

Although {{separated}} from his wife, Kingsley fears that Crystal— rich, pretty, spoiled and reckless—may have become involved in a scandal that could jeopardise his position with the shareholders of the company {{of which he is}} an executive. The last definite place Crystal was known to have been was their vacation cabin on Little Fawn Lake. Kingsley had received a telegram from Crystal about two weeks before (dateline El Paso, Texas) stating that she was divorcing him and marrying her gigolo boyfriend, Chris Lavery. But when Kingsley ran into Lavery in L.A. and asked him where Crystal was, Lavery told him that he hadn't seen her, wasn't with her in El Paso, didn't know where she was, and never agreed, <b>or</b> <b>wanted,</b> to marry her.|$|E

25|$|The {{reaction}} of France and Britain to the Soviet invasion and annexation of Eastern Poland was muted, since neither country expected <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> {{a confrontation with}} the Soviet Union at that time. Under {{the terms of the}} Polish-British Common Defence Pact of 25 August 1939, the British had promised assistance if a European power attacked Poland. A secret protocol of the pact, however, specified that the European power referred to Germany. When Polish Ambassador Edward Raczyński reminded Foreign Secretary Edward Frederick Lindley Wood of the pact, he was bluntly told that it was Britain's business whether to declare war on the Soviet Union. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain considered making a public commitment to restore the Polish state but in the end issued only general condemnations. This stance represented Britain's attempt at balance: its security interests included trade with the Soviets that would support its war effort and the possibility of a future Anglo-Soviet alliance against Germany. Public opinion in Britain was divided between expressions of outrage at the invasion and a perception that Soviet claims to the region were reasonable.|$|E

[...] Gibson argues that Joyce [...] "remained a Catholic intellectual if not a believer" [...] since his thinking remained influenced by his cultural background, even though he lived apart from that culture. His relationship with religion was complex and not easily understood, even perhaps by himself. He acknowledged the debt he owed to his early Jesuit training.

500|$|In March 2009, Morrissey {{appeared}} as corrupt police detective Maurice Jobson in Red Riding, the Channel 4 adaptation of David Peace's Red Riding novels. Morrissey {{already knew the}} directors of the films, enjoyed reading the script and had either worked with his co-stars on other projects, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> to work with them. He liked the flaws in the Jobson character and that he differs from typical vigilante police officers portrayed on television. Morrissey said of Jobson, [...] "I think he sets out to be a good cop, he tries to do his job well but he gets involved in some corruption and realises that being a 'bit' corrupt is like being a 'bit' pregnant. You either are or you're not." [...] He received a Best Actor nomination from the Broadcasting Press Guild for the role. At the end of the year, Morrissey played Bobby Dykins in the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy (2009). As a self-confessed [...] "Beatles geek", Morrissey relished the opportunity to star in the film about Lennon's childhood.|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{noted that}} the pod does not entirely {{take place in the}} Framework, and that the {{characters}} [...] "have their full memories of what happened" [...] once they return to the real world. Some, such as Fitz, struggle with their actions in the Framework. The producers felt the impact of the [...] "what if" [...] scenario comes from rooting the changes in character choices, with Bell saying, [...] "I will give the writers room credit that everything that was chosen had an emotional resonance. It was something you hadn’t seen, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> to see or wondered about, so for us it was really rich territory to mine." [...] Whedon added, [...] "It wasn’t just, 'OK, let’s go Wacky World!' It was, 'What if you’d made different decisions?' That made it for us a much more fun puzzle."

IGN's Eric Goldman rated the episode 9/10, calling it [...] "very satisfying", and Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended it as [...] "fine television." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote: [...] "I'm not sure I expected <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> a feel-good ending out of the first half of Glee. But what we got from [...] "Sectionals" [...] left me feeling very good about where the show is going this spring." [...] In contrast, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, felt that the episode brought too many storylines to a head at once, [...] "not allowing all to have as much impact as they might have had the big developments been spaced out". Sepinwall commented, however, that the acting and especially singing performances were [...] "uniformly strong." ...|$|E
5000|$|Asteya in practice, states Patricia Corner, implies to [...] "not steal", [...] "not cheat" [...] nor unethically {{manipulate}} other's {{property or}} others for one's own gain. Asteya as virtue demands {{that not only}} one [...] "not steal" [...] through one's action, one shouldn't want to encourage cheating through speech <b>or</b> writing, <b>or</b> <b>want</b> to cheat even in one's thinking. Smith states that the virtue of asteya arises out of the understanding that all misappropriation {{is an expression of}} craving and a feeling of lack of compassion for other beings. To steal <b>or</b> <b>want</b> to steal expresses lack of faith in oneself, one's ability to learn and create property. To steal another's property is also stealing from one's own potential ability to develop.

500|$|The {{writers were}} new to screenwriting, so their film {{treatment}} ran to 110-pages; the average was 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, {{an executive at}} Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the [...] "Seven Fires" [...] film treatment as Tanen's assistant, while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, [...] "We went further than I think Universal expected <b>or</b> <b>wanted.</b> I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And {{we had a lot}} of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit... We didn't back off anything". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, [...] "They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we’ll make a couple of bucks if we're lucky—let them do whatever they want.' ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great.
