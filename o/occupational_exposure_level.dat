Methods Measurements of particulate aerosols, bacterial bioaerosol, and endotoxins and 3 -hydroxy fatty acids (3 -OH FAs) content in water-based and straight oil MWFs were done during an 8 hr work shift in the grindery and oil basement sections of a steelworks located in Upper Silesia, Poland. Results Particulate aerosol concentrations were below NIOSH recommended <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level.</b> Differences in concentration and taxonomical composition of airborne bacteria between grindery and oil basement were found, due to the more aggressive creation of oil mist during machining operations and different MWF characteristics, which favor growth of different bacterial strains.

40|$|AbstractOver 40 {{years of}} {{scientific}} {{evidence indicates that}} methyl methacrylate (MMA) causes olfactory effects in rodents {{that are relevant to}} humans. More recent scientific studies have focused on understanding the apparent lack of species concordance between the rodent and human studies. Toxicokinetic studies and a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model describing inhalation dosimetry of MMA in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of rats and humans point to differences in nasal morphology and biochemistry that could explain and reconcile these differences as species-specific manifestations of a common toxicological process. We have applied the hypothesis-based weight-of-evidence (HBWoE) approach to evaluate the concordance of the available data and the hypothesis that the observed difference in sensitivity between rats and humans may be the expected result of physiological and biochemical differences. Our WoE analysis indicates that when the several lines of evidence (i. e., animal, human, mode-of-action, and toxicokinetics data) are integrated, they inform interpretation of one another and, overall, support use of the human data for derivation of an MMA <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> (OEL) of 50 ppm...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To review {{epidemiological}} studies {{which led to}} a change in the classification of formaldehyde by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2004 as well as studies published thereafter, with the objective to examine whether <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for formaldehyde should be adapted. METHOD: Cohort and case-control studies investigating the association between <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to formaldehyde and nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and reporting estimates of formaldehyde exposure as well as the most recent meta-analyses, published after 1994, were reviewed. RESULTS: Evidence of an association between <b>occupational</b> formaldehyde <b>exposure</b> and NPC appears debatable. Results of the cohort studied by Hauptmann et al. (Am J Epidemiol 159 (12) : 1117 - 1130, 2004) were key findings in the IARC evaluation. In this study, mortality from NPC was elevated compared with that of the US general population. However, internal comparison analysis using alternative categorization revealed that none of the relative risk for NPC was statistically significantly increased in any category of exposure (Marsh and Youk in Regul Toxicol Pharmacol 42 (3) : 275 - 283, 2005) and re-analyses of the data highlighted the inappropriateness of the exposure assessment used by Hauptmann et al. (Am J Epidemiol 159 (12) : 1117 - 1130, 2004) and Marsh et al. (Regul Toxicol Pharmacol 47 (1) : 59 - 67, 2007). Two other cohorts (Coggon et al. in J Natl Cancer Inst 95 (21) : 1608 - 1615, 2003; Pinkerton et al. in Occup Environ Med 61 (3) 193 - 200, 2004) reported no increase in NPC. Two case-control studies brought some evidence of an increased risk of NPC but the assessment of <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> was uncertain. DISCUSSION: Human studies fail to raise a convincing conclusion concerning the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde and are not helpful to delineate a possible dose-response relationship. Experimental data indicate that in rats, the carcinogenic activity of formaldehyde is associated with cytotoxic/proliferative mechanisms. Therefore protecting from these effects associated with formaldehyde exposure should be sufficient to protect from its potential carcinogenic effects, if any in humans.

In this study, the characteristics of occupational exposure to benzene during TA in the petrochemical companies were investigated {{in order to determine}} the best management strategies and improve the working environment. This was accomplished by evaluating the exposure level for the workers working in environments where benzene was being produced or used as an ingredient during the unit process. Methods: From 2003 to 2008, a total of 705 workers in three petrochemical companies in Korea were studied. Long- and short-term (< 1 hr) samples were taken during TAs. TA was classifi ed into three stages: shut-down, maintenance and start-up. All works were classifi ed into 12 occupation categories. Results: The long-term geometric mean (GM) benzene exposure level was 0. 025 (5. 82) ppm (0. 005 - 42. 120 ppm) and the short-term exposure concentration during TA was 0. 020 (17. 42) ppm (0. 005 - 61. 855 ppm).

No evidence of teratogenicity or maternal toxicity was observed in an inhalation (2 -ethylhexyl-L-lactate) or dermal study (ethyl-L-lactate). Subacute inhalation studies have been conducted at concentration up to 600 mg/m 3 or higher on four lactate esters (ethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, and 2 -ethylhexyl-L-lactate). Degenerative and regenerative changes in the nasal cavity were noted in all studies. The NOAEL in ethyl, n-butyl, and isobutyl-L-lactate vapor studies was 200 mg/m 3. For aerosol exposure, 2 -ethylhexyl-L-lactate, the most toxic of the lactates, minimal damage to the nasal epithelium was noted at 75 mg/m 3 with vapor being slightly less toxic than the aerosol. Lactates do not appear to cause systemic toxicity, except at very high concentrations (1800 mg/m 3 or higher). These systemic effects may be secondary to severe irritation seen at high doses. Sensory irritation tests suggest that a vapor exposure limit of 75 mg/m 3 (~ 15 ppm) should prevent irritation in humans and therefore an <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> for vapor of 75 mg/m 3 is recommended. However, aerosol exposure should be kept as low as possible. The low vapor pressure of the higher molecular weight esters would tend to keep vapor exposure low and the odor of lactate esters serves as a warning of exposure.

The work on which this paper is based included an extensive literature study, as well as field investigations on a surface mine in Namibia. A number of additional dust suppression interventions were identified. These improvements, listed below, will assist in reducing dust concentrations around the drill rigs: • Increase maintenance frequency on the shroud, sealing ring, suction pipes and filters of the drill rigs, • Design and install new overlapping rubber belts on the shroud of the DM 45, • Install an air-blocking shelf on the inside perimeter of the shroud of the DM 45, • Install an airflow meter to ensure that the QC: QB ratio never drops below 3 : 1, • Only allow wet drilling, • Flush the dust collector system more regularly with compressed air to ensure that it does not become blocked, • Introduce stricter supervision to ensure that the suction pipes are always connected to the shroud, • Give drill rig operators more advanced training to ensure more effective drilling in order to reduce dust levels.

40|$|Background: The {{activities}} of rescue and uniformed services {{require the use}} of wireless communication devices, such as portable radiophones. Assessment of workers' exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by radiophones is important in view of occupational safety and health (OSH), legislation requirements and reports on possible adverse health effects in users of devices emitting radiofrequency electromagnetic field. Materials and Methods: In this study 50 portable radiophones of conventional and trunked communication systems were investigated. The assessment of electromagnetic hazards to users involved unperturbed electromagnetic field measurements near radiophones' antennas. Results: The electric field strength corresponding to the <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> (fields of so-called safety zones established by OSH legislation in Poland) was measured at a distance of 45 - 65 cm from the portable radiophones antennas of conventional system and 75 - 95 cm from antennas of trunked system radiophones, depending on their type and mode of work. The assessment was based on the averaged results of series of measurements. The electric field strength exceeding action levels defined by Directive 2013 / 35 /EU was found up to 15 cm from radiophone antennas of conventional system and up to 10 cm from the antennas of trunked system radiophones. Conclusions: Taking into account the range of safety zones and the use of portable radiophones near the body, their users should be classified into the group of workers occupationally exposed to electromagnetic fields. Electromagnetic field measurement results and typical conditions of using portable radiophones justify theneed for additional assessment of electromagnetic hazards - the analysis of compliance with relevant exposure limit values provided by Directive 2013 / 35 /EU.

Cases of occupational asthma and allergic contact dermatitis have been reported among persons who work with these chemicals. Little personal exposure data exists on nail technicians 2 ̆ 7 exposures to these chemicals, especially ethyl methacrylate. The literature suggests that the industrial hygiene practices used for methyl methacrylate also be applied to ethyl methacrylate since more is known about methyl methacrylate. Previous exposure studies have revealed relatively low exposures to these chemical. There are no U. S. occupational exposure limits for ethyl methacrylate. The objectives {{of this study were}} to measure nail sculptors 2 ̆ 7 exposure to ethyl methacrylate and/or methyl methacrylate vapors in their personal breathing zone, describe the interior lay-out of the nail salon in relation to where the chemical vapors were generated, and quantify the volume of air supplied by the HVAC.

40|$|For {{chemical}} pollutants, {{health risk}} assessment of long-term exposure is usually best realized through an epidemiologic approach which attempts to link cumulative levels {{of exposure to}} the potential for occurrence of early adverse effects. For some chemicals, however, the frequency of peak exposures may be more relevant for assessing the health risk than the integrated dose. In very few circumstances, biological exposure indices directly reflect the cumulative dose (e. g. PCB in blood). More frequently they are indicators of short-term interval dose but provided they have been measured with a sufficient frequency, their integration over the duration of exposure may represent a valid surrogate of the cumulative dose. This has been clearly demonstrated for lead or cadmium in blood. The selection of the appropriate biological effect markers {{for the study of the}} dose-effect/dose-response relationships is frequently a controversial issue when information on the mechanism of action of the pollutant is insufficient. In this case, the study of the health significance of the observed biological changes may be required for assessing a meaningful no-adverse-effect level. For example, in adult male workers moderate exposure to lead may affect the synthesis of vasodilatory prostaglandins in the kidney but presently there is no indication that this effect should be taken into account to define the acceptable <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> to lead because it is not associated with an impairment of the hemodynamic response of the kidney to an acute protein load. On the contrary, a low-molecular-weight proteinuria induced by cadmium may be predictive of an increased age-related decline of the glomerular filtration rate. Although the use of early biological effect markers for the study of the dose-effect or dose-response relationships in humans is probably less affected by selection biases than morbidity data, the possibility of such an interference cannot be excluded. For example, in the general population, the tubulotoxic effects of cadmium may occur at a lower body burden of the metal than in adult male workers. Whatever the adverse biological effect considered, the application of an uncertainty factor remains justified when extrapolating a no-effect level from adult male workers to the general population...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Background: Workers will {{be exposed}} to silica dust (SiO 2) in any working {{environment}} where mineral deposits or rock types are being processed contain silica as a component. To prevent the development of silica related disease, the exposure to silica dust should be kept as far below the time weighted average (TWA) <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> (OEL). Exposure below the TWA OEL {{is considered to be}} safe. The silica content of platinum ore is low and exposure below the TWA OEL (Stanton et al., 2006), however studies have shown evidence of silicosis in workers that had no other exposure to silica outside of the platinum industry (Nelson and Murray., 2012). Objectives: To evaluate the silica exposure levels of 4 different high risk tasks at a platinum mine. To evaluate the sufficiency of the current South African OEL. To compare the differences in protocols used by the mine to NIOSH method 7602. Methods: Dust sampling was conducted by means of two cyclone samplers (aspirated at 2. 2 L/min) in the breathing zone of each of the 48 workers in 4 different areas. Two cyclone samplers were used to compare two different protocols. The first protocol reflected the method used by the mine and the second was done in accordance with the NIOSH method 7602 (NIOSH, 2003). Sampling was done in the vamping, development cleaning, belt attendant and grout plant areas. A 25 mm MCE filter was used to capture the respirable fraction. The quartz content of the filter was determined by a SANAS accredited laboratory using qualitative infrared spectroscopy in accordance with NIOSH method 7602. Additional bulk samples were taken to be analysed for silica as well. Results: Most of the samples were below the respective OELs of 0. 1 mg/m 3 (MHS, 1996), 0. 05 mg/m 3 (NIOSH, 2002) and 0. 025 mg/m 3 (ACGIH, 2012). A single sample in the development cleaning area in the Merensky reef had a value of 0. 032 mg/m 3. Nearly {{no significant differences were found}} in the exposure levels between the two protocols, the two reefs or the different underground areas. Although the differences in protocol are not statistically significant the protocol implemented by the mine yielded lower exposure values. The grout plant had the lowest silica exposure levels. Conclusions: Upon evaluating the silica exposures of platinum mine workers there does not seem to be a health or safety risk involved at these low levels. The implemented control measures are sufficient in preventing the development of applicable health and safety risks. However if any new cases of severe illness (e. g. silicosis) occur it may be necessary to re-evaluate the risks involved with silica exposure. Recommendations: The goal of silica monitoring should be to obtain accurate data that represents the actual exposure levels experienced by a worker during a working shift. Accurate data gives insight into the safety of the worker. To achieve this, the monitoring should be done as accurately as possible to adhere to the prescribed methods. Employees/workers should be trained in order to assist in identifying and correcting problems that may occur during sampling. Master...|$|E

There were no case reports or epidemiological studies available concerned with the potential carcinogenicity of chlorobenzene in humans. There was some limited evidence indicating that the compound is genotoxic and that it may induce hematopoietic toxicity at relatively moderate doses. Chlorobenzene was not classifiable as a human carcinogen. The author concludes that {{the central nervous system}} effects and the hepatotoxic effects should be considered in setting <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> limits.

40|$|Background: The {{aim was to}} use the {{measured}} data on annual exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the risk estimation model to estimate the increase in risk of Non-Melanomic Skin Cancer (NMSC) among outdoor workers compared to indoor workers in Rockhampton (lat. 23 S), Central Queensland, Australia. Methods: Results on annual <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> measured on two occupational groups Namely Australia Post Mail Delivery Personnel (APMDP) and Physical Education Teachers (PE) using film badge dosimeters {{was used in the}} risk estimation model to determine the increase in risk of NMSC with years of outdoor <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> compared to indoor workers. The sensitivity of the model was tested for variations in recreational and childhood exposure of both groups, as well as <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> of indoor workers. Results: For APMDP the increase in risk for Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) varied from 1. 1 to 3. 6 for 5 - 20 years of exposure and for Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) the risk varied from 1. 2 to 5. 5 for the same periods of exposure. For the PE teachers the risk for BCC varied from 1. 1 to 1. 8 and for SCC the range was 1. 1 - 2. 3 for similar exposure periods. Conclusion: The increased risk estimates did not show any significant changes for variations in <b>occupational</b> and recreational <b>exposure.</b> A maximum change of 20 % was computed for 25 % variation in childhood exposure, which was mainly for the APMDP with high <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> and more than 10 years of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure.</b> The increased risk estimates are useful to identify high risk groups at an early age and implement long-term protective measures against NMSC...|$|R

Differences are not statistically significant and it is concluded that <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to noise <b>levels</b> in that range cannot {{be held responsible for}} causing hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is {{produced}} in Poland as a high production volume chemical (HPVC). It is used mainly as a pigment for paints and coatings, plastics, paper, and also as additives to food and pharmaceuticals. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are increasingly applied in cosmetics, textiles and plastics as the ultraviolet light blocker. This contributes to a growing <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to TiO 2 nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are potentially responsible for the most adverse effects of titanium dioxide. Due {{to the absence of}} separate fraction of nanoobjects and appropriate measurement methods the maximum admissible concentrations (MAC) for particles < 100 nm and nano-TiO 2 cannot be established. In the world there are 2 proposals of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for titanium dioxide nanoparticles: 0. 3 mg/m 3, proposed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and 0. 6 mg/m 3, proposed by experts of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). The authors of this article, based on the available data and existing methods for hygiene standards binding in Poland, concluded that the MAC value of 0. 3 mg/m 3 for nanoparticles TiO 2 in the workplace air can be accepted.

40|$|Cultivation-based {{microbiological}} {{methods are}} a {{gold standard for}} monitoring of airborne micro-organisms to determine the <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> or transmission paths of a particular infectious agent. Some highly contagious microorganisms are not easily culturable but it is becoming evident that cultivation and molecular methods are complementary and in these cases highly relevant. We report a simple and efficient method for sampling and analyzing airborne bacteria with an impactor-type high-flow-rate portable air sampler, currently used for monitoring culturable bacteria or fungi. A method is reported for extraction of nucleic acids from impacted cells without prior cultivation and using agarose as a sampling matrix. The DNA extraction efficiency was determined in spiked samples and, samples taken from a wastewater treatment plant and an alpine area. The abundance, diversity and quantity of total bacteria were analysed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and by construction and analysis of clone libraries. The method does not interfere with downstream PCR analysis and can cover the gap between traditional culture and molecular techniques of bioaerosol monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Cutting {{autoclaved}} {{aerated concrete}} (AAC) {{in the construction industry}} has the potential to expose workers to dust containing respirable crystalline silica. In order to better understand this health risk, a pilot program of air monitoring was conducted in different areas of three Sydney construction sites over a six- day period. An analysis of the results showed that the mean <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> were below the exposure standard of 0. 1 mg/m 3 for respirable crystalline silica. However, exceedances of the 50 % action limit were observed. Respirable dust exposures exceeded the adopted OEL of 3. 0 mg/m 3 in some instances. There was considerable variation between the sites in terms of hazard controls, general working conditions and work environments. Wearing of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) varied between AAC crew members and was absent for workers in the vicinity. It can be concluded that strict control measures such as isolating cutting areas, tool maintenance, careful training and supervision, and attention to housekeeping must be adopted to prevent workers’ exposure to respirable quartz and dust...|$|R
40|$|Nanomaterial and {{nanotechnology}} safety {{require the}} characterization of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for completing a risk assessment. However, equally important is the estimation of the effective internal dose via lung deposition, transport and clearance mechanisms. An integrated source-to-biological dose assessment study is presented using real monitoring data collected during nanoparticle synthesis. Experimental monitoring data of airborne <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> during nanoparticle synthesis of CaSO 4 and BiPO 4 nanoparticles in a research laboratory is coupled with a human lung transport and deposition model, which solves in an Eulerian framework the general dynamic equation for polydisperse aerosols using particle specific physical-chemical properties. Subsequently, the lung deposition model is coupled with a mathematical particle clearance model providing the effective biological dose {{as well as the}} time course of the biological dose build-up after exposure. The results for the example of BiPO 4 demonstrate that even short exposures throughout the day can lead to particle doses of 1. 10 centerdotE+ 08 #/(kg-bwcenterdot 8 h-shift), with the majority accumulating in the pulmonary region. Clearance of particles is slow and is not completed within a working shift following a 1 hour exposure. It mostly occurs via macrophage activity in the alveolar region, with small amounts transported to the interstitium and less to the lymph nodes...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: European {{legislation}} {{concerning the}} protection of workers from exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) was recently (26. 6. 2013) completed by Directive 2013 / 35 /ΕU. This Directive is a specific one of the framework Directive 89 / 391 /EEC {{and part of the}} overall legislation for Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems have played a key role, both in the postponement of the former 2004 / 40 EMF Directive and {{in the formation of the}} latest limits adopted by the new Directive. On the other hand, MRI systems are associated with the exposure of personnel to EMF of various frequencies and modulations, arousing peculiar safety issues. Therefore, we will try to acquire the highly important knowledge of the exact <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> in all working scenarios and practices. Methods: Different MRI systems (1. 5 and 3 T) have been chosen for a variety of measurements in order to assess <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> compared to the limits (ALs) of the Directive and to the main OHS principles. Gradient function of MRI systems results in low frequency exposure, while high frequency exposure comes from the application of the RF excitation frequency. Results: In most of the cases the RMS and peak value measurements do not exceed the corresponding ALs, apart from a few specific hot spots, manageable through OHS principles. Discussion: Complete <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> results can form the basis for dealing with multiple exposures present in MRI systems. Peculiar RF harmonic components, of no safety concern, were detected. Their origin is under examination. © 2015 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, diesel motor exhaust (DME) {{has been}} {{classified}} as a known human carcinogen. We used data from epidemiological studies of diesel exposures to perform a quantitative risk assessment to calculate DME <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> expressed as elemental carbon (EC), corresponding to acceptable risk (AR) and maximum tolerable risk (MTR) levels of 4 to 10 (- 5) and 4 to 10 (- 3) for the lifetime excess probability of dying from lung cancer. METHODS: Previously published slope estimates (n= 14) of the exposure-response curve (ERC) for EC exposure and lung cancer were used in life-table analyses to calculate EC <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> corresponding to the specified AR and MTR levels. RESULTS: Considered ERC slope factors ranged from 0. 00060 to 0. 0012  natural logarithm of the relative rate (InRR) per μg/m(3)  years based on different selections of studies and study-specific risk estimates. Exposure limits based on these slope factors were between 0. 009 - 0. 017 and 0. 85 - 1. 67  μg/m(3) EC for the AR and MTR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Derived exposure limits based on the AR and MTR are around or well below 1  μg/m(3) EC. Such limits are below current <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> {{and in some instances}} even below environmental <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> Although uncertainties exist in the exact slope factors, these results indicate that an acceptable excess lung cancer mortality risk can only be achieved at very low DME <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> suggesting that diesel engines using older technologies should be removed from the workplace when possible or emissions strictly controlled...|$|R
