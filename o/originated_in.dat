5|$|Ceratopsia {{appears to}} have <b>originated</b> <b>in</b> Asia, as all of the {{earliest}} members are found there. Fragmentary remains, including teeth, which appear to be neoceratopsian, are found in North America from the Albian stage (112 to 100 million years ago), indicating that the group had dispersed across {{what is now the}} Bering Strait {{by the middle of the}} Cretaceous Period. Almost all leptoceratopsids are North American, aside from Udanoceratops, which may represent a separate dispersal event, back into Asia. Ceratopsids and their immediate ancestors, such as Zuniceratops, were unknown outside of western North America, and were presumed endemic to that continent. The traditional view that ceratopsoids <b>originated</b> <b>in</b> North America was called into question by the 2009 discovery of better specimens of the dubious Asian form Turanoceratops, which confirmed it as a ceratopsid. It is unknown whether this indicates ceratopsids actually <b>originated</b> <b>in</b> Asia, or if the Turanoceratops immigrated from North America.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Comparing the {{epidemiology}} of fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical and apical regions {{may help}} to understand the causes and risk of a vertical root fracture. We aimed to determine the frequency of vertical root fractures in different fracture sites and how the fracture site relates to fracture direction and post length. Methods: Teeth diagnosed with a vertical root fracture were retrospectively surveyed for age and sex of the patient, type of tooth, a fracture region in the longitudinal axial direction, site of the fracture, and presence of a post The fracture region in the longitudinal axial direction was classified as an incomplete fracture, complete fracture, and uncertain. Incomplete fractures were further classified into a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region, a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the midregion, and a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the apical region. Posts were evaluated by loss of post and length of post. Results: Fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical and apical region occurred around the same frequency, whereas fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the midregion were extremely scarce. Of the fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region, 36. 2 % were in a mesial and/or distal site and 57. 4 % in a buccal and/or lingual site. Of the fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the apical region, 90. 8 % were in the buccal and/ or lingual site. The {{number of cases of}} fractures <b>Originating</b> <b>in</b> the apical region decreased with increased post length. Conclusions: Sites of fracture and post length differed greatly between fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region and the apical region, suggesting that risk factors for fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical and apical regions are different...|$|R

5|$|The first {{evidence}} of malaria parasites {{was found in}} mosquitoes preserved in amber from the Palaeogene period that are approximately 30 million years old. Human malaria likely <b>originated</b> <b>in</b> Africa and coevolved with its hosts, mosquitoes and non-human primates. Malaria protozoa are diversified into primate, rodent, bird, and reptile host lineages. Humans may have originally caught Plasmodium falciparum from gorillas. P. vivax, another malarial Plasmodium species among the six that infect humans, also likely <b>originated</b> <b>in</b> African gorillas and chimpanzees. Another malarial species recently discovered to be transmissible to humans, P. knowlesi, <b>originated</b> <b>in</b> Asian macaque monkeys. While P. malariae is highly host specific to humans, {{there is some evidence}} that low level non-symptomatic infection persists among wild chimpanzees.|$|E

40|$|Coliphage T 4 {{was used}} as a model system to study the {{mechanism}} of biological inactivation produced by tritium decay. Experimentally, tritiated precursors were incorporated into phage DNA (thymidine- 3 H) or into phage protein (3 H-amino acids). The ratio of killing efficiencies for decays <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> phage DNA to those <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> phage protein was 2. 6. Inactivation by decays from labeled amino acids was assumed to occur exclusively from β-particle irradiation of phage DNA. If decays <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> DNA are due solely to irradiation of DNA, then the killing efficiencies reflect the energy transfer paths in phage DNA for decays <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> phage DNA and in the protein coat. The energy transfer paths were determined for the two cases {{with the help of a}} computer and found to be very nearly equal to the experimentally determined ratio (2. 6).
