5|$|Two small {{detachments}} of infantry {{of about}} 40 men each were ordered ahead of main columns.

5|$|Whether {{the pyramid}} was {{finished}} <b>or</b> <b>left</b> unfinished is disputed among experts. The egyptologist Rainer Stadelmann {{believes that the}} pyramid was indeed finished, but others, such as Miroslav Verner, think that the building was left unfinished because of the pharaoh's premature death. In particular, no traces of outer cladding were found, which could hint that there never was one because the pyramid was not completed.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives can {{be completed}} in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off early in the game, <b>or</b> <b>left</b> alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Riley {{made his}} last tour, making stops {{in most of}} the major cities in the United States. Advertised as his final performances, there was {{incredible}} demand for tickets and Riley performed before his largest audiences during the tour. He and Sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and Nye had done. Riley often lamented the lack of change in the program, but found when he tried to introduce new material, <b>or</b> <b>left</b> out any of his most popular poems, the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, {{the first}} M-108 {{designation}} was commissioned along a rare three-legged route connecting the State Highway Ferry Docks with the Fort Michilimackinac State Historic Park and US 31. At one point while traveling westbound on M-108, motorists could turn right onto northbound M-108 <b>or</b> <b>left</b> onto southbound M-108. In {{preparation for the}} opening of the Mackinac Bridge, the Michigan State Highway Department transferred all of M-108 to local control in late 1957, decommissioning the designation at the same time. In 1960, the current M-108 was commissioned along the final routing.|$|E
5|$|In many {{recreational}} diving {{settings where}} air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are {{identified with a}} green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured <b>or</b> <b>left</b> in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Reformation brought {{about changes in}} the {{governance}} of the cathedrals as discussed below. Some existent buildings became cathedrals at this time. Several of the buildings were structurally damaged <b>or</b> <b>left</b> incomplete because of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, 1537–40. Many of the large abbey churches, particularly those outside the towns, were robbed, burnt out and abandoned. The late 16th and early 17th centuries saw repairs to the fabric of many cathedrals and some new building and stained glass {{as well as many}} new fittings.|$|E

5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right <b>or</b> <b>left</b> in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Mortier {{accepted}} the bait of a rumored Russian retreat. In {{the early morning}} of 11 November he and Gazan departed from Dürenstein to seize Stein and Krems, presuming the Russians had either abandoned the settlements <b>or</b> <b>left</b> only a small rear-guard behind. As they approached Stein, a column of Miloradovich's troops attacked the French forward positions. Thinking this force was the rumored Russian rear guard, Mortier ordered Gen. Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein. Fighting spread though the villages of Oberloiben, Unterloiben and the farm at Rothenhof. Instead of withdrawing, as a rear guard would, more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column.|$|E
5|$|September 10, 1960– Hurricane Donna strikes near Cape Sable after {{crossing}} the Florida Keys, and after briefly moving emerging into the Gulf of Mexico makes its final landfall near Fort Myers. It leaves {{a path of}} destruction across the entire peninsula, including destroying 30% of the state's grapefruit crop and leveling {{over half of the}} mangrove trees in the Everglades. The passage of the hurricane results in 2,156destroyed homes, 3,903severely damaged houses, and 281 boats destroyed <b>or</b> <b>left</b> with major damage. Throughout the state, Donna causes over $300million in damage (1960USD, $2.19billion 2008USD) and 13direct deaths.|$|E

5|$|The Device Forts {{emerged as}} a result of changes in English {{military}} architecture and foreign policy in the early 16th century. During the late medieval period, the English use of castles as military fortifications had declined in importance. The introduction of gunpowder in warfare had initially favoured the defender, but soon traditional stone walls could easily be destroyed by early artillery. The few new castles that were built during this time still incorporated the older features of gatehouses and crenellated walls, but intended them more as martial symbols than as practical military defences. Many older castles were simply abandoned <b>or</b> <b>left</b> to fall in disrepair.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2cm into the right <b>or</b> <b>left</b> mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during thoracic surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the thoracic cavity.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lookout}} {{at the summit}} was abandoned, the Forest Service changed {{strategies}} from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed <b>or</b> <b>left</b> to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high fire danger.|$|E
