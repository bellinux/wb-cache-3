40|$|The {{process of}} the {{vegetation}} development on glacier moraines was surveyed in the lower stream area of Oobloyah Valley (80 ° 502 ̆ 7 N, 82 ° 452 ̆ 7 W), Ellesmere Island, high arctic Canada. Four glacier moraines, and an <b>outwash</b> <b>plane</b> with different establishment periods in the proglacial field of Arklio Glacier, were surveyed. The oldest moraine was estimated to have been established during the Full Glacial, ca. 25000 - 35000 years ago, and the youngest one during the Little Ice Age, ca. 250 years ago. The vegetation properties such as number of species per study plot, cover of vegetation, lichens and bryophytes showed constant increase the moraine age, suggesting directional vegetation development. Changes in the species composition were such that new species successively appeared during {{the establishment of the}} moraines without obvious replacement of the species. It was concluded that the manner of the vegetation development was directional-nonreplacement succession even under extreme high arctic environment, differing from the generally accepted view that under an extreme high arctic environment nondirectional-nonreplacement succession prevails. Vegetation physiognomy approached Cassiope tetragona-dominated dwarf shrub heath, which generally prevails in more southern regions than Ellesmere Island. The period required for the vegetation development in the study area was assumed to be quite long, probably at least ca. 20000 years...|$|E
40|$|Includes maps, airphotos, {{diagrams}} and photographs. A north-facing {{view from}} atop the Prairie du Sac dam affords a fleeting glimpse of something wholly {{different from the}} picturesque Lower Wisconsin Riverway (LWR) and its pastoral surroundings. For nearly 40 years the Badger Army Ammunition Plant (BAAP) has sat vacant and idle on Sauk Prairie, tempting any onlooker to explore the mysteries that lie beyond its chained gates. The more than 1, 000 buildings occupying this 10,OOO-acre swath of land on the glacial <b>outwash</b> <b>plane</b> that is Sauk Prairie are visual reminders-monuments-to the unprecedented landscape transitions that took place here. Like any relic of this scale, questions arise as to its genesis, evolution, and purpose. However, {{within the confines of}} this class we have chosen to narrow our scope to just two landscapes of change, specifically, the ways in which BAAP changed the physical and socio-economic landscapes of Sauk Prairie and surrounding counties. After analyzing PLSS notes, historic images and accounts, aerial photos, labor statistics, census data, and Plant publications we claim that BAAP contributed to Wisconsin in less than visible ways. BAAP is a blight on the landscape and much of it is contaminated with toxic chemicals, however, if BAAP never occupied Sauk Prairie the region would not have been awoken from the great depression when it was, nor would the region have been so connected with cheap and reliable transportation. Further, though contaminated, the land that BAAP occupies is a wild area with bird species seen few other areas in Wisconsin and vegetation the Prairie has not seen in thousands of years. We do not aim to defend the War Department in their decision to build BAAP on Sauk Prairie, however, consideration of the various benefits that BAAP brought to surrounding communities lead to a more nuanced view of its history...|$|E
40|$|The largest {{eruption}} in Iceland {{since the}} Laki 1783 - 84 event began in Holuhraun, NE Iceland, on 31 August 2014, producing a lava flow field which, {{by the end}} of the eruption on February 27 th 2015, covered 84, 5 km 2 with volume of 1, 44 km 3. Throughout the event, various satellite images (NOAA AVHRR, MODIS, SUOMI NPP VIIRS, ASTER, LANDSAT 7 & 8, EO- 1 ALI & HYPERION, RADARSAT- 2, SENTINEL- 1, COSMO SKYMED, TERRASAR X) were analysed to monitor the development of activity, identify active flow fronts and channels, and map the lava extent in close collaboration with the on-site field group. Aerial photographs and radar images from the Icelandic Coast Guard Dash 8 aircraft supported this effort. By the end of 2015, Loftmyndir ehf had produced a detailed 3 D model of the lava using aerial photographs from 2013 and 2015. The importance of carrying out real-time monitoring of a volcanic eruption is: i) to locate sites of elevated temperature that may be registering new areas of activity within the lava or opening of vents or fissures. ii) To establish and verify timing of events at the vents and within the lava. iii) To identify potential volcanic hazard that can be caused by lava movements, eruption-induced flash flooding, tephra fallout or gas pollution. iv) to provide up-to-date regional information to field groups concerning safety as well as to locate sites for sampling lava, tephra and polluted water. v) to produce quantitative information on magma discharge and lava flow advance, map the lava extent, document the flow morphology and plume/tephra dispersal. During the eruption, these efforts supported mapping of the extent of the lava every 3 - 4 days on average underpinning the time series of magma discharge calculations. Digitial elevation models from before and after the event, combined with the real-time data series, supports detailed analysis of how landscape affects lava flow in a flat terrain (< 0, 4 ◦), and provides important input to further developing lava flow models within the EU VETOOLS project, aiming to improve response to future events. Monitoring the site was carried out throughout 2015, including the cooling of the lava in relation to thickness and inflation history. This also included mapping of hydrology in the Dyngjujökull <b>outwash</b> <b>plane,</b> development of ponds where the lava blocked previous river channels. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The lithological and {{petrographical}} {{characteristics of}} soil pedogenesis was determined, and the spatial and vertical distribution of some soil physico-chemical properties (including heavy metal content) were studied along two transects in Poland. The genetic horizon for 22 soil profiles were described for particle size and petrographic composition, quartz grain abrasion, transformation of organic substance, carbon and nitrogen characteristics, base saturation, exchangeable cations, and acidity. The {{results showed that}} the morphogenesis of parent rock in all studied profiles is characterized by the glaciofluvial sedimentation of fine sands. All research plots were situated on valley terraces or <b>outwash</b> <b>planes</b> connected with glaciofluvial accumulation of redeposited, polygenetic sand formation. Soils belonged to three subtypes of Spodosols (podsolic class). All soil profiles were characterized by a very acid reaction (pH 3. 0 - 4. 5 in horizon A), and the degree of acidity corresponded to soil type. All other defined physico-chemical properties indicated that soils had low nutrient status. Mineral-humus layers of most of the soils were characterized by a high carbon:nitrogen ratio (from 10. 6 to 53. 7). This suggests limited biological activity of the soils and slow humification and mineralization rates. Overlying humus has three distinct subtypes (mor, moder/mor, mor/moder). In all soils the ratio of humic acids to fulvic acids was less than one, with the highest content of fulvic forms in humus compounds. Total exchangeable cations averaged 2. 5 meq per 100 g of soil from the mineral-humus horizon and 0. 5 meq per 100 g of soil in the parent rock. The degree that the sorption complex was saturated with base cations was also very low (less than 10 percent). Heavy metal spatial distribution in studied soils was not distinguished by region, but by local pollution sources or by natural concentration in the soil...|$|R
