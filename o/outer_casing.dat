5|$|The pyramid core was {{constructed}} in a step-like structure, a construction technique {{similar to that of}} the 4th dynasty although the building material was of a significantly lower quality. The <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> of the pyramid was made of fine Tura limestone which certainly ensured Userkaf's construction an appearance {{similar to that of the}} glorious 4th Dynasty pyramids. There was however no red granite paneling over the lower part of the pyramid as in the case of the Pyramid of Menkaure.|$|E
5|$|The {{other four}} members of the initial order made by the Southern Railway, Nos. 360025, were at varying stages of {{construction}} {{by the end of the}} development period. No. 36002 was almost complete, No. 36003 was without its <b>outer</b> <b>casing,</b> and Nos. 360045 were little more than sets of frames, although most of their major components had been constructed at Eastleigh and Brighton and were stored ready for fitting. With no prospect of further money being allocated by the Railway Executive for their completion, the unfinished locomotives were put into store at various depots around the former Southern Railway network pending a decision on their future.|$|E

Icall pioneered the use of {{plastics}} in hairdressing equipment, specifically a thermosetting plastic, (Bakelite) which was used {{not only because of}} its electrical properties in the windings of motors and heaters, but in the outer coverings of the heaters. They were less affected by corrosion and were less likely to burn the fingers of the hairdresser. Icall also used Bakelite for the <b>outer</b> <b>casings</b> of hand-held hair-dryers and also for the large linings of pedestal hair-dryers.|$|R
5|$|Djedkare {{was buried}} in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare ("Djedkare is perfect"), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> during antiquity. The burial chamber still held Djedkare's mummy when it was {{excavated}} in the 1940s. Examinations of the mummy revealed that he died in his fifties. Following his death, Djedkare was {{the object of a}} cult that lasted at least {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom. He seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-Sixth Dynasty, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom period (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also remembered by the Ancient Egyptians as the king of vizier Ptahhotep, the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature.|$|E

The SD card slot is also new, set behind a cover on the right side. While the DS Lite used a switch, the DSi, like the original Nintendo DS, features a button to power on or off. The button has extra functions and unlike the original's power button, it {{is located on the}} bottom-left side of the touchscreen. Brightness and volume controls are on the left side; five brightness settings—one more than on the DS Lite—are available. The headset port is on the bottom.|$|E
5|$|On Edward's {{death in}} 1648, Anthony Hungerford, his half-brother, {{inherited}} the castle. The north chapel was extensively renovated {{during this period}} by Edward's widow, Margaret Hungerford, who covered the walls with pictures of saints, cherubs, clouds, ribbons, crowns and heraldry, {{as part of an}} elaborate tomb for her and Edward which cost £1,100 (£136,000 in 2009 terms). The renovation effectively blocked most of the access into the north chapel, making the new tomb the focus of attention for any visitor or religious activity. A number of lead, anthropomorphic coffins, some with moulded faces or death masks, were laid down in the crypt in the mid- to late-17th century. Four men, two women and two children were embalmed in the castle in this way, probably including Edward and Margaret, as well as the final Sir Edward Hungerford, his wife, son and daughter-in-law. Such lead coffins were extremely expensive during the period and reserved for the wealthiest in society. Originally the lead coffins would have been encased in wood, but this <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> has since been lost.|$|E
50|$|On 20 and 21 March, {{investigators}} from Russia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and France, extracted the memory modules from their protective casings and downloaded {{the data from}} both the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Both recorders functioned normally until the time of impact. While their <b>outer</b> <b>casings</b> sustained some damage, the quality of both recordings was good. A transcript of the communication between the Captain and First Officer was prepared, as the data was analyzed. They also began synchronizing information from the flight recorders, ATC data and meteorological information.|$|R

5|$|The {{remains of}} Ahmose's pyramid in Abydos were {{discovered}} in 1899 and identified as his in 1902. Most of its <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> stones had been robbed for use in other building projects over the years, and the mound of rubble upon which it was built has collapsed. However, two rows of intact casing stones were found by Arthur Mace, who estimated its steep slope as about 60 degrees, {{based on the evidence}} of the limestone casing (compare to the less acute 51 degrees of the Great Pyramid of Giza). Adjacent to the main pyramid temple and to its east, Harvey has identified two temples constructed by Ahmose's queen, Ahmose-Nefertary. One of these structures also bears bricks stamped with the name of Chief Treasurer Neferperet, the official responsible for re-opening the stone quarries at el-Ma'asara (Tura) in Ahmose's year 22. A third, larger temple (Temple C) is similar to the pyramid temple in form and scale, but its stamped bricks and details of decoration reinforce that it was a cult place for Ahmose-Nefertary.|$|E

40|$|The {{building}} {{stones of}} ancient Egypt are those relatively soft, plentiful rocks {{used to construct}} most temples, pyramids, and mastaba tombs.

Similarly, building stones were used in other mud-brick structures of ancient Egypt wherever extra strength was needed, such as bases for wood pillars, and lintels, thresholds, and jambs for doors. Limestone and sandstone were the principal building stones employed by the Egyptians, while anhydrite and gypsum were also used along the Red Sea coast. A total of 128 ancient quarries for building stones are known (89 for limestone, 36 for sandstone, and three for gypsum), but there are probably many others still undiscovered or destroyed by modern quarrying...|$|R
25|$|The pyramid {{suffered}} several catastrophic collapses {{in ancient}} and medieval times; medieval Arab writers {{described it as}} having seven steps – although today only the three uppermost of these remain, giving the structure its odd, tower-like appearance. The hill on which the pyramid is situated is not a natural landscape feature – it is the small mountain of debris created when the lower courses and <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> of the pyramid gave way.|$|E
25|$|A gyrocompass, {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> of the gyrocompass device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in as little as a quarter of an hour.|$|E
25|$|A prepupal {{stage is}} often present and {{characterized}} by larval dispersion and migration {{away from the}} food source {{in search of a}} pupation site. The body length of the larva decreases during this stage in preparation for pupation. If the larvae are restricted from movement and not allowed to disperse during the prepupal stage, a 24-hour delay in pupation will be observed. Thus, in medicocriminal investigations, if a corpse is wrapped and causes restriction of maggot migration, altered developmental times should be considered. The prepupal stage takes 1.5 days and the pupal stage takes 3 days at a temperature of 29°C. Pupation usually occurs near the soil surface or near decaying flesh, and the skin of the larvae hardens to form a dark brown puparium or <b>outer</b> <b>casing.</b> Adults emerge after pupation and mate 3–7 days after emergence in summer, and 910 days after emergence in autumn. Adults are capable of living for 2330 days, and oviposition occurs about 5 days after mating.|$|E

25|$|The Woolnough {{design was}} used by Sentinel for their larger railway locomotives. It resembled most other three-drum designs, having almost-straight tubes. Its {{distinguishing}} feature was a firebrick wall {{two-thirds of the way}} down the furnace. The furnace grate was on the longer side of this, with the combustion gases passing out through the tube bank, along inside a steel <b>outer</b> <b>casing,</b> then back within the shorter tube bank. Coiled tube superheaters were placed in the gas flow outside the tubes. The combustion gases thus passed through the tube bank twice, once outwards and then again inwards. A single central chimney exhausted from the centre of the far end, not as usual from outside the tubes. The relative temperature difference between gas passage through the two sections of the bank led to a circulation current that was upwards through the first, hotter, part of the bank and downwards through the further, less hot, bank. Circulation was also controlled by an internal weir plate within the upper water drum, so as to keep a depth of water above the ends of the hotter tubes, thus avoiding overheating of dry tubes.|$|E

In the summer the air is taken in through outside air intakes and passed through screen filters; in the winter the air is partially recirculated. Heating is provided by electric heating under the bench seats (intermediate trailers and power cars usually have 20 furnaces, driving trailers 14). Each furnace uses 1 kW of power; the voltage feed is 750 V (from the traction power supply), so the furnaces are mounted in electrically grounded <b>outer</b> <b>casings</b> for safety (2 furnaces in each casing).
