5|$|Historically, Ashland {{has been}} {{something}} of a political outlier in southwest Oregon. In the presidential election of 1860, Ashland favored Abraham Lincoln while its neighbors strongly preferred pro-slavery candidates. In the early 1900s, Ashland voters supported women's suffrage and prohibition, generally out <b>of</b> <b>step</b> {{with the rest of the}} region. In more recent elections, liberal Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed by voters elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties.

40|$|Abstract: Stepped spillways are {{hydraulic}} structures that, {{because of}} their significant capacity in energy dissipation, {{have been widely used}} by designers. Flow mechanism over them is complex and many investigations have been performed to study that mechanism. The effect of some parameters such as the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> in energy dissipation has not been fully investigated. In this study the latest design criteria have been reviewed and then an algorithm has been developed to design the stepped spillways which are based on the effect <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>steps.</b> Results show that the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> affects the energy dissipation. With increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> energy dissipation increases and then decreases. Thus for specific discharge and spillway slope, the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> can be optimized for maximum energy dissipation. By reducing design discharge the optimum number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> increases. Research work on this subject can be continued in the future and various aspects of the design parameters may be investigate...|$|R

The findings further examined whether the results support a social ecological model with the relationships between distance, depth, the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> and interaction, and moderate variables (personal, environmental, and organizational factors). Findings indicated that the number <b>of</b> <b>steps,</b> as a function of human behavior, was affected by distance and depth (as environmental factors), age and years of working (as personal factors), and work hours (as an organizational factor) ...|$|R

With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness <b>of</b> <b>step,</b> Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team.

5|$|In 1926, Rix Nicholas {{returned}} to Australia, and in 1928 she married Edgar Wright, {{whom she had}} met during her travels in the early 1920s. The couple settled at Delegate, New South Wales; their only child, a son named Rix Wright, was born in 1930. Though she continued to paint significant works including The Summer House and The Fair Musterer, Rix Nicholas, a staunch critic of modernism who was disdainful {{of the works of}} emerging major artists such as Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, grew out <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with trends in Australian art. Her pictures remained didactic, portraying an Australian pastoral ideal, and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven. She held her last solo show in 1947. Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961. Her works are held in most major Australian collections, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, Australian War Memorial, National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Queensland Art Gallery.|$|E

40|$|Background. Carrying out whole tasks {{is often}} too {{difficult}} for novice learners attempting to acquire complex skills. The common solution is to split up the tasks into a number <b>of</b> smaller <b>steps.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> must be optimised for efficient and effective learning. Aim. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate the relation between the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> provided to learners and the quality of their learning of complex skills. It is hypothesized that students receiving an optimised number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> will learn better than those receiving either the whole task in only one step or those receiving a large number <b>of</b> <b>steps.</b> Sample. Thirty-five sophomore law students studying at Dutch universities, mean age = 22. 8 years (SD = 3. 5), with 63 per cent females. Method. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three computer-delivered versions of a multimedia program on how to prepare and carry out a law plea. The versions differed only in the number <b>of</b> learning <b>steps</b> provided. Videotaped plea-performance results were determined, various related learning measures were acquired and all computer-actions were logged and analysed. Results. Participants exposed to an intermediate (i. e., optimised) number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> outperformed all others on the compulsory learning task. No differences in performance on a transfer task were found. A high number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> proved to be less efficient for carrying out the learning task. Conclusions. An intermediate number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> is the most effective, proving that the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> can be optimised for improving learning...|$|R

5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far out <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with the astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine which randomly assigned noncontingent intervention (walking independently, with a coactor, or to preferred music) could improve self-determination of adults with Down syndrome by increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> during a walking exercise class. Participants were 10 adults who were diagnosed with Down syndrome between 24 to 52 years of age. Data were visually analyzed to determine if the participants increased the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> taken measured with a pedometer. Based on this visual analysis, there were individual differences among each of the participants between baseline and each of the three interventions. Five of the participants increased the mean number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> walking with a coactor compared to baseline. One participant had the highest mean number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> walking during baseline. Further, three participants increased the average number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> during the intervention of listening to prefened fast tempo music compared to baseline. In addition, one participant had the highest mean number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> walking independently. A Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the differences on the average number <b>of</b> <b>steps.</b> Results revealed a significant repeated measures effect, [F(3, 91) = 6. 03,p <. 01], indicating that that {{there was a significant difference}} in the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> walked between baseline and the three intervention types for the group. A pairwise comparison for the group revealed that that the interventions all had a greater number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> than baseline (p <. 05). Maintenance session occurred on two occasions in the same setting. The mean of the maintenance sessions across the participants was similar to the baseline and independent phases, but lower than the coactor or music phases. One generalization session occurred outdoors. Generalization scores were similar compared to the baseline and lower than the interventions. It was concluded that noncontingent interventions can improve self-determination towards exercise experience for adults with Down syndrome. However, they may not be effective in maintaining or generalizing the mean number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> once the intervention is removed. French, Ron Dr. Nichols, David Dr. Kinnison, Lloyd Dr...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether pedometers {{can be used}} to measure physical activity in dogs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS: 26 dogs. PROCEDURE: To determine pedometer accuracy, number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> recorded with the pedometer as dogs walked, trotted, and ran for a distance of approximately 30 m (100 ft) at each gait was compared with actual number <b>of</b> <b>steps.</b> Dogs and owners then wore pedometers for 7 to 14 days, and dog pedometer output was compared with body condition score, owner-reported activity of the dog, and owner pedometer output. RESULTS: Most owners classified their dogs as active or quite active and indicated that their dogs exercised 3 to 7 days/wk. For all dogs, body condition score was 5, 6, or 7 on a scale from 1 to 9. At a walk, pedometers overestimated actual number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> by approximately 17 % in large and medium dogs and underestimated actual number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> by approximately 7 % in small dogs. No significant differences between pedometer-recorded and actual number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> were detected when dogs trotted or ran. Number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> per day for the dogs was significantly correlated with owner-reported activity of the dog (r = 0. 305) and number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> per day for the owners (r = 0. 469) and was inversely correlated with body condition score (r = - 0. 554). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that pedometers can measure physical activity in dogs with reasonable accuracy. A lower number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> per day was associated with a higher body condition score, and less active owners generally had less active dogs...|$|R

40|$|Advisor: David S. SenchinaBackground: When {{performing}} a second task, normal gait parameters are altered {{as compared to}} normal walking. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effects of {{performing a}} task on gait parameters including number <b>of</b> <b>steps,</b> step width, step length, and stride length. Hypotheses: It was predicted that walking at a fast-pace would decrease number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> and step width while increasing stride length and step length. Carrying 15 % of the subjects body weight would increase number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> and step width while decreasing stride length and step length. Performing mental math would increase number <b>of</b> <b>steps,</b> step width would deviate from normal, and step length and stride length would decrease. Methods: Nine male and female students ages 19 - 26 participated in the study. Six conditions during walking were performed by each subject for a total of 18 7 -m trials. Measurements were taken including number <b>of</b> <b>steps,</b> step width, step length, and stride length. Ttests were performed to statistically analyze the data. Results: There was a statistically significant difference found between normal walking and fast-paced walking in number <b>of</b> <b>steps,</b> step length, and stride length, but not step width. No other statistically significant data was found. Conclusions: Gait is not significantly altered when performing a second task, with the exception of fast-paced walking.
