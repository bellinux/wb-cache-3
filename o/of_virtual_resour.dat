Sense <b>of</b> <b>Virtual</b> Community, and Virtual Community Origin Computer-mediated community environments need commitment of their members just like the traditional environment, {{based on the fact}} that we understand virtual community to be “a community extended via emerging technologies. ” Among the four elements (membership, influence, integration, and emotional connection) that McMillan & Chavis [1986] regarded as the components of sense of community, membership and influence are considered as common perception factors in both the virtual and traditional communities. Reflecting the unique characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>virtual</b> space, we introduce a new dimension of immersion, using an expanded concept of flow [Csikszentimihalyi, 1975; Hoffman & Novak, 1996]. Thus, sense <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> community is treated as having three dimensions: (1) membership−people experience feelings of belonging to their virtual community, (2) influence−people influence other members or their community, and (3) immersion−people feel the state <b>of</b> flow during <b>virtual</b> community navigation.

NDDE is novel {{in the sense}} that it allows for safe and ontinuous use of idle y les.

Besides safe and ontinuous y le exploitation, this approa h enables NDDE appli ations to run on an operating system other than that used intera tively. Our preliminary results suggest that NDDE an in fa t harvests most of the idle y les and has almost no impa t on the intera tive user. Key words. Grid Computing, Virtual Ma hines, Idle Cy les. 1.

Modern desktop omputers and workstations have powerful omputational apabilities that are used primarily to provide short response times to the user's daily a tivities like word pro essing, spreadsheet al ulations or web page rendering. Most of the time, however, this pro essing power is idle, waiting for o asional user inputs or requests. During this unused periods that an range from fra tions of a se ond (e. g. between user keystrokes) to hours, the operating system normally exe utes an "idle " pro ess, whi h is a dummy pro ess with the lowest priority on the system, so it runs only when there is no other pro ess or servi e needing to be exe uted.
