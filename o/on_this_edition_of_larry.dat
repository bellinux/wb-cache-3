Specifically, da Vinci realized that the circle and square that outline the limits of the man’s limbs {{do not have the same}} center: the center of the circle is the man’s navel, while the center of the square is somewhat lower. Here, the Vitruvian man stretches his arms to find the extent of his reach, just as NATO today is debating the extent of its mission. His arms reach in many directions, representing the many directions NATO has taken in its various operations around the world. The rays of the NATO star radiate from the center of the man, as the shared goals of the Alliance radiate from a shared history. Even so, the man does not occupy the center of the world; rather, he is a small part of a bigger world, to which he extends his hand...|$|R

2500|$|Commenting <b>on</b> <b>this</b> first <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> The United Irishman, Lord Stanley in the House of Lords, on 24 February 1848, {{maintained}} that the paper pursued [...] "the purpose of exciting sedition and rebellion among her Majesty's subjects in Ireland... it is language used in no common way, {{and for this reason}} I have called the attention of her Majesty's Government to it. This is not a mere casual article in a newspaper—it is the declaration of the aim and object for which it is established, and of the design with which its promoters have set out; that object being {{to do everything possible to}} drive the people of Ireland to sedition, to urge them into open rebellion, and to promote civil war for the purpose of exterminating every Englishman in Ireland. I hope, my Lords, her Majesty's Government will not say that this is a matter quite in theory—that it is below contempt, and that we should allow it to pass by in silence. If such a publication had appeared in England, I should have been very much inclined to think the good sense and sound judgment of the people would have rejected the article at once as a seditious invective, whose very violence, like an overdose of poison, prevented its effect.|$|R

40|$|Welcome to the {{combined}} Spring/Summer NCNM Review! Regular readers will notice {{that we have}} made some changes during 2008. As a result of the communications survey conducted at the end of 2007, we have decided to publish the Review twice a year from now on – June and October during 2008 and March and September from 2009 onwards. A more detailed report on the communications survey is contained in <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the Review – {{thanks to all of you}} who took part. The survey provided a very solid endorsement of the editorial policy being followed in the Review – the content is directly related to your stated preferences. Since our last Review, 24 additional ANP posts have been approved. One existing ANP, Olivia Smith, ANP (Emergency), St James' Hospital, has been re-accredited after five years service, and six new ANPs have been accredited. Congratulations to all of you. It is clear from our work that there continues to be a great demand within the services for the work of the ANPs and CNSs to work alongside staff nurses and midwives in developing and delivering innovative nursing and midwifery practice to patients and clients. As part of our policy to keep our procedures and practices for the establishment and accreditation of ANP posts at the leading edge of best practice, two key documents on these topics have been updated and are reported <b>on</b> in <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the Review. <b>This</b> is enhanced by the work of professional development activity at the front line of service, as evidenced by the report from Ann Kelleher of Kerry General Hospital on the use of an evidence base for the development of ANP services...|$|R

40|$|This Issue—Following the Money: Spending <b>on</b> anti-trafficking <b>This</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the Anti-Trafficking Review explores {{what happens}} to the money that is {{allocated}} by governments and private donors to stop human trafficking and to assist people who have been trafficked. It has been an honour {{to play the role of}} guest editor, though it has not been easy to steer a route between amazement (at the sums apparently involved), concern (at the lack of real insight into how money is allocated and spent) and cynicism (at what appear to be rather modest achievements). It was challenging for potential authors to choose a method of analysing anti-trafficking spending. Should they simply describe what money is available and the drawbacks of the ways which donors make it available to organisations to use? Some authors take this descriptive approach. Should articles be about the efficiency and effectiveness of aid flows in general, in which case the shortcomings in anti-trafficking funding may mirror the generic flaws in aid flows? Only one author (Ucnikova) has tackled this. Or, should studies focus on the way the purse strings are controlled by a small number of donors who appear poorly informed about the needs of trafficked persons or the factors that cause them to be trafficked? Several of the articles touch <b>on</b> <b>this</b> (e. g. those of Hoff and Nwogu). Early on, it became apparent to the editorial team that people working for large organisations with anti-trafficking programmes were wary of contributing articles <b>on</b> <b>this</b> topic. In this sense, although the Anti-Trafficking Review aims to promote public debate, we have not yet found the best way of opening up a debate about funding, for practitioners evidently fear that writing about their own sources of funding could result in the tap being turned off! So, it is mainly the Debate section that tackles the question of funding strategies. Even these contributions do not make assessments of the various actors involved (donors and the organisations they fund) in as full and frank a way as is needed. The articles in <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> represent a start on the topic of anti-trafficking funding, but a great deal remains to be explored...|$|R
