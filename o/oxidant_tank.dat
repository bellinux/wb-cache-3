5000|$|The {{test vehicle}} was a 3/10-scale {{model of the}} Miles E.24/43 design except for the {{omission}} of the distinctive annular air intake of the full-scale aircraft. To maintain {{the center of gravity}} (c.g.) it was necessary to include a large balance weight (a!most 1/10 of total all-up weight) in the foremost section of the nose. The layout was further restricted by the need to maintain a constant c.g. position during the consumption of the fuels. This was achieved by placing a small tank ahead of the wing holding one third of the total oxidant (as well as the fuel in the shaped nose tank) and locating the main <b>oxidant</b> <b>tank</b> aft of tile wing. Other large components were placed fore and aft of the wing. In the space below and above the wing centre section were located the air, fuel, oxidant and warm-air pipes, telemetering transmitter, instruments and batteries as well as the autopilot, timing clock, wiring terminal fuses and the connections by which the test vehicle was carried on the parent aircraft. The rear section housed the combustion chamber, radar transponder, smoke-producing fluid, instruments and oscillators for combustion chamber pressure and tailplane angle, servos and dive mechanism for the tailplane which together with the fixed directional fin were fitted to the lower body prior. The single-piece wing was of mahogany with Dural inserts at the leading and trailing edges; it was of biconvex section and of tapered planform with an unswept half-chord line. The Dural inserts formed a convenient dipole-aerial system for the telemetering unit. (A similar arrangement on the tailplane served the radar transponder.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Hwasong-7 {{also called}} the Scud-ER (extended range), is {{essentially}} a North Korean modification of the Hwasong-6 that exchanges payload for greater range; estimates range from 700-800 km {{to as much as}} 995 km through a reduced payload of 450-500 kg and enlarging the fuel and <b>oxidant</b> <b>tanks</b> along with a slight enlargement of the fuselage. The missile is single-stage and road mobile employing an HE, submunition, chemical, or potentially miniaturized nuclear warhead with a CEP of 3 km. Its range allows the North Korean military to strike anywhere on the peninsula and threaten areas of Japan.|$|R
40|$|This project {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of reliable theoretical and efficient computational descriptions of the chemistry of high-level waste simulants in highly concentrated solution and the experimental validation of this approach. It is an extension of previous work which: (a) Determined the mechanism of H{sub 2 } formation in waste simulants allowing quantitative prediction of H{sub 2 } generation in nuclear waste storage tanks; (b) Predicted and confirmed NO{sub 2 } as a key <b>oxidant</b> in the <b>tanks</b> (c) Determined relative rates of reaction of NO{sub 2 } with chelators thus helping to resolve the ''Organic Tanks'' safety issue; (d) Measured rates of NO{sub 2 } and NO{sub 2 }{sup -} with some model organic radicals; (e) Quantified the redox potentials of two major reductants, NO{sub 2 }{sup -} and NO{sub 3 }{sup -}; (f) Discovered a new radiolytic route to the reductant NO{sub 3 }{sup 2 -} and demonstrated its potential persistence in irradiated alkaline aqueous media; (g) Demonstrated that while radiolytic electrons escape from solid suspended silica particles to disrupt the surroundings, holes remain trapped thus storing oxidative equivalents...|$|R
