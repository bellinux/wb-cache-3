40|$|After {{many decades}} during which {{mainstream}} economic theorists posited that Central Banks either did, or certainly should, fix the monetary base, with <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> being subsequently determined endogenously (the famous IS/LM diagram), realism has finally triumphed (Bindseil 2004, Goodhart 2002). It is now accepted that, {{not only do}} Central Banks set <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> (which {{would be hard to}} deny given the publicity surrounding the meetings of FOMC, MPC in UK, ECB, BoJ for just that purpose), but that such procedures can be (nearly) optimal so long as Central Banks adjust <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> appropriately and endogenously in response to foreseen developments in the economy (Woodford 2003). Most empirical research on the question of how Central Banks actually do, and also should, set <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> have been based on (what have become known as) Taylor-type reaction functions, whereby the Central Bank adjusts its <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> in response to current deviations of inflation from target and of output from its estimated equilibrium, i. e. the output gap, (Taylor 1993, 1999).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature of}} competition in the Spanish banking industry during the years before and after Spain joined the European Monetary Union (EMU). The paper models competition in a product-differentiated market where banks choose {{from a list of}} price (<b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> of loans and deposits) and non-price variables (branches, advertising, IT capital). The empirically estimated demand and cost functions are used to simulate the values of the endogenous variables of the representative bank in response to the historically low <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> of the post Euro period. The results show {{that there has been a}} convergence in the levels of price competition in the loans and deposits markets during the post Euro period. Additionally, the paper finds that branches have lost weight in the mix of competition variables in benefit of advertising and IT capital. This is interpreted as evidence that traditional proximity banking is evolving towards distant banking. Finally, the simulation results highlight the high imbalances between loans and deposits for the representative bank in the regime of low <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> of the Euro zone. banking competition, product differentiation, intangibles, simulation...|$|R

The only exception to this net benefit rule is when someone refinances to a fixed rate mortgage from an adjustable rate mortgage. In that case, the new interest rate may actually be higher than the ARM interest rate.|$|E
5000|$|A {{credit crunch}} (also {{known as a}} credit squeeze or credit crisis) is a sudden {{reduction}} in the general availability of loans (or credit) or a sudden tightening of the conditions required to obtain a loan from banks. [...] A credit crunch generally involves {{a reduction in the}} availability of credit independent of a rise in official interest rates. In such situations, the relationship between credit availability and interest rates has implicitly changed, such that either credit becomes less available at any given <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> or there ceases to be a clear relationship between interest rates and credit availability (i.e. credit rationing occurs). Many times, a credit crunch is accompanied by a flight to quality by lenders and investors, as they seek less risky investments (often at the expense of small to medium size enterprises).|$|E

This drew strong criticism from The Daily Telegraph. [...] As the Global financial crisis of 2008-2009 progressed, Stevens announced large {{cuts to the}} official rate. By the end of 2008, the Reserve Bank board, chaired by Stevens, had cut interest rates a total of 300 basis points, returning them to mid-2002 levels. By August 2013, interest rates had been cut to 2.5%, with the RBA monthly meeting minutes citing domestic economic growth below long term trends, the relatively high value of the Australian dollar, and the [...] "subdued" [...] labour market as the justification for the historically low official interest rates. In May 2016 the RBA lowered the cash rate to 1.75%. The RBA stated that inflation has been unexpectedly low, due to low growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world; which justified lowering the cash rate to historically low levels.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the â€œpass-throughâ€ from interbank {{interest}} rate to market interest rates in domestic currency, and its relationship to Peruvian monetary policy during the period 1995 and 2004. Using an asymmetric and non-linear error correction model, the following hypotheses were tested: (a) the long-run passthrough is not complete; however, it has been raising since the announcement of the <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> â€œcorridorâ€ and has been reinforced with the adoption of the â€œinflation targetingâ€ regime; (b) the market interest rates’ speed of adjustment has increased since the announcement of the <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> â€œcorridorâ€; and (c) in the short-run, market interest rates respond asymmetrically when the interbank interest rate increases or decreases. The results favor the proposed hypotheses and suggest that monetary policy in Peru has shown a favorable evolution in terms of its impact on market interest rates, since the announcement of the <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> â€œcorridorâ€ and the adoption of the â€œinflation targetingâ€ regime. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of direct inflation targeting (DIT) on monetary policy credibility in the Czech Republic, as evidenced by asset prices. It examines the effect {{of changes in the}} two-week repo rate (the <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate)</b> on short and long–term market interest rates. It assumes the asymmetry of information and the existence of a stationary stochastic equilibrium with full knowledge of authorities reaction function. We find that at short maturities, the coefficients for changes in the official repo rate are lower in the DIT period than in the pre-crisis period. This implies that the hypothesis of no increase in the transparency of monetary policy with the introduction of DIT can be rejected. We find that bond yields and interest rate swap rates with maturities of 5 years and longer did not react significantly to <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> decisions in the DIT period. This is consistent with the hypothesis that monetary policy was credible both before and after introduction of DIT.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical importance of parameter uncertainty for monetary policy-making in the United Kingdom, using a method pioneered by Brian Sack of the US Federal Reserve. Using a VAR {{model of the}} UK economy and an assumed quadratic loss function for the policy-maker, an optimal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> rule is calculated first ignoring parameter uncertainty, then assuming that the parameter uncertainty is given by the estimated standard errors on the VAR coefficients. These rules are compared with the estimated <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> equation from the VAR. The optimal rule accounting for parameter uncertainty results in a less aggressive path for <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> than when parameter uncertainty is ignored.

40|$|A {{monetary}} economy comprises a {{vast array}} of market-clearing interest rates. Central banks exert a direct influence over only a narrow subset of these rates: the rate at which they supply marginal funds to the commercial banking system. Accordingly, the market interest rates which impinge upon real activity are typically distinct form - though not independent of - the <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> This paper develops a formal model of the interactions between the central bank, commercial banks and the non-bank private sector. This model is then used to analyse the relationship between the <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and 'other' market rates. Some illustrative evidence on the extent of the imperfection in the UK authorities' interest rate control is also considered. Two policy conclusions emerge. First the authorities must understand the nature of the feed-through of official interest rates into market rates when deciding on the appropriate level of the monetary instrument. Second, the possibility that interest rates may not all move perfectly in line, implies that policy-makers and commentators alike need to be conscious of this plurality of interest rates when assessing the overall tightness or looseness of monetary conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{policy is}} one of the oldest and at the same time most {{controversial}} tools with which central bank affects the economy. In fact, it comes down to the central bank initiated changes in the levels of the so-called <b>official</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> (discount rate, rediscount rate, lombard rate, and others) or influencing the market <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> through open market operations. A frequent paradox which appears in the historical approach to <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> is questioning of the causative role of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> changes introduced by central banks with reference to dynamics of the so-called real sphere as well as frequent use of this stabilization instrument. In the last few decades, several turnabouts occurred in economic policies (especially, monetary policies) of the industrialized countries. Each time, a new interpretation of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> policy was responsible for that [Bednarczyk, 1990, Hubbard, 2002]. One of the trends which appeared in the discussion was an attempt to return to classical roots of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> theory. The concept of the natural <b>rate</b> of <b>interest</b> became the focus of attention. This paper refers to this concept and is an attempt to present the author’s own interpretation of it. The final part of the paper presents a study case of the natural <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> policy of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) in the years 1999 - 2003.
