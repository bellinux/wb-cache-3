40|$|The {{potential}} for using imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) and indoxacarb (an oxadiazine) as grain protectants {{was investigated in}} bioassays against resistant strains of five stored grain beetles. The species investigated were Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (the lesser grain borer), Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (the rice weevil), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (the rust-red flour beetle), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (the saw tooth flour beetle), and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) (the flat grain beetle). Each of these species has developed resistance {{to one or more}} protectants, including organophosphorus insecticides, synthetic pyrethroids and the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene. Mortality and reproduction after a 2 -week exposure of adults to treated wheat depended on species, dose and insecticide. Imidacloprid had no effect on S. oryzae at any dose, but none of the other species produced any live progeny at 10 mg/kg. Indoxacarb had no effect on T. castaneum at any dose, but none of the other species produced any live progeny at 5 mg/kg. The results show that although both imidacloprid and indoxacarb can control at least four of the five key pests tested at doses comparable to those used for organophosphorus protectants, more potent neonicotinoid or <b>oxadiazine</b> <b>insecticides</b> would be needed than either of these to provide broad spectrum protection of stored grain...|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of the <b>oxadiazine</b> <b>insecticide</b> indoxacarb to the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), was evaluated {{in the presence}} and absence of S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF), an inhibitor of hydrolytic metabolism. Bioassays involving topical application of different concentrations of indoxacarb to third instars of a susceptible O. nubilalis laboratory strain were performed, and in vitro metabolism experiments involving [14 C] indoxacarb were examined to determine the role of hydrolytic metabolism in indoxacarb activation. Indoxacarb toxicity decreased {{in the presence of}} DEF indicating antagonism of toxicity. Results of in vivo and in vitro inhibition experiments indicated a reduction of indoxacarb activation and formation of the hydrolytic metabolite.

40|$|Background Universal {{coverage}} with long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets (LLIN) or indoor residual spraying (IRS) {{of houses}} remain the primary {{strategies for the}} control of mosquito vectors of malaria. Pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa and new insecticides with different modes of action are urgently needed if malaria vector control is to remain effective. Indoxacarb is an <b>oxadiazine</b> <b>insecticide</b> that is effective as an oral and contact insecticide against {{a broad spectrum of}} agricultural pests and, due to its unique site of action, no cross-resistance has been detected through mechanisms associated with resistance to insecticides currently used in public health. Methods WHO tunnel tests of host seeking mosquitoes were carried out as a forerunner to experimental hut trials, to provide information on dosage-dependent mortality, repellency, and blood-feeding inhibition. A dosage range of indoxacarb treated netting (100 – 1000 mg/m 2) was tested against a pyrethroid susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae. In addition, efficacy of indoxacarb 500 mg/m 2 was compared with a standard pyrethroid formulation against pyrethroid susceptible and resistant Culex quinquefasciatus. Dosages between 25 and 300 mg/m 2 indoxacarb were tested in tunnel tests and in ball-frame bioassays as mixtures with alphacypermethrin 25 mg/m 2 and were compared with singly applied treatments against an insectary reared pyrethroid resistant strain of Cx. quinquefasciatus originally collected in Cotonou, Benin. Results There was a dosage-dependent response in terms of indoxacarb induced mortality, with dosages > 100 mg/m 2 producing the best mortality response. In tunnel tests indoxacarb 500 mg/m 2 exceeded WHOPES thresholds with > 80...|$|R
40|$|Decarbomethoxyllated JW 062 (DCJW), {{the active}} {{component}} of a new <b>oxadiazine</b> <b>insecticide</b> DPX-JW 062 (Indoxacarb), was tested on action potentials and the inward sodium current recorded from short-term cultured dorsal unpaired median neurones of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Under whole-cell current-clamp conditions, 100 [*]nM DCJW reduced the amplitude of action potentials and induced a large hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential associated with a 41 % increase in input resistance. In voltage-clamp, DCJW resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition (IC 50 28 [*]nM) of the peak sodium current. Based on IC 50 values, the effect of DCJW was about 10 fold less potent than tetrodotoxin (TTX) but 1000 fold more potent than the local anaesthetic lidocaine. DCJW (100 [*]nM) was without effect on activation properties of the sodium current, reversal potential, voltage dependence of sodium conductance and on both fast and slow steady-state inactivations. TTX (2 [*]nM) resulted in 48 % inhibition of the peak inward sodium current. Co-application of TTX (2 [*]nM) with various concentrations of DCJW produced an additional inhibition of the peak inward current, indicating that the blocking actions of DCJW and TTX were distinct. Co-application of lidocaine (IC 50 30 [*]μM) with various concentrations of DCJW produced a reduction of the apparent potency of DCJW, suggesting that DCJW and lidocaine acted at the same site. DCJW (100 [*]nM) did not affect inward calcium or outward potassium currents.

40|$|Decarbomethoxylated JW 062 (DCJW), {{the active}} {{component}} of the <b>oxadiazine</b> <b>insecticide</b> (S) -methyl 7 -chloro- 2, 5 -dihydro- 2 -[[(methoxycarbonyl) [4 -(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl] amino]carbonyl] indeno[1, 2 -e][1, 3, 4]oxadiazine- 4 a(3 H) -carboxylate (DPX-JW 062) (indoxacarb), was tested on 2 inward voltage-dependent sodium currents (named INa 1 and INa 2) expressed in short-term cultured dorsal unpaired median neurons of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Under whole-cell voltage-clamp conditions, application of DCJW resulted in a biphasic dose-dependent inhibition of the global sodium current amplitude illustrating the differing sensitivity of sodium channels to DCJW. INa 2 was less sensitive to DCJW [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 1. 6 microM] compared with INa 1 (IC(50) = 1. 7 nM). Although a previous study demonstrated that INa 1 was regulated by the cAMP/protein kinase A cascade, we showed that INa 2 was mainly regulated in an opposite way by the activation of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2 B (PP 2 B) and calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II). Furthermore, we demonstrated that activation of CaM-kinase II by intracellular calcium via the calcium-calmodulin complex affected the sensitivity of INa 2 channels to DCJW. By increasing the intracellular calcium concentration and/or using 1, 2 -bis(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N 2 ̆ 7,N 2 ̆ 7 -tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) (a calcium chelator), N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro- 1 -naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride (W 7) (a calmodulin inhibitor), cyclosporine A (a PP 2 B inhibitor), and 1 -[N,O-bis(5 -isoquinolinesulfonyl) -N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]- 4 -phenylpiperazine (KN- 62) (a CaM-kinase II inhibitor), we revealed that activation of CaM-kinase II {{was involved in the}} modulation of the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation and that the CaM-kinase II pathway activated by elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration might render INa 2 channels approximately 3000 -fold more sensitive to DCJW. These results indicated that manipulating specific intracellular signaling pathways involved in the regulation of sodium channels might have fundamental consequences for the sensitivity of insects to insecticides.

40|$|The western {{burrowing}} owl, Athene cunicularia hypugaea, is a Federal Species of Concern, whose {{numbers and}} range have been drastically reduced from historic levels in Texas. Burrowing owls roost and forage in agricultural areas, {{and it has}} been hypothesized that exposure to insecticides may be a factor in the decline of their population. Burrowing owls wintering in southern Texas use agricultural culverts in cotton fields as roost sites, which may increase their risk of exposure to agricultural chemicals, either through ingestion of contaminated prey or through dermal exposure to agricultural runoff. Simulation modeling was used to characterize the risks to individual burrowing owls wintering in agricultural landscapes in southern Texas due to effects of exposure to insecticides or other agricultural chemicals. The simulation model was created using Stella? VII software (High Performance Systems, Inc., New Hampshire, USA). The model is broken into four submodels simulating (1) foraging behavior of burrowing owls, (2) chemical applications to crops, (3) chemical transfer and fate in the crop soil and prey items, and (4) chemical exposure in the burrowing owl. This model was used to evaluate (1) which components of the model most affect the endpoints, (2) the relationship between increased concentrations of agricultural chemicals in culverts and subsequent lethal and sublethal effects from dermal exposure to agricultural runoff, and (3) which agricultural chemicals have the greatest potential to cause adverse effects in burrowing owls. Model results suggested (1) the half-lives of agricultural chemicals in birds caused the most variation in the results, and data gaps exist for several important model components (2), exposure to increased concentrations of agricultural chemicals in culverts is unlikely to result in lethal effects, but is likely to lead to sublethal effects in burrowing owls, and (3) the chemicals with the greatest potential to negatively affect burrowing owls wintering in southern Texas are the OP insecticides chlorpyrifos, dicrotophos, and disulfoton, the <b>oxadiazine</b> <b>insecticide</b> indoxacarb, the herbicide trifluralin, and the defoliants tribufos and paraquat. The results of this model demonstrate the usefulness of simulation modeling to guide future research related to the conservation of burrowing owls...|$|R
