5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony palate, {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils {{while the rest of}} the head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|P. xinjiangensis is {{distinguished}} by a prominent jugal 'horn' that is flattened <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end,</b> {{as well as}} some features of the teeth. The ilium, one of the three bones of the pelvis, also bears a characteristically long bony process behind the acetabulum (hip socket). An adult femur has a published length of about 16centimetres (6.3in). P. meileyingensis has the shortest snout and neck frill of any species, making the skull nearly circular in profile. The orbit (eye socket) is roughly triangular, and there is a prominent flange on the lower edge of the dentary, a feature also seen in specimens of P. lujiatunensis, and to a lesser degree in P. mongoliensis, P. sattayaraki, and P. sibiricus. The complete type skull, probably adult, is 13.7centimetres (5.5in) long. The dentary of P. sattayaraki has a flange similar to that found in P. mongoliensis, P. sibiricus, P. lujiatunensis and P. meileyingensis, although it is less pronounced than in those species. The material appears to be roughly the same size as P. sinensis. The frontal bone of P. neimongoliensis is distinctly narrow compared to that of other species, resulting in a narrower skull overall. The ischium bone of the pelvis is also longer than the femur, which differs from other species in which these bones are known. The type specimen has a skull length of 13.2centimetres (5.2in) and a femoral length of 13centimetres (5.1in), but is not fully grown. An adult P. neimongoliensis was probably smaller than P. mongoliensis, with a proportionately longer skull and tail. P. ordosensis can be distinguished by numerous features of the jugals, which have very prominent 'horns'. It is also the smallest known species. One adult skull measures only 9.5centimeters (3.75in) in length.|$|E

From there, since mid September, Kapaun and the division were constantly on the move northward. On October 9, the division crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea and advanced within 50 miles of the Chinese border. His main complaint was lack of sleep for several weeks at a time. He constantly ministered to the dead and dying while performing baptisms, hearing confessions, offering Holy Communion and celebrating Mass from an improvised altar set up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of a jeep. He constantly would lose his Mass kit, jeep, and trailer to enemy fire. He told how he was thoroughly convinced that the prayers of many others were what had saved him so many times.|$|E
500|$|Parliament {{voted to}} fund a {{pedestal}} for the statue, carved from Cornish granite, but transportation delays meant {{that it was not}} until 26 October 1860 that the statue was placed on its pedestal and unveiled to the public. It was completely undecorated at first but a bronze shield was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the pedestal shortly after the installation. The Times (probably its pro-Marochetti reporter Henry Reeve) declared that with the installation of the statue [...] "a great reproach had been removed from London", which now finally had a great equestrian monument which displayed a [...] "combination of life and picturesqueness". It claimed that Marochetti's Richard I ranked [...] "with the few great statues of that class in Europe". Not all critics were as fulsome; the British critic and poet Francis Turner Palgrave castigated it as [...] "an essentially vulgar and low-class work precisely on the grounds that call forth the wonder of uncultivated spectators." [...] It was said to have been particularly appreciated by London's cabbies, who tethered their horses nearby.|$|E

500|$|Ruiz {{permanently}} {{joined the}} Phillies' roster {{on opening day}} 2007, after eight seasons in the minor leagues. He ultimately [...] "grabbed hold of the top job [...] and never let go". The Phillies signed Rod Barajas before the season {{because of concerns about}} Ruiz's ability to catch, hit, and generally hold up over a full season at the major league level, as seasons there are longer than in the minor leagues. During the season, he honed his confidence and earned the trust of the Phillies' pitching staff, including veteran Jamie Moyer, who commented, [...] "I see a real assuredness to his body language. He's not cocky or brash. He just seems very confident in what's going on." [...] On June 26, Ruiz stole home <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of a double steal in an 11–4 home win over the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the first Phillie to steal home since Scott Rolen in 1997.

40|$|Abstract. Facing {{tremendous}} {{and potentially}} infinite stream data, {{it is impossible}} to record them entirely. Thus synopses are required to be generated timely to capture the underlying model for stream management systems. Traditionally, curve fitting through Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a powerful and efficient modeling tool. In order to further accelerate its processing efficiency, we propose Step-by-step Regression (SR) as a more efficient alternative. As revealed in experiments, it speeds up for more than 40 times. In addition, inspired by previous work, we integrated SR into cube environment through similar compression technique to perform online analytical processing and mining over data stream. Finally, experiments show that SR not only significantly alleviates <b>the</b> computation pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> of data stream management systems, but also results in a much smaller stream cube for on line analysis and real-time surveillance. ...|$|R

2500|$|The HK45 {{represents}} an evolutionary {{advancement of the}} Heckler & Koch USP, and shares the same operating principles of that weapon. It {{is available in the}} same ten variants as the USP. The HK45 is a full size model pistol, but significant effort went towards making it more ergonomic than the HK USP full-size chambered in [...]45 ACP by incorporating features found on the Heckler & Koch P2000. These include an extended ambidextrous slide release, a textured ergonomic grip with finger grooves, and interchangeable backstraps to fit differently sized hands. The newer grip and backstraps allow the pistol to sit lower into the web of the hand, contributing to greater control of the weapon and recoil management. In order to accommodate the smaller, more ergonomic grip, the HK45 has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds versus 12 rounds for the USP45. The HK45 also added grip serrations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the slide, a Picatinny rail in front of the trigger guard for mounting accessories, and an O-ring polygonal barrel similar to the USP Expert and Match models and the Mark 23 for more consistent lock-up of the slide and barrel during cycling and increased accuracy.|$|E
