40|$|We {{examine the}} {{crafting}} <b>of</b> <b>publics</b> {{in the global}} Barcoding of Life Initiative (BOLI) —seen as crucial for re invigorating, and democratizing, early-twentyfirst- century taxonomic sciences and hence for actually achieving biodiversity protection. Our approach to the issue <b>of</b> <b>publics</b> differs from that <b>of</b> conventional <b>public</b> understanding <b>of</b> or engagement with science work. Combining science and technology studies with critical political theory allows us to examine the discursive and material formation <b>of</b> <b>publics</b> occurring within the science of DNA barcoding. Co-productionist theory suggests BOLI to be actively crafting its prospective publics imaginatively, {{as an integral part}} of its selfcomposition as public science. Drawing on the work of Laclau’s On Populist Reason, we examine how such normatively weighted abstract publics are necessarily chronically incomplete, with an unavoidable tension between the universal and the particular...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aligned with {{a renewed interest in}} design for opening new possibilities for democracy. This thesis builds on a growing corpus of research investigating the role of design in supporting the formation <b>of</b> <b>publics.</b> In this thesis, the concept <b>of</b> <b>publics</b> is aligned with Dewey’s view, which refers to heterogeneous groups of people concerned about an issue who organize themselves to address it. This thesis aims to contribute to this corpus of research by investigating the following research questions: what design processes can contribute to the formation <b>of</b> <b>publics?</b> and what design interventions can enable these processes? Answers to these questions are constructed by engaging in a practice-based design research of a case study of dyslexia in Trentino, a region in Italy where dyslexia is a controversial issue grounded not only in medical but also societal and political conditions. The main contribution of the thesis is a method to support the formation <b>of</b> <b>publics</b> following a practice-based interaction design approach. This method proposes articulating, representing and reconfiguring as three intertwining and complementing processes that can support the formation <b>of</b> <b>publics.</b> In addition, it proposes that designing interventions on the basis of physical artefacts, digital platforms and events can enable people to act on an issue. Finally, it proposes programs for action as takeaways of design research projects that aim to enable people to act on societal issues...|$|R
