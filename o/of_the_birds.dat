5|$|Salt glands {{are used}} by seabirds {{to deal with the}} salt they ingest by {{drinking}} and feeding (particularly on crustaceans), and to help them osmoregulate. The excretions from these glands (which are positioned in the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>birds,</b> emerging from the nasal cavity) are almost pure sodium chloride.|$|E
5|$|The salt lagoons, {{mangroves}} and samphire wetlands are recognised {{as important}} areas for migratory birds by their coverage under the China-Australia and Japan-Australia migratory bird agreements.

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{subspecies}} have been named, of which 12 were recognised in the Handbook <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> of the World. These subspecies are divided into two groups, the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group, and the Oriental P. d. indicus group. Several Middle Eastern subspecies, including P. d. biblicus, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The subspecies P. d. indicus {{was described as a}} species, and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} is {{a source}} of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law. Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> and their predators, rather than humans. Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon {{suggested}} that Sturnus-like species could have arrived in Africa, and {{given rise to}} the wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy starlings (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>birds.</b> A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.|$|E
50|$|Most scimitar babbler {{species are}} {{referred}} as parandel kurulla by the Sinhala speaking community. The term 'parandel' refers to dried grass and probably refers to <b>the</b> color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> <b>The</b> vernacular name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> parandel kurulla roughly translates to English as 'dried-grass colored bird'.

50|$|The {{documentary}} explores <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elephant <b>bird,</b> {{what led}} to its extinction, and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> conservation in preventing <b>the</b> extinction <b>of</b> critically endangered species. <b>The</b> extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elephant <b>bird</b> is attributed to human activity. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> were once widespread, but deforestation and <b>the</b> hunting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird's</b> eggs led to the species' decline. Attenborough compares the factors that led to <b>the</b> extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elephant <b>bird</b> with <b>the</b> threats facing critically endangered species in the present.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, Pamela C. Rasmussen {{granted the}} taxon {{autonomous}} status in her book, Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide, uncoupling the species from S. leucopsis. The classification was noted by ornithologists Nigel J. Collar and John D. Pilgrim in 2007, and {{endorsed by the}} International Ornithological Congress, by Alan P. Peterson in his well-known Zoological Nomenclature Resource (Zoonomen), and by the Internet Bird Collection (IBC), sponsored by the Handbook <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> of the World. No subspecies of S. przewalskii itself have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Leicestershire and Rutland are {{landlocked}} lowland {{counties and}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> {{are typical of}} English farmland habitat. Many coastal, oceanic and highland birds are absent or rare, and there are few rare vagrants compared to coastal areas. The construction of two large reservoirs, Eyebrook Reservoir in 1940 and Rutland Water (England's largest reservoir) in 1976, has provided freshwater environments enabling many aquatic birds to thrive.|$|E
5|$|Swans {{were kept}} by the Bishops of Lichfield on Bishops Fish Pool from the early 14th century. Special pens and nesting areas were constructed. Ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> passed to the Lichfield Corporation from 1548. In 1704 the lease owner of 'Swan Moggs' was {{required}} to allow the swans make their nests there. In this area today we get the street names Swan Road and Swan Mews reflecting {{the history of the}} land use.|$|E

5|$|The American Bird Conservancy {{designated}} Whitefish Point a Globally Important Bird Area. Whitefish Point's {{land and}} water features create a natural corridor that funnels thousands of birds during spring and fall migrations, providing unique opportunities for research, education, and conservation programs. Golden eagles, peregrine falcons, merlins, boreal owls, great gray owls, red-throated loons, red-necked grebes, scoters, and jaegers (also known as skuas) are just some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> {{that can be seen}} during migration.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is known}} to be a rejecter of cowbird eggs, so brood {{parasitism}} by the brown-headed cowbird is rare. Even when it occurs, the parasite's chick does not normally survive to fledging. In a study of 105 juvenile robins, 77.1% were infected with one or more species of endoparasite, with Syngamus species the most commonly encountered, found in 57.1% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} (Sitta europaea) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{found throughout}} temperate Asia and in Europe. There are more than 20 subspecies, but the precise number depends on how small differences between populations are evaluated. This article follows the 2013 Handbook <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> of the World Alive treatment, which has more recognised forms than the 1996 Tits, Nuthatches and Treecreepers. Given the similarities between geographical forms of the Eurasian nuthatch, subspecies boundaries are somewhat fluid, although fewer than half as many are recognised now as in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The Girl {{is based}} on Donald Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, which {{examines}} the relationships between Alfred Hitchcock and the female stars of his films. Spoto wrote that Hitchcock attempted to turn Tippi Hedren (star <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> and Marnie) into his perfect woman, choosing the clothes and lipstick he thought she should wear. Hedren told Spoto that Hitchcock fantasised about running off with her.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.|$|E
