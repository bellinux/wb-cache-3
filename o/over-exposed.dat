25|$|The {{economy of}} the Republic of Ireland {{expanded}} rapidly during the Celtic Tiger years (1995–2007) due to a low corporate tax rate, low ECB interest rates, and other systemic factors (such as soft surveillance of banking supervision including against observance of Basel Core Principles, underdeveloped public financial management and anti-corruption systems and adoption of poor policies including a corporate tax system that fostered non-tradable goods and services through the construction industry). At {{the end of the}} third quarter of 2010, German banks had between US$186.4 billion and $208.3 billion in total exposure to Ireland with $57.8 billion in exposure to Irish banks. This led to an expansion of credit and a property bubble which petered out in 2007.

25|$|A {{few days}} later, on December 7, Webb engaged two hobbyists, Edgar Van Horn and Ernest Howatt, to {{photograph}} the carcass for posterity. At least two photographs were taken, one of the lateral view {{and one of the}} anterior view, showing the apparent arm stumps. The latter also included a man, likely DeWitt Webb himself, for scale. As the images were <b>over-exposed,</b> they were never published. These photographs were for a long time considered lost, and only drawings based on them, made by Alpheus Hyatt Verrill and published in the American Naturalist of April 1897, were known. However, one of the original images, showing the lateral view, was obtained by Gary Mangiacopra in 1994. It is clear that one of Verrill's drawings was based on this photograph. A simplified drawing of this image also appeared in the Hartford Daily Running of February 18, 1897.|$|E

500|$|As a continuation, [...] "Red Dead Redemption elegiac tone knits {{incredibly}} {{well with}} [...] arch Gothic horror", wrote Dan Whitehead (Eurogamer). Critics found the expansion's story {{to be much}} more lighthearted in comparison to the main game, with a different overall feel. IGN marked the title's exaggerated theatricality and overtones of horror B movie panache. At the time, zombies were a recurring motif in video games. Whitehead added that Rockstar's ability to use the [...] "most played-out and <b>over-exposed</b> cultural meme" [...] in their [...] "epic Western" [...] without the product appearing silly or gimmicky was a testament to their design acumen. For instance, a talk with Sasquatch was both absurd and poignant. The expansion's script, he wrote, understood the spirit of its characters and balanced sardonicism and honest pathos. Whitehead felt that its nuanced treatment of Marston made him [...] "one of gaming's great characters". On the other hand, Whitehead considered the expansion's mission design lackluster and complained of too many quests in which the player fetches items for other people and traveling between points only to initiate cutscenes. GameSpot praised the story's humor but felt that it was less interesting and varied compared to the main game. Reviewers recommended finishing the base game before starting the downloadable content, not for spoilers but {{to make the most of}} the game's references to the original story.|$|E
500|$|Captain Jack {{has gone}} on to become a {{recognisable}} figure in the British public consciousness, and has attracted some parody. These parodies frequently echo criticisms both of the character and of Barrowman's portrayal. The character of Jack Harkness has been parodied several times on the satirical impressionist television show Dead Ringers. Played by Jon Culshaw, the show pokes fun at his bisexuality and apparent campness, as well his melodramatic personality in Torchwood. In one sketch, he walks bizarrely towards the camera, kissing a policeman as he passes him. In another sketch, he can be seen having a threesome with two Cybermen, a race of cyborgs from Doctor Who. Satirical technology columnist Verity Stob wrote a parody of Torchwood Season One in the style of Dylan Thomas's radio play Under Milk Wood, called Under Torch Wood. This parody described Captain Jack as [...] "the insomniac bicon; snug as a hobbit, pretty as a choirboy, immortal as carbon dioxide, wooden as a horse." [...] Barrowman's ubiquity, however, has even provoked criticism of the character. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror, in his review of Children of Earth, said [...] "Unlike David Tennant's Doctor, Barrowman's endless appearances on friendly drivel like Tonight's the Night, The Kids Are All Right and Any Dream Will Do, is so <b>over-exposed,</b> 'Captain Jack' is about as intriguing or alien as a Weetabix and twice as irritating. Unlike Tennant, as an actor he is just not good enough." [...] Television journalist Charlie Brooker, in his Screenwipe review of 2009 criticised Barrowman, with focus on his acting. [...] "Harkness is of course a man of mystery. You can't tell what he's thinking just by looking at his face... no matter how hard Barrowman tries." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{addition}} of the one-hour Sunday Kommotion special evidently caused some controversy. An unattributed press clipping from the time (reproduced on the Laurie Allan tribute site) indicates that The Go!! Show producers DYT {{were concerned about the}} increased competition from their rival (which also cost less to produce), and the article suggested that this move might oversaturate the pop market and lead to a drop in ratings all round, as well as <b>over-exposing</b> the relatively small pool of Australia's top-ranking pop talent. The latter issue was borne out by Jim Keays' comments in his autobiography, in which he reported that The Masters Apprentices were invited on both shows so regularly that they eventually had to 'ration' their appearances for fear of overexposure.|$|R

Agents {{are assumed to be}} fully rational, strategically sophisticated and forward-looking.

In steady state, in which infection is endemic, there are strategic substitutes. Individuals <b>over-expose</b> themselves to infection, leading to sub-optimally high steady state disease prevalence.

2500|$|George Lucas tried [...] "to get a {{cohesive}} reality" [...] for his feature. However, since {{the film is}} a fairy tale, as he had described, [...] "I still wanted it to have an ethereal quality, yet be well composed and, also, have an alien look." [...] He designed the film to have an [...] "extremely bizarre, Gregg Toland-like surreal look with strange <b>over-exposed</b> colors, a lot of shadows, a lot of hot areas." [...] Lucas wanted Star Wars to embrace the combination of [...] "strange graphics of fantasy" [...] and [...] "the feel of a documentary" [...] to impress a distinct look. To achieve this, he hired the British cinematographer Gilbert Taylor. Originally, Lucas's first choice for the position was Geoffrey Unsworth, who also provided the cinematography for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unsworth was interested in working with the director, and initially accepted the job when it was offered to him by Lucas and Kurtz. However, he eventually withdrew {{to work on the}} Vincente Minnelli-directed A Matter of Time (1976) instead, which [...] "really annoy" [...] Kurtz. Lucas called up for other cinematographers, and eventually chose Taylor, basing his choice on Taylor's cinematography for Dr. Strangelove and A Hard Day's Night (both 1964). On his decision, Lucas said: [...] "I thought they were good, eccentrically photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor".|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} role of the {{financial}} system in the amplification and propagation of business cycles. Chapter 1 studies the origin and propagation of balance sheet recessions. I first show that in standard models driven by TFP shocks, the balance sheet channel disappears when agents are allowed to write contracts on the aggregate state of the economy. In contrast, I show how uncertainty shocks can drive balance sheet recessions with depressed asset prices and growth, and trigger a "flight to quality" event with low interest rates and high risk-premia. Uncertainty shocks create an endogenous hedging motive that induces financial intermediaries to take on a disproportionate fraction of aggregate risk, even when contracts can be written on the aggregate state of the economy. Finally, I explore some implications for financial regulation. Chapter 2 studies a tractable model of dynamic moral hazard with purely pecuniary private benefits. The agent can trade a productive asset and secretly divert funds to a private account and use them to "recontract": at any time he can offer a new continuation contract to the principal, who accepts if the new contract is attractive. The main result is that the optimal contract can be characterized as the solution to a standard portfolio problem with a simple "skin in the game" constraint. The setting places few restrictions on preferences and the distribution of shocks, distinguishes between (observable) aggregate shocks and (unobservable) idiosyncratic shocks, and takes arbitrary general equilibrium prices as given. This makes the results easily applicable to many macro and financial applications. Chapter 3 explores under what conditions the presence of moral hazard can create a balance sheet amplification channel. If the private action of the agent exposes him to aggregate risk through his unobserved private benefit, the optimal contract will try to <b>over-expose</b> him to aggregate risk to deter him from misbehaving. This creates a tradeoff between aggregate and idiosyncratic risk-sharing. More productive agents naturally want to leverage more and therefore have larger incentives to distort their aggregate risk-sharing in order to reduce their exposure to idiosyncratic risk. In equilibrium, therefore, more productive agents take on a disproportionate fraction of aggregate risk, creating a balance sheet channel. by Sebastian T. Di Tella. Thesis (Ph. D.)
