A dowry may have been occasionally overlooked if a bride's family connections were very favorable; Callias reportedly married Elpinice, a daughter of the noble Philaidae, to join that family and was sufficiently wealthy that her lack of a dowry did not concern him.|$|E
25|$|When taking {{food from}} a {{communal}} dish, {{unless they are}} family or very close friends, one should turn the chopsticks around to grab the food; it is considered more sanitary. Alternatively, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a separate set of chopsticks for communal dishes.|$|E

C., and beyond, knew when he looked them in the eye that there was nothing practiced nor obligatory about his interest in what they had to say.|$|E

25|$|Of {{adolescents}} age 11–16, 83% {{believe a}} person is still a virgin after engaging in genital touching, and 70% said they believed one retained their virginity after having oral sex. Additionally, 16% considered themselves virgins after anal sex. However, 44% believed that one was abstinent after genital touching and 33% believed <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> oral sex and still remain abstinent. Of anal and vaginal sex, 14% believed one could engage in the former and 12% said one could participate in the latter while still remaining abstinent.|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{freezing}} point {{of water is}} 0°C and 32°F, and a 5°C change {{is the same as}} a 9°F change. Thus, to convert from units of Fahrenheit to units of Celsius, one subtracts 32°F (the offset from the point of reference), divides by 9°F and multiplies by 5°C (scales by the ratio of units), and adds 0°C (the offset from the point of reference). Reversing this yields the formula for obtaining a quantity in units of Celsius from units of Fahrenheit; <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> started with the equivalence between 100°C and 212°F, though this would yield the same formula at the end.|$|E
25|$|In this manner, {{liability}} for past losses could be transferred {{year after year}} until it reached the current syndicate. A member joining a syndicate {{with a long history}} of such transactions could – and often did – pick up {{liability for}} losses on policies written decades previously. As long as the reserves had been accurately estimated, and the appropriate RITC premium paid every year, then all would have been well, but in many cases this had not been possible. No <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> predicted the surge in APH losses. Therefore, the amounts of money transferred from earlier years by successive RITC premiums to cover these losses were insufficient, and the current members had to pay the shortfall.|$|E

25|$|The {{present form}} of the Maggid Meisharim shows plainly that it was never {{intended}} for publication, being merely a collection of stray notes; nor does Karo's son Judah mention the book among his father's works (Introduction to the Responsa). It is known, on the other hand, that during Karo's lifetime the kabalists believed his Maggid to be actually existent (compare Vital-Calabrese, Sefer ha-Gilgulim, pp.119, 142, Vilna, 1885). The Maggid Meisharim, furthermore, shows a knowledge of Karo's public and private life that no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> possessed after his death; {{and the fact that}} the maggid promises things to its favorite that were never fulfilled—e.g., a martyr's death—proves that it is not the work of a forger, composed for Karo's glorification.|$|E
25|$|The {{similarity}} of the Roman abacus to the Chinese one suggests that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> inspired the other, {{as there is}} some evidence of a trade relationship between the Roman Empire and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the {{similarity of}} the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and Japanese) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system, which was used for traditional Chinese measures of weight.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.|$|E
25|$|The six spoiler {{actuators}} {{were sent}} to the Royal Norwegian Air Force's facility at Kjeller for examination. Radiographic examinations confirmed that they were all in a closed and locked position. A simulation was carried out in a flight simulator to see if, given the conditions, a 146 could land at Sørstokken without operative spoilers. It concluded that this would be possible with a dry runway, but not if it is wet. An extensive investigation of the spoiler system was carried out by Aviation Engineering, who published their findings on 10 May 2011. AIBN quickly started working out from a hypothesis that the spoilers did not deploy and investigated three possible causes: a mechanical failure in the lever, a failure in two thrust lever micro switches, and an open circuit breaker in the lift spoiler system. In the latter it would have been necessary for two of four to fail, although <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> failed without being detected.|$|E

25|$|In his {{capacity}} of archbishop, Chichele remained {{what he had}} always been chiefly, the lawyer and diplomatist. He was present at the siege of Rouen, and the king committed to him personally the negotiations for the surrender of the city in January 1419 and for the marriage of Katherine. He crowned Katherine at Westminster (20 February 1421), and on 6 December baptised her child Henry VI. He was of course a persecutor of heretics. No <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> attained or kept the position of archbishop at the time without being so. So he presided at the trial of John Claydon, Skinner and citizen of London, who after five years imprisonment at various times had made public abjuration before the late archbishop, Arundel, but now was found in possession of a book in English called The Lanterne of Light, which contained the heinous heresy that the principal cause of the persecution of Christians was the illegal retention by priests of the goods of this world, and that archbishops and bishops were the special seats of Antichrist. As a relapsed heretic, he was left to the secular arm by Chichele.|$|E

500|$|Some Confederate congressmen were {{believed}} to oppose Breckinridge because he had waited so long to join the Confederacy, but his nomination was confirmed unanimously on February 6, 1865.

Klotter called Breckinridge [...] "perhaps the most effective of those who held that office", but Harrison wrote that [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done much with the War Department at that late date". While his predecessors had largely served Davis's interests, Breckinridge functioned independently, assigning officers, recommending promotions, and consulting on strategy with Confederate generals.|$|E

500|$|Verdi {{received}} the draft libretto {{a few weeks}} later, by early July 1889, {{at a time when}} his interest had been piqued by reading Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done better than you", he wrote back. Like Boito, Verdi loved and revered Shakespeare. The composer did not speak English, but he owned and frequently re-read Shakespeare's plays in Italian translations by Carlo Rusconi and Giulio Carcano, which he kept by his bedside. He had earlier set operatic adaptations of Shakespeare's Macbeth (in 1847) and Othello (in 1887) and had considered King Lear as a subject; Boito had suggested Antony and Cleopatra.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to the [...] "devious, but doomed" [...] {{characters}} {{was more}} negative than for other Lost characters.

America Online's TV Squad criticized the writing for the characters, and the characters were called [...] "incredibly annoying" [...] by Maclean's magazine. Television Without Pity called Paulo [...] "walking collateral damage". TV Guide wrote they were [...] "too darn perfect-looking to be believable as humans".

500|$|Once the {{pavilion}} was built, the initial plan {{was that the}} lawn seating would be free for all events. An early brochure for the Grant Park Music Festival said [...] "You never need a ticket to attend a concert! The lawn and the general seating section are always admission free." [...] However, when parking revenue fell short of estimates during the first year, the city charged $10 for lawn seating at the August 31, 2005, concert by Tori Amos. Amos, a classically trained musician who chose only piano and organ accompaniment for her concert, earned positive reviews as the inaugural rock and roll performer in a venue that regularly hosts classical music. The city justified the charge by contending that since the Pavilion is an open-air venue, there were many places in Millennium Park, such as the Cloud Gate, Crown Fountain and Lurie Gardens, where <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed the sounds or {{the atmosphere of the}} park without having to pay.|$|E

Batman stands on top of a Gotham building when the Bat-Signal appears in the sky, and swings off into the night to continue his war on crime.|$|E
500|$|Writing for SFScope, Sarah Stegall praised Reddick's {{performance}} as both Colonel Broyles, and Torv's [...] "tour-de-force" [...] {{performance as}} Olivia and her doppelganger. She also noted how strong {{of a show}} Fringe has evolved into, lauding the producers' decision {{to focus on the}} show's [...] "strongest and most innovative plot": the parallel universe. Stegall expressed hope that Fauxlivia's experiences in the prime universe would lead her to challenge Walternate's more militant actions to destroy it. Stegall further recognized the episode's editing, as [...] "a complicated story like this <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been endlessly confusing, with multiple versions of the same character, two extremely similar universes, and plot points reaching back to the first season. Yet the writing and direction kept it all sorted out, without resorting to voice-overs, flashbacks, or other lame expository devices. This is classy, tight writing, and my hat's off to the entire team". Television Without Pity graded the episode an A+,. Noel Murry at The A.V. Club gave it an A- highlighting Torv's performance.|$|E
500|$|The Confederate Congress {{established}} a special committee {{to investigate the}} military losses; Benjamin testified before it. The Secretary of State, Virginia's Robert M. T.

Varina Davis noted that some in Congress had sought Benjamin's ouster [...] "because of reverses which no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> averted, [...] the President promoted him to the State Department with a personal and aggrieved sense of injustice done {{to the man who}} had now become his friend and right hand." [...] Richmond diarist Sallie Ann Brock Putnam wrote, [...] "Mr. Benjamin was not forgiven... this act {{on the part of the}} President , in defiance of public opinion, was considered as unwise, arbitrary, and a reckless risking of [...] his reputation and popularity... was ever afterwards unpopular in the Confederacy, and particularly in Virginia". Despite the promotion, the committee reported that any blame for the defeat at Roanoke Island should attach to Wise's superior, Major General Benjamin Huger, [...] "and the late secretary of war, J.P.
