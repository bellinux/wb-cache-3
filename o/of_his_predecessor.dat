5|$|After {{retiring}} from Congress, Hastert made occasional public appearances on political programs. He also made some endorsements of political candidates; in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, he endorsed Mitt Romney instead <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor</b> as Speaker, Newt Gingrich.|$|E

5|$|Bishop Swinefield was {{concerned}} {{to ensure that}} his clergy were well treated. He worked to ensure that churches within his diocese were not misappropriated through the granting of custody to unworthy candidates, and was vigilant over monastic houses. His main efforts, though, went toward securing the canonisation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor</b> Thomas de Cantilupe. This did not however take place until 1320, after Swinefield's death.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Corzine {{refused to}} release his {{income tax return}} records. He claimed an {{interest}} in doing so, but he cited a confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs. Skeptics argued that Corzine should have followed the example <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor</b> Robert Rubin, who converted his equity stake into debt upon leaving Goldman.|$|E
5|$|Sahure is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important kings of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, his reign being a political and cultural high point of the 5th Dynasty.

5|$|As {{presiding}} {{officer of}} the Senate, Johnson was called on to cast a tie-breaking vote fourteen times, more than all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> save John Adams and John Calhoun. Despite the precedent set by some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors,</b> Johnson never addressed the Senate {{on the occasion of}} a tie-breaking vote; he did once explain his vote via an article in the Kentucky Gazette.|$|R

5|$|Ahidjo {{stepped down}} on 4 November 1982 and left power to his {{constitutional}} successor, Paul Biya. However, Ahidjo remained {{in control of}} the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed coup d'état nudged him toward the leadership style <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amenemhat IV {{may have}} been the son, {{grandson}} or step-son <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor,</b> the powerful Amenemhat III. His reign started with a two-year coregency with Amenemhat III and was seemingly peaceful. He undertook expeditions in the Sinai for turquoise, in Upper Egypt for amethyst and to the Land of Punt. He also maintained trade relations with Byblos as well as the Egyptian presence in Nubia. Amenemhat IV built some parts of the temple of Hathor at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai and constructed the well-preserved temple of Renenutet in Medinet Madi.|$|E

5|$|Amin's {{short-lived}} {{presidency was}} marked by controversies from beginning to end. He came to power by ordering the death <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor</b> Nur Muhammad Taraki. The revolt against communist rule which had begun under Taraki worsened under Amin, and was a problem that his government was unable to solve. The Soviet Union, which alleged that Amin was {{an agent of the}} CIA, intervened in Afghanistan while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated by the Soviets in December 1979 as part of Operation Storm-333, having ruled for slightly longer than three months.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It {{proved to be an}} early dawn for Arsenal, who spent {{most of the rest of}} the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor</b> Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E

The Wuffingas dynasty may have been connected with monastic foundations in the area around Faramoutiers through Anna's predecessor Sigeberht, who had spent several years as an exile in Gaul and had become a devout and learned Christian due to his experiences of monastic life.|$|E

5|$|His {{successes in}} Italy secured Nikephoros a {{friendly}} welcome and honours {{on his return}} to Constantinople, {{but he is not}} mentioned again for several years, until the outbreak of war with Bulgaria in 894.

5|$|In 766 Æthelbert succeeded Ecgbert as archbishop; he was consecrated 24 April 767, {{the feast}} day <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor</b> Wilfrid. This {{may have been}} {{deliberate}} and a sign that Æthelbert wished to revive Wilfrid's ambitions for the archiepiscopal see. Æthelbert received his pallium from Pope Adrian I in 773. Alcuin was appointed head of the cathedral school after Æthelbert became archbishop. Much of Alcuin's description of Æthelbert's time as archbishop has the flavour of a panegyric, as Alcuin praised Æthelbert as a model bishop suitable for other bishops {{to use as a}} role model.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Dannatt gave {{evidence}} to the Iraq Inquiry, focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002. He described an initial reluctance to commit the Army and stated that planning had been for a minimal land commitment {{and the provision of}} naval and air support to the United States. He also repeated his previous assertions that the army had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor</b> as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson.|$|E

5|$|Ine was King of Wessex from 688 to 726. He {{was unable}} to retain the {{territorial}} gains <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor,</b> Cædwalla, who had brought much of southern England under his control and expanded West Saxon territory substantially. By the end of Ine's reign, the kingdoms of Kent, Sussex, and Essex were no longer under West Saxon domination; however, Ine maintained control {{of what is now}} Hampshire, and consolidated and extended Wessex's territory in the western peninsula.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Shepseskare continued {{the construction of the}} funerary complex <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessor.</b> As Neferefre had died after a short reign, his pyramid complex was far from finished and neither the burial chamber nor the mortuary temple had been built. The planned pyramid was thus hastily changed into a square mastaba representing a stylized primeval hill and the accompanying mortuary temple was completed during the reign of Nyuserre.|$|E
