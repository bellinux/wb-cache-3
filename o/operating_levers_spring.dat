5000|$|The <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> {{raises and}} lowers the center plate of the grip, {{which in turn}} {{operates}} the jaws. With the lever fully forward, the grip is open, and the cable is free to fall out (necessary when the cable crosses under another line, {{as well as at}} the ends of lines, and at [...] "let-go" [...] curves). With the cable lifted into the jaws, the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> is pulled back, forcing the jaws between two fixed rollers, and capturing the cable between the grip's replaceable mild-steel dies (but without applying pressure). To start moving the car, the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> is pulled back further, squeezing the cable between the dies.|$|R

50|$|The {{function}} of the breech mechanism is to close the breech, and thereby hold the cartridge case in place. The breechblock is {{the main part of}} the mechanism. It closes the breech and is hinged so that it can be swung open for loading. It is moved by an <b>operating</b> <b>lever.</b> The lever and breechblock are connected by an operating bar, operating in a T-slot in the breechblock carrier. Thus connected, complete motion of the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> to the right will cause the breechblock to rotate and to be swung clear of the breech recess. Swinging the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> fully to the right engages cam surfaces of the breechblock carrier and extractor, causing the extractor to eject the empty cartridge case.|$|R

5000|$|The L.R.5 {{emerged in}} 1945 as a single-engined, wooden, low-wing {{monoplane}} with a fixed tricycle undercarriage, {{powered by a}} [...] Blackburn Cirrus Minor 4-cylinder, air-cooled, inverted, in-line piston aircraft engine. The spacious side-by-side configuration cockpit was covered by a large plexiglas canopy with car-type entry doors on both sides. The undercarriage included <b>levered</b> <b>sprung</b> main legs and a steerable nosewheel.|$|R
50|$|Cable-pull 'V' Brakes {{also use}} the hub or metal discs as a braking surface. The hand <b>operated</b> <b>lever</b> pulls a metal cable to push {{polyurethane}} blocks against the braking surface. Advantages include low cost, low weight, and easy installation and maintenance. Disadvantages include low braking power, {{and the need to}} be regularly adjusted.|$|R

5000|$|The car has a {{top speed}} of 39 mph. [...] There is a {{transmission}} brake fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake <b>lever.</b> <b>Springing</b> is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear of some of the cars. Artillery type wheels were fitted.|$|R
50|$|Screw jacks {{are limited}} in their lifting capacity. Increasing load {{increases}} friction within the screw threads. A fine pitch thread, which would increase {{the advantage of the}} screw, also reduces the size and strength of the threads. Longer <b>operating</b> <b>levers</b> soon reach a point where the lever will simply bend at their inner end.|$|R
50|$|The {{foot pedal}} {{operates}} by rod a transmission brake {{mounted on the}} rear end of the gearbox's second motion shaft. It {{is described as a}} powerful double-acting band brake. The brake's drum is surrounded by a water jacket. The hand <b>lever</b> <b>operated</b> side brakes (on the rear wheels) are also double-acting band brakes. These drums are fixed to the rear wheels. The <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> is inside the car by the right hand of the driver. The system of rods and levers incorporates an equalising arrangement.|$|R
50|$|All road wheels {{as well as}} the easily {{adjusted}} {{steering gear}} and the steering-heads have ball-bearings. There is no mention of suspension or braking systems. The omission of a mention of brakes was remedied in the advertisement displayed below - there was a pedal operated brake on the countershaft and a hand <b>operated</b> <b>lever</b> on internal acting brakes on the back wheels.|$|R
50|$|Sudo became {{well known}} for his {{particularly}} flashy choreographed ring entrances that often included costumed dancers. One entrance featured Sudo doing the robot and <b>operating</b> <b>levers</b> that released a column of smoke {{from the top of}} his head while wearing a Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket as a hat and a white plastic mask, in an homage to the musician Buckethead.|$|R
50|$|Single or {{double ended}} access {{platforms}} are another {{variation of the}} mobile safety steps. As with standard mobile safety steps they have wheels which can be secured by a hand <b>operated</b> <b>lever,</b> but will have a larger platform. This allows for activities like maintenance work on walls, machinery and aircraft. The double ended platform will have two sets of steps with a platform in between.|$|R
50|$|The Cineston's general {{operation}} {{is similar to}} the slide-controllers found in many modern mass transit systems. These controllers can be considered to be a re-implementation of the Cineston, as its fore-aft motion for acceleration and braking is the same. The change in layout is due to the introduction of new electronic controls, which do not require any mechanical connection between the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> and the electrical control systems.|$|R
50|$|The Sanibel-Captiva Optimists Club {{had held}} a raffle for the {{opportunity}} to be the operator of the drawbridge's machinery for its final opening. A private ceremony was held the day after the current bridge opened to commemorate the drawbridge's final opening. Seasonal Sanibel residents Bob and Ana Finks won the raffle, and they also got to keep the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> from the drawbridge's control room as part of the prize.|$|R
50|$|Standardized limit {{switches}} are industrial control components manufactured {{with a variety}} of operator types, including lever, roller plunger, and whisker type. Limit switches may be directly mechanically operated by the motion of the <b>operating</b> <b>lever.</b> A reed switch may be used to indicate proximity of a magnet mounted on some moving part. Proximity switches operate by the disturbance of an electromagnetic field, by capacitance, or by sensing a magnetic field.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} prototype {{developed by}} Browning in early 1889 was a [...]44 caliber black powder cartridge rifle, weighing under 12 pounds. This version placed the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> {{at the front}} of the barrel, and was acted on directly by the muzzle blast. An improved design was offered to Colt in 1892. The lever was moved rearward, and power was supplied by a gas port about six inches (15 cm) back from the muzzle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Peabody rifles, {{manufactured by}} the Providence Tool Company, used a manually cocked side-hammer. Swiss gunsmith Friedrich Martini devised {{an action that}} resembled the Peabody but incorporated a hammerless striker cocked by the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> with the same motion that pivoted the block. The 1871 Martini-Henry which replaced the [...] "trapdoor" [...] Snider-Enfield was the standard British Army rifle of the later Victorian era, and the Martini was also a popular action for civilian rifles.|$|R
5000|$|The gun was {{originally}} chambered in 6mm Lee Navy and later, after {{the adoption of}} the Krag-Jørgensen rifle, in [...]30-40 Krag, 7×57mm Mauser caliber (the same cartridge used in the Spanish Model 1893 Mauser), and [...]30-06 Springfield in 1914. The 1914 version also included a lower tripod for firing prone; this is likely what led to the gun's nickname of [...] "potato digger", as the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> would dig into the ground if it were fired from too low a position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Peabody rifles, {{manufactured by}} the Providence Tool Company, used a manually cocked side-hammer. Swiss gunsmith Friedrich Martini developed a pivoting block action by modifying the Peabody, that incorporated a hammerless striker which was cocked by the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> {{with the same}} single, efficient motion that also pivoted the block. The 1871 Martini-Henry which replaced the [...] "trapdoor" [...] Snider-Enfield was the standard British Army rifle of the later Victorian era, and the Martini was also a popular action for civilian rifles.|$|R

50|$|Single-revolution {{clutches}} {{were developed}} in the 19th century to power machinery such as shears or presses where a single pull of the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> or (later) press of a button would trip the mechanism, engaging the clutch between the power source and the machine's crankshaft for exactly one revolution before disengaging the clutch. When the clutch is disengaged and the driven member is stationary. Early designs were typically dog clutches with a cam on the driven member used to disengage the dogs at the appropriate point.|$|R
50|$|A {{spring scale}} {{measures}} weight by reporting {{the distance that}} a spring deflects under a load. This contrasts to a balance, which compares the torque on the arm due to a sample weight to the torque on the arm due to a standard reference weight using a horizontal <b>lever.</b> <b>Spring</b> scales measure force, which is the tension force of constraint acting on an object, opposing the local force of gravity. They are usually calibrated so that measured force translates to mass at earth's gravity. The object to be weighed can be simply hung from the spring or set on a pivot and bearing platform.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a {{water-cooled}} twin-cylinder of 1800 cc enlarged to 1995 cc on later cars, with overhead inlet and side exhaust valves, {{and based on}} the original Royce engine but with an improved crankshaft. The power output was [...] at 1000 rpm. The car has a top speed of 39 mph. There is a transmission brake fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake <b>lever.</b> <b>Springing</b> is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles. It is a small car with a wheelbase of 75 in and a track of 48 in.|$|R

50|$|A three-position safety {{attached}} at {{the rear}} of the bolt which <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> can be flicked from right (safety on, bolt locked) to middle (safety on, bolt can be opened for reloading), to left (ready to fire), but only when the rifle is cocked; otherwise, the safety will not move. The safety secures the firing pin. The safety catch lever is quite large, making it easy to operate, but posing a problem for mounting telescopic sights low above the receiver whilst retaining good operability of the safety catch lever.|$|R

50|$|In {{a typical}} lever action design, the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> lies under {{the rear of}} the gun, {{typically}} below the stock, and is hinged near the breech area. It is operated by rotating the lever down and forward, which causes the breechblock to slide rearward away from the barrel and eject the spent round. The potato digger mechanism bears some similarities to the basic lever action design, in effect it uses a lever that is powered by the expanding gasses that are propelling the bullet down the barrel, rather than the operator's hands.|$|R
50|$|On woodwind {{instruments}} {{such as a}} flute or saxophone, {{keys are}} finger <b>operated</b> <b>levers</b> used to open or close tone holes, thereby shortening or lengthening the resonating tube of the instrument. The keys on the keyboard of a pipe organ also open and close various valves, but the air flow is driven mechanically rather than lung powered, and the flow of air is directed through different pipes tuned for each note. The keys of an accordion direct the air flow from a manually operated bellows across various tuned vibrating reeds.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{added on}} the 2003 model was an {{electronic}} parking-brake paddle-switch that replaced the conventional manually <b>operated</b> <b>lever</b> for the rear brakes. For the 2003 model year, the Jaguar S-type {{was given a}} six-speed, automatic ZF 6HP26 transmission {{as well as a}} revised 3.0-litre V6 engine with [...] (US spec) versus [...] for the 1999 to 2002 models. The 2003 model featured a revised dash, centre console, and a grille with the Jaguar badge to give the vehicle a more Jaguar-like appearance, and a flip-open key was devised for the ignition.|$|R
50|$|Steering {{controls}} {{differ on}} z-turn mowers. Instead of a steering wheel, most z-turns have two throttles {{that control the}} rotational speed and direction of each drive wheel. The throttles are typically moved by a seated driver who <b>operates</b> <b>levers</b> mounted waist to shoulder high. The mower's engine throttle is controlled separately, if at all. Some zero turn mowers are steered by a joystick or a steering wheel, the advantage of either one being {{the location of the}} hands may permit less fatigue during prolonged mowing and the use of a single hand for steering.|$|R
50|$|The Terrapin was {{powered by}} two Ford V8 engines mounted side-by-side, with each motor driving the wheels on one side. Wheel braking {{was used to}} steer, the brakes being <b>operated</b> by <b>levers.</b>|$|R
