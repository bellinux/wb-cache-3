5|$|After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with {{a report}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success,</b> along with {{questions}} about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; {{this section of the}} History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum. Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{played a}} key role in 1856 in {{bringing}} forward John C. Frémont as a moderate Republican presidential nominee. Because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success</b> as speaker, Banks was considered a possible presidential contender, and his name was put in nomination by supporters (knowing that he supported Frémont) at the Know Nothing convention, held one week before the Republicans met. Banks then refused the Know Nothing nomination, which went instead to former President Millard Fillmore. Banks was active on the stump in support of Frémont, who lost the election to James Buchanan; Banks easily won reelection to his own seat. Democrats, however, regained control of the House of Representatives, depriving him of the speakership.|$|E

5|$|Crunch owner, Howard Dolgon, {{pursued the}} ideal of having his team in an outdoor game, but unlike the National Hockey League's (NHL) Winter Classic the Crunch were {{responsible}} for funding the entire event. In order to afford the cost of hosting an outdoor game sponsorship deals with several independent organizations were made including Mirabito Energy Products, which lent {{its name to the}} title of the event. In part because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success</b> in putting on the event, Dolgon was awarded the James C. Hendy Memorial Award as the AHL's outstanding executive. Following the success of the Mirabito Outdoor Classic other AHL Outdoor Classics were held by other AHL teams.|$|E
5|$|He {{reached the}} height <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success</b> in 1940, {{in his first}} season at Stanford, where he led the Indians to an undefeated season that culminated with a Rose Bowl victory. That year, he also helped prepare the Chicago Bears for the 1940 NFL Championship Game, in which they routed Washington, 73–0. Shaughnessy's successes showcased the {{effectiveness}} of the T formation and encouraged its widespread adoption. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1968. Shaughnessy also coached college basketball at Tulane University. He played college football at the University of Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Brinkley {{opened a}} 16-room clinic in Milford, where he won over the locals {{immediately}} by paying good wages, invigorating {{the local economy}} and making house calls on patients afflicted with the virulent and deadly outbreak of the 1918 flu pandemic. For all his later infamy as a charlatan, accounts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success</b> at nursing flu victims back to health, and the lengths to which he went to treat them, were resoundingly positive.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success</b> {{in leading}} the Hokies {{to a bowl}} game win, Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick was named {{the most valuable player}} of the winning team. Vick finished the game having completed 10 of 18 passes for 205 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Vick also ran the ball nine times for a gain of 21 yards and a touchdown. He was sacked twice, resulting in a loss of two yards. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Clemson wide receiver Rod Gardner was named the MVP of the losing team. He caught seven passes for 94 yards and a touchdown during the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success,</b> Garfield {{was promoted}} to brigadier general, {{at the age of}} 30. After Marshall's retreat, Garfield's command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky, and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes and lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union. The proclamation was surprisingly lenient, as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery. Following a brief skirmish at Pound Gap, the last rebel units in the area were outflanked, and they retreated to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Lejoille's {{published}} {{account of}} the action greatly exaggerated the scale <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success,</b> and, although he was highly praised in the French press, he was castigated in Britain for his conduct. Thompson, Berry {{and most of the}} British officers were exchanged and acquitted at court martial, and the captains were knighted for their services, while Leander and many of the crew were recaptured in March 1799 by a Russian squadron that seized Corfu, and returned to British control by order of Tsar Paul. Généreux survived another year in the Mediterranean, but was eventually captured off Malta in 1800 by a British squadron under Lord Nelson.|$|E

5|$|Selznick {{observed}} {{that she had}} shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused {{to allow her to}} join Olivier in Pride and Prejudice (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. Waterloo Bridge (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then at the peak <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success</b> as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.|$|E
5|$|The Marlboroughs {{also lost}} state funding for Blenheim Palace, and the {{building}} {{came to a halt}} {{for the first time since}} it was begun in 1705.

5|$|There are varying tales {{as to the}} {{inspiration}} for Deere to create the invention he is famed for, the steel plow. In one version he recalled the way the polished steel pitchfork tines moved through hay and soil and thought that the same effect could be obtained for a plow. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall. Crandall spread word <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success</b> with Deere's plow quickly, and two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841 he was manufacturing 75 plows per year, and 100 plows per year in 1876.|$|E

Other than the trip by Laurence, little is known of the activities of the missionaries in the period from their arrival until 601. Gregory mentions the mass conversions, and there is mention of Augustine working miracles that helped win converts, but there is little evidence of specific events.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success,</b> by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E

5|$|At {{the height}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success</b> with United, Bruce was {{contacted}} by Jack Charlton, {{manager of the}} Republic of Ireland national team, who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly match was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that {{he chose not to}} play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Augustine consecrated Laurence of Canterbury as his {{successor}} to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office. Although {{at the time of}} Augustine's death, 26 May 604, the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles. Much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success</b> came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Æthelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself. Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{happened}} to many prominent {{individuals in the}} Athenian democracy, Themistocles's fellow citizens grew jealous <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>success,</b> and possibly tired of his boasting. It is probable that in early 479 BC, Themistocles was stripped of his command; instead, Xanthippus was to command the Athenian fleet, and Aristides the land forces. Though Themistocles was no doubt politically and militarily active {{for the rest of}} the campaign, no mention of his activities in 479 BC is made in the ancient sources. In the summer of that year, after receiving an Athenian ultimatum, the Peloponnesians finally agreed to assemble an army and march to confront Mardonius, who had reoccupied Athens in June. At the decisive Battle of Plataea, the Allies destroyed the Persian army, while apparently on the same day, the Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale. These twin victories completed the Allied triumph, and ended the Persian threat to Greece.|$|E
