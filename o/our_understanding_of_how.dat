25|$|Burgess’ studies {{revealed}} how the dendrites {{of brain}} neurons grow during development. Together with Richard Coss at the University of California, Davis, Burgess {{was the first}} to show that sensory stimuli, including social stressors, can cause long-lasting changes in brain cell anatomical structure in just a few minutes. Together with Jaime Villablanca at UCLA, Burgess discovered that early brain injury resembling childhood congenital disorders and adult traumatic brain injury can heal naturally and that rehabilitative exercise improves brain healing. He helped clarify the rôle of the caudate nucleus in aggression and found that, without input from this nucleus, usually aggressive cats are friendly and affiliative. Burgess also contributed to <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the nervous system responds to morphine, especially during early development.|$|E

30|$|The reforms, {{summarised}} in Appendix 1, were formalised in the National Early Childhood Development Strategy (the Strategy) (Council of Australian Governments 2009). The key to {{the reforms}} was a focus on quality as a centrepiece of change to systems and structures for the early childhood sector (Cheeseman and Torr 2009; Logan et al. 2012). In the following section, we elaborate on <b>our</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> transformative policy change occurs and can be conceptualised as a critical juncture.|$|R
500|$|Plant {{responses}} to climate {{and other environmental}} changes can inform <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity. For example, plant phenology can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology, and the biological impact of climate change and global warming. Palynology, the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from thousands or {{millions of years ago}} allows the reconstruction of past climates. Estimates of atmospheric [...] concentrations since the Palaeozoic have been obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants. Ozone depletion can expose plants to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation-B (UV-B), resulting in lower growth rates. Moreover, information from studies of community ecology, plant systematics, and taxonomy is essential to understanding vegetation change, habitat destruction and species extinction.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in neurophysiological memory is how it is maintained and changed through multiple time scales. Unstable synapses are easy to train but also prone to stochastic disruption. Stable [...] synapses forget less easily, {{but they are also}} harder to consolidate. One recent computational hypothesis involves cascades of plasticity that allow synapses to function at multiple time scales. Stereochemically detailed models of the acetylcholine receptor-based synapse with the Monte Carlo method, working at the time scale of microseconds, have been built. It is likely that computational tools will contribute greatly to <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> synapses function and change in relation to external stimulus in the coming decades.|$|E

30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to report <b>our</b> current <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> ecosystem management can be applied in the boreal black spruce peatlands of the Clay Bely. More specifically, we first summarize <b>our</b> current <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> natural disturbances shaped this landscape and influenced stand dynamics and biodiversity, and review the main differences between natural and managed forest stands. Then we describe how the former (i.e. clearcutting) and actual (i.e. careful logging around advanced growth [CLAAG]) management regime succeeded or failed to reproduce the structures and conditions of natural stands necessary for biodiversity. We conclude by showing how ecosystem management in paludified boreal forests could contribute to carbon sequestration and mitigate projected climate change.|$|R

Finally, the conceptual weaknesses of biopower for organizational theorizing are critically evaluated to help develop the idea for future scholarship...|$|R
40|$|For decades, {{researchers}} have {{shed light on}} the injurious effect exclusionary discipline policies have on academic achievement and postsecondary aspirations. By providing personal narratives, these stories can enhance <b>our</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> regressive policies transform students' lives. This case study is based on interviews with 16 former students of one Midwestern school district, all of whom received long-term suspensions while in high school. Findings include the parallels between the district and national trends, as well as the binary language students use to associate student behavior and perceived academic identity. The findings suggest that fear of the one's disciplinary record being revealed plays a cumbersome role in students' academic journeys...|$|R
5000|$|Classroom {{interactions}} {{can also}} have unseen consequences. Because gender is something we learn, day-to-day interactions shape <b>our</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to do gender. [...] Teachers and staff in an elementary may reinforce certain gender roles without thinking. Their communicative interactions may also single out other students. For example, a teacher may call {{on one or two}} students more than the others. This causes those who are called on less to be less confidant. A gendered example would be a teacher expecting a girl to be good at coloring or a boy to be good at building. These types of interactions restrict a student to the particular role assigned to them.|$|R

40|$|This article {{develops}} and mobilises {{the concept}} of ‘mundane data’ as an analytical entry point for understanding Big Data. We call for in-depth investigation of the human experiences, routines, improvisations and accomplishments which implicate digital data {{in the flow of}} the everyday. We demonstrate the value of this approach through a discussion of our ethnographic research with self-tracking cycling commuters. We argue that such investigations are crucial in informing <b>our</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> digital data become meaningful in mundane contexts of everyday life for two reasons: first because there is a gap in <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the contingencies and specificities through which big digital data sets are produced, and second because designers and policy makers often seek to make interventions for change in everyday contexts through the presentation of mundane data to consumers but with little <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> people produce, experience and engage with these data...|$|R
