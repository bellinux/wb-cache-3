5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly into <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E

5|$|The series {{features}} {{a number of}} recurring character archetypes. Most famously, every game since Final FantasyII, including subsequent remakes of the original Final Fantasy, {{features a}} character named Cid. Cid's appearance, personality, goals, and role in the game (non-playable ally, party member, villain) vary dramatically. However, two characteristics many versions of Cid have in common are 1) being a scientist or engineer, and 2) being tied {{in some way to}} an airship the party eventually acquires. Every Cid has at least <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> traits.|$|E
5|$|Margiris, {{the defender}} of Pilėnai, is often {{suggested}} {{as the most}} likely candidate for the fourth brother. The chronicles of Hermann de Wartberge mention that in 1329 Gediminas {{and two of his}} brothers raided Livonia. By that time Vytenis was already dead and Fiodor was probably occupied with establishing himself in Kiev. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> brothers must then have been Vainius; the identity of the other still puzzles historians. Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that he was Margiris because sources attest to his high status and wealth. Sources mention one son of Margiris, who was captured by the Teutonic Knights soon after his father's suicide in 1336 and did not return.|$|E

40|$|The finds {{of coins}} of the Golden Horde period from {{excavation}} trench CLXVIII {{located in the}} central part of the Bulgar fortified settlement site are examined and systematized in the article. Basic data on the numismatic material are presented in the form of tables. All in all, 40 coins were found: two silver and 38 copper <b>ones.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>these,</b> <b>two</b> coins are dated to the 13 th century: a silver <b>one</b> (mint <b>of</b> Kerman) and <b>one</b> copper fels <b>of</b> Argun, the Mongol ruler of Iran (mint of Yazd?). The remaining coins were issued in the period of the 1320 s through to the early 15 th century. They were minted at the Bulgar, Saray, Saray al-Jadid, Gulistan and the Crimea mints. Bulgar emissions are represented by ten copper coins issued between 720 and 736 CE and, presumably, one most recent coin of the early 800 s CE...|$|R
5|$|Of the season's four {{tropical}} cyclones, two reached hurricane status. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> strengthened {{into a major}} hurricanes, {{which are}} Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the third hurricane, peaked at Category3 strength, with maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195km/h). Rough seas produced by this storm sunk a ship {{in the vicinity of}} the Lesser Antilles, drowning 10people. The final tropical cyclone was first observed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October31. Peaking as a strong Category1 hurricane, it headed westward and made landfall in Nicaragua, before being last noted over Central America on November1. The storm produced only minor damage in Nicaragua. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this season resulted in at least $1million in damage and 14confirmed fatalities.|$|E
5|$|In 342 BC, two {{significant}} laws were passed. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> laws made {{it illegal to}} hold more than one office at any given point in time, and the other law required an interval of ten years to pass before any magistrate could seek reelection to any office. As {{a result of these}} two laws, the military situation quickly became unmanageable. During this time period, Rome was expanding within Italy and beginning to take steps beyond Italy, and thus it became necessary for military commanders to hold office for several years at a time. This problem was resolved with the creation of the pro-magisterial offices, so that when an individual's term in office ended, his command might be prorogued (prorogatio imperii). In effect, when a magistrate's term ended, his imperium was extended, and he usually held the title of either Proconsul or Propraetor. This constitutional device was not in harmony with the underlying genius of the Roman constitution, and its frequent usage eventually {{paved the way for the}} empire. In addition, during these years, the Plebeian Tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realized the need to use Plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals, and so to win over the Tribunes, the senators gave the Tribunes a great deal of power, and unsurprisingly, the Tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the Tribunes and the senators grew closer, Plebeian senators were often able to secure the Tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the Tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E

25|$|R. C. Zaehner distinguishes three {{fundamental}} {{types of}} mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic ("all-in-one") or natural mysticism. The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the Bhagavad Gita. The monistic type, {{which according to}} Zaehner is based upon an experience of the unity of one's soul, includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as Samhya and Advaita vedanta. Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not fit into <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> categories.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1908, while a {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, Millikan worked on an oil-drop experiment in which he measured the charge on a single electron. J. J.

Therefore, if <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> values were to be discovered, the other could easily be calculated. Millikan and his then graduate student Harvey Fletcher used the oil-drop experiment to measure the charge of the electron (as well as the electron mass, and Avogadro's number, since their relation to the electron charge was known).|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} {{of the existence of}} an ordinary line can also be posed for points in the real projective plane RP2 instead of the Euclidean plane. The Euclidean plane {{can be viewed as a}} subset of the projective plane, but the additional points and lines of the projective plane do not change the problem, as any finite set of projective points can be transformed into a Euclidean point set without changing its set of ordinary lines. Therefore, any pattern of intersecting points and lines that exists in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> types of plane also exists in the other. However, the projective viewpoint allows certain configurations to be described more easily.|$|E
