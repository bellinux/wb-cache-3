In the first stage, two geographic Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Units</b> are selected {{from each of}} the strata within each state. In selecting Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Units,</b> if a Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> that was in the 1990 design is reselected in 2000, then the experienced field representative in that Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> can remain working on the survey. If a new Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> is selected, then a new field representative will have to be hired and trained. Therefore, reselecting as many of the Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Units</b> that were in the 1990 design as possible would minimize this turnover of field representatives. This will help reduce nonsampling errors caused by the inexperience of newly hired field representatives and the costs to train them. The Bureau of the Census employs the Ernst (1986) algorithm to select Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Units</b> while maximizing the Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> overlap between the 1990 and 2000 designs.

40|$|Sampled microarchitectural {{simulation}} of single-threaded applications is mature technology {{for over a}} decade now. Sampling multithreaded applications, on the other hand, is much more complicated. Not until very recently have researchers proposed solutions for sampled {{simulation of}} multithreaded applications. Time-Based Sampling (TBS) samples multithreaded application execution based on time—not instructions as is typically done for single-threaded applications—yielding estimates for a multithreaded application’s execution time. In this article, we revisit and analyze previously proposed TBS approaches (periodic and cantor fractal based sampling), and we obtain a number of novel and surprising insights, such as (i) accurately estimating fast-forwarding IPC, that is, performance in-between <b>sampling</b> <b>units,</b> is more important than accurately estimating sample IPC, that is, performance within the sampling units; (ii) fast-forwarding IPC estimation accuracy is determined by both the <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> distribution and how to use the <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> to predict fast-forwarding IPC; and (iii) cantor sampling is more accurate at small <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> sizes, whereas periodic is more accurate at large <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> sizes. These insights lead to the development of Two-level Hybrid Sampling (THS), a novel sampling methodology for multithreaded applications that combines periodic sampling’s accuracy at large time scales (i. e., uniformly selecting coarse-grain <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> across the entire program execution) with cantor sampling’s accuracy at small time scales (i. e., the ability to accurately predict fast-forwarding IPC in-between small <b>sampling</b> <b>units).</b> The clustered occurrence of small <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> under cantor <b>sampling</b> also enables shortened warmup and thus enhanced simulation speed. Overall, THS achieves an average absolute execution time prediction error of 4 % while yielding an average simulation speedup of 40 × compared to detailed simulation, which is both more accurate and faster than the current state-of-the-art. Case studies illustrate THS’ ability to accurately predict relative performance differences across the design space...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the effect of <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> size on the perception of spatial patterns of earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris L.) middens. The implications for optimal sampling strategy for spatial interpolation were assessed. Spatial variation of midden density was investigated in Vaisakko forest, south-western Finland, using 225 sample points distributed on a square grid with a minimum distance of 25 m between samples. At each point, middens were counted within samples of sequentially increasing size (sample surface 0. 125, 0. 25, 1 m 2) and analysed by means of geostatistics. The results showed significant spatial continuity of midden distribution in all cases. Whereas, neither the estimate of mean middens density nor the global distribution pattern were markedly affected by <b>sample</b> <b>unit</b> size, the total variance increased considerably with decreasing <b>sample</b> <b>unit</b> area. Isotropic variograms for different <b>sample</b> <b>unit</b> sizes were all spherical but large discrepancies in the model parameters were observed.

40|$|Abstract – Studies in {{tropical}} streams are relatively few, {{and one of}} the still-unresolved methodological is-sues is sample size. Adequate sample size for temperate streams cannot be extrapolated for tropical sites, be-cause of the differences in species richness and the proportions of rare species. We evaluated reliable sample size for estimation of resemblance among samples of macroinvertebrate assemblages inhabiting riffles of tropi-cal streams, using the autosimilarity approach. Sample sizes were much larger than those currently employed {{in tropical}} studies. <b>Sampling</b> <b>units</b> consisted of individuals associated with single stones (15 – 20 cm). Evaluations employed the Bray-Curtis index for abundance data and the equivalent Sorensen index for pre-sence-absence data. Autosimilarity curves were constructed using both <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> and individuals. The estimation of resemblance among samples was strongly dependent upon sample size at reduced sampling ef-fort, particularly for the Bray-Curtis index. For the same sampling effort, fixed counts of individuals obtained randomly from <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> gave better estimations of resemblance, and their similarity curves tended to stabilize earlier than those using <b>sampling</b> <b>units.</b> A minimum of 9 – 15 <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> (stones) or 150 – 850 in-dividuals is necessary for adequate estimations of resemblance using presence-absence data, and 13 – 18 sam-pling units or 750 – 1550 individuals are required for relative abundance data in tropical streams...|$|R
