5|$|Béla {{supported}} the development <b>of</b> <b>towns.</b> For instance, he confirmed the liberties {{of the citizens}} of Székesfehérvár and granted privileges to Hungarian and German settlers in Bars (Starý Tekov, Slovakia) in 1237. Zadar, a town in Dalmatia which had been lost to Venice in 1202, acknowledged Béla's suzerainty in 1240.|$|E
5|$|In 1311–1312, a {{rebellion}} in Kraków instigated by the city's patrician leadership seeking rule by the House of Luxembourg was put down. This event {{may have had}} a limiting impact on the emerging political power <b>of</b> <b>towns.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Kerala backwaters are {{a network}} of {{interconnected}} canals, rivers, lakes and inlets, a labyrinthine system formed by more than 900km of waterways. In {{the midst of this}} landscape, there are a number <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> and cities, which serve as the starting and end points of transportation services and backwater cruises.|$|E
5|$|Whitby is twinned with {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> across the globe. Most were either visited by Captain Cook in ships that were built in Whitby – and one was named after Whitby by {{settlers}} from England.|$|E
5|$|Australian kites may be {{sedentary}} or nomadic, {{and generally}} occur in open grasslands or valleys {{where there are}} scattered clumps of trees. In urban areas they are found on the edge <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> on wasteland, irregularly mown areas, or grassy roadside verges. They also hunt over coastal dunes, drier marshland, and farmland.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{territorial}} truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced {{a period of}} accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy. A great monetary reform was implemented {{during the reign of}} Casimir III.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{to the early}} 1980s, a number of German, Dutch and Swiss {{settlers}} were attracted to Banagher, mainly because of its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle. A number of these are still resident in Banagher. As with the majority <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> and cities in Ireland, Banagher has seen an influx of foreign nationals, mostly of Eastern European origin, {{in recent years and}} these now make up just over 10% of the population.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland has a {{dense network}} <b>of</b> <b>towns,</b> where large, medium and small towns are complementary. The plateau is very densely {{populated}} with about 450 people per km2 {{and the landscape}} continually shows signs of human presence. The weight of the largest metropolitan areas, which are Zürich, Geneva–Lausanne, Basel and Bern tend to increase. In international comparison {{the importance of these}} urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests. In addition the two main centres of Zürich and Geneva are recognised for their particularly great quality of life.|$|E
50|$|The Sterling Micropolitan Statistical Area {{includes}} the City <b>of</b> Sterling, the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Crook, the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Fleming, the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Iliff, the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Merino, the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Peetz, and the unincorporated areas of Logan County.|$|R

5|$|The {{first true}} {{national}} census with exhaustive and broad coverage {{was carried out}} in 1872. The small number of people and small number <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> reported by the census reveal Brazil's enormous territory to have been sparsely populated. It showed Brazil as having a total population of 9,930,478 inhabitants. Estimates made by the government in prior decades showed 4,000,000 inhabitants in 1823 and gave a figure of 7,000,700 in 1854. The population was distributed across 20 provinces and the Neutral Municipality (the Empire's capital) with 641 municipalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{pastoral}} {{profession of}} Zimmerman's father caused {{his family to}} relocate to a number <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> throughout Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Zimmerman spent {{the majority of his}} youth in Woodstock and Salem, Virginia, before his father transferred to Romney, West Virginia, to preside over the Moorefield district of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.|$|E
5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings in a number <b>of</b> <b>towns,</b> including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served to heighten anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E
50|$|October 3, 1955, song <b>of</b> <b>town</b> and symbol <b>of</b> <b>town</b> were enacted.|$|R
50|$|Hartland {{is south}} <b>of</b> the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Somerset and north <b>of</b> the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Royalton {{and a small}} part <b>of</b> the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Lockport. To the west is the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Newfane. The eastern border is the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Ridgeway in Orleans County.|$|R

Theses include the Ontario Guild <b>of</b> <b>Town</b> Criers, the Nova Scotia Guild <b>of</b> <b>Town</b> Criers and the American Guild <b>of</b> <b>Town</b> Criers. In 2016, the <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Burlingame, California added a town crier.|$|R
5|$|After a {{brief period}} of {{consolidation}} on Dominica, Cochrane and Beckwith sailed for Guadeloupe on 27 January 1810, arriving off Le Gosier in the evening and landing the larger division at the village of Sainte-Marie under the command of Hislop. The division split, with one half marching south towards Basse-Terre and the other north. Neither met serious opposition, the militia forces deserting in large numbers and abandoning their fortifications as the British approached. Messages were sent by the approaching British ordering the surrender <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> and forts, and both forces made rapid progress over the following two days. On 30 January, Ernouf took up a position with his remaining garrison in the Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge highlands that guarded the approaches to Basse-Terre, Hislop forming his men in front of Ernouf's position. Later in the day, Harcourt's men came ashore to the north of Basse-Terre, outflanking the strongest French positions at Trois-Rivières and forcing their withdrawal to Basse-Terre itself.|$|E
5|$|Also {{close to}} the 35thparallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the {{founding}} <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.|$|E
5|$|During {{and shortly}} after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were {{inserted}} into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the populace. They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a moat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and their financial and judicial roles. When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11thand 12thcenturies, settlement in those countries was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> was often linked {{with the creation of}} a castle.|$|E
50|$|A {{woman has}} decided to shop at one store today, either in the north part <b>of</b> <b>town</b> or the south part <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> If she visits the north part <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> she will shop at either a mall, a {{furniture}} store, or a jewelry store (3 ways). If she visits the south part <b>of</b> <b>town</b> then she will shop at either a clothing store or a shoe store (2 ways).|$|R
50|$|Cherry Creek is east <b>of</b> the <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Charlotte. It {{is south}} <b>of</b> the <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Villenova and north <b>of</b> the <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Ellington. Cherry Creek's east town line {{is shared by}} the <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Leon in Cattaraugus County.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Milton was {{established}} in 1792 from part <b>of</b> the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Ballston. In 1793, part <b>of</b> the <b>town</b> was taken to form part <b>of</b> the <b>Town</b> <b>of</b> Greenfield.|$|R
5|$|Following these killings, Spanish garrisons were {{stationed}} in several towns in southern Yucatán, and rewards were offered for {{the whereabouts of}} AjK'in P'ol. The Maya governor of Oxkutzcab, Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track the warleader down; they succeeded in capturing the Itza captain and his followers, together with silverware from the looted Sakalum church and items belonging to Mirones. The prisoners were taken back to the Spanish Captain Antonio Méndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried, and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered. They were decapitated, and the heads were displayed in the plazas <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> throughout the colonial Partido de la Sierra {{in what is now}} Mexico's Yucatán state. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown lacked the time, money or interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades.|$|E
5|$|In August 1987, the {{encouraged}} Chadians {{carried their}} offensive into the disputed Aouzou Strip, occupying {{the town of}} Aouzou following another battle in which the Libyans suffered severe losses in troops and abandoned equipment. In retaliation, Libya intensified its air bombardments <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> in the north, usually from altitudes beyond the range of FANT's shoulder-fired missiles. Appeals by Habré for French air missions to defend the area against the bombing were rejected, as Aouzou had been retaken against the wishes of French President François Mitterrand. Instead, Mitterrand called for international mediation to settle competing claims to the disputed territory.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Europe, Romania built {{what were}} termed heroes' war grave cemeteries, either in {{existing}} heroes' cemeteries, on {{the sites of}} the World War I battles, or in new cemeteries symbolically placed on the edges <b>of</b> <b>towns.</b> The situation was somewhat different in Russia, however, where the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was used {{not just for the}} war dead of World War I, but also for the casualties of the Civil War, and then the victims of the secret police. It was finally closed by the Bolsheviks in 1925 and turned into a park; subsequently, possibly on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the Eastern Orthodox church and the headstones were systematically destroyed until almost no trace of the cemetery remained.|$|E
50|$|The Ontario Southland Railway {{also serves}} Tillsonburg using the former CPR Port Burwell {{subdivision}} running from nearby Ingersoll, parallel to Highway 19 north <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> {{and then into}} the north-east end <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> The OSR interchanges with the STER at the south end <b>of</b> <b>town.</b>|$|R
