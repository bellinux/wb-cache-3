5|$|The {{cessation}} of menstrual cycles {{at the end}} of a woman's reproductive period is termed menopause. The average age <b>of</b> <b>menopause</b> in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause before age 45 is considered premature in industrialised countries. Like the age of menarche, the age <b>of</b> <b>menopause</b> is largely a result of cultural and biological factors; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Type I endometrial carcinomas occur most {{commonly}} before {{and around the}} time <b>of</b> <b>menopause.</b> In the United States they are more common in whites, particularly those {{with a history of}} endometrial hyperplasia. Type I endometrial cancers are often low-grade, minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), estrogen-dependent, and have a good outcome with treatment. Type I carcinomas represent 75–90% of endometrial cancer.|$|E

From August 27 to November 21, 1951, Wong starred in a detective series that was written specifically for her, the DuMont Television Network series The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, in which she played the title role which used her birth name. Wong's character was a dealer in Chinese art whose career involved her in detective work and international intrigue. The ten half-hour episodes aired during prime time, from 9:00 to 9:30p.m. Although there were plans for a second season, DuMont canceled the show in 1952. No copies of the show or its scripts are known to exist. After the completion of the series, Wong's health began to deteriorate. In late 1953 she suffered an internal hemorrhage, which her brother attributed to the onset <b>of</b> <b>menopause,</b> her continued heavy drinking, and financial worries.|$|E

However, previous studies have suggested that female premutation carriers may have an increased incidence <b>of</b> premature <b>menopause.</b> To test this possible association, we screened for premutation alleles among 216 women with early menopause (at age < 47 years), 33 of whom had premature menopause (at age < 40 years), as well as among 107 control women, all of whom were ascertained solely on the basis <b>of</b> age at <b>menopause.</b> No full-mutation alleles were found; and only one premutation allele was found, but, it was in a member of the control group. These results are consistent with what would be expected on the basis of chance only. Our sample size was sufficient to rule out a ⩾ 3 -fold increased risk <b>of</b> early <b>menopause</b> and a ⩾ 9 -fold increased risk <b>of</b> premature <b>menopause</b> due to an FMR 1 premutation, under a model considering the risk of both sporadic and familial early menopause.

25|$|After menopause, {{the body}} {{produces}} less estrogen, which causes the vaginal walls {{to thin out}} significantly. The effects <b>of</b> <b>menopause</b> can lead to vaginal dryness (due to a decrease in vaginal lubrication), which causes vaginal discomfort on its own or discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse. This can be alleviated with hormone replacement therapy, estrogen-containing vaginal creams, or non-prescription, non-hormonal products, but there are risks and adverse effects associated with hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{theories}} {{discussed above}} assume that evolution directly selected for menopause. Another theory states that menopause is the {{byproduct of the}} evolutionary selection for follicular atresia, a factor that causes menopause. Menopause results from having too few ovarian follicles to produce enough estrogen to maintain the ovarian-pituitary-hypothalamic loop, which results in the cessation of menses and the beginning <b>of</b> <b>menopause.</b> Human females are born with approximately a million oocytes, and approximately 400 oocytes are lost to ovulation throughout life.|$|E
25|$|On a {{molecular}} level, {{hormone replacement therapy}} at the time <b>of</b> <b>menopause</b> has effects on the lipid profile. Specifically, HDL decreases, while LDL, triglycerides and lipoprotein a increase. Supplemental estrogen improves the lipid profile by reversing each of these effects. Beyond this, it improves cardiac contractility, coronary artery blood flow, metabolism of carbohydrates, and decreases platelet aggregation and plaque formation. At the molecular level HRT may promote reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) via the induction of cholesterol ABC transporters.|$|E

25|$|During perimenopause, {{estrogen}} levels {{average about}} 20–30% higher than during premenopause, often with wide fluctuations. These fluctuations cause {{many of the}} physical changes during perimenopause as well as menopause. Some of these changes are hot flashes, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, vaginal dryness or atrophy, incontinence, osteoporosis, and heart disease. During this period, fertility diminishes but is not considered to reach zero until the official date <b>of</b> <b>menopause.</b> The official date is determined retroactively, once 12 months have passed after the last appearance of menstrual blood.|$|E
25|$|The average onset age <b>of</b> <b>menopause</b> after {{hysterectomy}} with ovarian {{conservation is}} 3.7 years earlier than average. This {{has been suggested}} {{to be due to}} the disruption of blood supply to the ovaries after a hysterectomy or due to missing endocrine feedback of the uterus. The function of the remaining ovaries is significantly affected in about 40% of women, some of them even require hormone replacement treatment. Surprisingly, a similar and only slightly weaker effect has been observed for endometrial ablation which is often considered as an alternative to hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|The WHI {{trial was}} limited by low adherence, high attrition, {{inadequate}} power to detect risks for some outcomes, {{and evaluation of}} few regimens.

As a result, while the average age <b>of</b> <b>menopause</b> is age 51, study participants were on average 62 years of age.

25|$|In menopausal women, sexual {{functioning}} can impact several {{dimensions of}} a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being.

25|$|It {{is unclear}} if phytoestrogens {{have any effect}} on the cause or {{prevention}} of cancer in females. Some epidemiological studies have suggested a protective effect against breast cancer. Other epidemiological studies found that consumption of soy estrogens is safe for patients with breast cancer, and that it may decrease mortality and recurrence rates. It remains unclear if phytoestrogens can minimize some of the deleterious effects of low estrogen levels (hypoestrogenism) resulting from oophorectomy, menopause, or other causes. A Cochrane Review of the use of phytoestrogens to relieve the vasomotor symptoms <b>of</b> <b>menopause</b> (hot flashes) stated that there was no conclusive evidence to suggest any benefit to their use, although genistein effects should be further investigated.|$|E
25|$|The current {{indications}} for {{use from}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration include short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor hot flashes or urogenital atrophy, and prevention of osteoporosis.

A consensus expert opinion published by The Endocrine Society stated that when taken during perimenopause, or the initial years <b>of</b> <b>menopause,</b> hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published, and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios.
