In his typically florid prose, he issued a Manifesto explaining the coup to the people. Resentful of the parliamentarians' attacks against him, King Alfonso tried to give Primo de Rivera legitimacy by naming him prime minister. In justifying his coup d'état, Primo de Rivera announced: [...] "Our aim is to <b>open</b> a brief <b>parenthesis</b> in the constitutional life of Spain and to re-establish {{it as soon as}} the country offers us men uncontaminated with the vices of political organization."

Hiragana consisting of connected strokes {{are replaced by}} symbols or Greek letters: for example, す (su) may be rendered as the section symbol [...] Hiragana consisting of detached elements are replaced by sequences of kana, Western letters, or symbols. For example, ほ (ho) may be typed as [...] (vertical bar and hiragana ma) or [...] (<b>open</b> <b>parenthesis</b> and ma), け (ke) may be typed as [...] (katakana re na), [...] (capital i, na), or [...] (<b>open</b> <b>parenthesis,</b> dagger), and た (ta) may be typed as [...] (katakana na, equals sign) or [...] (dagger, hiragana ko). Katakana is frequently replaced by similar-looking kanji, such as 世 for セ (se) or 干 for チ (chi), in {{a reversal of the}} process that turned man'yōgana into kana. Kana and rōmaji may be mixed freely, even within a word, and Latin letters in rōmaji may be replaced with similar-looking Cyrillic letters, such as replacing N with И (Cyrillic I). Compound kanji are decomposed into left and right elements, which are written as individual kanji or kana. For example, the kanji 好 in 好き, meaning [...] "like, enjoy" [...] may be split into 女子 (the kanji for woman and child, respectively).|$|E

New laws were violated in 1542 when the governors granted new permits for conquest, although this was {{a function of the}} Royal Court. The president attributed such outrages to the inexperience of the governors, they were not men of letters, to their condition and the remoteness of the hearing. So the judge sent as visitors Cepeda, Juan Lopez de Cartagena and Santa Marta, and Diego Garcia de Valverde tax for governor of Popayan. Control over the governors, the president said his opposition to develop expeditionary companies, among those not authorized are those of Diego de Ospina to the region of Antioquia and Diego de Vargas, who longed to find the coveted Golden on the Plains Orientals. As a result, the management Venero de Leiva (1564-1575) <b>opened</b> a <b>parenthesis</b> in the process of expansion of the conquest; considered necessary to curb the abuses of the conquistadores, both on the communities from which the Indians extracted dragged looting expeditions such as that performed in the people they conquered. Furthermore, it was essential to organize the space that had been conquered and lay the groundwork for colonization tasks. Result of such concerns was the founding pioneer of the Villa de Leiva, requested by several farmers who had recently arrived from Spain. The foundation, authorized by the president on April 29, 1572, left the city erectile guidelines to rely on the establishment of a layer of tenants who disputed the indigenous labor to the encomenderos of Tunja rivalry born too early between the two cities, as traders preferred to that for the quality and abundance of wheat crops.|$|R
60|$|But {{the point}} of my reminiscence {{is that there were}} other {{communications}} that day, as there were certainly other responses. I have forgotten exactly what it was we were looking for--without much success--when we met the three Sisters. Nothing requires more care, as a long knowledge of Venice works in, than not to lose the useful faculty of getting lost. I had so successfully done my best to preserve it that I could at that moment conscientiously profess an absence of any suspicion of where we might be. It proved enough that, wherever we were, we were where the three sisters found us. This was on a little bridge near a big campo, and a part of the charm of the matter was the theory that it was very much out of the way. They took us promptly in hand--they were only walking over to San Marco to match some coloured wool for the manufacture of such belated cushions as still bloom with purple and green in the long leisures of old palaces; and that mild errand could easily <b>open</b> a <b>parenthesis.</b> The obscure church we had feebly imagined we were looking for proved, if I am not mistaken, that of the sisters' parish; as to which I have but a confused recollection of a large grey void and of admiring {{for the first time a}} fine work of art of which I have now quite lost the identity. This was the effect of the charming beneficence of the three sisters, who presently were to give our adventure a turn in the emotion of which everything that had preceded seemed as nothing. It actually strikes me even as a little dim to have been told by them, as we all fared together, that a certain low, wide house, in a small square as to which I found myself without particular association, had been in the far- off time the residence of George Sand. And yet this was a fact that, though I could then only feel it must be for another day, would in a different connection have set me richly reconstructing.|$|R

5000|$|One {{noteworthy}} {{feature is}} that in the standard layout, paired delimiters -- parentheses , brackets , braces , and angle brackets (less/greater than) [...] -- have the opposite visual representation from the standard in left-to-right languages.

On a right-to-left keyboard, this is written as the Unicode character U+0029, [...] "right parenthesis": [...] This is true on Arabic keyboards as well.
