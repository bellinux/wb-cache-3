5|$|Physically, the {{cyclonic}} {{circulation of}} the storm advects environmental air poleward east <b>of</b> <b>center</b> and equatorial west <b>of</b> <b>center.</b> Because air must conserve its angular momentum, this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward {{of the storm}} center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center. The combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs {{even if there is}} zero environmental flow.|$|E

5|$|A {{road from}} New Albany to north <b>of</b> <b>Center</b> Village first {{appeared}} on maps in 1924. In 1929, the road was extended to connect to Condit. SR 605 was designated in 1937, following the alignment from US 62, to a junction with the US 36/SR 3 concurrency in Condit. By 1994, jurisdiction of the portion of SR 605 between SR 37 and the US 36/SR 3 concurrency was transferred from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to Delaware County, who renamed the road to County Road 605. As {{a result of this}} move, SR 605 took on the routing that it does today.|$|E

5|$|Starting at the {{intersection}} between Van Dyke Avenue and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue), M-53 runs north-northwesterly along Van Dyke {{in the city of}} Detroit. The four-lane roadway passes through residential neighborhoods on the city's east side. About a half mile (0.8km) north of its start, M-53 meets I-94 at the latter's exit218. On {{the opposite side of the}} freeway interchange, Van Dyke Avenue turns due north and continues through a mix of residential and industrial areas near Coleman A. Young International Airport. In this area, the highway crosses branch lines for both the Conrail Shared Assets Operations and the Canadian National Railway. M-53 continues northward through residential areas north of 6Mile Road and crosses from Detroit into Warren at the junction with 8Mile Road; that road also marks the Wayne–Macomb county line. The highway passes through the middle <b>of</b> <b>Center</b> Line, an enclave surrounded by Warren. On the northern edge <b>of</b> <b>Center</b> Line, M-53 meets exit23 along I-696, the Walter Reuther Freeway. North of this interchange, Van Dyke Avenue crosses back into Warren and continues northward. The highway is paralleled by a Conrail line as they both pass through the northern Detroit suburbs. Between 12Mile and 14Mile roads, M-53 passes next to the General Motors Technical Center and through the center of a suburban shopping district. The roadway widens out into a divided highway as it continues northward, crossing into Sterling Heights at 14Mile Road. The highway is bounded by additional commercial and light industrial properties as it intersects Metropolitan Parkway (16Mile Road).|$|E

5|$|The US$1 million ($ million today) {{project was}} {{initiated}} by Pittsburgh Pirates' owner Barney Dreyfuss, {{with the goal}} of replacing his franchise's then-current home, Exposition Park. The stadium was made of concrete and steel (one of the first of its kind) in order to increase its lifespan. The Pirates opened Forbes Field on June 30, 1909, against the Chicago Cubs, and would play the final game that was also against the Cubs on June 28, 1970. The field itself featured a large playing surface, with the batting cage placed in the deepest part <b>of</b> <b>center</b> field during games. Seating was altered multiple times throughout the stadium's life; at times fans were permitted to sit on the grass in the outfield during overflow crowds. The Pirates won three World Series while at Forbes Field and the other original tenant, the Pittsburgh Panthers football team had five undefeated seasons before moving in 1924.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, freeway {{approaches}} {{were planned}} {{for both sides}} of the Ben Franklin Bridge, which was completed in 1926 and served as a part of US 30. In Pennsylvania, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the northern edge <b>of</b> <b>Center</b> City Philadelphia to the Schuylkill River, while in New Jersey, the North-South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, this stretch of highway was a part of I-80S, with Interstate 680 continuing on the Schuylkill Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge. In 1964, the designations became I-76 and I-676, respectively, and in 1972 the two routes were switched onto their current alignments. I-676 in New Jersey was completed between I-76 and Morgan Boulevard by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s. The Vine Street Expressway was opened from the Schuylkill Expressway to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I-95 on January 10, 1991 after several obstacles to construction. However, there are grade-level intersections in the connections between the Vine Street Expressway and the Ben Franklin Bridge.|$|E
5|$|After the 2014 Finals, LeBron James {{became a}} free agent and {{returned}} to the Cleveland Cavaliers where he teamed up with Kyrie Irving. The Cavs also traded for Kevin Love to form a new Big Three in Cleveland as they led the Cavs to the 2015 NBA Finals. In the 2015 postseason, 2014 finalist Miami Heat did not qualify in the playoffs after losing James to free agency and due to mediocrity stemming from brutal injuries all season, and the former defending champions, the San Antonio Spurs, were eliminated in a Game 7 battle against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. This allowed Cleveland to conquer the East. Golden State, spearheaded by reigning MVP, Stephen Curry, achieved a 67–15 record and were able to take the West. Entering the 2015 Finals, James and current Cavalier and former Heat teammate James Jones made their fifth straight finals appearance – the first two players to do this since the 1960s Celtics. The Warriors managed to defy conventional wisdom and traditionalist ideas by winning the championship with a small-ball, three-point shooting, fast-paced team. The Warriors won Game 1 in overtime, with the Cavaliers losing Irving to injury in the process. The Cavaliers would win Games 2 and 3, however, the Warriors won the next three games after coach Steve Kerr made the adjustment of inserting sixth man Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup in place <b>of</b> <b>center</b> Andrew Bogut, thus achieving the desired small-ball offense. The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 4–2, with Iguodala becoming the first player to not start in any regular season game to win the Finals MVP award.|$|E
