While a tribune could veto any act of the senate, the assemblies, or the magistrates, he could only veto the act, and not the actual measure. Therefore, he had to physically be present when the act was occurring. As soon as that tribune was no longer present, the act could be completed as if {{there had never been}} a veto.|$|E
5|$|Shannen Says is an eight-episode American reality {{television}} series which was broadcast on WE tv from April 10 to May 13, 2012. It focused on {{preparations for the}} wedding of actress Shannen Doherty and photographer Kurt Iswarienko, with help from celebrity-wedding planner David Tutera. The series' premise originated from a discussion between Doherty and Iswarienko about providing a look into their lives and document the stress <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> planning their wedding. The series' executive producers included Doherty, Iswarienko, Kathleen Farrell, Tom Forman, and Russell Heldt. It was filmed in Malibu, California over a seven-week period, and was produced by RelativityREAL and Doherty's production company No Apologies Productions. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video under the title Shannen Says, Season 1, but was not made available on DVD or Blu-ray.|$|E

25|$|Those changes {{turned the}} match on its head. Instead of the Australian batsmen taking easy runs off the English bowlers, the English bowlers now tied down the batting, getting rewards {{in the form}} of wickets.

Damien Martyn and Andrew Symonds decided to retreat into their shell, as the English bowling turned from difficult to almost unhittable, Flintoff getting a touch on the off-stump of Symonds, but the bail didn't fall off, so he survived. However, the pair could only add 19 from 35 deliveries, before Harmison had Martyn caught behind with a ball that moved away from the batsman, off the waiting edge and into Geraint Jones' gloves.|$|E
