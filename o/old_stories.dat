5|$|From 1943 on, Hergé {{with the}} help of Edgar P. Jacobs started {{redrawing}} and colouring the early Tintin adventures, while also collaborating in the production of new stories. The <b>old</b> <b>stories,</b> usually a bit over 100 pages long, were restructured to fit into 62 pages. Jacobs eventually ended the collaboration in 1947 when Hergé refused to share the credit with him. They remained friends regardless of the fact.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{after the end}} of the Second World War, Hergé was {{continuing}} to produce new instalments of The Adventures of Tintin for the Belgian magazine Tintin, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his <b>old</b> <b>stories,</b> Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with The Adventures of Tintin, he felt great pressure on him to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E
5|$|The story began {{serialisation}} in Tintin magazine from 16 September 1948, {{before beginning}} its serialisation in the French {{edition of the}} magazine from 28 October 1948. Rather than continuing {{at the point where}} he had previously left off, Hergé started the story from scratch. He nevertheless made revisions to {{the early part of the}} story, namely by reworking the characters of Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus, as well as the location of Marlinspike Hall, into the narrative, all of which were elements that had been introduced to the Adventures of Tintin during the intervening eight years. Hergé was contractually obliged to produce two pages of comic for each issue, and in the previous adventure, Prisoners of the Sun, had fulfilled this by producing two pages of new Tintin stories each week. Seeking to limit his workload, he would only produce one page of Land of Black Gold per issue, with the other page being filled by a re-serialisation of <b>old</b> <b>stories</b> from his Jo, Zette and Jocko series.|$|E

25|$|The Theogony {{concerns}} {{the origins of}} the world (cosmogony) and of the gods (theogony), beginning with Chaos, Gaia, Tartarus and Eros, and shows a special interest in genealogy. Embedded in Greek myth, there remain fragments of quite variant tales, hinting at the rich variety of myth that once existed, city by city; but Hesiod's retelling of the <b>old</b> <b>stories</b> became, according to Herodotus, the accepted version that linked all Hellenes.|$|E
25|$|If past {{records and}} current {{conditions}} indicate {{anything about the}} area, they show the area breeds entrepreneurship; whether numbering 286 currently or 1,348 in 1929, residents {{seem to have a}} knack for being industrious, always looking to expand a new building purchased, or a new business started. From the first Métis in the area, looking for better hunting grounds in 1871, to a thriving museum, housed in a building nearly 100 years <b>old,</b> <b>stories</b> of growth and expansion abound in this quaint town’s history.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling in {{indigenous}} cultures {{is sometimes}} passed on by oral means {{in a quiet}} and relaxing environment, which usually coincides with family or tribal community gatherings and official events such as family occasions, rituals, or ceremonial practices. During the telling of the story, children may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story. Furthermore, stories are not often told {{in the same manner}} twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into <b>old</b> <b>stories</b> dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.|$|E

25|$|Mantle {{spoke with}} great remorse of his {{drinking}} in a 1994 Sports Illustrated cover story. He {{said that he}} was telling the same <b>old</b> <b>stories,</b> and realizing how many of them involved himself and others being drunk – including at least one drunk-driving accident – he decided they were not funny anymore. He admitted he had often been cruel and hurtful to family, friends, and fans because of his alcoholism, and sought to make amends. Mantle became a Christian because of his former teammate Bobby Richardson, an ordained Baptist minister who shared his faith with him. After the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, Mantle joined with fellow Oklahoman and Yankee Bobby Murcer {{to raise money for the}} victims.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz reinvented Green Lantern as {{a science}} fiction hero. The new Green Lantern, named Hal Jordan, was {{empowered}} by alien masters {{to serve as an}} interstellar lawman and had many adventures set in outer space. His powers were similar to Alan's but he was otherwise completely unrelatedAlan Scott never existed as far as the new stories were concerned. Hal Jordan proved popular, but readers still had an interest in the old Green Lantern. Some years later, Alan Scott reappeared as a guest star in The Flash #137 (1963). To avoid continuity conflicts with the Hal Jordan character, Alan Scott and all his <b>old</b> <b>stories</b> were written as being from a parallel universe. For most of the 1960s and 1970s, Alan Scott made guest appearances in books belonging to Silver Age characters, visiting their universe through magical or technological means. In 1976, he appeared regularly alongside his Justice Society comrades in the revived All-Star Comics and later Adventure Comics in stories set in the 1970s. In 1981, DC Comics launched All-Star Squadron, which featured Alan Scott and the Justice Society in a World War 2 setting.|$|E

Club described the episode as [...] "Star Trek comfort food", but also that it demonstrated [...] "a show unable to carve out its own identity, content to rehash <b>old</b> <b>stories</b> when the show’s very premise demands new storytelling". He also said that it was a [...] "blatant example" [...] of Enterprise repeating the story mechanics of previous seasons. Chaz Lipp at The Morton Report called [...] "Acquisition" [...] a [...] "goofy" [...] episode, and one of several which were [...] "weak and uninspired".|$|E

2500|$|Cats as yōkai in {{literature}} {{date back to}} the Kamakura period (11851333). In the collection of setsuwa (oral tradition of folktales before the 14th century), the Kokon Chomonjū, from this period, there can be seen statements pointing out cats that do strange and suspicious things, noting that [...] "these are perhaps ones that have turned into demons." [...] <b>Old</b> <b>stories</b> about bakeneko from that time period are often associated with temples, but it is thought that {{the reason for this is}} that when Buddhism came to Japan, in order to protect the sutras (sacred texts) from being chewed on by rats, cats were brought along too.|$|E
2500|$|It used to {{be common}} to hear reports of unfortunate {{incidents}} along the Ashton, such as thefts from boats and intimidating, or at least unnerving, behaviour {{on the part of}} some local youths and children.

[...] Today the Ashton Canal is increasingly valued by the communities through which it passes, and although many boaters still advise others to cover the Ashton during early hours, and not in school holidays, reports of problems often turn out to be the repeated telling of <b>old</b> <b>stories.</b> However, incidents do still occur, as in August 2014 when a number of boats were attacked by hooded youths.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{televised}} leaders' debate, Turner attacked Mulroney over the patronage machine {{that the latter}} had allegedly set up in anticipation of victory, comparing it to the Union Nationale governments of Quebec. [...] Mulroney responded by pointing to the raft of patronage appointments made {{on the advice of}} Trudeau and Turner. Turner had the right to advise Sauvé to cancel Trudeau's appointments—advice that she was bound to follow by convention—but failed to do so and added to his own. Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize to the country for what he called [...] "these horrible appointments." [...] Turner claimed that [...] "I had no option" [...] except to let them stand. Mulroney [...] responded, [...] "You had an option, sirto say 'no'and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the <b>old</b> <b>stories</b> of the Liberal Party." [...] He highlighted the Liberals long record in government and resulting patronage appointments.

2500|$|... "The Confidential {{house style}} was laden with elaborate, pun-inflected alliteration and allowed stories to suggest, rather than state, the {{existence}} of scandal." [...] But if Harrison had sworn affidavits or photographic/audio proof, the story would go beyond innuendo. Film historian Mary Desjardins described Confidentials editorial style as using [...] "research methods and writing techniques that recycled <b>old</b> <b>stories</b> or created 'composite' facts {{as the basis of}} new ones." [...] Robert Harrison himself described it thus: [...] "Once we establish the star in the hay and that's documented, we can say anything we want and I think we make them {{a hell of a lot}} more interesting than they really are. What's a guy gonna do, sue us and admit he was in the hay with the dame, but claim he didn't do all the other things we dress the story with?" [...] After the [...] "facts" [...] of an article were assembled, a staff of four would rewrite it several times to achieve Confidentials [...] "toboggan ride" [...] style: [...] "racy and free of embroidery, keeps the reader on the edge of his seat." [...] The final product would be read aloud at a staff meeting for euphony.|$|E
2500|$|Before handing {{power to}} Turner, Trudeau advised Governor General Jeanne Sauvé to appoint over 200 Liberals to {{patronage}} positions. [...] He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The {{sheer volume of}} appointments, combined with questions about the appointees' qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum. However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call an election for September 1984, almost a year before it was due. Turner's appointment deal with Trudeau came back to haunt the Liberals at the English-language debate, when Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize for not advising that the appointments be canceled—advice that Sauvé would have been required to follow by convention. Turner claimed that [...] "I had no option" [...] but to let the appointments stand, prompting Mulroney to tell him, [...] "You had an option, sir--to say 'no'--and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the <b>old</b> <b>stories</b> of the Liberal Party." [...] The Liberals never recovered from this. Combined with anger in Quebec at being left out of patriation, the Liberals were heavily defeated at the 1984 election, losing 95 seats {{in what was then}} the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level.|$|E
