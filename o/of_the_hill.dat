5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to the south-east of the town were carved into the cliff's monolithic stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its lowest point, is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} dozens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> inside Ina. They have very diverse sizes and rounded amoeba-like edges, like drops of mercury. Many {{of them are}} {{connected}} with other hills or with edge of depression. They are rather low (5-25, usually 10-15 m). Their tops are flat or slightly rounded, but the slopes are very steep. Edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> are usually very sharp. Often they are surrounded by a little moat. Boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> and lowland has the same appearance as <b>the</b> outer boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depression. <b>The</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> is very smooth compared to the lowlands. In addition, although the sample size is not great, <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> do have an impact crater density intermediate between the fresh lowlands and the ancient neighboring plains of Lacus Felicitatis.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with the}} geology, <b>the</b> biology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black <b>Hills</b> is complex. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hills</b> are a fire-climax ponderosa pine forest, with Black Hills spruce (Picea glauca var. densata) {{occurring}} in cool moist valleys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern <b>Hills.</b> Oddly, this endemic variety of spruce {{does not occur}} in the moist Bear Lodge Mountains, which make up most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wyoming portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black <b>Hills.</b> Large open parks (mountain meadows) with lush grassland rather than forest are scattered through <b>the</b> <b>Hills</b> (especially <b>the</b> western portion), and <b>the</b> southern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hills,</b> due to <b>the</b> rainshadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> higher elevations, are covered by a dry pine savannah, with stands of mountain mahogany and Rocky Mountain juniper.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> low rolling <b>hills</b> to <b>the</b> south {{extend to}} Dunfermline. Although less {{dramatic}} than <b>the</b> Lomond <b>Hills</b> to their east {{they do have}} <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> being low enough to accommodate a road across. Several small lochs including Loch Glow and the Black Loch lie amongst <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> Loch Fitty lies on <b>the</b> southern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> <b>The</b> highest point is Dunglow (379m). Knockhill Racing Circuit lies at <b>the</b> western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b>|$|R
5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the table to the placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E
5|$|One legend {{states that}} when Andrew the Apostle visited the {{uninhabited}} {{mountains in the}} mid-stream of the Dnieper River (today's Andriyvskyy Descent area), he put up a cross atop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> where the descent starts and prophesied a foundation of a great Christian city. Since that time, wooden churches sprang up around in the vicinity, completing his prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> {{is used to}} generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E

There are two falls - the lower falls, {{which is a good}} picnic spot, and the higher falls, which is further uphill.

50|$|<b>The</b> main {{features}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race are <b>the</b> delightful countryside <b>of</b> Dartmoor and <b>the</b> associated <b>hills.</b> <b>The</b> total rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> is about 1200 metres (nearly 4000 ft).
