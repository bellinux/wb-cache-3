40|$|We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of selected recent <b>operational</b> <b>applications</b> of <b>satellite</b> remote sensing and marine Geographic Information Systems (GIS) procedures to the practice of sustainable aquaculture in southern Hokkaido, Japan, focusing mainly on kelp and scallop aquaculture. We also developed a suitable aquaculture site-selection model (SASSM) for suspension culture of Gagome (a kelp species) in the same region. Models for Japanese kelp and Gagome showed that the distributions of the most suitable areas for both species overlapped. Competition between kelps was especially marked along the coastline between Hakodate and Esan. In addition, we examined the impact of oceanographic environmental changes and atmospheric events on scallop and kelp aquaculture sites, demonstrating that variations in the coastal Oyashio Current and the Tsugaru Warm Current significantly influenced the growth and harvesting seasons of scallops and kelps in Funka Bay and other sections of southern Hokkaido. Because a strong El Nino event occurred in 2010, January of that year was extremely cold. The proportion of suitable areas for both scallops and kelps during their respective growing seasons contracted in 2010. Thus, shifts in oceanographic and atmospheric conditions should be incorporated into sustainability management planning for coastal scallop and kelp aquaculture in southern Hokkaido...|$|R
30|$|There was an {{immediate}} international response and reaction after the main shock at 05 : 54 local time at 27 May 2006. Approximately 100 response operations reacted quickly and brought to a rapid acquisition of satellite imagery to support the preliminary damage assessment process. A variety of damage maps were available in {{a week after the}} earthquake. Those damage maps mostly were produced by UN Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)’s <b>Operational</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Applications</b> Programs (UNOSAT) (Kerle, 2010). The rapid ground survey was conducted by the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) in Yogyakarta. As a result, an extensive database of building type, function and construction material of affected buildings were made available soon after the earthquake.|$|R

40|$|Remote sensing {{continues}} to be an invaluable tool in earthquake damage assessments and emergency response. This study evaluates the effectiveness of multilayer feedforward neural networks, radial basis neural networks, and Random Forests in detecting earthquake damage caused by the 2010 Port-au-Prince, Haiti 7. 0 moment magnitude (Mw) event. Additionally, textural and structural features including entropy, dissimilarity, Laplacian of Gaussian, and rectangular fit are investigated as key variables for high spatial resolution imagery classification. Our findings show that each of the algorithms achieved nearly a 90 % kernel density match using the United Nations <b>Operational</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Applications</b> Programme (UNITAR/UNOSAT) dataset as validation. The multilayer feedforward network was able to achieve an error rate below 40 % in detecting damaged buildings. Spatial features of texture and structure were far more important in algorithmic classification than spectral information, highlighting the potential for future implementation of machine learning algorithms which use panchromatic or pansharpened imagery alone...|$|R
40|$|A low power, dc arcjet {{thruster}} {{was tested}} for starting reliability using hydrogen-nitrogen mixtures simulating the decomposition products of hydrazine. More than 300 starts were accumulated in phases with extended burn-in periods interlaced. A {{high degree of}} flow stabilization was built into the arcjet and the power supply incorporated both rapid current regulation and a high voltage, pulsed starting circuit. A nominal current level of 10 A was maintained throughout the test. Photomicrographs of the cathode tip showed a rapid recession to a steady-state operating geometry. A target of 300 starts was selected, as this represents significantly more than anticipated (150 to 240), in missions of 10 yr or less duration. Weighings showed no apparent mass loss. Some anode erosion was observed, particularly {{at the entrance to}} the constrictor. This was attributed to the brief period during startup the arc mode attachment point spends in the high pressure region upstream of the nozzle. Based on the results obtained, startup does not appear to be performance or life limiting for the number of starts typical of <b>operational</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R
2500|$|On 19 September 2016, a UN/Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) aid convoy was {{attacked}} at night, {{as well as}} a SARC warehouse and health clinic in Urum al-Kubra, a rebel-held town 12km west of Aleppo. 20 civilians and one SARC staff member were killed, while food and medical aid, intended to reach Aleppo, was destroyed. Some witnesses on the ground {{at the time of the}} attack claimed to have heard helicopters during the attack. The United States accused Russian or Syrian government warplanes of perpetrating the attack, while Russia rejected the accusation. The UN said it was not in a position to determine how the attacked unfolded. The UN <b>Operational</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Applications</b> Programme (UNOSAT) said it believed the convoy was attack by airstrikes. United Nations investigators later concluded that the Syrian government was responsible for the attack in a [...] "meticulously planned and ruthlessly carried out" [...] air strike. The investigators stated in a report that the Syrian Air Force used barrel bombs and rockets to attack the convoy and that, after the initial attack, Syrian government jets strafed the survivors. According to the investigators, since these actions were carried out deliberately they constituted a war crime.|$|R

40|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Haiti earthquake of 12 January 2010, a joint work for the estimation of damage to the building stock based on aerial images was carried out by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) <b>Operational</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Applications</b> Programme (UNOSAT), the European Commission (EC) Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the World Bank/ ImageCAT in support of the Post Disaster Needs Assessment and Recovery Framework (PDNA). A targeted field campaign was led to the areas affected by the disaster in collaboration with the Centre National d’Information Géo-Spatial (CNIGS) representing the Government of Haiti with the purpose of validating the remote sensing based damage assessment. These two methodologies for collecting data resulted in two data sets of the damaged buildings categorised according to European Macroseismic Scale (EMS- 98) damage grades. The present study makes use of these data for the derivation of empirical fragility functions. Fragility functions for different urban zones of Haiti, i. e. low-, medium- and high-density built-up zones and shanty zone, are developed from the remote sensing damage assessment data. Structural fragilities for buildings grouped with respect to material type and number of stories are derived on the basis of observed damage data collected through field surveys. JRC.

It {{took place}} in Geneva & Dardagny, Switzerland from 11 to 13 September 2013. 74 {{participants}} from UN and EC stakeholders, NGOs, civil protection bodies, academia, and industry attended the workshop. The workshop's purpose was to present, demonstrate, and explore the state-of-the-art and future potential of unmanned aerial systems for rapid mapping applications {{in the context of}} humanitarian crisis aid and natural disaster relief operations. Main impressions from the workshop were the diversity in technological solutions for various practical uses, the rapid turnaround time from flight to having useable data at hand in the field and a reality check on what are still challenges related to flight permissions. Within the European Union a process on the harmonisation of the diverse regulations for UAS operations and the introduction of UAS into the civil airspace is ongoing. The UAS technology will most likely make a large impact on data collection in future emergency situations.
