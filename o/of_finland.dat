5|$|Even though Thomas is {{the first}} known Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Finland,</b> {{it is certain that}} he was not the first bishop overall. An unnamed Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> is {{mentioned}} dead in a letter by Pope Innocent III already in 1209. A 15th-century chronicle names bishops Henry, Rodulff and Folquinus before him, but no indisputable records survive of them.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with his}} alleged murderer Lalli, Henry {{remains one of}} the most {{recognized}} people from the early history <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> His feast is celebrated by the majority Lutheran Church <b>of</b> <b>Finland,</b> as well as by the Roman Catholic Church <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> He is commemorated in the liturgical calendars of several Protestant and Anglican churches.|$|E

5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger {{than at any other time}} in history, and almost every usable horse <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1918, under {{pressure}} by Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, Friedrich Karl, brother-in-law of German Emperor William II, {{to become the}} King <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> Eventually, General Rüdiger von der Goltz was able to utilize the weakness <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> for the power political benefit of the German Empire. All this diminished Finnish sovereignty. The Finns, both right and left, had achieved independence on 6 December 1917 without a gunshot, but then compromised it by allowing the Germans to enter the country without difficulty during the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Finland {{was a part}} of Sweden {{from the}} 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to Russia in 1809. Swedish was the sole {{administrative}} language until 1902 as well as the dominant language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917. The percentage of Swedish speakers in Finland has steadily decreased since then. The Swedish-speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland and Nyland where the percentage <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> Swedes partly is high, with Swedish being spoken by more than 90% of the population in several municipalities, and on Åland, where Swedish is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language. Swedish is an official language also in the rest <b>of</b> <b>Finland,</b> though, with the same official status as Finnish. The country's public broadcaster, Yle, provides two Swedish-language radio stations, Yle Vega and Yle X3M, as well a TV channel, Yle Fem.|$|E

5|$|In early 1833, {{medical doctor}} Elias Lönnrot, {{best known for}} {{compiling}} Kalevala, the national epic <b>of</b> <b>Finland,</b> was appointed district physician in Kajaani and was assigned to assist {{in dealing with the}} typhoid and cholera epidemic which was raging during the 1830s. Disease was difficult to treat and he soon fell ill himself with typhus at the end of February 1833 but recovered. Kajaani was severely affected by famine in 1867-1868 which devastated much <b>of</b> <b>Finland,</b> but the town gradually recovered {{and by the end of}} the century had grown to more than 1200 inhabitants. Kajaani Town Hall was built in 1831, the former City Library in 1852, Kainuu's first elementary school in 1883, and Kajaani Church in 1896 as it grew into a notable settlement.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid up each winter when the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> froze. Bronenosets was {{reclassified}} as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. During 1903, the ship was converted into a coal barge by the removal of her turret, her side armor, and its wooden backing, and by the division of her hull into three holds. She was redesignated as Barzha No. 34, Barzha No. 51 and, in 1914, Barzha No. 324. The ship sank in a storm in the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> sometime during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bones}} in Turku were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a {{transfer}} to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> in the Great Northern War. The man behind the idea was the infamous Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side {{during the war and}} {{was in charge of the}} grim occupation <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Siuntio, and studied at the University of Helsinki where the nationalistic {{movement}} struggle between the Fennomans and the Svecomans was raging.
