5|$|Florian Witold Znaniecki (15 January 1882– 23 March 1958) was a Polish {{philosopher and}} {{sociologist}} who taught and wrote in Poland {{and in the}} United States.

He remains a major figure in the history <b>of</b> <b>Polish</b> and American sociology; the founder <b>of</b> <b>Polish</b> academic sociology, and of an entire school of thought in sociology. He won international renown as co-author, with William I. Thomas, of the study, The Polish Peasant in Europe and America (1918–20), which is considered the foundation of modern empirical sociology. He also made major contributions to sociological theory, introducing terms such as humanistic coefficient and culturalism.|$|E

During the {{transferring}} {{process of}} the large die surfaces, there are extensive needs <b>of</b> die surface <b>polishing.</b> Since almost large die surfaces are free-form surfaces, currently, these are almost manually implemented.

40|$|Abstract.

Such attributes are influenced by the lithotype texture and colour characteristics and by the degree and quality <b>of</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>of</b> the exposed surfaces.

30|$|A {{similarly}} well-performing {{model was}} built for the identification <b>of</b> <b>polishing.</b> 74 out <b>of</b> 104 samples were selected randomly for calibration and 30 samples were used for independent validation.

Although validation is highly satisfactory, it is worth emphasizing that the model was built based on visual (and thus subjective) assessment of the presence <b>of</b> <b>polishing.</b> It {{might be possible to}} improve the predictive value of this classification model by confirming the presence <b>of</b> <b>polishing</b> with SEM and FTIR; however, as it is, the model is useful for collection surveys where visual assessment of the presence <b>of</b> <b>polishing</b> is too time consuming in comparison with the NIR method.|$|R

5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss <b>of</b> <b>Polish</b> statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial <b>of</b> <b>Polish</b> uniqueness.|$|E
