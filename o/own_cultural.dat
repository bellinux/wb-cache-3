25|$|At {{the end of}} 1985, at {{the first}} prehispanic {{societies}} meeting, {{in relation to the}} Chupícuaro culture it was noted, that Chupícuaro tradition ceramics manufacturing groups, should be considered part of Mesoamerican stratified societies, with a definite political and territorial structure and not as isolated village societies, lacking ceremonial centers and architecture. From that first impulse, subsequent social groups presented <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> expressions, at regional level in the Mesoamerican context.|$|E

25|$|Murray {{is perhaps}} now {{best known for}} his verse {{translations}} of Greek drama, which were popular and prominent in their time. As a poet he was generally taken to be a follower of Swinburne and had little sympathy from the modernist poets of the rising generation. The staging of Athenian drama in English did have its <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> impact. He had earlier experimented with his own prose dramas, without much success.|$|E

25|$|The sinicization of the Lingnan {{region was}} largely {{complete}} {{by the time}} of late Southern Song Dynasty (12th to 13th century). During 15th to 18th century, Lingnan (especially the area around Guangzhou) served as one of the main ports for the Ming Empire. Cantonese people were exposed to Western European cultures and incorporated European elements into their <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> artifacts. It was by that time when Lingnan culture has largely attained its current form.|$|E
25|$|Some Francophone and Germanophone {{scholars}} {{reject the}} others' claim to Gambrinus as an appropriation {{of one of}} their <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> heroes. Aventinus' account did not just establish a claim to Gambrivius, but to a glorious ancestry and heritage. The myths also reimagined Gambrivius as a catalyst for the enlargement of the territory of a Germanic people (the Gambrivii), and made him a divine conduit into Germania for the Egyptians' ancient beer lore.|$|E

25|$|Indigenous communities, peoples, {{and nations}} are those that, having a {{historical}} continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from {{other sectors of}} the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them.

25|$|The {{experiences}} {{children go}} through {{during times of}} armed conflict can impede their ability to learn in an educational setting. Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and immigrant students from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents. Because refugees come from various regions globally with their <b>own</b> <b>cultural,</b> religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.|$|E

25|$|Hong Kong as a {{predominant}} Chinese {{society has}} its <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> conservatism {{which could be}} found in the Confucian teachings. The conservatism of the Chinese elites was further protected under the British colonial rule in the early collaborative colonial regime between the Chinese elites and British colonialists. To facilitate its governance of the colonised, the colonial government helped consolidate the gentry's power to preserve conservative cultural values in the wake of progressive movements about Chinese nationalism such as the May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the subsequent New Culture Movement in the 1920s in China.|$|E
25|$|While {{the arrival}} of Europeans had a {{profound}} impact on the Māori way of life, many aspects of traditional society have survived into the 21st century. Māori participate fully in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, leading largely Western lifestyles while also maintaining their <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> and social customs. The traditional social strata of rangatira, tūtūā and mōkai have all but disappeared from Māori society, while the roles of tohunga and kaumātua are still present. Traditional kinship ties are also actively maintained, and the whānau in particular remains an integral part of Māori life.|$|E

25|$|In 1892 Alberta {{adopted the}} Ontario schools model, {{emphasizing}} state-run institutions that glorified {{not only the}} English language but English history and customs as well. Predominantly francophone communities in Alberta maintained some control of local schools by electing trustees sympathetic to French language and culture. Such groups as the Association Canadienne-Française de l'Alberta expected trustees to implement their <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> agenda. An additional problem francophone communities faced was the constant shortage of qualified francophone teachers during 1908-35; {{the majority of those}} hired left their positions after only a few years of service. After 1940 school consolidation largely ignored the language and culture issues of francophones.|$|E
25|$|Brazil's {{return to}} {{democracy}} in 1985 after over 20years of military authoritarian rule, {{and the subsequent}} end of rampant censorship, allowed for a new freedom of expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture. Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil's <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and Brazilian hip hop. Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to-late development of the Punk in Brazil, and that of Brazilian thrash metal. Democratic renewal also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture.|$|E

Moreover, it promotes the integration of faith and reason by imparting a deeper knowledge of {{and respect for the}} students' <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> and religious traditions {{as well as those of}} others.
