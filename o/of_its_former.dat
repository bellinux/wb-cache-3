5|$|Stroma is now abandoned, {{with the}} houses <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> {{inhabitants}} unoccupied and falling into ruin. Its population fell gradually {{through the first}} half of the 20th century as inhabitants drifted away to seek opportunities elsewhere, as economic problems and Stroma's isolation made life on the island increasingly unsupportable. From an all-time peak of 375 people in 1901, the population fell to just 12 by 1961 and the last islanders left at the end of the following year. Stroma's final abandonment came in 1997 when the lighthouse keepers and their families departed. The island is now owned by one <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> inhabitants, who uses it to graze cattle and sheep.|$|E

5|$|Although textile-related {{engineering}} declined {{with the}} processing industry, {{leading to the}} demise of both Stotts and Platts, other engineering firms existed, notably electrical and later electronic engineers Ferranti in 1896. Ferranti went into receivership in 1993, but some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> works continue in other hands. Part of the original Hollinwood site was operated by Siemens Metering and Semiconductor divisions. The remainder of the site is occupied by Mirror Colour Print Ltd; the printing division of the Trinity Mirror group, which prints and distributes thirty-six major newspapers, and employs five hundred staff.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, Sparta lost its {{position}} as a major power in Greece. Subsequent Spartan attempts to recover the losses failed and Nabis, the last sovereign ruler, was eventually murdered. Soon after, Sparta was forcibly made a member <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> rival, the Achaean League, ending several centuries of fierce political independence.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon is {{a member}} of both the Commonwealth of Nations and La Francophonie. Its foreign policy closely follows that of its main ally, France (one <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> colonial rulers). Cameroon relies heavily on France for its defence, {{although}} military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government. Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich Bakassi peninsula (however, this was resolved with the Greentree Agreement) and with Gabon's president, El Hadj Omar Bongo, over personal rivalries.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the {{uprising}} was doomed by poor communication and the overeagerness {{of some of}} the PMO activists. Piłsudski failed to discourage local PMO activists from carrying out the Sejny Uprising in the Suwałki Region. The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched {{the uprising}}, which while locally successful, led to the failure of the nationwide coup. PMO members in Lithuania stated that the Sejny uprising had damaged their reputation, and many <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> supporters rejected calls by PMO recruiters.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate. This loss of members {{resulted in a}} Klan that was a skeleton <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> self. Historians have attributed this loss of membership to ineptness and hypocrisy {{on the part of}} Klan leadership. McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with other political groups led to the sharp loss of political power and solidarity within the group.|$|E
5|$|Paris' {{cultural}} centre {{had begun to}} move to the Right Bank, after the draining <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> swampland made the land habitable and fit for crops. In 1137, a new city marketplace (where Les Halles is today) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de la Grève (Hotel de Ville). The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris' first municipal government.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian {{occupation}} of East Timor began in December 1975 and lasted until October 1999.

5|$|The {{entirety}} of modern-day NY164 was originally designated as NY312 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. When the NY312 designation was shifted south {{to its current}} location {{in the town of}} Southeast , its former routing in Patterson became part of an extended NY216, which connected with its current routing by way of modern NY311, NY292 and NY55. NY216 was truncated to its current length on January1, 1970. The portion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> alignment between NY311 and NY22 was then redesignated as NY164.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set on board a haunted galleon named the Blackwyche. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to free the soul <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> captain, Richard Cavendish. Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons. The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy. If Pendragon completely runs out of energy, a large skeletal hand will drag the player off-screen, thus killing him.|$|E

5|$|The highest forested zone on the volcano, at an {{elevation}} of , is dominated by māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as māmane–naio forest.

The palila was formerly found {{on the slopes of}} Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Hualālai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Kea—only 10% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> range—and has been declared critically endangered.|$|E
