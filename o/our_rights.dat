Beck had said, [...] "Once we sign <b>our</b> <b>rights</b> over to international law, the Constitution is officially dead."

He warns Americans that the Chinese see kindness only as weakness and thus can never respond to any type of positive reinforcement. [...] "For every Chinese, from highest to lowest," [...] he argues, [...] "all the acts of life are concentrated upon extracting, from those who mean nothing to him, what he can for the benefit of himself and his clan." [...] By contrast, he believes that the Chinese do understand force and respect strength. Therefore, he advocates that the United States forgo naive [...] "sentimentalist" [...] thinking and adopt a policy of [...] "stern insistence upon <b>our</b> <b>rights</b> without cruel abuse of our strength", including withholding further loans without strict conditions and holding on to foreign concessions and extraterritoriality.|$|E

[...] In May 1769, Washington introduced a proposal, drafted by his friend George Mason, calling for Virginia to boycott British goods until the Acts were repealed. Parliament repealed the Townshend Acts in 1770, and, for Washington at least, the crisis had passed. However, Washington regarded the passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774 as [...] "an Invasion of <b>our</b> <b>Rights</b> and Privileges". [...] In July 1774, he chaired the meeting at which the [...] "Fairfax Resolves" [...] were adopted, which called for, among other things, the convening of a Continental Congress. In August, Washington attended the First Virginia Convention, where he was selected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress.
