40|$|Using {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model of predation, this paper introduces an analytical tool for studying the macroeconomics of property crime. Rational and identical agents choose between becoming producers or criminals. Criminals are modelled as predators, who try to steal goods from producers. Producers can deter criminals by allocating some of their resources to protecting their property. The public authority attempts to apprehend and convict criminals by operating the police and a court of justice. The main focus in our analysis is on the interaction {{between public and private}} measures against crime. In addition, our analysis takes a new approach to modelling the supply of <b>offenses.</b> <b>Our</b> model returns an explicit number of offenses, instead of relying on vague measures of illegitimate activities. The model is solved for simple functional forms. Calibrating the model results in very realistic values for the crime rate and the criminal population. Sensitivity analysis around these values reveals some new insight on the efficacy of deterrence policy.

The study investigates the network structure of a Mafia organization, describing its evolution and highlighting its plasticity to interventions targeting membership and its resilience to disruption caused by police operations.
