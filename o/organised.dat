40|$|Faced with {{increasing}} environmental complexity and uncertainty, organisations have been urged to replace traditional bureaucratic structures with more flexible, responsive forms of <b>organising.</b> However, the emerging paradox is that exploration and experimentation, features of {{new forms of}} <b>organising,</b> benefit from the planning, coordinating and direction-setting mechanisms that underpin traditional forms of <b>organising.</b> It is therefore important to recognise the distinctive and complementary features of traditional and new forms of <b>organising.</b> This demands a dualities-sensitive perspective which encourages, rather than tries to resolve, a constructive tension between seemingly contradictory <b>organising</b> forms such as flexibility and efficiency, autonomy and control, hierarchy and networks, focus and diversification.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Organising</b> {{pneumonia}} is {{a distinct}} histopathological entity characterized by intra-alveolar buds of granulation tissue, called Masson bodies, which mainly comprise of activated fibroblasts and loose connective tissue. This histopathologic pattern has been described in idiopathic cases, characterizing cryptogenic <b>organising</b> pneumonia {{as well as in}} the context of pulmonary infection, drug-induced pneumonitis and following lung transplantation. Although distinct as a clinical and pathological entity, community <b>organising</b> pneumonia may present with atypical clinical and pathological features, such as intra-alveolar fillings of fibrin balls and <b>organising</b> tissue that resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome or diffuse alveolar damage. The latter characteristics constitute a recently described anatomoclinical entity called acute fibrinous and <b>organising</b> pneumonia. Case presentation Here, we describe a rare case of acute fibrinous and <b>organising</b> pneumonia, in an otherwise healthy 65 -year-old Greek woman who complained of dry cough, fever, weight loss and progressive dyspnoea. She had never been a smoker. Her clinical symptoms showed a rapid deterioration in the two weeks before admission, despite a course of oral antibiotics. After excluding infection and malignancy with routine laboratory tests and flexible bronchoscopy, high resolution computed tomography and video assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy were performed. Diagnosis was based on radiological features typical of community <b>organising</b> pneumonia coupled with pathologic features characteristic of acute fibrinous and <b>organising</b> pneumonia. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and showed excellent clinical and radiological response three months after treatment initiation. Conclusion Acute fibrinous and <b>organising</b> pneumonia is an extremely rare pathologic entity, often misdiagnosed as typical community <b>organising</b> pneumonia. To our knowledge, this is the seventh case of acute fibrinous and <b>organising</b> pneumonia in the literature, with no identifiable cause or association in a female patient, with no underlying lung disease or known exposures and with an unremarkable previous medical history. We highlight the need for careful review of lung biopsies from patients with clinical and radiologic characteristics typical of community <b>organising</b> pneumonia. Although it remains uncertain whether fibrin alters the favourable prognosis and treatment response of community <b>organising</b> pneumonia, it becomes obvious that a thorough pathologic review, apart from establishing the diagnosis of acute fibrinous and <b>organising</b> pneumonia, may predict a more unfavorable outcome therefore alerting the clinician to administer more aggressive and prolonged therapeutic regimens. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{adoption}} of the <b>organising</b> model of union renewal by the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) in response to membership decline and civil service restructuring. The neoliberal stance of successive UK Governments, together with the continuing decline of union influence and membership, have led unions to reassess their organisational and recruitment strategies. The growth in union renewal has seen many unions adopt both <b>organising</b> and partnership approaches since the formal re-launch of the TUC in 1994 (Heery, 1998). Despite <b>organising</b> now being a well-established tactic deployed by many unions, evaluating its effectiveness is problematic and requires further detailed research which transcends the extent to which <b>organising</b> fits the <b>organising</b> model. The central aim of this research is to: situate debates around union <b>organising</b> in a wider historical and political context; systematically examine the issues of structure and action in relation to union <b>organising</b> and union purpose; and provide a more holistic overview of one union's approach to <b>organising</b> by examining <b>organising</b> across different (horizontal and vertical) levels of union activity in a recognised environment. Hyman's (1994) model of internal union dynamics was adopted as a framework to examine the extent to which <b>organising</b> has been embedded in the structures of the PCS and the work of Simms (2007 a) and Martinez Lucio and Stuart (2005) were applied where appropriate. The research findings extend and challenge the existing literature on union renewal with two case studies illustrating that different sections of the same union can be expected to engage with the <b>organising</b> agenda to varying degrees. This is dependent on the perceived purpose of the union amongst representatives, as well as structural factors such as the employer's organisation of services and employment, the union's own internal structures, and crucially bargaining locus and scope.
