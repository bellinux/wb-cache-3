5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{protective}} gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, because it is inert. Because of its inertness, thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> <b>and</b> high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities.|$|E
5|$|Just one sound can be {{complete}} in itself, for its complexity {{lies in the}} formulation of ma, an unquantifiable metaphysical space (duration) of dynamically tensed absence of sound. For example, in the performance of nō, the ma <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> silence does not have an organic relation for the purpose of artistic expression. Rather, these two elements contrast sharply with one another in an immaterial balance.|$|E
5|$|The term titanates usually {{refers to}} titanium(IV) compounds, as {{represented}} by barium titanate (BaTiO3). With a perovskite structure, this material exhibits piezoelectric properties and {{is used as a}} transducer in the interconversion <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> electricity. Many minerals are titanates, e.g. ilmenite (FeTiO3). Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.|$|E

5|$|The Nydalen district, {{formerly}} {{an industrial}} area, has since undergone urban redevelopment. The immediate {{vicinity of the}} station includes several large workplaces. In 2005, BI, with 8000 students and faculty, {{moved into a new}} campus across the street from Nydalen Station. Nydalen is the only underground station on the Ring Line. The escalators leading down to the platform features The Tunnel of Light, an artistic presentation <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> colour around the passengers as they ascend from or to descend to the station. The artwork contains 1800 lights and 44 speakers. Nydalen also serves as a bus hub.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> <b>and</b> is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E

25|$|When {{investigators}} analysed the 727's voice recorder, {{the recording}} {{revealed that the}} pilots believed that the shaking of the stick shaker mechanism {{was caused by the}} airliner reaching the speed <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> <b>and</b> not a warning that it was going into a stall.|$|E
25|$|Vedangas {{developed}} as ancillary studies for the Vedas, but its insights into meters, structure <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> language, grammar, linguistic analysis and other subjects influenced post-Vedic studies, arts, culture and various schools of Hindu philosophy. The Kalpa Vedanga studies, for example, {{gave rise to}} the Dharma-sutras, which later expanded into Dharma-shastras.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{linguistics}} views linguistic {{structure as}} arising continuously out of usage. Speakers are forever discovering {{new ways to}} convey meanings by producing sounds, {{and in some cases}} these novel strategies become conventionalised. Between phonological structure and semantic structure there is no causal relationship. Instead, each novel pairing <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> meaning involves an imaginative leap.|$|E

25|$|While both {{continue}} to produce music together, only Fadi currently goes on tour since Aly suffered a severe ear injury while performing and was advised to avoid loud music or risk losing the hearing in that ear altogether.

25|$|In aerodynamics, {{hypersonic}} speeds are speeds {{that are}} highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed <b>of</b> <b>sound)</b> <b>and</b> above. The hypersonic regime is {{a subset of the}} supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.|$|E
