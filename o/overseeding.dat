Applications were made in repeat monthly intervals to apply either three, four or five repeat applications beginning in December 2007, and ending in April 2008. When applied as a post emergent PGR material, TGR caused only a slight decrease in turfgrass color and quality of <b>overseeded</b> turfs in March at the high (and repeated) rate of 12. 0 oz/product/acre. This effect was short lived, as <b>overseeded</b> turfs {{for the remainder of}} the season maintained fully acceptable color and quality through the spring transition period. Tenacity turfs always had quality scores of 6. 0 or higher throughout the test. Seed head suppression was realized from TGR, with greater head suppression at the 12. 0 oz rate than that of the 8. 0 oz rate. Bermudagrass transition among TGR treated turfs was not different from that of the untreated controls, whether the turfs were <b>overseeded</b> or not. On 20 June 2008, percent bermudagrass plot cover ranged from 29 - 58 % for TGR treated turfs, 40 % for Tenacity, while the <b>overseeded</b> UTC had 35 %, on average. The percent bermudagrass increased quickly after a 2. 0 lb. /N /M application on June 20, to 68 % to 90 % bermudagrass cover for TGR treated turfs (UTC = 83 %). After a scalping event (from 1. 25 inches to 0. 50 inches) performed on July 1, percent bermudagrass decreased temporarily (from bermudagrass removal), but rebounded within 15 days to yield 96 % to 99 % bermudagrass cover by the close of the test on 31 July, 2008.

40|$|In many {{athletic}} stadiums {{around the}} world, reduced light levels from the stadium structure can significantly reduce turfgrass quality and playing characteristics. In most warm-weather stadiums, the primary surface is bermudagrass which is commonly <b>overseeded</b> with perennial ryegrass {{to provide a}} winter and spring playing surface. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effects of four shade levels on turfgrass quality and playing characteristics of <b>overseeded</b> and non-overseeded bermudagrass (cv. Riviera). Shade levels included a non-shaded control and shade treatments which blocked 30 %, 60 %, and 90 % of ambient light. These shade levels resulted in average daily PAR loads of 45. 1, 29. 6, 16. 7, and 4. 7 mol PAR / m 2 / day, respectively. Data collection included both quality and playability characteristics. The effects of shading became obvious as the study continued into early summer, with the 90 % shade plots losing almost all cover and the 60 % shade plots losing up to 40 % of coverage through mid-summer. The 30 % shade plots had a slight decline in turfgrass coverage, although, still retained close to 90 % coverage. Based on these results, a minimum daily light load of approximately 30 mol PAR / m 2 / day is needed to sustain Riviera bermudagrass at or near 100 % coverage. In the <b>overseeded</b> plots, the only shade treatment that caused a significant reduction in turfgrass coverage was the 90 % shade treatment (4. 7 mol PAR / m 2 / day). There was a significant decrease in the amount of bermudagrass present in the <b>overseeded</b> plots in mid-summer, suggesting that increased shading was causing a shift in population from the warm-season bermudagrass to the cool-season perennial ryegrass. In both <b>overseeded</b> and non-overseeded plots, rotational resistance (traction) decreased even with modest levels of shade, which is likely correlated to a decrease in turfgrass densit...|$|R
40|$|Cool-season grass {{species are}} {{commonly}} <b>overseeded</b> into bermudagrass turf for winter color. When the <b>overseeded</b> grass persists beyond the spring; however, {{it becomes a}} weed. The ability of perennial ryegrass, Italian (annual) ryegrass, intermediate ryegrass, and hybrid bluegrass to persist in bermudagrass one year after seeding was determined. Perennial ryegrass, intermediate ryegrass, and Italian ryegrass produced acceptable ground cover in the spring after fall seeding. Hybrid bluegrass did not establish well, resulting in unacceptable cover. Perennial ryegrass generally persisted the most one year after seeding, either because of summer survival of plants or because of new germination the following fall. Plant counts one year after seeding were greater in the higher seeding rate treatment compared to the lower seeding treatment rate of perennial ryegrass, suggesting new germination had occurred. Plant counts one year after seeding plots with intermediate ryegrass or Italian ryegrass were attributed primarily to latent germination and not summer survival. Applications of foramsulfuron generally did not prevent <b>overseeded</b> species stand one year after seeding, supporting the conclusion of new germination. Although quality is less with intermediate ryegrass compared to perennial ryegrass, it transitions out easier than perennial ryegrass, resulting in fewer surviving plants one year later...|$|R
40|$|Bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) golf {{greens are}} usually <b>overseeded</b> {{in the fall}} with cool-season grasses {{throughout}} the southern United States to maintain a dense, green turf while bermudagrass is dormant. However, the <b>overseeded</b> grass can delay transition back to the bermudagrass monostand the following spring and early summer. Spring management practices of reducing mowing height, delaying fertilization, and reducing soil moisture (Bruneau et al. 1985; Meyers and Horn 1970; Palmertree 1975) influence the transition of cool-season grass to bermudagrass. However, the response from vertical mowing and coring has not been consistent (Bruneau et al. 1985; Mazur and Wagner 1987). The success of management programs often depends on weather conditions and timing of cultivation treatments. Because results from the management practices vary, a herbicide that would gradually reduce the cool-season grass and permit normal bermudagrass growth during the transition period would be desirable. A uniform turfgrass cover must be maintained during the transition from <b>overseeded</b> ryegrass to bermudagrass in spring and early summer. When ryegrass dies faster than bermudagrass can fill in, the transition is poor. Ideally, the cover of bermudagrass should increase {{at the same rate}} that the cover of ryegrass decreases.

40|$|Perennial {{ryegrass}} (Lolium perenne L.) {{is commonly}} overseeded into hybrid bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. X C. transvaalensis Burtt Davy] turfs during autumn {{in the southern}} United States. <b>Overseeding</b> can provide a green, actively-growing turf throughout the winter dormancy period. Improved persistence of perennial ryegrass cultivars has increased management inputs during the spring transition period. Lower input turf systems that provide acceptable winter <b>overseeding</b> quality are preferred, and research aimed at evaluating alternative <b>overseeding</b> species are warranted. Grooming reel attachments allowing for threedimensional clipping management (3 DCM) have become increasingly used by turf managers for reducing grain and thatch, but scientific information on best management practices and canopy effects of 3 DCM-grooming are lacking. A field study was conducted at the Texas A&M Turfgrass Field Laboratory in College Station, TX (30. 6191 degrees N, 96. 3576 degrees W), to investigate the effects of <b>overseeding</b> using annual (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and perennial ryegrasses on 3 DCM-groomed and non-groomed fairway turfs of 'Tifway' hybrid bermudagrass, zoysiagrass [Zoysia matrella (L.)

Species whole main plots were split into three grooming intervals, which were further split into four <b>overseeding</b> treatments. Data were collected assessing visual turf quality, visual turf cover, leaf area index, clipping yield, shoot density, and biomass partitioning. Results indicate annual ryegrass alone and an annual/perennial ryegrass <b>overseeding</b> mix provided acceptable turf quality, but did not improve turf recovery over perennial ryegrass alone in 'Tifway' or 'Sea Isle 1 ' turfs. In 'Cavalier' turfs, summer quality was affected by <b>overseeding</b> treatment as follows: control > annual > annual/perennial > perennial.

For the initial establishment of fall overseeded bermudagrass with perennial ryegrass, Barricade and Ronstar both showed decrease in establishment at thirty days after <b>overseeding</b> (October 26) {{when compared to the}} controls. Reductions in turfgrass density after <b>overseeding</b> were realized by all pre-emergence treatments in the mid to late fall, depending on the specific treatment. Ronstar applied in one application at 2. 0 lbs AI/A noticeably reduced visual density at 30 and 65 days after <b>overseeding,</b> regardless of the application timing (6 vs. 8 weeks) before <b>overseeding.</b> Reductions in turfgrass quality paralleled the reduction in density. Barricade applied at 0. 75 lbs AI/A at 6 WBOS showed decreased quality at 30 and 65 days after <b>overseeding.</b> This same treatment caused a noticeable decrease in overall plot density at thirty days after <b>overseeding.</b> At 65 days after <b>overseeding</b> (November 30), quality was not quite fully acceptable (quality mean = 5. 8), but acceptable density was achieved (mean density = 6. 3). Poa annua (PA) established itself quickly. By November 30 (65 days after <b>overseeding)</b> overseeded- untreated control plots had between 67 %- 77 % Poa annua present. The maximum rate of PA control for Ronstar in March was 74 % (showing 15 % Poa plot cover) and 61 % in April (34 % Poa plot cover).

40|$|Spring {{transition}} of <b>overseeded</b> turf {{has become a}} major challenge to turfgrass managers in the southern United States. Turf-type ryegrasses which exhibit increased mowing and heat tolerance have made the return of bermudagrass problematic, especially in common bermudagrass. Herbicides were evaluated for use as a Spring transition agent to decrease ryegrass competition/enhance bermudagrass. Treatments of TADS 14776 experimental herbicide, Manor, Kerb and Corsair were applied to <b>overseeded</b> common bermudagrass on may 6, 2001. Application of TADS experimental herbicide at all rates above 0. 21 ounce/product increased bermuda enhancement over Kerb, Corsair and Manor, by 29 June 2001. When applied with extra fertilizer applications, the 0. 21 ounce rate of TADS was greater than that of Kerb, Corsair and Manor for bermuda transition. TADS applied at the highest rate of 0. 64 ounce (+) fertilizer, and TADS @ 0. 42 ounce (+) GENAPOL 150 surfactant and extra plot fertilizer, were the first treatments to exhibit total necrosis of the perennial ryegrass <b>overseed</b> by 4 June (1 month after treatment). However, these treatments created a poorer quality turf, compared to other treatments. TADS @ 0. 42 ounce (+) extra plot fertilizer ranked highest in bermudagrass plot cover, with five times as much bermudagrass present than untreated controls on 29 May. This same treatment continued with this trend, achieving 100 % bermudagrass cover by 29 June (highly desirable). This treatment resulted in a brief decrease in turfgrass quality at 9 and 16 days after treatment (14 May, 21 May). With that in mind, TADS @ 0. 42 ounce (+) extra plot nitrogen proved to be the best treatment that produced acceptable levels of turf quality throughout the transition, yielding the fastest re-establishment of the underlying common bermudagrass. At the close of the test on 10 July, TADS @ 0. 21 ounce (+) fertilizer and TADS @ 0. 42 ounce (+) fertilizer closed with 88 % and 99 % bermudagrass cover, and mean quality scores of 6. 0 and 7. 0 respectively.

40|$|Alfalfa stands thin {{over time}} due to pests, poor fertility, winter killing, and {{stresses}} associated with harvesting. It {{would be useful}} to be able to improve alfalfa stands by <b>overseeding</b> periodically or at specific locations in a field where plants have been lost. Numerous studies have shown that alfalfa seedlings grow very slowly and often die when placed in close proximity to established alfalfa plants. For instance, Asbil and Coulman (1992) overseeded an existing alfalfa stand with 4 or 11 lbs/A of alfalfa seed (Fig. 1). <b>Overseeding</b> had no impact on yield the year of <b>overseeding</b> and increased yield only 1 T/A in the year after <b>overseeding.</b> Plant populations increased from 1. 5 /ft 2 to 3 and 4 plants/ft 2 for plots receiving 4 and 11 lbs seed/A, respectively. At these seeding rates 18 and 55 seeds/ft 2 are planted, indicating that only 5 to 8 % of the seed resulted in new plants. This extensive death of alfalfa seedlings when seeded into an established alfalfa stand is known as autotoxicity.

When applied alone as a repeat applications, Velocity herbicide applied at 15 and 30 gm ai/a was safe on perennial ryegrass <b>overseed</b> (based on color response). Velocity was safe for the <b>overseed</b> ryegrass when tank mixed with Tourney fungicide, both with and without the addition of Primo PGR. Tourney fungicide when applied alone at either 8 or 16 oz. /product/acre produced no negative affects. As expected, Primo alone produced a dark color turf (7. 8, 7. 5, 7. 0, and 7. 0) on all four dates, respectively. Several treatments caused moderate injury to the (AB) across the entire test period. These included Velocity alone at the 15 gm/ai/a rate, and Velocity @ 30 gm ai/a plus Tourney @ 8 oz. prod/acre. The greatest amount of injury to (AB) occurred on 3 / 11 / 2008 for Velocity at 30 gm ai/a, either with or without Tourney fungicide. Although visible injury to Poa annua resulted after treatments were applied, seed head suppression was the most consistent treatment response. While injury to the Poa was severe for some treatments (Velocity plus Tourney fungicide), the Poa annua did return, ranging from re-growth as "weak plants" to an actively growing turfs (as is sometimes typical after a surviving injury response).

However, there are still difficulties associated with legume utilization including establishment and persistence. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate legume performance under herbivory. The objective of Experiment 1 was to compare forage production and beef cattle gains from annual ryegrass [Lolium multiflorum (L.) ] and bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. ] pastures fertilized with N or <b>overseeded</b> with legumes. Gelbvieh × Angus crossbred heifers (n = 40; average of 264 ± 45. 62 kg initial BW) were assigned to one of eight, 2 -ha pastures in the spring of each of the three years of the study. All pastures were <b>overseeded</b> with `Marshall 2 ̆ 7 annual ryegrass, and were not seeded with any clover (Con) or <b>overseeded</b> with `Dixie 2 ̆ 7 crimson clover [(C; Trifolium incarnatum (L.) ], `Osceola 2 ̆ 7 white clover [L; Trifolium repens (L.) ], or a combination of crimson clover and white clover (CL). Grazing initiated early- to mid-spring and continued until early- to mid-May. Total body weight (BW) gain was greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the spring season for Con compared to the legume treatments. However, average daily gain (ADG) was not different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) in spring, and there were no differences (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) in total BW gain or ADG in summer. Although clovers {{may not be able to}} entirely eliminate the need for N fertilizer, they may help reduce dependency on it by aiding in the production of cattle having similar BW gains to cattle grazing traditionally fertilized pastures. The objective of Experiment 2 was to monitor the persistence of three annual and three perennial legume species <b>overseeded</b> into common bermudagrass pastures that were rotationally stocked. The three annual species were crimson clover (cv. Dixie), arrowleaf clover [Trifolium vesiculosum (Savi), cv. Yucchi], and hairy vetch [Vicia villosa (Roth), cv. VNS]. The three perennial species were white clover (cv. Durana), red clover [Trifolium pretense (L.), cv. Cinnamon Plus], and alfalfa [Medicago sativa (L.), cv. Ameristand 403 T]. Annual clovers were managed to reseed themselves. Crimson clover persisted two years and all other annul species for three years. Among perennial legumes, only white and red clovers persisted for three years, while alfalfa stands disappeared after the second year of the study. The frequency of occurrence of weeds and other undesirable plants generally increased each year while legume populations declined in all six clover treatments.

Five of the grass types, four of which are Bermudas, are able to withstand the heat during the warm summer months of Hilton Head Island. The other two grass types are annually <b>overseeded</b> in October {{in order to keep}} the course green during the cold months. The rye grass that is planted in October is only temporary and will eventually die out when the weather warms up, and the Bermuda grass is no longer dormant.

40|$|Dormant {{bermudagrass}} (Cynodon dactlyon (L.) Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) is overseeded with {{perennial ryegrass}} (Lolium perenne L.) to maintain green color through {{the fall and}} winter. Annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) control is critical for <b>overseeding</b> success, as this weed can greatly decrease aesthetic quality and playability of turfgrass due to excessive seedhead production. Research was conducted to evaluate the infl uence of pre-seeding cultural practices (scalping, solid-tine aerifi cation, vertical mowing, and vertical mowing plus scalping) on <b>overseeding</b> establishment. The effect of increasing <b>overseeding</b> rates of perennial ryegrass (111, 222, 444, and 888 kg pure live seed·ha– 1; 100, 200, 400, and 800 lb·A– 1) and roughstalk bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.) (55, 111, and 222 kg pure live seed·ha– 1; 50, 100, and 200 lb·A– 1) on annual bluegrass populations was also investigated. Additionally, plant growth regulators (PGRs) were evaluated for annual bluegrass seedhead suppression and turf injury. Mefl uidide at 0. 056 kg ae·ha– 1 (0. 05 lb ae·A– 1), and paclobutrazol, fl urprimidol, trinexapac-ethyl, and trinexapac-ethyl plus ethephon at 0. 28, 0. 42, 0. 382, and 0. 095 plus 3. 82 kg ai·ha– 1 (0. 25, 0. 37, 0. 34, 0. 085 plus 3. 4 lb ai·A– 1), respectively, were applied twice, sequentially with a four-week interval. Contrary to previous research, pre-seeding cultural practices did not improve <b>overseeding</b> success. Annual bluegrass density decreased with increasing perennial ryegrass <b>overseeding</b> rates from 50 % in the non-overseeded to 14 to 17 % when overseeded with rates up to 222 kg pure live seed·ha– 1, and 4 to 8 % when overseeded with rates between 444 and 888 kg pure live seed·ha– 1. Roughstalk bluegrass overseeded reduced annual bluegrass density from 50 % in the non-overseeded, to 7 to 13 % when overseeded with 55, 111, or 222 kg pure live seed·ha– 1, regardless of the <b>overseeding</b> rate. <b>Overseeding</b> bermudagrass with roughstalk bluegrass or perennial ryegrass increased turfgrass green cover during winter, especially 100 days after seeding. Paclobutrazol, flurprimidol, and trinexapac-ethyl were successful at suppressing annual bluegrass seedheads and were not injurious to perennial ryegrass. Mefluidide resulted in efficient annual bluegrass seedhead suppression; however, unacceptable turfgrass injury occurred in 2012...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Deciding {{what to do}} with a {{depleted}} stand can be {{a complex}} decision in production areas with few profitable rotation crops. This decision should be based on an assessment of the productivity of the existing stand, using either production records or stand or stem density evaluations. When stand density has thinned sufficiently so that productivity or quality have declined and the stand is no longer profitable, a decision must be made regarding the fate of the stand. Management options include removing the stand and planting another crop, interseeding an annual or perennial forage species, or <b>overseeding</b> with alfalfa. <b>Overseeding</b> after the second to the last cutting of the year shows promise for increasing the alfalfa density in isolated areas of the field were the stand is poor.

40|$|White oat and {{ryegrass}} were <b>overseeded</b> on Tifton 85 pastures {{for evaluation}} of dry matter yield (DMY), leaf:stem ratio (L:S), dehydration curves and nutritional value of forages. Dry matter intake and L:S ratio were analyzed using a completely randomized blocks design with five forage growth conditions (single Tifton 85 and intercropped with white oat or ryegrass, and white oat or ryegrass intercropped with Tifton 85), whereas for drying curves, ten dehydration times were tested (0, 4, 8, 24, 28, 32, 48, 52, 56 and 71 hours after harvest) by a 5 × 10 split-plot arrangement (growth conditions of forages as main plot and dehydration times as sub-plots). The nutritive value data were analyzed in a 3 × 3 split-plot trial with single Tifton 85, Tifton 85 - Oat and Tifton 85 -Ryegrass as main plots and the three sampling times (before harvesting, at baling and 100 days after storage) as sub-plots. Oat and ryegrass showed higher L:S ratio, while the intercrops of Tifton 85 - Oat and Tifton 85 - Ryegrass presented lower DMY, but higher crude protein concentration and in vitro DM digestibility than single Tifton. Neutral and acid detergent fiber concentrations were higher for single Tifton 85. Ryegrass and white oat, <b>overseeded</b> on Tifton 85 pasture, improved the nutritional value of the hay produced; however, in a 100 -day storage period, there was a reduction in in vitro dry matter digestibility and crude protein concentrations...|$|R

Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.), also known as roughstalk bluegrass, is commonly used in the southern United States to <b>overseed</b> golf course greens, fairways, and landscape areas in the winter. Warm-season grasses go dormant and turn brown during the cool season, and rough bluegrass generally is mixed with ryegrass to maintain a lush, green color through the winter. As temperatures rise in the spring, the rough bluegrass mix dies, and the warm-season grasses come out of dormancy and become green again...|$|R
