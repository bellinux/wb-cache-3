50|$|Note {{that the}} list is {{arranged}} {{in the order of}} Cyrillic(for some unexplained reasons Chernihiv oblast goes in front of Chernivtsi oblast). For example, the territorial highway 22 in Rivne Oblast would be identified as T-18-22 where 18 is the index for the Rivne Oblast. The T-network (Territorial) {{as the rest of the}} roads networks of local importance differs per oblast, but the road numbering itself consists of two digits. The Oblast network (<b>O-network),</b> on the other hand, has the same concept of T-network, but the road numbering contains four digits and the code does not have the hyphen as in T-networks. For example, a highway in Kharkiv Oblast would have code O-21xxxx.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{the framework}} of linear response theory the complete phonon dispersion, phonon induced electronic charge response, electron-phonon interaction and dielectric and infrared properties of the high-temperature superconductors (HTSC's). In particular the experimentally observed strong renormalization of the in-plane oxygen bond-stretching modes (OBSM) which appear upon doping in the HTSC's is discussed. It is shown that the characteristic softening, indicating a strong EPI, is most likely a generic effect of the CuO plane and is driven by a nonlocal coupling of the displaced ions to the localized charge-fluctuations (CF's) at the Cu and O ions. The different behaviour of the OBSM during the insulator-metal transition via the underdoped phase is calculated and from a comparison of these modes conclusions about the electronic state in the HTSC's are drawn. The underdoped state is modelled in terms of a charge response which is insulator-like at the Cu and is competing with a metallic charge response at the <b>O-network</b> in the CuO plane. For the non-cuprate HTSC Ba-Bi-O also a strong renormalization of the OBSM is predicted. C-axis polarized infrared and Raman-active modes of the HTSC's are calculated in terms of CF's and anisotropic dipole-fluctuations and the problem of a metallic character of the BiO planes is studied. Interlayer phonons and their accompanying charge response are investigated. Depending on the interlayer coupling calculations are performed from the static, adiabatic- to the non-adiabatic regime. It is shown that phonon-plasmon mixing and a strong long-ranged non-adiabatic EPI becomes evident within a certain region around the c-axis. Both the OBSM and the non-adiabatic coupled c-axis phonon-plasmon modes are found to be important for pairing in the HTSC's. Comment: 65 pages, 20 figures.
