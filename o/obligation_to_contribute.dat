More specifically, we account for the results from a panel study on the effects of a course on SD held in autumn 2010 at the University of Gothenburg (n = 323) on teacher education students. The surveys consisted of questions about the students’ concerns about various issues, including issues related to SD, and their attitudes towards SD and views of moral <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> SD. The study included a control group (n = 97) consisting of students from the teacher-training programme at University West, which had not and did not include ESD.

40|$|The central {{challenge}} facing {{the global economy}} and financial system today is the failure of countries to limit {{the negative effects of}} their policies on other countries and on global economic and financial stability. The most prominent manifestations of this challenge are the balance-of-payments adjustment process and the notorious asymmetry therein, spillovers from other countries' financial-sector policies such as those involved in the crisis of 2007 - 10, and the prospect of sustained unbalanced growth in the global economy with some countries overheating and others facing substantial excess capacity. Truman proposes an approach to strengthen International Monetary Fund (IMF) surveillance over the economic and financial policies of its member countries [...] an approach that builds on members' IMF obligations with a view to producing significant promise of affecting their policy choices. His proposed approach has five integrated components: (1) updated obligations of IMF membership, (2) development of a set of norms to guide members in meeting those obligations, (3) a process to apply judgment in monitoring compliance with those obligations via the use of the norms, (4) accountability in the application of such judgment based on transparency, and (5) potential consequences for member countries that are judged not to have complied with their obligations. The crux of the approach is to enhance IMF members' <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> global economic and financial stability and to strengthen IMF surveillance of those obligations through the use of norms and a transparent peer review process that leads to improved policies and outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} Te Aute College to Maori advancement by exploring the whakapapa of Te Aute College and the brand that has developed out of the school’s whakapapa from its beginnings in 1854 prior to major European settlement in the Hawkes Bay through to the 21 st century. In doing so, the notion of whakapapa is used to reveal the layers of tradition, history, connections, narratives, achievements and setbacks that have enabled the realisation of Maori potential {{and the ability of}} Te Aute College to sustain a contribution to the advancement of Maori. This thesis contends that the contribution of Te Aute College to Maori advancement stems from its whakapapa and its brand that is unequivocally Te Aute in focus and character. An Indigenous Maori research paradigm, a whakapapa research methodology, provides the context for researching Te Aute College, the basis of this thesis. The thesis also explores whakapapa as a tool that {{can be used as a}} legitimate research framework when engaging in Maori research. It posits an Indigenous Maori research approach as a paradigm base for a philosophical and theoretical discourse when researching Maori institutions and communities. This thesis signifies the continuation of both a personal and professional journey that originates from the author’s enduring interest in and sense of <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the story of Te Aute College. The initial thesis discourse contextualises the research through a historical chronology of the tangata whenua connection to the research community; of the first 150 years of Te Aute College providing education for predominantly young male Maori and of the ‘special character’ education that is offered by Te Aute College today. Three interconnecting themes provide the systematic basis for exploring the distinctive yet simultaneously universal layers of Te Aute College that emerged as significant to this research; the Te Aute Experience, the contribution of Te Aute College and He Toa Takitini - Collaboration. Finally, an analysis is given of these themes in conjunction with the whakapapa of Te Aute College and the future role of Te Aute College in sustaining its contribution to the advancement of Maori...|$|R
