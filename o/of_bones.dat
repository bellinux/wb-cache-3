30|$|Bone {{quality is}} a generic {{term for the}} {{characterization}} <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> tissue in three dimensions: the structural quality, related to the amount <b>of</b> the cortical <b>bone</b> and to the trabecular bone pattern; the bone density, related to the amount <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> mineralization and/or the amount <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> by its volume; and the amount <b>of</b> <b>bone,</b> related to the volume <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> available [3]. Bone quality varies intra- and inter-subject depending on the thickness <b>of</b> cortical <b>bone,</b> the amount <b>of</b> trabecular <b>bone,</b> and the amount <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> tissue mineralization {{in the region of}} interest for implant placement [4]. Some classifications <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> quality have considered cortical bone thickness and trabecular bone structure based on preoperative panoramic radiographs and tactile perception during exploratory drilling of the implant site; bone density based on the tactile sensation and Hounsfield units of computed tomography (CT) images; radiographic pattern of trabecular bone; and intra-surgical bone density and biopsy with histomorphometric evaluation [5 – 8]. However, most classifications <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> quality for routine clinical use still are not validated by using objective and subjective assessment methods.|$|R

40|$|Bone is {{a dynamic}} tissue that is {{constantly}} undergoing remodeling or turnover, a requirement for maintenance <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> health.

5|$|The {{human body}} absorbs {{strontium}} {{as if it}} were its lighter congener calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant health threat. The average human has an intake of about two milligrams of strontium a day.

5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening <b>of</b> <b>bones,</b> known as osteomalacia.|$|E
30|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> {{augmentation}} {{prior to}} dental implant placement should facilitate the formation <b>of</b> good quality <b>bone</b> with minimal loss <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> volume during healing [3].

5|$|Cetotheriidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the pygmy right whale (Caperea marginata). The first descriptions {{date back to the}} 1840s <b>of</b> <b>bones</b> and baleen plates resembling a smaller version of the right whale, and was named Balaena marginata. In 1864, it was moved into the genus Caperea after a skull of another specimen was discovered. Six years later, the pygmy right whale was classified under the family Neobalaenidae. Despite its name, the pygmy right whale is more genetically similar to rorquals and gray whales than to right whales. A study published in 2012, based on bone structure, moved the pygmy right whale from the family Neobalaenidae to the family Cetotheriidae, making it a living fossil; Neobalaenidae was elevated down to subfamily level as Neobalaeninae.|$|E
5|$|Deterioration of whale {{carcasses}} happens {{though a}} series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months, and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization <b>of</b> <b>bones</b> and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E
5|$|EFS, {{a system}} {{found on the}} surface <b>of</b> <b>bones,</b> is thought to show a growth plateau which {{indicates}} that maximum body size and skeletal maturity is reached in an individual. Ampelosaurus has not been known to have EFS, found on most non-titanosaurian sauropods. Magyarosaurus, a closely related titanosaur, Lirainosaurus, a titanosaur related to saltasaurids, Alamosaurus, a saltasaurid, and Phuwiangosaurus, a very basal titanosaur, were also found to have lacked EFS. However, the basal macronarian Europasaurus {{has been shown to}} have had EFS, so it was likely just titanosaurians that did not have them. The outer edge of the bones, were EFS would have been found, was well-preserved, and still lacked any fossilized proof of them being present for Ampelosaurus. However, in the PLoS ONE study that found the lack of EFS, the larger specimens were not tested, so Ampelosaurus might have had EFS. This is characteristic of titanosaurs, as diplodocoids and basal macronarians seem to have EFS. A majority of all Ampelosaurus specimens have been found with secondary osteons placed densely in the inner regions <b>of</b> <b>bones,</b> and lightly in outer regions. The osteon orientation found in Ampelosaurus of osteons not only facing across the bone is not typical of Neosauropoda. Also, there is no medullary cavity in any bones of Ampelosaurus. Ampelosaurus seems to have had many ontogenetic stages in its life based on its bone histology.|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{currently}} available anti-osteoporosis medications promptly and significantly influence the rate <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> turnover.

40|$|Age-related {{bone loss}} and {{postmenopausal}} osteoporosis {{are due to}} a dysregulation <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> remodelling in which less bone is reformed than resorbed. This dysregulation <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> remodelling does not occur with equal strength in all <b>bone</b> regions. Loss <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> is more pronounced near the endocortical surface. This leads to thinning of the cortical wall proceeding from the endosteum, a process sometimes called ‘trabecularisation’. In this paper, we investigate {{the influence of the}} nonuniform distribution <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> surface within bone tissue for osteoporotic bone losses. We use a spatio-temporal computational model <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> remodelling in which microstructural changes <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> tissue are represented by a phenomenological relationship between bone specific surface and bone porosity. The simulation of an osteoporotic condition by our model shows that the evolution <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> porosity within a bone cross section is significantly influenced by the nonuniform availability <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> surface. Greater bone loss occurs near the endocortical wall, leading to cortical wall thinning and to an expansion of the medullary cavity similar to cross-sectional observations from human femur midshafts. Our model suggests that the rate of cortical wall thinning is fast/slow in the presence/absence of an adjacent trabecular or trabecularised bone compartment...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{remodeling}} {{involves the}} coordinated removal <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> by osteoclasts and addition <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> by osteoblasts, {{a process that}} is modulated by the prevailing mechanical environment.

As for mechanoregulation, bone remodeling is controlled proportionally to the microscopic strain energy density, on the observation scale where the sensing of the mechanical loading actually takes place, estimated by means of continuum micromechanics-based strain concentration. This new approach allows us to address how biochemical changes influence bone remodeling and thus affect the composition and mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>bone,</b> and what mechanisms are responsible for mechanoregulation <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> remodeling. Numerical studies highlight the capabilities of the model: we demonstrate that computationally simulated changes <b>of</b> the <b>bone</b> constituent volume fractions are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations for disuse syndromes...|$|R
