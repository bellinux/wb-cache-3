40|$|Single sheet {{graphene}} (SG) is {{an innovative}} transparent material with high electrical and thermal conduction {{the use of}} which in transparent electrodes instead of traditional materials improves the performance of optoelectronic devices. In this study, graphene oxide (GO) has been obtained by a modified Hummer`s method followed by an advanced technique of water removal (lyophilisation). The Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method was applied to transfer GO from suspension to substrate. To optimize the deposition process, as suspending and spreading solvents the benzene and benzene/methanol mixtures were chosen instead of previously studied water suspensions. The number of GO layers in suspension is reduced by exfoliation {{in order to obtain}} a single GO monolayer. For this purpose, sonication and centrifugation of GO sheets are carried out. Finally, the effect of variously treated glass substrate surfaces on the deposition efficiency has been studied. In the work, it is shown that <b>ozonization</b> <b>of</b> glass substrate improves the deposition outcome, while <b>ozonization</b> <b>of</b> indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate is necessary to perform such deposition.

Unsaturated fatty acids and triacylglycerols decrease with ozone applied dosage due to ozone reaction with double bonds. Small amounts of oleic acid were consumed with applied ozone dosage at 35 mg/g, which demonstrated that peroxide values and oxygen content were not principally increased by the ozone attack on the double bonds, but other mechanisms could {{be involved in the}} reaction system...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ozonization</b> <b>of</b> 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 4 -nitroaniline (NA) was {{conducted}} in completely mixed reactors by semi-batch tests. At pH 7 both direkt and radical reactions contribute to the oxidation of the nitroaromatic compounds. In a partially mass transfer- limited reaction a specific ozone absorption of A* = 3. 0 [...] . 3. 5 g g-' was measured for a 398 % elimination of the target compounds. About 80 [...] . 90 % of the input ozone were absorbed and 10 [...] . 20 % left the system unreacted. At pH 7 the degree of DOC reduction increased linearly with the specific ozone absorption to final values of 35 % (NA) and 44 % (DNT) respectively. Subsequent biodegradation of the oxidation products by non-acclimated bacteria increased the degree of mineralization to 75 %. Compared to ozonization alone 35 and 50 % of ozone were thus saved by the sequential chemical-biological process. Batch tests with a real wastewater from the alkaline hydrolysis of a mixture of 2, 4, 6 - Trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1, 3 -Dinit rotoluene (DNB) confirmed the approach. No reduction in the required ozone dosage was achieved in a completely mixed continuous system <b>of</b> <b>ozonization</b> followed by biodegradation even when compared to batch ozonization alone. Therefore, the reduction of longitudinal mixing in continuous <b>ozonization</b> systems is <b>of</b> fundamental importance...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided in two {{independent}} parts. The work {{described in the}} first part involves {{the development of a new}} system for the synthesis of organic-inorganic hybrids utilizing ozone and silicon chemistry. ^ Polydimethylsiloxane proved to be resistant to ozone over 24 hr. This indicates that the Si-CH 3 group is resistant to ozone attack. Investigation <b>of</b> the <b>ozonization</b> <b>of</b> phenyl-containing siloxane copolymers (PSX- 80) suggested that ozone attack takes place in two steps. In the first step ozone attacks and breaks the aromatic ring attached to silicon and subsequently the weakened Si-C moiety is cleaved to form the siloxane group. ^ Mixtures of phenylsilane with several hydrosiloxanes having variable amount of hydride content were oxidized in order to effect hybridization. <b>Ozonization</b> <b>of</b> phenylsilane (PhSiH 3) generates the inorganic component of the hybrid material, while the organic constituent is due to the siloxane polymers. The ability to vary the hydride concentration on the polymer backbone enables the control of the inorganic content of the hybrid. The hybrid materials exhibit low surface polarity and high thermal stability which depends on the inorganic content of the material. ^ Application of ozonized hydrosiloxanes as coatings for cellulose paper was investigated. Contact angle and tensile testing data suggested that even the smallest amount of silicone coating dramatically affects the surface behavior and the wet strength of the cellulose paper. ^ In the second part of this document the mechanical properties of oriented elastomers at low temperatures are investigated. A dramatic increase, to the levels of high performance plastics, was observed in the modulus and strength of the oriented elastomers (∼ 32 GPa, 1. 2 GPa). ^ A polyetherimide-b-polystyrene ABA type block copolymer was synthesized and its properties were examined. The weak and brittle behavior of the copolymer indicated that a higher molecular weight soft segment (polystyrene) is necessary in order to perform tensile testing in the elongated state. ...|$|R
40|$|Chlorination, {{oxidation}} with {{nitric acid}} and <b>ozonization</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids adsorbed on different materials (Al_ 2 O_ 3, SiO_ 2, BaSO_ 4) were studied {{with respect to}} regioselective chemical CH oxidation and compared with the Fe (II) -catalized fatty acid oxidation by amine N-oxides {{in the presence of}} trifluoroacetic acid. Hydroxylation with amine N-oxides yields the highest product selectivity and regionalselectivity with respect to terminal hydroxyfatty acids. Dry ozonolysis of fatty acids adsorbed on silica gel yields 80 - 90 % oxofatty acids. By fermentation of oleic acid with candida tropicalis 50 % cis- 9 -octadecene- 1, 18 -diacid is obtained.
