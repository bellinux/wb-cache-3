40|$|A major {{drawback}} {{of artificial}} intelligence systems {{that rely on}} declarative representations is that the efficiency of reasoning degrades quickly as {{the size of the}} knowledge base increases. To address this problem when building a system, we need to acquire not only knowledge about the domain, but also knowledge about control of reasoning. In this paper, we discuss one type of such control knowledge, namely, relevance of our knowledge to specific problem solving goals. We show how this knowledge can be used by the problem solver either to ignore part of its knowledge or to automatically create abstractions and how the system can guide the acquisition of such knowledge.

40|$|The wave {{of strikes}} in the {{logistics}} sector since 2008 {{is by far}} the most important struggle that has developed in Italy in the wake of the global economic crisis. In this article we reflect on its potential for the renewal of the labour movement. We ground <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> analysis of global production transformations and migration as a factor of working class re-composition. We show that in Italy the crisis is determining an acute process of deindustrialisation, while austerity and harshening immigration restrictions are reinforcing the deregulation and racialisation of employment relation. Deindustrialisation, however, is matched by the growth of the logistics sector and its reorganisation along the lines of Just-in-Time production, which actually strengthens workers’ bargaining power at the point of production. After describing working conditions in the sector, we present the main characteristics of logistics struggles. The mainly immigrant logistics workers have been able to exercise their power through blockades and strikes, obtaining improved agreements with some of the main logistics companies. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> context of increasingly generalised precarity, these struggles can inspire workers in other sectors and promote a process of international class re-composition...|$|R

40|$|How can social {{psychological}} research {{contribute to}} the development of increasingly powerful marital therapies? This question is of interest to both social psychologists and clinical researchers. The natural partnership between social and clinical psychology has a long past (cf. Morton Prince and Floyd Allport’s establishment of Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology in 1921) and has been reiterated on many occasions (e. g., Brehm, 1976; Kanfer & Scheft, 1988; Snyder & Forsyth, 1991 among many others). However, in the marital area it is a partnership that has been strained for several years by the view of many marital therapy researchers that theory may be irrelevant to the advancement of treatment efficacy. Because the partnership between social psychology and marital therapy research is one that neither side can afford to abandon, it is prudent to examine this view carefully in terms of its origins, various forms, and accuracy. Agenda and Rationale The chapter begins by situating <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> broader literature on the interface between social and clinical psychology. We then consider the role of social psychology in the origins and development of Behavioral Marital Therapy (BMT). In doing so, we identify developments that led to some of its more prominent offspring (e. g., Integrative Couple Therapy...|$|E
40|$|We study a {{modification}} of the Evolutionary Minority Game (EMG) in which agents are placed in the nodes of a regular or a random graph. A neighborhood for each agent can thus be defined and {{a modification}} of the usual relaxation dynamics {{can be made in}} which each agent updates her decision scheme depending upon the options made in her immediate neighborhood. We name this model the Local Evolutionary Minority Game (LEMG). We report numerical results for the topologies of a ring, a torus and a random graph changing the size of the neighborhood. We focus <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> one dimensional system and perform a detailed comparison of the results obtained from the random relaxation dynamics of the LEMG and from a linear chain of interacting spin-like variables at a finite temperature. We provide a physical interpretation of the surprising result that in the LEMG a better coordination (a lower frustration) is achieved if agents base their actions on local information. We show how the LEMG can be regarded as a model that gradually interpolates between a fully ordered, antiferromagnetic system and a fully disordered system that can be assimilated to a spin glass.

40|$|Most {{requirements}} engineering (RE) {{research and practice}} embodies a philosophy that we will call abstractionism, which involves the building of simplified models of domains of discourse and proposed systems. Abstractionists make much use of formal models, such as goal dependency networks. An alternative design philosophy is contextualism, according to which the peculiarities of the context of use of a system must be understood in detail before the requirements can be derived. Contextualists use qualitative methods to uncover and help interpret these particularities. In this paper, we analyze {{what it would mean}} to combine the best features of abstractionism and contextualism, and we ground <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> illustration of abstractionist and contextualist thinking about RE through goal refinement (GR). In the context of the domain of meeting scheduling, we contrast a wholly abstractionist approach to GR with one that incorporates data gathered using two ethnographic methods. In doing so, we consider each step of the abstractionist approach, illustrating where ethnographic data obtained in our work environment affects the model produced. As we proceed, we summarize the general lessons learned. We then discuss how other abstractionist and contextualist methods could be integrated...|$|R
30|$|The {{phase-shift}} (or phase) of the neuronal voltage {{response to}} subthreshold oscillatory input currents has received less attention that the corresponding amplitude response [11, 14, 29]. This {{despite the fact}} that phases are expected to play <b>a</b> major role <b>in</b> determining the synchronization properties of neuronal networks [30]. A zero-phase response indicates that both voltage output and current input peak at the same time, thus generating in-phase synchronized patterns. We use the term phase-resonance to refer to the ability of neurons to exhibit a zero-phase response to oscillatory inputs at a non-zero (phase-resonant) frequency. The resonant and phase-resonant frequencies do not generally coincide [29] for neuronal models (they do so for circuits in parallel but not for circuits in series as neuronal models are).

40|$|Problem: In {{society of}} today {{corporate}} competence {{is an important}} factor for survivor and development. IT is developing rapidly and can not be ignored by companies. Then need for people with IT-competence is conquent increasing. A survey of corporate IT-competence is therefore of interest for companies as well as for local authorities. To determine the IT competence within an organisation, this competence has to be measurable. Therefore, it is necessary to define the concept of IT competence. In agreement with our principal, we are focusing on the manufacturing industry. Purpose: To develop a measuring instrument which can be used to survey the IT competence within a manufacturing sector. Method: Our development of the measuring instrument is divided into four steps. In the first step, we have made a definition of IT competence, relevant literature and research. This definition is used in the second step, where we connect <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> matrix in order to illustrate our reasoning regarding IT competence. In the third step, and based this discussion, we are outlining questions, which all together form the measuring instrument itself. In the last step, we deal with the obscurities and ideas for improvement that have arisen through the test investigation along with our own reflections about what could have been done better. Conclusion: We are using the ideas for improvement to change the measuring instrument. When all the changes have been made, the final measuring instrument has emerged, which means our assignment is completed. Based on our studies, we can establish {{that it is possible to}} measure the IT competence within an organisation, and thus, to survey the IT competence in a local authority...|$|E

Definition 14. 1. 1 A metric space M is a pair (X, dM) where X is a set and dM: X × X → [0, ∞) is a metric, satisfying the following axioms: (i) dM(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y, (ii) dM(x, y) = dM(y, x), and (iii) dM(x, y) + dM(y, z) ≥ dM(x, z) (triangle inequality). In the following, we will slightly abuse notations, and use M to refer to the underlying set of points. Also, we assume that we are provided with a black box, such that given any two points x and y, we can compute the distances dM(x, y) in constant time. For example of a metric, IR 2 with the regular euclidean distance is a metric space. Another standard example is a graph G with non-negative weights ω(·) defined on the edges, and let dG(x, y) denote the shortest path (under the given weights) between any x, y ∈ V(G). It is easy to verify that dG(·, ·) is a metric. In fact, any finite metric (i. e., a metric defined over a finite set) can be represented by such a weighted graph...|$|E
40|$|First paragraph: What {{happens when}} (so-called) {{analytic}} philosophy is brought {{face to face}} with (so-called) continental philosophy? In its present form, this question is too nebulous to deserve serious attention, since any answer that achieves more than unhelpful over-generalization will depend on which particular lines of thought within these two great philosophical traditions are selected to represent them. So we need to replace our opening question with one that limits the range of views under consideration, and is correspondingly more tractable. Here goes. What happens when scientifically oriented philosophy of mind in the analytic tradition is brought {{face to face with}} phenomenological thought in the continental tradition? Given that both these modes of inquiry seek to investigate human experience, one might reasonably think that there must be some sort of overlap between them. So what happens when they are brought together? Do we end up with a meeting of minds or a clashing of heads? Is it a case of friends reunited or of mortal combat? Is there any prospect that the interactions in question will provide the platform for a productive overcoming of the apparent divisions that are standardly thought to separate the two traditions? These are the programmatic questions that ultimately concern us in this paper. To anchor <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> concrete issue, we propose to address them by way of a significant challenge that confronts research in artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science. The uninitiated might think of such research as paradigmatically relevant to scientifically oriented philosophy of mind in the analytic tradition, but of little interest to continental phenomenology - except perhaps {{as an example of the}} sort of dehumanizing technological thinking that ought to be criticized.

40|$|Water {{resource}} {{systems planning}} and management issues are rarely simple. Demands for reliable supplies of clean water to satisfy the energy, food, and industrial demands of an increasing population and to maintain viable natural ecosystems are growing. This is happening {{at the same time}} changes in our climate are increasing the risks of having to deal with too little or too much water in many river basins, watersheds, and urban areas. Societies are becoming increasingly {{aware of the importance of}} water and its management and use; their governing institutions are becoming increasingly involved in water resources development and management decision-making processes. To gain a better understanding of the complex interactions among all the hydrologic, ecologic, economic, engineering and social components of water resource systems, analyses based on systems perspectives are useful. While analyses of such complex systems can be challenging, integrated systems approaches are fundamental for identifying and evaluating options for improving system performance and security for the benefit of all of us. Just how well we are able to plan and manage our water availability, quality, and variability is a major determinant of the survival of species, the functioning and resilience of ecosystems, the strength of economies, and the vitality of societies. To aid in the analysis of planning and managing options, a variety of modelling approaches have been developed. This book intro- duces the science and art of developing and applying various modelling approaches in support of water resources {{planning and management}}. Its main emphasis is on the practice of developing and using models to address specific water resources planning and management issues and problems. Their purpose is to provide relevant, objective, timely and meaningful information to those who are responsible for deciding how we develop, manage, and use our water resources. Readers of this book are not likely to learn the art of systems modelling and analyses unless they actually do it. The modelling approaches, examples and case studies contained in this book, together with the exercises offered at the end of most chapters, we believe and hope, will facilitate the process of becoming a skilled water resources systems modeler, analyst and planner. This has been our profession, indeed our hobby and source of enjoyment, and we can highly recommend it to others. Water resource systems planning and management is a multidisciplinary activity. The modelling and analysis of water resources systems involves inputs from the applicable natural and social sciences and from the people, the stakeholders, who will be impacted. It is a challenge. Although we have attempted to incorporate into each chapter current approaches to water resources systems planning and analysis, this book does not pretend to be a review of the state-of-the-art of water resources systems analysis. Rather it is intended to introduce readers to the art of developing and using models and modelling approaches applied to the planning and managing of water resources systems. We have tried to organize <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way useful for teaching and self-study. The contents reflect our belief that the most appropriate methods for planning and management are often the simpler ones, chiefly because they are easier to understand and explain, require less input data and time, and are easier to apply to specific issues or problems. This does not imply that more sophisticated and complex models are less useful. Sometimes their use is the only way one can provide the needed information. In this book, we attempt to give readers the knowledge to make appro- priate choices regarding model complexity. These choices will depend in part on factors such as the issues being addressed and the information needed, the level of accuracy desired, the availability of data and their cost, and the time required and available to carry out the analysis. While many analysts have their favourite modelling approaches, the choice of a particular model and solution method should be based on the knowledge of various modelling approaches and their advantages and limitations. There is no one best approach for analyzing all the issues one might face in this profession. This book assumes readers have had some mathematical training in algebra, calculus, geometry and the use of vectors and matrices. Readers will also benefit from some background in probability and statistics and some exposure to micro-economic theory and welfare economics. Some knowl- edge of hydrology, hydraulics and environmental engineering will also be beneficial, but not absolutely essential. Readers wanting an overview of some of natural processes that take place in watersheds, river basins, estuaries and coastal zones can refer to the Appendices (available on the internet along with the book itself). An introductory course in optimization and simulation methods, typically provided in either an operations research or an economic theory course, can also benefit the reader, but again it is not essential. Chapter 1 introduces water resources systems planning and management and reviews some examples of water resources systems projects in which modelling has had a critical role. These projects also serve to identify some of the current issues facing water managers in different parts of the world. Chapter 2 introduces the general modelling approach and the role of models in water resources planning and management activities. Chapter 3 begins the discussion of optimization and simulation modelling and how they are applied and used in practice. Chapter 4 focuses on the development and use of various optimization methods for the preliminary definition of infrastructure design and operating policies. These preliminary results define alternatives that usually need to be further analyzed and improved using simulation methods. The advantages and limitations of different optimization/simulation approaches are illustrated using some simple water allocation, reservoir operation and water quality management problems. Chapter 5 extends this discussion of optimization to problems characterized by more qualitative objectives and/or constraints. In addition, it introduces some of the more recently developed methods of statistical modelling,including artificial neural networks and evolutionary search methods including genetic algorithms and genetic programming. This chapter expects interested readers desiring more detail will refer to other books and papers,many of which are solely devoted to just these topics. Chapters 6 through 8 are devoted to probabilistic models, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. These methods are useful not only for identifying more realistic, reliable, and robust infrastructure designs and operating policies for the given hydrolog- ical variability and uncertain parameter values and objectives but also for estimating some of the major uncertainties associated with model predictions. Such probabilistic and stochastic models can also help identify just what model input data are needed and how accurate those data need be with respect to their influence on the decisions being considered. Water resources planning and management today inevitably involve multiple goals or objectives, many of which may be conflicting. It is difficult, if not impossible, to please all stakeholders all the time. Models containing multiple objectives can be used to identify the tradeoffs among conflicting objectives. This is the information useful to decision-makers who must decide what to do given these tradeoffs among conflicting performance cri- teria that stakeholders care about. Chapter 9 on multi-objective modelling identifies various types of economic, environmental and physical objectives, and some commonly used ways of including multiple objectives in optimization and simulation models. Chapter 10 is devoted to various approaches for modelling water quality in surface water bodies. Chapter 11 focuses on modelling approaches for multiple purpose water quantity planning and management in river basins. Chapter 12 zooms into urban areas and presents some ways of analyzing urban water systems. Finally, Chap. 13 describes how projects involving the analyses of water resource systems can be planned and executed. Following these thirteen chapters are four appendices. They are not contained in the book but are available on the internet where this book can be downloaded. They contain descriptions of (A) natural hydrological and ecological processes in river basins, estuaries and coastal zones, (B) monitoring and adaptive management, (C) drought management, and (D) flood management. For university teachers, the contents of this book represent more than can normally be covered in a single quarter or semester course. A first course might include Chaps. 1 through 5, and possibly Chaps. 9 and 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 depending on the background and interest of the participants in the class. A second course could include Chaps. 6 through 8 and/or any combination of Chaps. 10 through 12, as desired. Exercises are offered at the end of each chapter, and instructors using this text in their academic courses can contact the authors for the solutions of those exercises if desired...|$|E

It is important {{to take into account}} the phenomenon of dangerous irrelevance: over long times or large field ranges, physics can become sensitive to higher scales than the input energies. This pertains in inflationary cosmology (and possibly other aspects of horizon physics). String theory also contributes to our understanding of observational constraints and search strategies at the level of low energy field theory. We illustrate this with a current example concerning a new form of non-Gaussianity generated by very massive degrees of freedom coupling to the inflaton. New constraints on such fields and couplings can be obtained from existing data, increasing our empirical knowledge of the universe. This builds in part from the development of the string landscape, which is neither random nor an abdication of science as has sometimes been suggested.

40|$|The basic {{structure}} of standard {{quantum mechanics is}} derived from two compatible postulates. They are: 1) The laws of physics are invariant under the choice of experimental setup and 2) Every quantum observation or event is intrinsically statistical. The resulting geometric formulation naturally leads to a background independent extension of quantum theory with a local intrinsic time implying the relativity {{of the concept of}} a quantum event. The basic outcome of such an extension is the interplay between the dynamical metric and symplectic form of the space of quantum events and a dynamical non-integrable almost complex structure. This provides a missing conceptual ingredient in the search for a background independent quantum theory of gravity. The crucial new technical element <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> is contained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> set of recent mathematical results concerning the category of infinite dimensional almost Kahler manifolds which replaces th...|$|R

The final version is available from Royal Society Publishing via [URL] article concerns the earliest evidence for Isaac Newton’s use of Hebrew: a manuscript copy by Newton of part of a work intended to provide a reader of the Hebrew alphabet {{with the ability to}} identify or memorize more than 1000 words and to begin to master the conjugations of the Hebrew verb. In describing the content of this unpublished manuscript and establishing its source and original author for the first time, we suggest how and when Newton may have initially become acquainted with the language. Finally, basing <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> part on <b>an</b> examination of the reading marks that Newton left in the surviving copies of Hebrew grammars and lexicons that he owned, we will argue that his interest in Hebrew was not intended to achieve linguistic proficiency but remained limited to particular theological queries of singular concern.

40|$|AbstractThe {{field of}} Participatory Design (PD) has greatly diversified {{and we see}} a broad {{spectrum}} of approaches and methodologies emerging. However, to foster its role in designing future interactive technologies, a discussion about accountability and rigour across this spectrum is needed. Rejecting the traditional, positivistic framework, we take inspiration from related fields such as Design Research and Action Research to develop interpretations of these concepts that are rooted in PD׳s own belief system. We argue that unlike in other fields, accountability and rigour are nuanced concepts that are delivered through debate, critique and reflection. A key prerequisite for having such debates is the availability of a language that allows designers, researchers and practitioners to construct solid arguments about the appropriateness of their stances, choices and judgements. To this end, we propose a “tool-to-think-with” that provides such a language by guiding designers, researchers and practitioners through a process of systematic reflection and critical analysis. The tool proposes four lenses to critically reflect on the nature of a PD effort: epistemology, values, stakeholders and outcomes. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> subsequent step, the coherence between the revealed features is analysed and shows whether they pull the project in the same direction or work against each other. Regardless of the flavour of PD, we argue that this coherence of features indicates the level of internal rigour of PD work and that the process of reflection and analysis provides the language to argue for it. We envision our tool to be useful at all stages of PD work: in the planning phase, as part of a reflective practice during the work, and as a means to construct knowledge and advance the field after the fact. We ground <b>our</b> theoretical <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specific PD experience, the ECHOES project, to motivate the tool and to illustrate its workings...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In early 2006 the Irish Government {{announced}} a Pilot Initiative for Collaborative Projects from Industry-Led Networks, the latest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of policies on ‘business networking’ that {{date back to}} the mid- 1980 s. The purpose of this chapter is to describe and comment on those policies by reviewing the previous literature (both academic and policy documents). What we stress is that over the years and across different policies, the precise focus has varied, in terms of networking aims and objectives and networking forms. 1 We appreciate that there is considerable confusion <b>in</b> the wider <b>discussions</b> as to the meaning of ‘networks’ and ‘networking’ <b>in</b> <b>a</b> business context, and indeed this has been recognized before in analysis of Irish policy (for example, in Forfás (2004)). However, our approach is to avoid much of that confusion by simply centring discussion on those (inter-related and overlapping) areas of policy that the literature on Ireland consistently addresses when considering ‘business networking’, namely: ‘linkages’ between ‘local’ firms and transnational/multinational corporation (TNCs); training networks; research and development (R&D) networks; inter-firm cooperation processes more widely. These four topics are respectively the prime focus of successive Sections <b>in</b> this Chapter. <b>Our</b> <b>discussion</b> culminates <b>in</b> <b>a</b> consideration of the prospects for the successful impact of the 2006 Pilot. We welcome the initiative as seeming to represent <b>a</b> welcome seed-change <b>in</b> policy, and offer preliminary insights into how it might be evaluated. In doing so we introduce the notion of ‘public interest evaluation’ (PIE), intended to assess the extent to which public interests are served by a particular policy. Part of the idea is that whilst the Pilot is focused on (to some extent) measurable benefits to participating enterprises from networking projects, it might also be desirable to consider other effects on wider publics.

40|$|Why {{would an}} {{economic}} actor {{want to own}} an asset? The standard reason (applicable, say, to a share of stock) is that the asset is expected to yield <b>a</b> high return. <b>In</b> this note, however, we explore a second reason: to stop someone else from owning the asset. Obviously, this second reason applies only if the first party cares what the second would do with the asset (so a share of stock does not usually fit in this category, but might if one considered something like <b>a</b> proxy vote <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hostile takeover bid). When one party cares what another might do with an asset, we will say that “control rights ” to the asset matter. As will become clear, the key idea is actually the control right, not the asset. For example, we will see that control rights can be moved from one firm to another via contract, {{even if there is}} no physical asset to be moved. We will conduct much of <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>a</b> supply transaction involving an upstream party (supplier), a downstream party (user), and an asset (production equipment). The upstream party uses the asset to produce a good {{that can be used in}} the downstream party’s production process. If the upstream party owns the asset, we will call her an independent contractor (i. e., someone who works with her own tools) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} meaning and {{mechanics}} of belonging with a particular focus {{on the role of}} place and place-making. It explores the ways people come to achieve a sense of belonging with reference to recent theoretical treatments of place, territory, and mobility. We ground <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> analysis of <b>an</b> ethnographic case of Ecuadorian families who have migrated to Trentino in northern Italy. Most families miss the social relationships and places they left behind, but have decided to stay permanently in Italy, giving up the "myth of return" (Anwar 1979). Trentino offers more opportunities in term of employment, education, and access to services than Ecuador. Yet the decision to stay in Trentino is based on more than a simple assessment of economic advantage. Participants spoke of a slowly unfolding sense of belonging to Trentino, with strong affective dimensions born of a specific attachment to the very materiality of place in Trentino. This attachment may be regarded as an assemblage of social, material and affective resonances, experiences and resources, revealing something of the place and feeling of belonging. Hence, the Ecuadorian sense of belonging does not rely on an abstract conception of cultural affiliation, nor is it a purely psychological response. Rather, belonging accrues in particular practices and material attachments. We unpack these practices by documenting the work participants put into inhabiting an unfamiliar place as "their" place, {{while at the same time}} questioning the ontological status of space...|$|R
