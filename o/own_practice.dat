5|$|After graduating Coffin {{was unable}} to find work with {{established}} architectural firms, due to widespread prejudice against a woman working in a male-dominated field. She set up her <b>own</b> <b>practice</b> in New York City in 1905, starting out by designing suburban gardens on Long Island. Her increasing fame led to larger commissions from wealthy and powerful East Coast families. By the 1920s {{she was one of the}} most sought-after landscape architects in the eastern United States. Coffin's clientele included some of the wealthiest and most famous families in the country, including the Fricks, the Vanderbilts, the Huttons, and the du Ponts.|$|E

40|$|By {{adopting}} {{the theory of}} planned behavior, this study tried to predict human resources managers' (N = 79) intentions toward unstructured and structured interview techniques. Managers evaluated case descriptions of both techniques and were interviewed about their <b>own</b> <b>practices.</b> The data revealed stronger intentions toward unstructured interviewing than toward structured interviewing, which was consistent with their <b>own</b> <b>practices</b> in selecting staff, which appeared to be rather unstructured. l. Ajzen's (1991) theory {{appeared to be a}} useful framework for predicting managers' intentions. In particular, attitudes and subjective norms were predictive of intentions to engage in either method. Only intentions toward the unstructured case were related to managers' actual behavior...|$|R
5|$|In 1833, Payne {{moved to}} Cleveland, Ohio, {{which was then}} a town of just 3000 people. Douglas preceded him there, but was ill, and Payne's first task on arrival in Ohio was to nurse his friend back to health. He {{continued}} to study law, this time under Sherlock J. Andrews and in 1834 {{was admitted to the}} bar. He opened his <b>own</b> <b>practice</b> the same year, forming a partnership with future United States federal judge Hiram V. Willson.

Philip Sydney Stott, third son of Abraham and later titled as Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet, was the most prominent and famous of the Stott mill architects. He established his <b>own</b> <b>practice</b> in 1883 and designed over a hundred mills in several countries.

5|$|War {{memorials}} {{became a}} common sight in British towns and cities following the First World War (1914–1918). Almost one million men from Britain {{were killed in the}} conflict, and monuments were erected in virtually every settlement in the country. The memorial raised in Spalding, a town in southern Lincolnshire in eastern England, was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had previously established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients. From 1917 onwards, Lutyens dedicated much of his time to the memorialisation of the war dead, first advising the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and later designing war memorials both for the commission and through his <b>own</b> <b>practice.</b> Spalding was one of his first war memorial commissions.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his residency in ophthalmology, Paul moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky. He has held a state-issued medical license since moving there in 1993. He received {{his first job}} from John Downing of Downing McPeak Vision Centers, which brought him to Bowling Green after {{completing his}} residency. Paul worked for Downing {{for about five years}} before parting ways. Afterwards, he went to work at the Graves Gilbert Clinic, a private medical group in Bowling Green, for 10years before creating his <b>own</b> <b>practice</b> in a converted one-story house across the street from Downing's office. After his election to the U.S. Senate, he merged his practice with Downing's medical practice. Paul has faced two malpractice lawsuits between 1993 and 2010; he was cleared in one case while the other was settled for $50,000. His medical work has been praised by Downing and he has medical privileges at two Bowling Green hospitals. Paul specializes in cataract and glaucoma surgeries, LASIK procedures, and corneal transplants. As a member of the Bowling Green Noon Lions Club, Paul founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic in 2009 to help provide eye surgery and exams for those who cannot afford to pay. Paul won the Melvin Jones Fellow Award for Dedicated Humanitarian Services from the Lions Club International Foundation for his work establishing the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Sharpe {{started his}} {{practice}} {{at the end of}} 1835 in his mother's house in Penny Street, moving into premises in Sun Street in 1838. In October that year he took as his pupil Edward Graham Paley, then aged 15. Later in 1838 Sharpe took a house in StLeonard's Gate large enough to accommodate himself and Paley; the practice continued to use the premises in Sun Street until after Sharpe's retirement. In 1841 Thomas Austin also joined the practice as a pupil, staying until 1852 when he left to set up on his own as an architect in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1845 Sharpe made Paley a partner, and in 1847 effectively handed the business over to him. At about this time also, John Douglas joined the firm as Paley's assistant, and stayed with the firm until about 1859, when he moved to Chester to establish his <b>own</b> <b>practice.</b> Sharpe retired completely from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as sole principal. Also in 1851 Paley married Sharpe's sister, Frances.|$|E

40|$|In this piece,I {{explore the}} current status of Action Research in the EAP {{community}} and suggest some reasons why it is perhaps under utilised as a potentially emancipatory way for EAP practitioners to become researchers of their <b>own</b> <b>practices</b> and conditions.

In order to do this, this article provides an example of my own practitioner research conducted within an Action Research framework on the assessment of writing on an EAP pre-sessional course at one UK institution. I do this not to provide an example of good research but to reinforce my central thesis that conducting research is a difficult, risky but ultimately necessary practice for the EAP practitioner...|$|R
