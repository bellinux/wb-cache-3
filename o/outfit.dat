5|$|Due {{to global}} demand and the {{development}} staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to XIII. The game tackles {{the question of whether}} Lightning is happy after the events of XIII. Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had wanted to create a truly happy ending for the character. Lightning's <b>outfit</b> in XIII-2 was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo. He worked from a rough sketch by Nomura of how Lightning should appear. The <b>outfit</b> was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a qipao and a science fiction-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the valkyries of Norse mythology. The <b>outfit</b> was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning. It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers. She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a normal person.|$|E

The missions studied covered the full range of in-space technology development activities envisioned for early Space Station operations and included both pressurized volume and attached payload requirements. Equipment needs were compared with <b>outfitting</b> plans for the life sciences and microgravity user communities, and a number of potential <b>outfitting</b> additions were identified. <b>Outfitting</b> implementation was addressed by selecting a strawman mission complement for each of seven technical themes, by organizing the missions into flight scenarios, and by assessing the associated <b>outfitting</b> buildup for planning impacts...|$|R

5|$|Further {{marketing}} of Sleeping Dogs was via cross-promotion on different platforms; players {{who bought the}} game through Steam received an eight item pack for Team Fortress 2, which was later made available for separate purchase, and a Hong Kong-themed Team Fortress 2 level, Kong King.

40|$|On {{its way to}} {{becoming}} successful and competitive on the world shipbuilding market, the shipyard has to build quality, have small cost of production process and short delivery time of the ship. Optimisation of the shipbuilding process using a modular <b>outfitting</b> concept needs some changes in design and technological processes in shipbuilding. It needs some changes in <b>outfitting</b> by redirectioning of some <b>outfitting</b> works from blocks, berth and <b>outfitting</b> after launching of the ship towards the workshop. This is a way to shorten the time of the shipbuilding process, reduce costs, increase of competitiveness, without investment in new facilities, machines and tools. In this paper, a model which shows interdependence between various activities in the shipbuilding process is described. This is a vehicle which can be used for research on the dependence of the shipbuilding process in relation to some changes in the <b>outfitting</b> process while shifting some <b>outfitting</b> work from on-board towards <b>outfitting</b> workshops. Those workshops can be either a part of the shipyard or a part of outsourcing. On the basis of the results obtained by this research, it is possible to measure optimisation results as a consequence of using a new modular <b>outfitting</b> concept within the shipbuilding process. In this way, a higher process efficiency, reduced activity cost and durations within the shipbuilding process can be achieved. The authors suggest that further improvement is possible by introducing higher degree of standardisation, unification and typification of ship systems and structures, particularly adapted to a modular <b>outfitting</b> concept, and additionally increased by way of on-block <b>outfits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Currently, in {{shipbuilding}} {{as well as}} {{in civil}} engineering <b>outfitting</b> planning is not sufficiently investigated. A multitude of requirements such as technological dependencies, resource and work space assignment have to be considered. <b>Outfitting</b> processes in both domains are distinguished by interferences, disturbances, great interdependencies and different surrounding area requirements. In consequence, on production site an extensive coordination effort is necessary to handle these problems. A realistic planning and detailed analysis will help to reduce the on-site coordination effort and not to overrun the projected costs and time. Appropriate tools have to be implemented to support planners and improve the <b>outfitting</b> planning. Within the cooperation SIMoFIT (Simulation of <b>Outfitting</b> Processes in Shipbuilding and Civil Engineering) a discrete-event simulation framework is developing to support <b>outfitting</b> planning in shipbuilding and civil engineering. This paper focuses on using a constraint-based simulation approach to detail <b>outfitting</b> tasks and their corresponding restrictions and requirements. Typical <b>outfitting</b> restrictions and requirements are specified as hard and soft constraints. This approach guarantees a high flexibility in modeling processes...|$|R

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar <b>outfit.</b> The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch.
