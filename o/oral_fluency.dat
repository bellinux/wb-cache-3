A three by two between-subject design was conducted. Three classes of English-majored college students in central Taiwan were conveniently sampled and participated in the training. From each class, eight learners of low <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> and another eight of high <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> were chosen for data analysis. Learners in Class 1 enhanced their <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> with an audio player, Class 2 with a system-paced ASAS, and Class 3 with a learner-paced ASAS.

During the 8 -week training period, each student was required to read half of an article by repeating after the model speaker for thirty minutes each week. Two-way ANOVA simple main effect was conducted to analyze the data. Four conclusions were made. First, the training either with an audio player or with an ASAS enhanced learners’ WCPM more than their MFS scores. Second, students of low <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> benefited more by practicing with the ASAS. Third, training either with an audio player or an ASAS didn’t seem to help learners of high <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> much.

5000|$|Receptive bilinguals {{are those}} who have the ability to {{understand}} a second language but who cannot speak it or whose abilities to speak it are inhibited by psychological barriers. Receptive bilingualism is frequently encountered among adult immigrants to the U.S. who do not speak English as a native language but who have children who do speak English natively, usually in part because those children's education has been conducted in English; while the immigrant parents can understand both their native language and English, they speak only their native language to their children. If their children are likewise receptively bilingual but productively English-monolingual, throughout the conversation the parents will speak their native language and the children will speak English. If their children are productively bilingual, however, those children may answer in the parents' native language, in English, or in a combination of both languages, varying their choice of language depending on factors such as the communication's content, context, and/or emotional intensity and {{the presence or absence of}} third-party speakers of one language or the other. The third alternative represents the phenomenon of [...] "code-switching" [...] in which the productively bilingual party to a communication switches languages in the course of that communication. Receptively bilingual persons, especially children, may rapidly achieve <b>oral</b> <b>fluency</b> by spending extended time in situations where they are required to speak the language that they theretofore understood only passively. Until both generations achieve <b>oral</b> <b>fluency,</b> not all definitions of bilingualism accurately characterize the family as a whole, but the linguistic differences between the family's generations often constitute little or no impairment to the family's functionality.Receptive bilingualism in one language as exhibited by a speaker of another language, or even as exhibited by most speakers of that language, is not the same as mutual intelligibility of languages; the latter is a property of a pair of languages, namely a consequence of objectively high lexical and grammatical similarities between the languages themselves (e.g., Iberian Spanish and Iberian Portuguese), whereas the former is a property of one or more persons and is determined by subjective or intersubjective factors such as the respective languages' prevalence in the life history (including family upbringing, educational setting, and ambient culture) of the person or persons.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005 Enda Kenny, {{leader of}} Fine Gael, {{called for the}} {{language}} to be made an optional subject {{in the last two}} years of secondary school. Mr Kenny, despite being a fluent speaker himself (and a teacher), stated that he believed that compulsory Irish has done the language more harm than good. The point was made again in April 2010 by Fine Gael's education spokesman Brian Hayes, who said that forcing students to learn Irish was not working, and was actually driving young people away from real engagement with the language. The question provoked a public debate, with some expressing resentment of what they saw as the coercion involved in compulsory Irish. According to the incoming Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore from the Labour Party in this book [...] "Inside the Room" [...] published in 2015 Enda Kenny tried to persuade him in the government formation negotiations in 2011 for Irish to become optional for the Leaving Certificate but he would not agree to it.

40|$|Planning and {{implementation}} of a quality education for pupils with learning difficulties in Slovenia {{is based on the}} five-step model of learning support for pupils with learning difficulties (hereinafter referred to as a five-step model). The five step model represents an effective system of support and treatment for pupils with learning difficulties, which provides flexible transitions up and down through five stages of different intensity of support. Experts note that in Slovenia {{a very large number of}} students receive the most intense learning support and treatment (received at the fifth step of the five step model). A possible reason for that could be in an inefficient implementation of the five-step model, especially its first steps. As a response to the highlighted problem within this master thesis, as one of several tests, the US curriculum based measurement model (CBM) formative test of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> (CBM, curriculum based measurement) was adapted and tested. The test of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> (CBM – ORF, curriculum based measurement – test of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency)</b> was performed on 18 different Slovenian primary schools on a sample of Slovenian third grade pupils with (N = 79, specific reading difficulty – PPPU, dyslexia) and without (N = 254, average readers) specific learning difficulties. The result of this master thesis represents an analysis of pupils’ performance on the CBM test of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency.</b> The results of the test were compared to pupils’ results on SNAP test of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency,</b> to pupils' results on the teacher's assessment of the quality of students' oral reading and to pupils' results on reading comprehension test. For a subsample of pupils, the results of the CBM test of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> were also compared with pupil's results on the external assessment at the national level (NPZ) in sixth grade for different subject areas (Slovenian language, Mathematics and English). For the CBM test of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> the local percentile norms for the beginning of the 3 rd grade were developed. On the basis of foreign research results in this area the critical values (criteria, thresholds) of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency,</b> which could help in identifying students at risk for reading difficulties in reading, were suggested. On the basis of our results the psychometric characteristics of the test (reliability, validity, objectivity, sensitivity and economy) and the usefulness of the CBM test of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> in conjunction with the Slovenian five-step model of support for pupils with learning difficulties in reading, were evaluated. The suggested use of CBM test of <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> in Slovenia is at the level of a broad screening for detection. The CBM test is useful as an indicator of the possible presence of specific learning difficulties. As a matter of obtaining clearer picture of the source and intensity of the reading difficulties other differential tests need to be performed. The main contribution of the master thesis is in evaluation of CBM <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> test. Its further development and usage could help in assessing problems and providing support in early reading skills acquisition within the first four stages of the Slovenian five-step model of support for pupils with learning difficulties. The presented work and its results contribute to the development of time-efficient and simple forms of formative assessment of student progress in the area of early reading. It represents a starting point for further development of CBM tests for formative assessment of progress in reading and other basic learning skills. ...|$|R

In the English as {{a second}} language (ESL) and English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom, the focus is often on teaching reading, writing and grammar skills while little time is spent teaching speaking skills. This becomes a problem when students need to use English to speak. Many adult nonnative English language learners studying abroad in English speaking countries need an extended time immersed in the language before they are comfortable or even able to communicate with the spoken word effectively. This is not desired by the language learners, and {{it is not necessary to}} send these language learners out into the world ill equipped. <b>Oral</b> <b>fluency</b> can be taught and the indivisible multiword language chunks, known as formulaic sequences, are one way to accomplish this goal.

The dependent variables were reading achievement and <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency.</b> Data were pretest and posttest scores on reading achievement and <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> measures. Students in 2 of the 3 groups graphed their <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> (words read correctly per minute), which supported the intrinsic motivation condition of goal setting. Similarly, students in 2 of the 3 groups received rewards, which defined the extrinsic motivation condition. After 8 weeks of treatment conditions, posttest scores were compared with pretest scores as a covariate. An analysis of covariance showed no statistically significant differences in reading achievement between the 3 motivation conditions. Further analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> favoring the intrinsic motivation intervention group. The findings suggest that 8 weeks may not be sufficient for students to benefit directly from any specific motivation condition, but suggest that engaging students in goal setting may improve reading achievement and eventual literacy...|$|R
5000|$|The {{organization}} conducts {{monitoring and}} evaluation for impact assessment, develops reading focused out-of-classroom activities and teacher workshops by working with communities and partner organizations. Its research shows that students in the e-reader programs improved 94% in mother tongue <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> after 5 months, and girls in the e-reader programs improved twice as fast in <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> as girls in neighboring schools, closing an existing gender gap. The Worldreader iREAD 2 project was funded by an All Children Reading grant from USAID, World Vision and AusAid, aimed to improve early grade reading skills for students in Ghana. The project’s final report, [...] in November 2014, showed significant improvements in <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency,</b> reading comprehension gains, significant impact among low-performing students and development of positive reading habits. Worldreader has shown that reading from the Worldreader Open Library is particularly popular with women, who spend on average 207 minutes reading per month, compared to 32 minutes for men.|$|R
40|$|Teaching <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> is an {{important}} aspect of effective literacy instruction. Researchers have investigated a number of strategies shown to be effective with beginning readers; however, less empirical evidence is available for older, struggling readers. The secondary curriculum presents adolescent struggling readers with different challenges, including successful completion of higher level comprehension skill activities, high-stakes assessments, and limited classroom time with practice with <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> exercises. These conditions may lead to academic failure or school drop-out for students who have limited reading ability. An alternating conditions design (Kazdin, 1982) was used to examine the influence of peer-mediated fluency instruction (repeated reading and continuous reading) on the <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> and comprehension skills of five high school-aged struggling readers from an urban alternative high school setting. The three dependent variables measured were (a) words correct per minute, (b) number of errors, and (c) number of comprehension questions answered correctly. Results of the alternating treatments design indicate that all students increased their correct words per minute with implementation of peer-mediated repeated reading fluency instruction as compared to the peer-mediated continuous reading instruction. However, mixed results were found regarding accuracy of comprehension questions. Limitations were noted with regard to working within an alternative high school setting, variability in student outcomes, and the use of narrative text. Future research suggestions for using peer-mediated <b>oral</b> reading <b>fluency</b> instruction with students with and without disabilities in alternative high school settings are provided...|$|R
