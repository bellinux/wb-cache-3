The king lavishes Finn with food and asks that he stay and watch the chiming of his cuckoo clock. However, it soon becomes apparent that King Huge is insane; he demands that Finn remain and watch every time the clock chimes the hour.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>bear</b> claw is <b>a</b> sweet, yeast-raised pastry, {{similar to}} a Danish, {{originating}} in the United States during the mid-1920s. <b>A</b> <b>bear</b> claw is usually filled with almond paste, and sometimes raisins, and often shaped in a semicircle with slices along the curved edge, or rectangular with partial slices along one side.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the use of a pastoral romance from the 1590s indicates {{that at the end of}} his career, Shakespeare felt a renewed interest in the dramatic contexts of his youth. Minor influences also suggest such an interest. As in Pericles, he uses a chorus to advance the action in the manner of the naive dramatic tradition; the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> in the scene on the Bohemian seashore is almost certainly indebted to Mucedorus, a chivalric romance revived at court around 1610.|$|E
25|$|The Beast {{is not of}} any {{one species}} of animal, but a chimera (a mixture of several animals), who would {{probably}} be classified as a carnivore overall.

He also bears resemblance to mythical monsters like the Minotaur or a werewolf. He also has blue eyes, the one physical feature that does not change whether he is a beast or a human.|$|E
25|$|The {{sacrifice}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> for Artemis {{started with}} the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced {{to the people of}} Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').|$|E

25|$|Sloth bears {{may have}} reached their current {{form in the}} early Pleistocene, {{the time when the}} bear family {{specialized}} and dispersed. A fragment of fossilized humerus from the Pleistocene, found in Andhra Pradesh's Kurnool Basin is identical to the humerus of a modern sloth bear. The fossilized skulls <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> once named Melursus theobaldi found in the Shivaliks from the early Pleistocene or early Pliocene are thought by certain authors to represent an intermediate stage between sloth bears and ancestral brown bears. M. theobaldi itself had teeth intermediate in size between sloth bears and other bear species, though its palate was {{the same size as the}} former species, leading to the theory that it is the sloth bear's direct ancestor. Sloth bears probably arose during the mid-Pliocene and evolved in the Indian subcontinent. The sloth bear shows evidence of having undergone a convergent evolution similar to that of other ant-eating mammals.|$|E
25|$|A {{limitation}} of food sources {{in early spring}} and wild berry and nut crop failures during summer months may be contributing factors to black bears regularly feeding from commercial human-based food sources. Crops are frequently eaten by these bears, especially during autumn hyperphagia when natural foods are scarce. Favored crops may include apples, oats and corns. Black bears can do extensive damage {{in some areas of}} the northwestern United States by stripping the bark from trees and feeding on the cambium. Livestock depredations by black bears occur mostly in spring. Though black bears have the capacity to (and occasionally do) hunt adult cattle and horses, they seem to prefer smaller, more easily overwhelmed prey such as sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. They normally kill by biting the neck and shoulders, though they may break the neck or back of prey with blows from the paws. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> attack includes claw marks and is frequently found on the neck, back, and shoulders of larger animals. Surplus killing of sheep and goats are common. Bears have been known to frighten livestock herds over cliffs, causing injuries and death to many animals; {{whether or not this is}} intentional is not known. Occasionally, pets, especially dogs, which are most prone to harass a bear, are killed by black bears. It is not recommended to use unleashed dogs as a deterrent from bear attacks. Although large, aggressive dogs sometimes cause a bear to run, if pressed, angry bears frequently turn the tables and end up chasing the dog in return. A bear in pursuit of a pet dog has the potential to threaten both canid and human lives.|$|E
500|$|Another of Gestumblindi's riddles asks, [...] "What is that beast all girded with iron, which {{kills the}} flocks? [...] He has eight horns but no head, and runs as he pleases." [...] Here, {{it is the}} answer that is controversial, as the {{response}} has been variously translated as: [...] "It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> and runs when he is thrown;" [...] or, [...] "It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> and escapes when he is attacked." [...] The first problem is in translating the word húnn, which may refer to a die (as suggested by the former translation), the [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight corners of a six-sided die and [...] "the flocks" [...] that he kills referring to the stakes the players lose. [...] Alternatively, húnn may refer to the king, his [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight defenders, which is more consistent with the latter translation, [...] "He has the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> and escapes when he is attacked." [...] Ultimately, the literary references prove inconclusive {{on the use of}} dice in Hnefatafl.|$|E

500|$|There is {{evidence}} of prehistoric bear worship, though this is disputed by archaeologists. The prehistoric Finns, Siberian peoples and more recently Koreans considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers. There {{is evidence}} of bear worship in early Chinese and Ainu cultures. In many Native American cultures, the bear {{is a symbol of}} rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence. The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the female's devotion and protection of her cubs. Japanese folklore features the Onikuma, a [...] "demon bear" [...] that walks upright. The Ainu of northern Japan, a different people from the Japanese, saw the bear instead as sacred; Hirasawa Byozan painted a scene in documentary style <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> sacrifice in an Ainu temple, complete with offerings to the dead animal's spirit.|$|E
500|$|Anne Boleyn was {{beheaded}} in 1536 for treason against Henry VIII; her ghost supposedly haunts {{the chapel}} of St Peter ad Vincula, {{where she is}} buried, and has been said {{to walk around the}} White Tower carrying her head under her arm. This haunting is commemorated in the 1934 comic song [...] "With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm". Other reported ghosts include Henry VI, Lady Jane Grey, Margaret Pole, and the Princes in the Tower. In January 1816, a sentry on guard outside the Jewel House claimed to have witnessed an apparition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> advancing towards him, and reportedly died of fright a few days later. In October 1817, a tubular, glowing apparition was claimed to have been seen in the Jewel House by the Keeper of the Crown Jewels, Edmund Lenthal Swifte. He said that the apparition hovered over the shoulder of his wife, leading her to exclaim: [...] "Oh, Christ! It has seized me!" [...] Other nameless and formless terrors have been reported, more recently, by night staff at the Tower.|$|E
500|$|Robby Benson as Beast [...] – A young prince who is {{transformed}} into a beast by an enchantress as punishment for his arrogance. The animators drew him with the head structure and horns of an American bison, the arms and body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear,</b> the ears of a deer, the eyebrows of a gorilla, the jaws, teeth, and mane of a lion, the tusks of a wild boar, and the legs and tail of a wolf. Chris Sanders, one of the film's storyboard artists, drafted the designs for the Beast and came up with designs based on birds, insects, and fish before coming up with something close to the final design. Glen Keane, supervising animator for the Beast, refined the design by going to the zoo and studying the animals on which the Beast was based. Benson commented, [...] "There's a rage and torment in this character I've never been asked to use before." [...] The filmmakers commented that [...] "everybody was big fee-fi-fo-fum and gravelly" [...] while Benson's voice had the [...] "big voice and the warm, accessible side" [...] and that [...] "you could hear the prince beneath the fur".|$|E
