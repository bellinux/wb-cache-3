5|$|The fox {{discovers the}} badger {{asleep in his}} bed, and {{originally}} plans to hit him, but decides against this due to the Badger's teeth. He decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water balanced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> tester of the bed. Brock however is awake, escapes the trick, and makes tea for himself in the kitchen. Mr. Tod thinks the bucket has killed Tommy and decides to bury him in the tunnel the rabbits have dug, thinking Tommy dug it. When Mr. Tod discovers Tommy in the Kitchen and has tea thrown over him, a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors. The two roll away down the hill still fighting. Benjamin and Peter quickly gather the bunnies, and return home in triumph.|$|E
25|$|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB) : the LB {{began as}} the London and Croydon Railway (opened in 1839) and the London and Brighton Railway (1840). Its network of lines covered {{a large portion}} of the South London suburbs and served almost the whole of the county of Sussex, much of Surrey and some {{extensions}} into Kent and Hampshire. Many of the south coast resorts owe their existence to the line. Electrification began in 1909 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> system; this was later changed to third rail when the LB became part of the Southern Railway.|$|E
25|$|It quickly {{proved to}} be a useful {{addition}} to the fleet. The first, and only, English Electric trolley bus in service at the time for the Shirley route, opened on 1 April 1931, had to be temporarily withdrawn after a month for upgrades to its bodywork, during which time no. 213 was able to provide relief cover. It was also used for experiments on the Cashmere Hills tram route to test performance on steep terrain. On the morning of 24 May 1931 and the afternoon of 1 June 1931 no. 213 was run along the Cashmere tramline to Dyers Pass Road with one pole <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> tram wire and towing a contact line attached to a skate on the tram rail. Though the Board was satisfied with the results, it ultimately decided against conversion of the Cashmere tram route to trolley bus operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{first white}} farmers began to immigrate from South Africa and the United Kingdom {{during the late}} nineteenth century, {{less than a hundred}} years after the Ndebele invasions. This {{reflected}} a larger trend of permanent European settlement in the milder, drier regions of Southern Africa as opposed to the tropical and sub-tropical climates further north. In 1889 Cecil Rhodes and the British South Africa Company (BSAC) introduced the earliest white settlers to Zimbabwe as prospectors, seeking concessions from the Ndebele for mineral rights. Collectively known as the Pioneer Column, the settlers established the city of Salisbury, now Harare. Rhodes hoped to discover gold and establish a mining colony, but the original intention had to be modified as neither the costs nor the returns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> capital matched the original projections. Local gold deposits failed to yield the massive returns which the BSAC had promised its investors, and the military costs of the expedition had caused a deficit. An interim solution was the granting of land to the settlers in the hopes that they would develop productive farms and generate enough income to justify the colony's continued administrative costs. The region was demarcated as Southern Rhodesia after 1898.|$|E
500|$|Drayton and Brown {{sat next}} to each other on the bus, Drayton by the aisle and Brown by the window. When Officer Lang arrived at their row, he {{identified}} himself as a police investigator and showed his badge. In a voice [...] "just loud enough" [...] to hear, he said he was a police officer [...] "conducting bus interdiction , attempting to deter drugs and illegal weapons being transported on the bus". When Lang asked Drayton and Brown if they had any luggage on the bus, they both pointed to the same green bag <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> luggage rack. Lang asked, [...] "o you mind if I check it?", and Brown replied, [...] "o ahead". The officers inspected the bag and discovered no contraband inside.|$|E
500|$|... "You Belong with Me" [...] is {{performed}} as the opening number on all 2009 and 2010 dates of Swift's first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour. Before Swift or the dancers entered the stage, a video played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> screens; it showed various celebrities, including Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Faith Hill, Lucas Till and Swift herself, sharing their {{definitions of the}} word [...] "fearless". Following the video's completion, the band and backup dancers appeared, dressed in yellow cheerleading uniforms. Swift, {{dressed in a white}} marching band uniform, then emerges {{from the bottom of the}} stage and commences singing. Swift roams around the stage singing and backup dancers perform cheerleading routines while projections of cheerleaders are shown on the stage. Midway through the performance, the backup dancers removed Swift's marching band uniform to reveal a sparkly cocktail dress; she is then handed a rhinestoned acoustic guitar and finishes the performance. Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter believed Swift's performance of [...] "You Belong with Me", coupled with the performance of [...] "Should've Said No", at the May 22, 2009, concert in Los Angeles at the Staples Center made the show a success. The song is also performed on the Speak Now World Tour and The Red Tour. [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] also was performed on The 1989 World Tour in several venues in place of [...] "You Are in Love".|$|E

500|$|In 2009 Cyrus {{continued}} promotion for {{the single}} and The Time of Our Lives, performing [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] on The Today Show and VH1 Divas in the United States. In the winter, she promoted the track in the United Kingdom at 95.8 Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball, the annual gala for British Royal Family, Royal Variety Performance, and , {{as well as in}} Ireland on The Late Late Show. Cyrus performed the song on all venues of her first world concert tour, the Wonder World Tour, which extended from September to December 2009. During each performance, Cyrus was costumed by a black tank top, black hot pants, black leather boots and a blue jean vest as images <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> screens depicted an abundance of sites in and representations of the United States. She roamed throughout the stage with numerous backup dancers and, mid-performance, entered a luggage cart that escorted her throughout the stage again. The lyrics' reference to Jay-Z was replaced with one for Michael Jackson in all live performances. Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, who attended the September 22, 2009, concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, believed [...] "Cyrus managed a reasonable approximation of a rapper" [...] in the performance. Dave Paulson of The Tennessean reported that the song's performance at the November 25, 2009, concert at the Sommet Center in Nashville, Tennessee, [...] "received cheers at Jonas Brothers–worthy decibel levels." ...|$|E

On the instant he leaped for the floor, received a blow on the nose from the heavy whip-handle, and had a blank cartridge fired straight into his nostril. His madness of pain and fear was multiplied. He sprang away in flight, but Mulcachy's voice rang out, [...] "Hoist him!" [...] and he slowly rose in the air again, hanging by his neck, and began to strangle.|$|E

[...] they do not respond to American curiosity so frankly as could be wished. They are like other English things in that, however, and it must be said for them that when apparent they are sometimes unimpressive. From my own note-book, indeed, I find that I pretended to think them [...] "wonderful and almost endless," [...] and so I dare say they are. But they formed only a very perfunctory interest of our day at Liverpool, where we had come to meet, not to take, a steamer.|$|E
