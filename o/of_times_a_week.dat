2500|$|In 1978, General Hospital {{was close}} to {{cancellation}} owing to low viewership. At that time, they were ranked lowest in the Nielsen ratings. To save the show, ABC executive Jackie Smith hired Gloria Monty as the show's executive producer and Douglas Marland as head writer. Monty wanted to attract a youth-based audience {{as a way of}} garnering higher ratings. To do this, she and Marland brought troubled teenager Laura Vining (Genie Francis) to the forefront of the series. The character went from appearing a couple <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to having fifty pages of script a day. [...] "Gloria put sex and romance into Laura's life," [...] Francis said, [...] "and it bowled me over. Here I was doing things in front of 20 million people that I had never done in my life." [...] Her early stories included killing her older lover, David Hamilton, for cheating on her with her mother and a popular romance with Scott [...] "Scotty" [...] Baldwin. In response, General Hospital's ratings rose as younger viewers began watching for Laura. Teenagers connected with her because she was their age and experienced some of the same problems they did, yet also lived [...] "the life of a 28 year old".|$|E

6000|$|When I {{sat in a}} dusky upper {{chamber and}} read [...] "French literature" [...] with blighted M. Toeppfer, son of a happier sire, as I was sure the charming writer and caricaturist, in spite of {{cumbrous}} cares, must have been; or when, a couple <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> {{and in the same}} eternal twilight (we groped almost lampless through the winter days, and our glimmering tapers, when they sparsely appeared, smelt of a past age), I worried out Virgil and Tite-Live with M. Verchère, or Schiller and Lessing with the ruddy noisy little professor of German, who sat always, the lesson long, in a light brown talma, the sides of which he caused violently to flap for emphasis like agitated wings, I was almost conscious of the breath of culture as I modestly aspired to culture, and was at any rate safe for the time from a summons to the blackboard at the hands of awful little M. Galopin, that dispenser of the paralysing chalk who most affected me. Extremely diminutive and wearing for the most part a thin inscrutable smile, the ghost of a tribute to awkwardness happily carried off, he found in our barren interviews, I believed, a charm to curiosity, bending afresh each time as over the handful of specimen dust, unprecedented product at its finest, extracted from the scratched soil of my intelligence. With M. Toeppfer I was almost happy; with each of these instructors my hour was unshared, my exploits unwitnessed, by others; but M. Toeppfer became a friend, shewed himself a causeur, brightened our lesson with memories of his time in Paris, where, if I am not mistaken, he had made, with great animation, his baccalauréat, and whence it was my possibly presumptuous impression he had brought back a state of health, apparently much impaired, which represented contrition for youthful spirits. He had haunted the parterre of the Théâtre Français, and when we read Racine his vision of Rachel, whom he had seen there as often as possible, revived; he was able to say at moments how she had spoken and moved, and I recall in particular his telling me that on her entrance as Phèdre, borne down, in her languorous passion, by the weight of her royal robes--"Que ces vains ornemens, que ces voiles me pèsent!"--the long lapse of time before she spoke and while she sank upon a seat filled itself extraordinarily with her visible woe. But where he most gave me comfort was in bringing home to me that the house commemorated, immortalised, as we call it, in the first of his father's Nouvelles Genevoises, La Bibliothèque de mon Oncle, was none other than the structure facing us where we sat and which so impinged and leaned on the cathedral walls that he had but to indicate to me certain points from the window of our room to reconstitute thrillingly the scenery, the drollery, the whimsical action of the tale. There was a demonstration I could feel important, votary and victim of the [...] "scene," [...] the scene and the [...] "atmosphere" [...] only, that I had been formed to be. That I called interesting lore--called it so at least to myself, though feeling {{it at the same time}} of course so little directly producible that I could perhaps even then have fronted this actually remote circumstance of my never having produced it till this moment. There abode in me, I may add, a sense that on any subject that did appeal and that so found me ready--such subjects being indeed as yet vague, but immensely suggestive of number--I should have grasped the confident chalk, welcomed the very biggest piece, not in the least have feared the blackboard. They were inscribed, alas for me, in no recognised course. I put my hand straight on another of them, none the less, if not on a whole group of others, in my ascent, each morning of the spring or the early summer sémestre, of the admirable old Rue de la Tour de Boël, pronounced Boisl, which, dusky, steep and tortuous, formed a short cut to that part of the Grand' Rue in which the Academy was then seated.|$|E

40|$|In the {{endeavour}} {{to apply}} exercise as a therapeutic or prophylactic modality, the health professional is {{challenged by the}} science of exercise prescription. In order to prescribe the correct "dosage" for a specific problem, the exercise principles (frequency, intensity, duration and time) should be borne in mind. Another frequently asked question to the Biokineticist/ Exercise Physiologist is what the effect of detraining and retraining will be when an interruption occurs in the rehabilitation or conditioning regimen. Hence {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the effect of training frequency on some physical and hemodynamic parameters in the training and retraining of adult males. Sixty (60) healthy but sedentary Caucasian males aged 28 - 49 years were recruited to participate in this study. They were randomly selected into 3 groups of 20 each. Groups A and B served as the training groups while group C formed the control group which remained sedentary, and followed their normal lifestyle. The experimental groups (A & B) initially trained for 12 <b>weeks</b> at <b>a</b> training frequency <b>of</b> 3 <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> This was followed by a detraining and retraining regimen of 12 weeks each. During the retraining period, Groups A and B retrained at a frequency of 2 and 4 times per week respectively. Some physical and hemodynamic parameters were assessed before (baseline) as well as after each phase. The physical working capacity (PWC) results of this study indicated that the experimental groups lost about 50 % of the gained benefits after 12 weeks of detraining. With retraining, <b>a</b> frequency <b>of</b> 2 <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> was able to maintain the level of PWC (Group A) while Group B, retraining at <b>a</b> frequency <b>of</b> 4 <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> improved and exceeded the capacity reached after the initial training phase. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest indicated salutogenic changes following the training and retraining regimens, with deterioration during detraining. However, not all changes were statistically significant. The parameters representing the effectiveness of cardio-vascular functioning during exercise, viz. systolic blood pressure as well as double product at peak (DP peak) workload, reflected statistically significant improvement with a training frequency <b>of</b> 3 <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> After 12 weeks of detraining, deterioration occurred in all mentioned parameters, but not to the pre-training level. With retraining, a training frequency <b>of</b> 2 <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> showed improvement (but not significant) in DP peak but not in SBP peak, while retraining at <b>a</b> frequency <b>of</b> 4 <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> resulted in statistically significant improvements.
