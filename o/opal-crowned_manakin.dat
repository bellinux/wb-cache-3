50|$|The golden-crowned manakin (Lepidothrix vilasboasi) {{is a small}} {{species of}} {{perching}} bird in the manakin family (Pipridae). It is endemic to the south-central Amazon Rainforest in Brazil, and it is threatened by habitat loss. Helmut Sick described this species in 1959 based {{on a series of}} specimens collected a few years before near a small tributary of the upper Rio Cururu-ri in the east Brazilian Amazon. The species was only rediscovered (in part due to confusion over the original type locality) in 2002. Except for the yellow crown of the male, it closely resembles a hybrid of the <b>opal-crowned</b> <b>manakin</b> and snow-capped manakin. Observations and molecular work has demonstrated that the species distributions do not overlap.|$|E
