40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} {{is a highly}} disabling anxiety disorder, characterized by occurrence of intrusive and unwanted thoughts (<b>obsessions),</b> which lead to performance of repetitive compulsions and/or rituals {{in order to reduce}} distress. Recently, it has been proposed that <b>obsessions</b> may be divided into two categories, termed autogenous and reactive <b>obsessions</b> [Lee, H. -J., & Kwon, S. -M. (2003). Two different types of obsessions: autogenous <b>obsessions</b> and reactive <b>obsessions.</b> Behavior Research and Therapy, 41, 11 - 29]. In this study, we aimed to further validate this subtyping of <b>obsessions,</b> and to investigate the cognitive and emotional correlates of the subtypes. Evidence was found for the division, using a confirmatory factor analysis in an analogue sample (N = 372). It was found that frequency of reactive <b>obsessions</b> related more strongly to distress caused by overt OC symptoms (e. g., washing, checking), whereas frequency of autogenous <b>obsessions</b> related to distress from impulses of harm. Compared to autogenous <b>obsessions,</b> frequency of reactive <b>obsessions</b> correlated more strongly with all OC-related beliefs. Few differences were found between autogenous and reactive <b>obsessions</b> with respect to depression, anxiety, and view about self (self-ambivalence, self-esteem). It is suggested that existing OC-belief measures are more relevant to reactive <b>obsessions.</b> Implications for theory and treatment are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Transformation <b>obsessions</b> denote an under-reported {{symptom of}} Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), characterised by an {{excessive}} fear of turning into another person/object or acquiring unwanted characteristics. Relative to other OCD symptoms, {{little is known}} about the clinical presentation of transformation <b>obsessions.</b> The study aims to examine the clinical correlates and treatment prognosis of transformation <b>obsessions</b> in a paediatric OCD sample. Methods: The sample consisted of 346 youths with a primary diagnosis of OCD. Patients with and without transformation <b>obsessions</b> were compared in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics, and CBT outcomes. Results: 10 % of the sample endorsed transformation <b>obsessions.</b> Patients with transformation <b>obsessions</b> were more likely to be boys, to be on augmented medication regimes, and to present with more severe <b>obsessions</b> at assessment. A factor analysis identified four major OCD symptom clusters, with transformation <b>obsessions</b> loading on a ‘forbidden thoughts’ factor alongside aggressive, sexual, and religious <b>obsessions.</b> No group differences in treatment outcomes were observed. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional and retrospective nature of the study, the representativeness of our sample, and use of concomitant medication, among others. Conclusions: The study provides the first empirical evidence regarding phenomenological similarities and differences between paediatric OCD patients presenting with and without transformation <b>obsessions.</b> The findings suggest that transformation <b>obsessions</b> are best conceptualised as related to ‘forbidden’ <b>obsessions</b> and respond to exposure-based CBT...|$|R

40|$|Obsessive-compulsion diorder (ocd) is {{characterized}} by recurrent <b>obsessions</b> and/or compulsions. <b>Obsessions</b> are intrusive and unwanted thoughts, images or feelings which elicit considerable anxiety and discomfort. Commonly recurring themes in <b>obsessions</b> are aggression, blasphemy, death and (unacceptable) sexual urges. Compulsions are repetitive, ritualistic behaviours or mental acts that are performed to reduce or neutralise the anxiety that is elicited by the <b>obsessions.</b> The most frequently encountered compulsions are ordering, counting, checking and washing. When the patient resists carrying out the compulsions, anxiety usually increases. Patients generally recognize that the <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions are excessive and irrational. Nevertheless, the <b>obsessions</b> and com-pulsions cause marked distress, are timeconsuming and interfere signiicantly with the person’s social or occupational life. Many patients experience both <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions; only a minority presents with either <b>obsessions</b> or compulsions (Foa & Kozak). Ocd is classiied in dsm- 4 as an anxiety disorder, although not all clinicians agree on this categorization (Nelson & Chouinard) ...|$|R
40|$|Sexual and {{religious}} <b>obsessions</b> are often grouped together as unacceptable thoughts, symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) hypothesized {{to be maintained}} by maladaptive beliefs about the importance and control of thoughts. Although there is empirical justification for this typology, {{there are several reasons}} to suspect that sexual {{and religious}} <b>obsessions</b> may differ with respect to associated obsessional beliefs and personality traits. In this study, we examined the associations between sexual and religious <b>obsessions</b> (separately) and (a) putatively obsessional cognitive styles, especially beliefs about the importance and control of thoughts, and responsibility; (b) obsessive-compulsive personality traits; and (c) schizotypal personality traits. Whereas sexual <b>obsessions</b> were predicted only by increased beliefs about the importance and control of thoughts, and contamination <b>obsessions</b> were predicted only by inflated responsibility appraisals and threat estimation, religious <b>obsessions</b> were independently predicted by both of these constructs. In addition, only religious <b>obsessions</b> were related to self-reported obsessive-compulsive personality traits. Researchers and clinicians should be cognizant of potentially important distinctions between sexual and religious <b>obsessions,</b> and the possibility that scrupulous OCD shares processes with both autogenous and reactive presentations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Sexual <b>obsessions</b> {{are common}} {{symptoms}} of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The literal content of these <b>obsessions</b> super cially resembles {{other types of}} iterative sexual ideation, {{as seen in the}} paraphilias, PTSD, and normal sexual fantasy. However, their form, function, and effect on behavior vary greatly. A failure to distinguish these different categories of sexual thought can lead to confusion and iatrogenic treatment. This paper will describe the content and form of sexual <b>obsessions,</b> clarify salient differences between sexual <b>obsessions</b> and other repetitive sexual thoughts, and nally discuss ways of treating sexual <b>obsessions</b> when they are symptomatic of OCD...|$|R

5000|$|Assessment of <b>obsessions</b> {{separately}} from compulsions. Many OCD symptom measures assess <b>obsessions</b> {{separately from}} compulsions, thus treating these symptoms as disconnected clinical phenomena. Yet {{research shows that}} <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions are related to one another. Moreover, OCD symptoms occur along thematic dimensions (or subtypes) that include both <b>obsessions</b> and compulsive rituals. Thus, many measures do not provide clinicians and researchers with the proper conceptual framework for best understanding and treating OCD symptoms.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the presence of}} <b>obsessions</b> {{in the general population}} and in various psychiatric disorders. Second, the impact of <b>obsessions</b> is studied in terms of general functioning and quality of life in the general population. Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), a large representative sample of the Dutch population (n = 7, 076). Diagnostic criteria were assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The association of quality of life and <b>obsessions</b> on each subject was assessed by using Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF- 36) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). <b>Obsessions</b> occurred frequently in the general population: the lifetime prevalence of <b>obsessions</b> was 5. 3 % and the 12 -month prevalence was 1. 7 %. Subjects with <b>obsessions</b> scored significantly worse (P <. 0001) on all eight dimensions of the SF- 36 {{as well as on the}} GHQ. When controlling for the presence of any mental disorder, the negative association of <b>obsessions</b> and low general health and well-being remained significantly intact. In patients with a psychiatric disorder, <b>obsessions</b> had a lifetime prevalence of 10. 3 % and a 12 -month prevalence of 6. 8 %. <b>Obsessions</b> are common phenomena in the general population and are associated with decreased functioning in several areas of health and well-being.

50|$|People {{with sexual}} <b>obsessions</b> can devote an {{excessive}} {{amount of time}} and energy attempting to understand the <b>obsessions.</b> They usually decide they are having these problems because they are defective in some way, and they are often too ashamed to seek help. Because sexual <b>obsessions</b> are not as well-described in the research literature, many therapists may fail to properly diagnose OCD in a client with primary sexual <b>obsessions.</b> Mental health professionals unfamiliar with OCD may even attribute the symptoms to an unconscious wish (typically in the case of psychoanalysts or psychodynamic therapists), sexual identity crisis, or hidden paraphilia. Such a misdiagnosis only panics an already distressed individual. Fortunately, sexual <b>obsessions</b> respond to the same type of effective treatments available for other forms of OCD: cognitive-behavioral therapy and serotonergic antidepressant medications (SSRIs). People with sexual <b>obsessions</b> may, however, need a longer and more aggressive course of treatment.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Obsessions</b> and compulsions {{are the two}} core {{features}} of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Mild and infrequent <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions are common. Persistent and distressing <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions of the kind seen in OCD occur in far fewer people. As {{is the case with}} other psychiatric disorders, many people with OCD do not seek help. Clinical observation suggests that help-seeking delay in OCD is substantial, averaging eleven years. A proliferation of research studies of non-OCD patient participants has arisen from the observation that some people in community settings have clinically significant <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions. Conversely, there is little research that considers why people with <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions delay help-seeking and why this morbidity may be missed. Aims: This thesis examined attitudes to obsessive-compulsive (OC) problems, the existence of <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions in non-psychiatric groups, the profile of OC features in a clinical OCD group, and the help-seeking and treatment experiences of people with OCD. Its primary focus was to discover barriers to disclosing <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions in order to seek help. Findings: Dermatology and obstetric outpatients and students exhibited <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions comparable to those evidenced by people with OCD. The content of an OC problem influenced judgements of fear and shame about disclosing the problem. People with OCD delayed seeking help because of fear, shame and lack of knowledge. Concealment had occurred {{in the hope that the}} problem would go away, or from fear of the reaction of others. Feelings of embarrassment and shame were pervasive. Implications: Continued research on public attitudes to OC problems and on the help-seeking experiences of people with such problems is necessary. Raising public awareness of <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions and their treatment may reduce stigma and fear. Ultimately, concealment is problematic for the person with <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions, and for the conceptualisation of OCD...|$|R

50|$|Because sex carries {{significant}} emotional, moral, {{and religious}} importance, it often becomes {{a magnet for}} <b>obsessions</b> in people predisposed to OCD.

50|$|Formal {{diagnosis}} may {{be performed}} by a psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or other licensed mental health professional. To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have <b>obsessions,</b> compulsions, or both, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize clinically significant <b>obsessions</b> and compulsions. Such <b>obsessions,</b> the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses, or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the normal range of worries about conventional problems. A person may attempt to ignore or suppress such <b>obsessions,</b> or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the <b>obsessions</b> as idiosyncratic or irrational.|$|R
