50|$|Jean-Paul Sartre also {{speaks of}} {{transcendence}} in his works. In Being and Nothingness, Sartre utilizes transcendence {{to describe the}} relation of the self to the object oriented world, as well as our concrete relations with <b>others.</b> For Sartre, <b>the</b> for-itself is sometimes called a transcendence. Additionally if <b>the</b> <b>other</b> is viewed strictly as an object, much like any <b>other</b> object, then <b>the</b> <b>other</b> is, for <b>the</b> for-itself, a transcendence-transcended. When the for-itself grasps <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in <b>the</b> <b>others</b> world, and grasps the subjectivity that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> has, it is referred to as transcending-transcendence. Thus, Sartre defines relations with others in terms of transcendence.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates which {{consequences}} for the constitution of subjectivity in its ethical-political dimension {{can be drawn from}} Waldenfels’ understanding of responsive phenomenology. The deferment Waldenfels’ thinking of responsivity suggests focuses on a precarious conception of the self as it is regarded as radically undisclosed in respect to <b>the</b> <b>Other.</b> Responding to <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>the</b> self is at the time responsible for <b>the</b> <b>Other.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> dimension of the ethical and the political is not to be taken as an additional aspect of subjectivity.
