5|$|Father Octavian orders them to set <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> cave {{system to}} reach the Byzantium, using a gravity globe to {{illuminate}} the cave. The Doctor and River comment on the various statues they pass, believing they are made by the planet's natives, until they recall the natives are two-headed beings and the statues are only single-headed. They conclude they must be weakened Weeping Angels, and that the Angel on the Byzantium purposely crashed the ship here to rescue its kind. The Angels start to pursue the group. Amy finds that she cannot move, and the Doctor realises {{that the image of}} the Angel still exists in her eye and is making her believe this; he bites her wrist to prove she is still mobile, and they continue to flee.|$|E
5|$|The Poles {{started to}} march towards Poland, but Stephen ambushed and routed {{them at a}} ravine in Bukovina on 25 and 26 October. Several raids into Poland during the {{following}} months, including the sacking of Lviv, Yavoriv, and Przemyśl, cemented his victory. These were either ordered and directed by Stephen, or carried <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> combined force of Ottoman–Tatar–Moldavian irregulars commanded by Malkoçoğlu. Stephen made peace with John Albert only after Poland and Hungary concluded a new alliance against the Ottoman Empire, and Moldavia received direct access to Lviv's markets. Meanwhile, the Ottoman campaign ended in disaster, as a heavy winter induced famine; various Polish and Lithuanian reports also suggest that Stephen ordered false flag attacks against his panicking former allies.|$|E
5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{soundtrack of}} Ocarina of Time {{was published by}} Pony Canyon and released in Japan on December 18, 1998. It comprises one compact disc with 82 tracks. A US version was also released, although with fewer tracks and different packaging artwork. Many critics praised the music in Ocarina of Time, although IGN was disappointed that the traditional Zelda overworld theme was not included. In 2001, {{three years after the}} initial release of Ocarina of Time, GameSpot labeled it {{as one of the top}} ten video game soundtracks. The soundtrack, at the time, was not released in Europe or Australia. In 2011, however, a 51-track limited edition soundtrack for the 3DS version was available in a free mail <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> Club Nintendo offer to owners of the 3DS edition, as an incentive to register the product. The original musical theme for the Fire Temple area was altered before release of the game, due to Nintendo's policy of not including real religious references in their products, with the altered theme simply removing the chanting samples.|$|E

25|$|Son Sann {{countered with}} the {{formation}} of a new military command committee under General Prum Vith. He said, however, that General Sak would remain as Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Military Command, which was launched in January 1986 reportedly as a concession to the dissident group. Under a compromise worked <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> third party, General Sak regained his control of the armed forces in March 1986. In July General Dien retired temporarily to a monastery.|$|E
25|$|Geoducks {{are one of}} the longest-living {{organisms in}} the animal kingdom. The oldest {{recorded}} specimen was 168 years old, but individuals usually live up to 140 years. A geoduck sucks water containing plankton down through its long siphon, filters this for food and ejects its refuse <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> separate hole in the siphon. Adult geoducks have few natural predators, which may also contribute to their longevity. In Alaska, sea otters and dogfish have proved capable of dislodging geoducks; starfish also attack and feed on the exposed geoduck siphon.|$|E
25|$|The {{recombinant}} {{building is}} a lesson in engineering and architecture. Thirty thousand square feet of studios and seminar spaces, a workshop, a thesis pit and a bridge to the library have been stacked, cantilevered and suspended to form an open-ended, permissive, flexible space. It seems that anything can happen within these walls. Enter a studio through its doorway (which has no door), and you are standing on what {{is more like a}} stage, looking <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> proscenium framed by new steel posts and girders set parallel to and in tandem with the old concrete columns and beams.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of those who escaped unharmed were workers {{in the front of}} the building who left through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke. Others tried to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; most of the survivors from the rear of the building got <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> loading bay. The bay was initially blocked by a tractor-trailer, but three workers went into the rear of the truck and pounded on the walls until they were heard by rescuers who moved the vehicle. Others escaped when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, though for many this came too late.|$|E
25|$|Hannibal {{defeated}} the Roman legions in several major engagements, including the Battle of the Trebia (December 218 BC), the Battle of Lake Trasimene (217 BC) and most famously the Battle of Cannae (216 BC), but his long-term strategy failed. Lacking siege engines and sufficient manpower {{to take the}} city of Rome itself, {{he had planned to}} turn the Italian allies against Rome and to starve the city <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> siege. However, {{with the exception of a}} few of the southern city-states, the majority of the Roman allies remained loyal and continued to fight alongside Rome, despite Hannibal's near-invincible army devastating the Italian countryside. Rome also exhibited an impressive ability to draft army after army of conscripts after each crushing defeat by Hannibal, allowing them to recover from the defeats at Cannae and elsewhere and to keep Hannibal cut off from aid.|$|E
25|$|Reid {{finally took}} his own chance to escape {{on the night of}} 14/15 October 1942, along with Major Ronald Littledale, Lieutenant Commander William L. Stephens RNVR, and Flight Lieutenant Howard Wardle RAF. They cut through the bars on a window in the prisoner's kitchen, and climbed out onto the flat roof of the German kitchen. They then crossed the brightly lit outer yard, and avoided being seen by a guard. They entered a storage cellar under the Kommandantur (Commandant's HQ), crawled <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> narrow air shaft leading to the dry moat, and exited through the park. They split into pairs, with Reid and Wardle {{disguised}} as Flemish workmen travelling by train to Tuttlingen, near the Swiss border, via Zwickau and Munich. They crossed the border near Ramsen on the evening of 18 October. Stephens and Littledale also travelled to Tuttlingen by train, via Chemnitz, Nuremberg and Stuttgart, then followed Reid and Wardle across the border {{in the early hours of}} 20 October.|$|E
50|$|Ileal conduit urinary diversion, {{in which}} the ureters are surgically resected from the bladder and a ureteroenteric {{anastomosis}} is made in order to drain the urine into a detached section of ileum (a part of the small intestine). The end of the ileum is then brought <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> opening (a stoma) in the abdominal wall. The urine is collected <b>through</b> <b>a</b> bag that attaches {{on the outside of}} the body over the stoma.|$|R
50|$|Longstone's most {{dramatic}} features are the Slateford Aqueduct (1822) carrying the Union Canal and the adjacent railway viaduct (1842). Underneath these runs the Water of Leith, and the canal may sometimes be seen pouring <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> overflow {{down into the}} river. The Water of Leith's visitor centre lies almost underneath the aqueduct here.|$|R
50|$|Surgical repair {{is carried}} <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> {{incision}} in the abdomen. After locating the pseudocyst, it {{is attached to}} the wall of the stomach and the cystogastrostomy is created. This is the most expensive of the three methods. Although it has a high success rate, it is infrequently used because of the extensive recovery period.|$|R
25|$|The use {{of digital}} rights {{management}} is not universally accepted. Proponents of DRM {{argue that it is}} necessary to prevent intellectual property from being copied freely, just as physical locks are needed to prevent personal property from being stolen, that it can help the copyright holder maintain artistic control, and that it can ensure continued revenue streams. Those opposed to DRM contend there is no evidence that DRM helps prevent copyright infringement, arguing instead that it serves only to inconvenience legitimate customers, and that DRM helps big business stifle innovation and competition. Furthermore, works can become permanently inaccessible if the DRM scheme changes or if the service is discontinued. DRM can also restrict users from exercising their legal rights under the copyright law, such as backing up copies of CDs or DVDs (instead having to buy another copy, if it can still be purchased), lending materials <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> library, accessing works in the public domain, or using copyrighted materials for research and education under the fair use doctrine, and under French law. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) consider the use of DRM systems to be an anti-competitive practice.|$|E
25|$|Carlito buys train {{tickets to}} Miami {{for himself and}} Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met {{by a group of}} mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> secret exit. The Italians pursue him {{throughout}} the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal, where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly dies.|$|E
25|$|Contracts for {{the project}} were awarded {{to some of the}} biggest and most reputed {{construction}} firms in India, including Larsen & Toubro, Gammon India and AFCONS. To enable quicker construction, several innovative practices were adopted. Piers for major bridges were cast on the riverbanks itself and launched using cranes mounted on pontoons. The technique of incremental launching of bridge spans was used {{for the first time in}} India. Since it would take too long to complete the project using locally available tunnelling technology, nine hydraulic tunnelling machines were imported from Sweden in order to bore through the hard rock of the Sahayadris. The biggest challenge, however, came from the nine tunnels that had to be bored through soft soil. No technology existed anywhere in the world for this purpose and the work had to be carried <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> painstakingly slow manual process. Excavation was almost impossible due to the clayey soil that was saturated with water owing to a high water table in the region. Several times tunnels collapsed immediately after they had been dug, necessitating work to be redone. Nineteen lives and four years were lost while constructing the soft soil tunnels alone. In all, seventy-four people perished during the construction of the line.|$|E
30|$|Feature {{extraction}} {{was carried}} <b>out</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> empirical mode decomposition. The extracted features were forwarded to two classifiers, the classification and regression {{tree and the}} C 4.5 classifiers. The method using the C 4.5 classifier suggested by Martis et al. [14] obtained good experimental results of 95.33, 98 and 97  % for accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively.|$|R
