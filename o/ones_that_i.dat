500|$|Labyrinth {{was being}} seriously {{discussed}} {{as early as}} March 1983, when Henson held a meeting with Froud and children's author Dennis Lee. Lee was tasked with writing a novella on which a script could be based, submitting {{it at the end}} of 1983. Henson approached Terry Jones to write the film's script as [...] "his daughter Lisa had just read Erik the Viking and suggested that he try me as screen-writer." [...] Jones was given Dennis Lee's novella to use as a basis for his script, but later told Empire that Lee had produced an unfinished [...] "poetic novella" [...] that he [...] "didn't really get on with." [...] In light of this, Jones [...] "discarded it and sat down with Brian 's drawings and sifted through them and found the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really liked, and started creating the story from them." ...|$|E
500|$|In the hospice's {{founding}} charter, {{signed in}} August 1443, Rolin wrote that [...] "disregarding all human concerns {{and in the}} interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal <b>ones,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital." [...] In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily. [...] Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, {{played a major role in}} the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.|$|E
500|$|On February 16, 1824, de la Torre {{mandated}} a more-aggressive pursuit {{and prosecution}} of pirates. In March the governor ordered {{a search for}} the schooner Caballo Blanco, reportedly used in the boarding of Boniton and Bonne Sophie and similar attacks. In private communication with Mayagüez military commander José Rivas, he asked Rivas to find someone trustworthy who could launch a mission to capture [...] "the so-called Cofresin" [...] and to notify him personally of the pirate's arrest. Authorizing the use of force, the governor described Cofresí as [...] "one of the evil <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am pursuing" [...] and acknowledged that the pirate was protected by Cabo Rojo authorities. The mayor was unable (or unwilling) to cooperate, despite orders from de la Torre. Rivas tracked Cofresí to his house twice, but found it empty. When the captain lost contact with the pirate and his wife, he was also unable to communicate with the mayor. A similar search was undertaken in San Germán, whose mayor reported to de la Torre on March 12, 1824.|$|E

500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect she had on her husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can be here today and gone tomorrow. And how I measure riches is by the friends I have and the loved <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have and the people that I care about in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucas had story {{treatments}} for episodes VII, VIII and IX which {{he turned over}} to Disney chairman Bob Iger around the time Lucasfilm was sold to Disney in 2012. However, during an interview with Cinemablend in January 2014 to promote the upcoming release of the Lucasfilm animated movie Strange Magic, Lucas revealed that ultimately, Disney chose {{not to use the}} story treatments which he had written and turned over with the acquisition, and that the company chose to create brand new stories for the upcoming movies instead: [...] "The <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sold to Disney, they came up to the decision that they didn't really want to do those. So they made up their own. So it's not the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> originally wrote [...] ". No information about these has been released; however, during the previous 35 years, Lucas had given many hints about the content of the sequel trilogy, including the following (sometimes contradictory) possibilities: ...|$|E
2500|$|Through Roeder, Faragher became {{well known}} in circles {{concerned}} with Manx Gaelic culture. He became connected with the major figures of the Manx cultural revival, including Sophia Morrison, John Kneen, Edmund Goodwin and John Clague. As this {{was at the time}} of Pan-Celticism, there was also an interest in Faragher from outside the island. Faragher's letters to Roeder tell of visits from gentlemen who had [...] "heard [...] name mentioned in London," [...] academics such as the Professor of Gaelic from Scotland who communicated with him through Scottish Gaelic, and Edward Spencer Dodgson (cousin of Lewis Carroll) who visited Faragher in Cregneash when visiting the island. In 1896 the foreign interest in Faragher reached such an extent that he would write that he was being [...] "kept busy answering young ladies letters <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never saw." ...|$|E

2500|$|In mid June Darwin {{returned}} home to Shrewsbury, and continued [...] "working like a tiger" [...] for the Canary scheme, [...] "at present Spanish & Geology, the former I find as intensely stupid, as the latter most interesting". By then his most likely companion on the trip was the tutor Marmaduke Ramsay. Darwin was [...] "trying to make a map" [...] of Shropshire, [...] "but dont find it so easy as I expected." [...] He ordered a clinometer, and on 11 July wrote to tell Henslow that it had arrived and he had tried it out in his bedroom. [...] "As yet I have only indulged in hypotheses; but they are such powerful <b>ones,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> suppose, if they were put into action but for one day, the world would come to an end." [...] In efforts to learn the basics of geology he extended his mapping of strata {{as far away as}} Llanymynech, some [...] from Shrewsbury, using the terminology he had learnt in Edinburgh from Robert Jameson. Already he was anxious that he had not heard from Sedgwick, and when he investigated ship sailings he found that they were only available in certain months. For this reason, the trip to Teneriffe had to be postponed to the following June, and it looked increasingly unlikely that Henslow would come on the trip. Darwin wrote to one of his student friends that he was [...] "at present mad about Geology" [...] and had plans to ride through Wales then meet with other students at Barmouth.|$|E
