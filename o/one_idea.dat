5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> was to have {{some parts of the}} Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E
5|$|One current {{difficulty}} in {{the ideas of}} Geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> offered by Rael in Geniocracy is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, {{a series of tests}} that would define each person's level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In {{every other}} {{transaction}} of life no man's wits {{could be more}} regular than those of Smart, for this prevalence of <b>one</b> <b>idea</b> pertinaciously keeping the first place in his head had in no sense, except in what immediately related to itself, perverted his judgement at all; his opinions were unchanged as before, nor did he seem more likely to fall {{into a state of}} distraction than any other man; less so, perhaps, as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} content {{featured}} in the game received mixed reviews. Miller thought that the game only revolved around <b>one</b> <b>idea,</b> which led to its simplistic gameplay. Camron and Cooper thought that the campaign was too short for most players. Shoemaker thought that for a full-priced game, it lacked content. Reiner furthered criticized the game's low replay value. Carter advocated that players purchase the game when its price dropped. He added that while the game features lots of ideas, most of them failed to deliver.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} considered other methods of recovering active {{material in the}} event of a dud explosion. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> was to cover it with a cone of sand. Another was to suspend the bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment either. The CM-10 (Chemistry and Metallurgy) group at Los Alamos also studied how the active material could be chemically recovered after a contained or failed explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{theoretical}} {{maximum energy}} dissipation from Gulf Stream by turbines {{is in the}} range of 20-60GW. <b>One</b> <b>idea,</b> which would supply the equivalent power of several nuclear power plants, would deploy a field of underwater turbines placed 300 meters (980ft) under the center of the core of the Gulf Stream. Ocean thermal energy could also be harnessed to produce electricity using the temperature difference between cold deep water and warm surface water.|$|E

5|$|All {{four major}} {{networks}} {{turned down the}} new Star Trek series, as they were not willing to commit to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot {{as well as a}} promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including Robert H. Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{developed}} his own theories regarding {{the history of}} the Cheyenne. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> in particular, that many of Custer's men committed suicide when the situation became hopeless, proved to be highly controversial. This idea first surfaced in the Wooden Leg narrative, but was most fully developed in Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, considered by Marquis to be his most important work and the culmination of his Custer research. The latter was not published during Marquis' life; much of his work did not appear in print until the 1970s. The last book to be published, The Cheyennes of Montana (pub. 1978), is regarded as especially valuable by historians. In 2006 of a collection of his photographs was published as, A Northern Cheyenne Album.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers sought {{inspiration}} from novels such as Prime Directive, Spock's World and Best Destiny {{to fill in}} gaps unexplained by canon; Best Destiny particularly explores Kirk's childhood and names his parents. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> that was justified through information from the novels was having Enterprise built on Earth, which {{was inspired by a}} piece of fan art of Enterprise being built in a shipyard. Orci had sent the fan art to Abrams to show how realistic the film could be. Orci explained parts of the ship would have to be constructed on Earth because of the artificial gravity employed on the ship and its requirement for sustaining warp speed, and therefore the calibration of the ship's machinery would be best done in the exact gravity well which is to be simulated. They felt free to have the ship built in Iowa because canon is ambiguous as to whether it was built in San Francisco, but this {{is a result of the}} time travel rather than something intended to overlap with the original timeline. Abrams noted the continuity of the original series itself was inconsistent at times.|$|E

50|$|Other, more {{specialized}} topics studied include amodal perception and object permanence.

25|$|Variations in the Solvay process {{have been}} {{proposed}} for carbon sequestration. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> is to react carbon dioxide, produced perhaps by the combustion of coal, to form solid carbonates (such as sodium bicarbonate) that could be permanently stored, thus avoiding carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the Amazonian dark earths were not {{immediately}} clear to later settlers. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> was that they resulted from ashfall from volcanoes in the Andes, since they occur more frequently on the brows of higher terraces.

In spite of this, the senior staff felt compelled to resume innovative programs that had characterized the Board during the 1960s and 1970s. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> had been talked about in the program department was a school for artistic students.|$|E
25|$|During one journalism conference, Hersh {{stated that}} after the Strait of Hormuz incident, members of the Bush {{administration}} met in vice president Dick Cheney's office to consider methods of initiating a war with Iran. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> considered was staging a false flag operation involving the use of Navy SEALs dressed as Iranian PT boaters who would engage in a firefight with US ships. According to Hersh this proposed provocation was rejected. Hersh's allegation has not been verified.|$|E
25|$|The renter Nathaniel H. Ragland then {{purchased}} the property for $1,250 in 1872. After Nathaniel died in 1888, his widow Martha sold {{the property in}} 1891 for $10,000 to a Captain Myron Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York. Dunlap and some other investors who participated devised a few plans intending {{to capitalize on the}} notoriety of the property. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> was to completely take apart the wooden house and move it to Chicago as an exhibit for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. This plan fell through due to lack of total interest of all the investors involved.|$|E

30|$|Although student-active {{methods have}} been {{recently}} emphasized, their essence goes back to ancient Greece and the Socratic Method.

25|$|If {{the hidden}} {{variables}} {{can communicate with}} each other faster than light, Bell's inequality can easily be violated. Once one particle is measured, it can communicate the necessary correlations to the other particle. Since in relativity the notion of simultaneity is not absolute, this is unattractive. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> is to replace instantaneous communication with a process that travels backwards in time along the past light cone. This is the idea behind a transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics, which interprets the statistical emergence of a quantum history as a gradual coming to agreement between histories that go both forward and backward in time.|$|E
25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have <b>one</b> <b>idea</b> in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E
25|$|Metzger {{worked to}} {{encourage}} friendly {{relationships with other}} religious communities. <b>One</b> <b>idea</b> that Metzger proposed was {{the establishment of a}} religious United Nations in Jerusalem. He first advocated this in late 2004 after mediating a highly publicized dispute between Jerusalem Haredim and the Armenian Christian community. Under Metzger's plan, the new body would contain representatives of the world's religions, as opposed to nations. Metzger has also suggested that the Dalai Lama could lead the assembly. The Dalai Lama was reportedly very excited at the idea, and pledged to help Metzger realize his plan. Other supporters include Frederico Major, the co-president of the Alliance for Civilizations, a Spanish lobby group for international conflict resolution.|$|E
