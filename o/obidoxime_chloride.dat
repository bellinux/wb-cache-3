40|$|Atropine (AT) and oximes, {{alone or}} in combination, have been proven greatly {{valuable}} therapeutics {{in the treatment of}} organophosphates intoxications. An injectable mixture of AT and obidoxime (OB) was formulated for the administration by automatic self-injector. The aqueous single dose solution contained 275 mg <b>obidoxime</b> <b>chloride</b> and 2. 5 mg atropine sulfate per 1 mL (220 mg and 2 mg per 0. 8 effective dose, respectively). The final solution was sterilized by filtration through a 0. 22 Âµm pore size filter. This more concentrated solution allowed to use a smaller size and lighter weight cartridge. Quality control tests, including assay of the two major compounds were performed separately, using reversed-phase HPLC methods. Besides, the stability test was carried out according to ICH guideline for the accelerated test. The obtained results showed that the proposed formulation is stable over a period of 2 years after preparation...|$|E
