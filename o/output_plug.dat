50|$|The Covox Speech Thing is an {{external}} audio device {{attached to the}} computer to output digital sound. It was composed of the most primitive 8-bit DAC using a resistor ladder and an analogue signal <b>output,</b> and <b>plugged</b> into the printer port of the PC.|$|R
5000|$|DJ mixers have an AC {{mains plug}} that is {{connected}} to the wall to supply electric power for the unit. Some DJ mixers can take batteries, which enables users to mix songs outside or away from electric power sources, with the <b>output</b> being <b>plugged</b> into a portable boom box or other battery-powered sound system.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to design and build an industrialized {{microprocessor}} system capable of testing the limits and capabilities of microprocessors in the industrial process control world. The system must be capable of operating in a data logging or control or supervisory capacity. The system consists of a ruggerdized, electrically isolated unit, designed on a "black box" principle, with minimum operator controls. It is housed in a sealed crate with internal access via rows of input and <b>output</b> <b>plugs</b> and connecters. The system has been designed on a modular basis {{in order to simplify}} expansion. It can be operated as a small dedicated controller or expanded by the addition of memory and/or industrial I/O modules to its full capacity. The system is based on an INTEL 8080 microprocessor. The industrial interface consists of electrically isolated analog and digital input and output modules which can be selected under program control. There are also up to 64 asynchronous priority encoded alarm channels that can interrupt the control sequence at any time should an alarm condition arise. For debugging hardware and software a plug-on front panel unit is provided...|$|R
5000|$|Higher-cost bass {{amplifiers}} sometimes include built-in bass effects, {{which are}} electronic effects units designed for electric bass or more rarely, for upright bass. Common built-in effects include audio compressor or limiter features, which {{help to keep}} the amplifier from doing unwanted distorting at high volume levels and potentially damaging the speakers; equalizers; and in some amps from the 1980s and more commonly in the 2000s, bass overdrive. Bass amps may provide an XLR DI <b>output</b> for <b>plugging</b> the bass amp signal directly into a mixing board or PA system. Larger, more powerful bass amplifiers (300 or more watts) are often provided with internal or external metal heat sinks and/or fans {{to help keep the}} amplifier cool.|$|R
40|$|We enhance {{power and}} {{accuracy}} of QTL mapping in multiple related families, by clustering {{the founders of the}} families on their local genomic similarity. MCQTL is a linkage mapping software application that allows the joint QTL mapping of multiple related families. In its current implementation, QTLs are modeled with one or two parameters for each parent that is a founder of the multi-cross design. The higher the number of parents, the higher the number of model parameters which can impact the power and the accuracy of the mapping. We propose {{to make use of the}} availability of denser and denser genotyping information on the founders to lessen the number of MCQTL parameters and thus boost the QTL discovery. We developed clusthaplo, an R package ([URL]), which aims to cluster haplotypes using a genomic similarity that reflects the probability of sharing the same ancestral allele. Computed in a sliding window along the genome and followed by a clustering method, the genomic similarity allows the local clustering of the parent haplotypes. Our assumption is that the haplotypes belonging to the same class transmit the same ancestral allele. So their putative QTL allelic effects can be modeled with the same parameter, leading to a parsimonious model, that is plugged in MCQTL. Intensive simulations using three maize data sets showed the significant gain in power and in accuracy of the QTL mapping with the ancestral allele model compared to the classical MCQTL model. MCQTL_LD (clusthaplo <b>outputs</b> <b>plug</b> in MCQTL) is a versatile and powerful tool for QTL mapping in multiple related families that makes use of linkage and linkage disequilibrium (web site [URL]) ...|$|R
5000|$|Sound modules may use {{any number}} of {{technologies}} to produce their sounds. A sound module may be an analog or digital synthesizer, a sampler, or a rompler. Electronic drum module are sound modules which specialize in percussion sounds. Drum modules may be triggered by external trigger pads or pickups {{as well as through}} MIDI. Drum modules are distinguished from drum machines through their lack of dedicated on-board triggers and lack of an integrated sequencer. Sound modules are often rack-mountable, but might also have a table-top form factor, particularly when the intended user is a DJ or record producer. The height of a sound module is often described in rack units ("U") or unit. Small sound modules are mostly 1U in height, the larger models a multiplication e.g. 2U or 3U. Despite the name, [...] "sound module", most sound modules do not produce any audible sound until their <b>output</b> is <b>plugged</b> into a keyboard amplifier and loudspeaker or a PA system.|$|R
5000|$|The Nexus Q {{takes the}} form of a sphere with a flat base; Google {{designer}} Mike Simonian explained that its form factor was meant to represent a device that pointed towards [...] "the cloud", and towards [...] "people all around" [...] to reflect its communal nature. The sphere is divided into two halves; the top half can be rotated to adjust the audio volume being output over attached speakers or to other home theater equipment, and tapped to mute. In between the two halves is a ring of 32 LEDs; these lights serve as a music visualizer that animate in time to music, and can be set to one of five different color schemes. The rear of the device contains a power connector, ethernet jack, micro HDMI and optical audio <b>outputs,</b> banana <b>plugs</b> for connecting speakers to the device's built-in 25-watt [...] "stereo-grade" [...] amplifier, and a micro USB connector meant to [...] "connect future accessories and encourage general hack-ability". The Nexus Q includes an OMAP4 processor, 1 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of storage used for caching of streamed content. It also supports near-field communication and Bluetooth for pairing devices and initial setup.|$|R
5000|$|The DR-110 had various outputs. It could output a [...] "V-trig" [...] {{clock pulse}} (+6V, 10ms duration), via a 3.5mm mini-jack, to allow other [...] "slave" [...] {{synthesizer}} units (e.g. arpeggiators) to synchronize to the DR-110 accent section. The DR-110 has a 10kΩ impedance unbalanced mono audio output, available on an ¼" [...] phone connector socket. This <b>output</b> can be <b>plugged</b> into a keyboard amplifier or PA system. The socket was configured as the [...] "Roland P-bus", which meant {{it also could}} be used as a simultaneous audio input, the input source being mixed with the output signal. A separate 3.5mm headphone output socket was also present. The headphone socket can be used with headphones to listen to the unit's drum sounds without disturbing others.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} in October 1990, {{with the objective}} of developing and validating a new computer model of a recovery boiler furnace using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code specifically tailored to the requirements for solving recovery boiler flows, and using improved submodels for black liquor combustion based on continued laboratory fundamental studies. The key tasks to be accomplished were as follows: (1) Complete the development of enhanced furnace models that have the capability to accurately predict carryover, emissions behavior, dust concentrations, gas temperatures, and wall heat fluxes. (2) Validate the enhanced furnace models, so that users can have confidence in the predicted results. (3) Obtain fundamental information on aerosol formation, deposition, and hardening so as to develop the knowledge base needed to relate furnace model <b>outputs</b> to <b>plugging</b> and fouling in the convective sections of the boiler. (4) Facilitate the transfer of codes, black liquid submodels, and fundamental knowledge to the US kraft pulp industry. Volume 1 contains {{the main body of the}} report and the first 4 sections of Appendix 1 : Modeling of black liquor recovery boilers [...] summary report; Flow and heat transfer modeling in the upper furnace of a kraft recovery boiler; Numerical simulation of black liquor combustion; and Investigation of turbulence models and prediction of swirling flows for kraft recovery furnaces...|$|R
