5|$|The {{first phase}} saw the {{addition}} of an inner railway track, {{which was designed to}} take a third of the weight of the telescope. The outer railway track, which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years, was relaid in the second phase. Four bogies and their steelwork were added on the inner track, and the existing bogies on the <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> were overhauled.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E
25|$|South of the Armitage station, Brown and Purple Line trains {{continue}} southward {{towards the}} Chicago Loop on elevated tracks which zigzags {{its way through}} the neighborhoods of Lincoln Park and Near North Side stopping at Sedgwick and Chicago/Franklin. Running over Franklin, then Wells Street, a stop is made at the Merchandise Mart before crossing the Chicago River on the upper level of the Wells Street Bridge before joining the Loop Elevated at Lake Street. Operating counterclockwise, Brown Line trains operate around the Loop on the <b>Outer</b> <b>track</b> via Wells-Van Buren-Wabash-Lake, serving all Loop stations, before the return trip back north to the Kimball terminal.|$|E
50|$|Besides defragmenting program files, the defragmenting tool {{can also}} reduce {{the time it takes}} to load {{programs}} and open files. For example, the Windows 9x defragmenter included the Intel Application Launch Accelerator which optimized programs on the disk by placing the defragmented program files and their dependencies next to each other, in the order of which the program loads them, to load these programs faster. At the beginning of the hard drive, the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> have a higher transfer rate than the inner tracks. Placing frequently accessed files onto the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> increases performance. Third party defragmenters, such as MyDefrag, will move frequently accessed files onto the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> and defragment these files.|$|R
50|$|South of this station, {{the center}} track splits into two and forms the local tracks {{of the line}} while the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> pass under the two center tracks and merge into a single track between them. This center track is the express track {{of the line and}} is only used during rush hours in the peak direction. The track layout allows for trains {{stopping}} on the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> to remain on the local tracks {{for the rest of the}} line. North of the station, the center track widens to two tracks that lead to the Concourse Yard to the west. The <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> curve to the east to Norwood - 205th Street, the last stop on this line.|$|R

2500|$|The stage {{featured}} a pentagonal <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> with five ramps {{to a central}} circular platform. This platform would normally be higher {{than the rest of}} the stage, but could be lowered down below the stage to allow the band to enter from or exit to the [...] "understage" [...] area (equivalent to [...] "backstage"); the ramps would adjust accordingly. The platform and ramps could also be positioned flat at the level of stage the with the rest of the stage, creating a flat stage with only a slight step-up from the <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> to the center area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrumental}} {{band was}} {{situated in the}} space between the <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> and the central platform, with band members separated from each other by the ramps. The stage was also accessible by stairways down off {{the outer edge of the}} stage to the venue floor, from where the [...] "understage" [...] could also be accessed. Among those involved in designing the staging was Mark Rabbit.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{one notable}} 6-track local station, DeKalb Avenue on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, where trains {{to or from}} the Manhattan Bridge either stop at the outer tracks of the island {{platforms}} (...) , or pass through and bypass the station on the middle tracks ("bypass express tracks") (...) [...] Trains to or from the Montague Street Tunnel (...) stop across the platform from the respective <b>outer</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> (1 and 4) are {{generally}} used by stopping trains to allow non-stop trains to pass.|$|R
5000|$|... 168th Street is {{an express}} {{station on the}} IND Eighth Avenue Line that opened on September 10, 1932, and has four tracks and two island platforms. Contrary to the usual express station layout, the inner tracks serve the C local trains while the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> serve the A express trains. This {{is to make it}} easier for C trains to {{terminate}} here, and turn around to make the southbound trip to Brooklyn. South of this station, the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> descend to a lower level below the inner tracks, creating a two-over-two track layout. North of the station, the inner tracks continue north under Broadway to 174th Street Yard while the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> turn sharply under Fort Washington Avenue before continuing to Inwood-207th Street.|$|R

2500|$|Both <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> walls have a {{lime green}} tile band {{with a black}} border and small [...] "71st AVE" [...] signs below them, in white {{lettering}} on black tiles. The station's columns are painted in lime green with signs reading [...] "71 - Forest Hills", while older signs on the black columns between the express tracks read [...] "CONTINENTAL AVENUE - Forest Hills" [...] in black lettering on a white border.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> walls have a blue color stripe {{with a black}} {{border and}} {{relatively}} new, 2-tile-by-10-tile black-on-white name tablets stating [...] "ROOSEVELT" [...] at regular interval. The platforms' I-beam columns are painted in blue, but some columns are encased in concrete and covered with white tiles. The fare control is {{in the center of}} the full-length mezzanine above the platforms and tracks, with unmanned High Entry-Exit Turnstile (HEET) entrances at the southeast end of the mezzanine, and a turnstiled exit with a booth at the northeast end. There is also a HEET entrance {{in the center of the}} mezzanine.|$|E
2500|$|An {{instrumental}} jazz melody {{was used}} to allow the band to change into suits (initially pink, but replaced with dark pin-striped suits later in the tour). They were raised on the central platform with stools and mic stands to sing a string of ballads. They added matching fedoras for the [...] "hat-dance" [...] routine in [...] "All I Have To Give". [...] "Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely" [...] featured five of the female dancers slow-dancing on the <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> while the band remains on the upper platform until after the bridge when the band members {{came down to the}} track to slow-dance with a dancer. They returned to the platform and were lowered under the stage to end the song, and ostensibly end the concert.|$|E

25|$|Whitehall Street–South Ferry on the BMT Broadway Line {{has three}} tracks and two island platforms. The <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> {{continue}} south into the Montague Street Tunnel to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn, {{and are used}} by late-night N trains and daytime R trains. The center track, used to terminate late-night R trains from Brooklyn and weekday W trains from Queens, merges with the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> {{at both ends of}} the station.|$|R

2500|$|The {{factor of}} 306 {{cylinders}} (rather than 256 or 512, {{both of which}} are powers of two) in the calculation causes the capacity to be not conveniently close to a power of 1024; operating systems and programs using the customary binary prefixes show this as [...] "9.5625MB". Many later drives in the personal computer market used 17 sectors per track; still later, zone bit recording was introduced, causing the number of sectors per track to vary from the <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> to the inner. Nor are drives required to have a number of active surfaces that is a power of, or even divisible by, two; drives with e.g. three active surfaces are not uncommon. All of these factors reduce the utility of the customary binary prefixes for expressing drive capacity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974 {{the last}} {{prototype}} was discovered abandoned {{in a field}} at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. It is unknown where it spent the intervening 27 years. It is the sole remaining example of these tanks and was exhibited at the Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor in Kentucky. In 2011, it was shipped to its new home at Fort Benning, Georgia. It will {{be placed in the}} new Patton Park, which is a plot of 30 acres where all of the tanks being stored at Fort Benning will be displayed. Patton Park will be completed by 2020. Unfortunately the vehicle was damaged in January 2017 during transit to another facility for external refurbishment when it broke loose from the M1070 HET carrying it. [...] The transporter failed to negotiate a downhill slope and subsequent bend at a safe speed, causing the securing chains to break and allowing the T28 to slide off the trailer. [...] Despite then rolling into a ditch, only minor repairable damage was sustained to 2 bogies. The <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> units had been removed.|$|E

50|$|The board {{consists}} of a square with an <b>outer</b> <b>track</b> and several minor loops (called occupation paths), each of which starts and ends at a space on the <b>outer</b> <b>track.</b> Originally there were eight loops, but that was later simplified to six. Some fame, happiness and money ("victory points") can be obtained on the <b>outer</b> <b>track.</b> These victory points can be obtained more quickly on the occupation paths. Each occupation path has more opportunities for certain types of victory points than others (e.g., in Hollywood there are many opportunities to get fame points). Each occupation also has certain minimum entry requirements.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{the tunnel}} are three former stations, located at 59th Street, 72nd Street, and 86th Street, {{each of which}} had side {{platforms}} on the two <b>outer</b> <b>tracks.</b> These are now used for storage and emergency exits. None of the stations' platforms are more than 172 ft long, making them too short for contemporary trains to use. [...] While the 59th Street and 72nd Street stations had typical side platforms located {{on the outside of}} all four tracks (i.e. trains on the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> opened their doors on the right), the 86th Street station had two platforms located in between the outside tracks and the center pair of tracks, creating side platforms that resembled walled-off island platforms. [...] This is similar to the layout at 14th Street-Sixth Avenue, except the platforms are walled off from the center tracks, so that trains on the <b>outer</b> <b>tracks</b> opened their doors on the left, and trains on the inner tracks bypassed the station.|$|R
