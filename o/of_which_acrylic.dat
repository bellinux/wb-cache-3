30|$|Recently, {{a unique}} {{behavior}} was reported for bacterial cellulose (BC) in <b>which</b> <b>acrylic</b> acid and sodium acrylate were copolymerized and crosslinked in situ [12]. This crosslinked BC gel had excellent shape recovery after multiple drying and rewetting cycles {{because of the}} superabsorbent nature of PAANa [13, 14]. This phenomenon can be interpreted by considering the high osmotic pressure <b>of</b> PAANa gel, <b>which</b> absorbs {{a large amount of}} water in its three-dimensional networks and retains the absorbed water even under compression, drying, and shrinkage. The PAANa gel has high durability and stability in the swelling environment and during the storage [14]. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the applicability of this technique to WW as a potential tool for preservation from unexpected drying.|$|R
40|$|Widely used {{materials}} are reported as denture cleansers are peroxide and hypochlorite. Many contradictions {{on the effectiveness}} of the commercial peroxide base solution against Candida albicans (C. albicans). Low concentration sodium hypochlorite (0. 5 %) is used as a household sanitizer. But it is still unknown whether it has an antifungal effect, what is the optimum concentration and contact time to destroy the yeast. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the antifungal efficacy of commercial peroxide-based soaking solution and low concentration sodium hypochlorite against C. albicans, to determine the optimum concentration and contact time, and at the end, to obtain an effective denture soaking solution which is safe to use, easy to get, affordable and could be used to destroy C. albicans on dentures. The research conducted was an in vitro practical test for surface disinfectant. Sixty plates <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>which</b> were already incubated with C. albicans are immersed in peroxide and hypochlorite base soaking solution in different concentration and contact time. The result showed that peroxide base was not effective to C. albicans and hypochlorite base solution can destroy C. albicans in 10 minutes at a concentration of 0, 125 %. Thus, the use of low concentration sodium hypochlorite as a denture soaking solution can be suggested...|$|R

40|$|Adhesive {{interactions}} between Candida albicans and oral bacteria are generally thought {{to play a}} crucial role in the microbial colonization <b>of</b> denture <b>acrylic,</b> <b>which</b> may lead to denture stomatitis. This study investigated the influence of saliva on the adhesive {{interactions between}} C. albicans and Streptococcus sanguis or Actinomyces naeslundii on denture acrylic. First, bacteria were allowed to adhere to the acrylic surface from a flowing suspension, and subsequently yeasts were flowed over the acrylic surface. The organisms were assayed in the presence or absence of human whole saliva. All experiments were carried out in a parallel plate flow chamber and enumeration was done in situ with an image analysis system. In the absence of adhering bacteria, adhesion of C. albicans from buffer was more extensive than from saliva. However, in the presence of adhering bacteria, yeast adhesion from saliva was increased with respect to adhesion of yeasts from buffer, indicating that specific salivary components constitute a bridge between bacteria and yeasts. In all cases, yeast aggregates consisting of 3 to 5 yeast cells were observed adhering to the surface. A surface physico-chemical analysis of the microbial cell surfaces prior to and after bathing the microorganisms in saliva, suggests that this bridging is mediated by acid-base interactions since all strains show a major increase in electron-donating surface free energy parameters upon bathing in saliva, with no change in their zeta potentials. The surface physico-chemical analysis furthermore suggests that S. sanguis and A. naeslundii may use a different mechanism for adhesive interactions with C. albicans in saliva...|$|R

40|$|This is {{an artistic}} {{response}} to Mrs Lindy Chamberlain and the drama that engulfed {{almost a decade}} of her life. That drama began {{with the loss of}} her baby Azaria to a dingo while on a family camping holiday at Uluru in Central Australia in 1980. Two years later she was wrongly convicted of the baby’s murder, and spent the next three-and-a-half years in gaol. Upon her release, she continued to fight to clear her name. Her conviction was finally quashed in 1989. The Chamberlain drama was part of the almost daily news diet of Australians for some years, and still provokes strong reactions in many today. It was a story with powerful ingredients: the disappearance in the night of a helpless baby, into a remote desert landscape of ancient mythological significance; a contest for credibility between a defiant accused mother and a little understood native species of wild dog; forensic experts evoking horrific images of the baby’s last moments, using only her bloodied clothing but without her body; a co-accused husband and wife who were active members of a minority religious group that was noticeably different to mainstream Australian church denominations; and so on. The paintings discussed here explore the story’s many ongoing resonances and re-engage their viewers with it in new and positive ways. The thesis comprises 36 works, most <b>of</b> <b>which</b> are <b>acrylic</b> on board or canvas. It includes ten portraits of the predominant personalities in the case, a number of pseudo-portraits (i. e. several reworked media-derived pictures of Lindy Chamberlain and four depictions of the ‘Dingo Spirit’), and approximately fifteen other related paintings. This documentation explores what influenced these works, including: the facts of the decade-long story; the implications of these facts; the artistic considerations involved, both technical and aesthetic; and some of the artworks, artistic traditions and critical theories about art that influenced the works’ design and execution or might subsequently shed light on their interpretation – especially the portraiture traditions of Europe and Australia, from the Renaissance to today. This paper also provides: background material for each painting, a brief workby- work analysis of them, and a short history of their creation and exhibition. The significance of this body of work is that it contributes to both the Chamberlain story itself and {{to the development of the}} role that art and artists play in Australian cultural life. In particular, it demonstrates a compelling social role for portraiture in Australia today. By depicting as a series the major characters and several key moments of an important historical episode, insights can be communicated, responses evoked, and positive social discourse furthered. The project and its accompanying paper should be understood to insist that no single theory about art or our relationship with it can really render an artistic practice invalid. Rather, critical ideas from both past and present can and should be drawn upon simultaneously to assist in making meaning. This is consistent with the observation that artists and viewers alike appreciate artistic expression on many levels at once...|$|R

This study is a descriptive analytic study performed to 5 acrylic artificial teeth posterior brands commonly used by dentists and technicians. From each brand, 3 sample teeth were taken. The acrylic artificial teeth were prepared into a rectangular shape and were attached between acrylic prothesis base simulation and jigs. The sample was given tensile load using a Universal Testing Machine. The amount of force that causes the teeth to be fractured was recorded and the bond strength was calculated. The results of the study show that the average value for the five acrylic artificial teeth for the five brands were as followed: Brand A, 125. 993 kgF/cm 2; B, 188. 457 kgF/cm 2; C, 175. 880 kgF/cm 2; D, 153. 373 kgF/cm 2; E, 82. 839 kgF/cm 2.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages #-#) My {{intention of}} this show is to illustrate the physical and optical tension between the actual object and the implied surface of these reliefs. Although the images deal with biomorphic shapes, they have no direct link with nature. They are, however, meant to resemble a semaphore apparatus, each signaling whimsical, enigmatic messages. An antithesis is created by employing loosely applied color over highly formal curvilinear three dimension forms. This opposition is emphasized by the totally mechanical {{way in which the}} structures are fabricated. (All of the figures where prepaired and painted using the same process. The raw metal was precoated with a clear lacquer to build a surface to <b>which</b> <b>acrylic</b> paint would adhere with permanence.

I believe this seemingly dissonant synthesis ereates a viseral ruckus that works to control the balance between an overly austere content, or to the other extreme, an excess amount of decoration. It has been stated, "Content justifies art's existence, style (mode) defines it, therefore content merely fills the void. Style gives content the capacity to absorb us, to move us, it is style that makes us care.
