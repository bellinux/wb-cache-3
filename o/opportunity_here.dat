For Gómez, he would defend his title if he won the race and the Brownlee {{brothers}} finished outside of the top three. Since 2009 when this format was adopted Alistair had won 50% of the races and had never lost a Grand Final. However, Alexander Bryukhankov was not discounted and needed a big upset to win a place on the podium.

2500|$|Two of the {{directors}} of the Hagerstown Bank, Colonel William Fitzhugh and Major Charles Carroll were, like Rochester, wealthy landowners interested in acquiring land in the new [...] "frontier" [...] of the U.S. [...] In 1800, Fitzhugh and Carroll convinced Rochester to travel with them on a prospecting visit to the frontier lands of New York State, and specifically to the lands along the upper portion of the Genesee River. [...] Fitzhugh and Carroll acquired land along the river on their trip, but Rochester, sensing the opportunity to develop a town, chose a [...] tract along Canaseragea Creek near the hamlet of Dansville. [...] Upon a return trip to the area, they travelled farther up the river to a small abandoned tract of land near the river's Upper Falls.

2500|$|A {{planning}} commission {{meeting was}} held on May 3 to decide if they would approve skyscrapers that break the height limit. Executive director of the commissioners, Barbara J.

[...] She cited that the project would create 12,000 jobs and US$15 million in tax revenue. Opponent Lee Copeland, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Fine Arts, said the height limit was [...] "a kind of Philadelphia golden rule {{which is part of}} the spirit and tradition of our past." [...] The meeting ended with the commission deciding to prevent buildings taller than City Hall while it studies the issue for one year. In May, the Philadelphia City Council announced its support for the project because of the jobs it would create. On June 13, Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode came out in favor of the project. He proposed the creation of a special ordinance that would allow buildings taller than City Hall between 16th and 20th Streets and the north side of Chestnut Street and the south side of John F. Kennedy Boulevard. Upset at the mayor's support for the project, Edmund Bacon resigned from a commission about Philadelphia's future. Bacon called the complex [...] "a total disaster," [...] adding that, [...] "It absolutely decimates the scale of Center City, and once it's been done, there's no stopping it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of discussions at the Peace Conference, {{a small group of}} British and American diplomats and {{scholars}} met on May 30, 1919 at the Hotel Majestic in Paris and decided to create an Anglo-American organization called [...] "The Institute of International Affairs", which would have offices in London and New York. Due to the isolationist views prevalent in American society at the time, the scholars had difficulty gaining traction with their plan, and turned their focus instead to a set of discreet meetings that had been taking place since June 1918 in New York City, under the name Council on Foreign Relations. The meetings were headed by the corporate lawyer Elihu Root, who had served as Secretary of State under President Theodore Roosevelt, and attended by 108 “high-ranking officers of banking, manufacturing, trading and finance companies, together with many lawyers.” The members were proponents of Wilson's internationalism, but were particularly concerned about [...] "the effect that the war and the treaty of peace might have on postwar business." [...] The scholars from the inquiry saw an <b>opportunity</b> <b>here</b> to create an organization that brought diplomats, high-level government officials and academics together with lawyers, bankers, and industrialists to engineer government policy. On July 29, 1921 they filed a certification of incorporation, officially forming the Council on Foreign Relations. In 1922 Edwin F. Gay, former dean of the Harvard Business School and director of the Shipping Board during the war, spearheaded the Council's efforts to begin publication of a magazine that would be the [...] "authoritative" [...] source on foreign policy. He gathered $125,000 from the wealthy members on the council, and via sending letters soliciting funds to [...] "the thousand richest Americans". Using these funds, the first issue of Foreign Affairs was published in September 1922, and within a few years had a gained a reputation as the [...] "most authoritative American review dealing with international relations".|$|E
