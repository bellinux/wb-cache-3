30|$|Wood is {{composed}} of porous wood cells such as the tracheids, fibers, and ray cells and thereby {{can be regarded as}} a dielectric mixture with the pores elongated in the L and R directions and aligned orderly in wood substance composed of cellulose of oriented molecule, hemicellulose, lignin, and bound water. The first question about this model is which of the two factors, the alignment of the pores and the dielectric anisotropy of wood substance, causes the dielectric anisotropy of wood [17 – 20, 23, 25, 29]. Norimoto and Yamada [23] concluded that the dielectric anisotropy of <b>oven-dried</b> <b>wood</b> is caused by both of them in the low frequency range and only by the pore alignment in the high frequency range. According to their conclusion, it is expected that the dielectric anisotropy of <b>oven-dried</b> <b>wood</b> at a frequency of 100  GHz is caused only by the pore alignment and that wood substance is a dielectric isotropic material.

Thermal softening of wet (= water-saturated) wood occurs at much lower temperature than that of completely (anhydrous) dried wood [6, 7].

The temperature increase on the transverse, radial and tangential surfaces of small wood specimens during adsorption was measured by thermal imaging. The experiments were conducted in a purpose-built humidity chamber facilitating the accurate control of the internal relative humidity (RH). It was found that the temperature rise on initially <b>oven-dry</b> <b>wood</b> surfaces exposed to a RH of 95 % was anisotropic, with a maximum temperature increase of around 4 °C occurring on the transverse surface and around 1 °C on both the radial and tangential surfaces. Additionally, it was observed that the technique reported can be used to accurately measure the temperature change arising from sorption, thus providing reliable information about the behaviour of wood.

40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of carbon (C) content in live wood {{is essential for}} quantifying tropical forest C stocks, yet generic assumptions (such as biomass consisting of 50 % carbon on a weight/weight basis) remain widely used despite being supported by little chemical analysis. Empirical data from stem cores of 59 Panamanian rainforest tree species demonstrate that wood C content is highly variable among co-occurring species, with an average (47. 4 ± 2. 51 % S. D.) significantly lower than widely assumed values. Prior published values have neglected to account for volatile C content of tropical woods. By comparing freeze- and <b>oven-dried</b> <b>wood</b> samples, we show that volatile C is non-negligible, and excluding the volatile fraction underestimates wood C content by 2. 48 ± 1. 28 % (S.

Wood C content varied substantially among species (from 41. 9 – 51. 6 %), but was neither strongly phylogenetically conserved, nor correlated to ecological (i. e. wood density, maximum tree height) or demographic traits (i. e. relative growth rate, mortality rate). Overall, assuming generic C fractions in tropical wood overestimates forest C stocks by ∼ 3. 3 – 5. 3 %, a non-trivial margin of error leading to overestimates of 4. 1 – 6. 8 Mg C ha− 1 in a 50 -ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama.

The volume of each voxel was 0.98  ×  0.98  mm through the cross-section and 5  mm in the grain direction. Thirty scans at 5  mm intervals were performed, covering half of the sample length and producing a total of 2160 scan images before and after impregnation. Scanning on the other half was not performed, but the other half was assumed to have the same distribution of density values.
