5|$|Although {{the writing}} of unit names is language-specific, {{the writing of}} unit symbols and the values of {{quantities}} is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them. The guideline produced by the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> (NIST) clarifies language-specific areas in respect of American English that were left open by the SI Brochure, but is otherwise identical to the SI Brochure.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> (NIST) {{investigated}} the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7WTC. The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how {{fire protection systems}} might be improved in future construction. The investigation into the collapse of 1WTC and 2WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7WTC was completed in August 2008.|$|E
5|$|A pair of {{experimental}} atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> {{has set a}} record for stability. NIST physicists reported in the August 22, 2013 issue of Science Express that the ytterbium clocks' ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion (1 followed by 18 zeros), roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks. The clocks would be accurate within a second for a period comparable {{to the age of}} the universe.|$|E
5|$|Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th {{floors of the}} North Tower, lost 658 employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer. Marsh Inc., located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt {{decided that}} the letter {{required}} action, and authorized {{the creation of the}} Advisory Committee on Uranium. The committee was chaired by Lyman James Briggs, the Director of the Bureau of Standards (currently the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology),</b> with Adamson and Hoover as its other members. It convened {{for the first time on}} October 21. The meeting was also attended by Fred L. Mohler from the Bureau of Standards, Richard B. Roberts of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Szilárd, Teller and Wigner. Adamson was skeptical about the prospect of building an atomic bomb, but was willing to authorize $6,000 ($100,000 in current USD) for the purchase of uranium and graphite for Szilárd and Fermi's experiment.|$|E
5|$|Technetium-99 decays {{almost entirely}} by beta decay, {{emitting}} beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> (NIST) standard beta emitter, and is used for equipment calibration. Technetium-99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries.|$|E
5|$|The CGPM {{publishes a}} {{brochure}} which defines and presents SI. Its official version is in French, {{in line with}} the Metre Convention. It leaves some scope for local interpretation, particularly regarding names and terms in different languages, so for example the United States' National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> (NIST) has produced a version of the CGPM document (NIST SP 330) which clarifies local interpretation for English-language publications that use American English and another document (NIST SP 811) that gives general guidance for the use of SI in the United States and conversion factors between SI and customary units.|$|E

Those announcements were, in fact, performed by Fred Covington (b. 1928, d. 1993).|$|R
50|$|NSA {{promoted}} {{the inclusion of}} a random number generator called Dual EC DRBG in the U.S. National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology's</b> 2007 guidelines.

5|$|The International System of Units {{standardized}} its unit of time, the second, on {{the properties}} of cesium in 1967. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. The cesium atomic clock, maintained by the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology,</b> is accurate to 30billionths of a second per year. Atomic clocks have employed other elements, such as hydrogen and rubidium vapor, offering greater stability—in the case of hydrogen clocks—and smaller size, lower power consumption, and thus lower cost (in the case of rubidium clocks).|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of gallium, at 302.9146K (29.7646°C, 85.5763°F), is just above room temperature, and is {{approximately}} {{the same as the}} average summer daytime temperatures in Earth's mid-latitudes. This melting point (mp) is one of the formal temperature reference points in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) established by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The triple point of gallium, 302.9166K (29.7666°C, 85.5799°F), is used by the US National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> (NIST) in preference to the melting point.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-range}} {{committee was}} made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies. The six computer manufacturers were Burroughs Corporation, IBM, Minneapolis-Honeywell (Honeywell Labs), RCA, Sperry Rand, and Sylvania Electric Products. The three government agencies were the US Air Force, the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin, and the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology).</b> The committee was chaired by Joseph Wegstein of the US National Bureau of Standards. Work began by investigating data description, statements, existing applications and user experiences.|$|E

5|$|On 10 February 1964, the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology)</b> {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it was to use SI except where this would have an obvious detrimental effect. In 1968 Congress authorised the U.S. Metric Study, the emphasis of which {{was to examine the}} feasibility of adopting SI. The first volume was delivered in 1970. The study recommended that the United States adopt the International System of units, and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for the increased use of the metric measurement system in the United States. Metrication was voluntary and to be coordinated by the United States Metric Board (USMB).|$|E
