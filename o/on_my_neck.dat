500|$|During a 1994 interview, a visibly {{intoxicated}} Frusciante {{noted that}} he wrote the album {{in order to create}} [...] "interesting music", which he felt no longer existed. He felt contemporary artists were not writing material he deemed worth listening to and the mainstream population were settling for mediocrity. Drugs were another significant topic Frusciante based Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt on. According to Frusciante, he [...] "was stoned for every single note [...] played on the album." [...] He increased his drug use to cope with worsening depression that was caused by leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and his subsequent isolation. Several songs on the album deal with his dislike for the Chili Peppers' success, such as the album's eleventh track, [...] "Blood <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Neck</b> From Success".|$|E
500|$|The Diane Martel-directed {{music video}} for [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] premiered on March 22, 2009. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, it was {{reported}} that Collins could no longer play drums, due to a recent operation to repair dislocated vertebrae in his neck. However, a statement from Collins on the Genesis band website said, [...] "There isn't any drama regarding my 'disability' and playing drums. Somehow, during the last Genesis tour, I dislocated some vertebrae in my upper neck and that affected my hands. After a successful operation <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> my hands still can't function normally. Maybe in a year or so it will change, but for now it is impossible for me to play drums or piano. I am not in any 'distressed' state, stuff happens in life." ...|$|E

Sometimes they put one <b>on</b> <b>my</b> thumb and another <b>on</b> <b>my</b> tongue, <b>neck</b> or ear. It {{had a hand}} crank to make it go. They had two kinds of machines, one with a crank and one with buttons."" ...|$|R

Don't hold <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> so tight--this here paint hoss ain't any too shore-footed, {{let me tell}} ye. He's liable to dump us both off if we don't watch out." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sometime in the 230s, Lü Yi, the {{supervisor}} of the audit bureau, falsely accused Diao Jia (刁嘉), the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Wuhan, Hubei), of defaming the imperial court. Sun Quan was so furious {{when he heard about}} it that he had Diao Jia arrested and imprisoned. During the interrogation, when Diao Jia's colleagues were asked whether they heard him defame the imperial court, they all said they did, because they feared retaliation from Lü Yi if they said no. Shi Yi, however, insisted that he did not hear Diao Jia say anything defamatory. As the investigation dragged on for days, the tone of the imperial edicts issued by Sun Quan on this issue became increasingly harsh and stern, to the point where Shi Yi's colleagues feared for his life. Shi Yi remained unfazed and told Sun Quan, [...] "The sword's blade is now <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> Why would I dare to conceal the truth, seek my own death, and end up becoming a disloyal ghost? I only hope that everyone will see the truth." [...] When he was questioned, he answered truthfully and gave consistent responses. Sun Quan eventually believed Shi Yi and spared Diao Jia. The Eastern Jin dynasty historian Xu Zhong (徐眾) praised Shi Yi for maintaining his integrity, standing by his moral principles, and showing moral courage in such a life-threatening situation.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{stood in}} the road, <b>my</b> hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> horse's <b>neck,</b> and with <b>my</b> dim [...] eyes sought to trace the {{outlines}} of the holy places which I had [...] long before fixed in my mind, but the fast-flowing tears forbade my [...] succeeding.

6000|$|I obeyed, and bending {{so close}} that I felt her warm breath <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> she whispered: [...] "Are the people in Cuzco like me? Would they {{understand}} me--the things you cannot understand? Do you know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{can send}} twenty hunters with me,” Subienkow went on. “You see, I must get the berries and the roots {{with which to}} make the {{medicine}}. Then, when you have brought the two sleds and loaded on them the fish and the beaver skins and the rifle, {{and when you have}} told off the six hunters who will go with me—then, when all is ready, I will rub the medicine <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> so, and lay my neck there on that log. Then can your strongest hunter take the axe and strike three times <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> You yourself can strike the three times.” ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{succession}} of injuries dogged him in 2006 and 2007 though and {{he announced his}} retirement from speedway in October 2007. He said: [...] "I'm at a stage now where I can't take another hit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head or <b>neck.</b> If I didn’t have kids and my wife I might consider carrying on, but you can’t just live for yourself." [...] However, after holding talks with his doctor and family, Norris came out of retirement and once again rode for the Eastbourne Eagles during the 2009 season, assisted in the pits by Dean Barker.|$|R

6000|$|I was roused from my amazement, {{and concern}} for her--I am sure, for her--by her falling <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> for a moment, and crying that she only grieved for me. In another moment she {{suppressed}} this emotion; and said with an aspect more triumphant than dejected: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rise early, and be by {{me all the}} day. There will be {{much work}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hands, and I shall be hurt between <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> and <b>my</b> shoulder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lazzaro!" [...] It was {{the cry of}} a {{breaking}} heart. Her arms went round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and in a passion of grief her kisses burned <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lips.|$|R

60|$|He {{swung the}} rope's end over his head, {{and brought it}} down with all force. I sprang aside, and {{received}} the blow squarely <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. Had I not done so the rope would have cut <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> deeply.|$|R
