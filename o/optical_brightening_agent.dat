Bymeasuring these changes under specific experimental conditions, any non-random directional coincidence of the absorption a d emission transition moments a sociated with the dye molecules can be evaluated and the spatial array of the dyes estimated. From such measurements, the binding of the <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agent</b> FBA 1, a triazinylaminostilbene compound, tosepiolite has been studied. A fluorophore is an active fluorescent group which absorbs linearly polarized light of a suitable wavelength.

Light of a longer wavelength is emitted polarized parallel to an emission transition moment (e-) which may not be coincident with d. The fluorescent beam is thus generally depolarized even when the fluorophore has been held stationary during the fluorescence interaction. The depolarization can be characterized by the measurement of four polarized components of fluorescence, Ff; where F = V or H for vertically and horizontally polarized incident light, respectively, and f = v or h for the similar polarization states of the emitted beam (Parker, 1968) ...|$|E

In an effort to develop better fabrics for sun protective clothing, scientists have completed many studies investigating various factors influencing ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission through fabrics.

40|$|The paper {{industry}} is constantly {{looking for new}} ideas for improving paper products while competition and raw material prices are increasing. Many paper products are pigment coated. Coating layer is {{the top layer of}} paper, thus by modifying coating pigment also the paper itself can be altered and value added to the final product. In this thesis, synthesis of new plastic and hybrid pigments and their performance in paper and paperboard coating is reported. Two types of plastic pigments were studied: core-shell latexes and solid beads of maleimide copolymers. Core-shell latexes with partially crosslinked hydrophilic polymer core of poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid) and a hard hydrophobic polystyrene shell were prepared to improve the optical properties of coated paper. In addition, the effect of different crosslinkers was analyzed and the best overall performance was achieved by the use of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). Furthermore, the possibility to modify core-shell latex was investigated by introducing a new polymerizable <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agent,</b> 1 -[(4 -vinylphenoxy) methyl]- 4 -(2 -henylethylenyl) benzene which gave promising results. The prepared core-shell latex pigments performed smoothly also in pilot coating and printing trials. The results demonstrated that by optimizing polymer composition, the optical and surface properties of coated paper can be significantly enhanced. The optimal reaction conditions were established for thermal imidization of poly(styrene-co-maleimide) (SMI) and poly(octadecene-co-maleimide) (OMI) from respective maleic anhydride copolymer precursors and ammonia in a solvent free process. The obtained aqueous dispersions of nanoparticle copolymers exhibited glass transition temperatures (Tg) between 140 - 170 ºC and particle sizes from 50 - 230 nm. Furthermore, the maleimide copolymers were evaluated in paperboard coating as additional pigments. The maleimide copolymer nanoparticles were partly imbedded into the porous coating structure and therefore the full potential of optical property enhancement for paperboard was not achieved by this method. The possibility to modify maleimide copolymers was also studied. Modifications were carried out via N-substitution by replacing part of the ammonia in the imidization reaction with amines, such as triacetonediamine (TAD), aspartic acid (ASP) and fluorinated amines (2, 2, 2 - trifluoroethylamine, TFEA and 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4 -heptafluorobuthylamine, HFBA). The obtained functional nanoparticles varied in size between 50 - 217 nm and their Tg from 150 - 180 ºC. During the coating process the produced plastic pigments exhibited good runnability. No significant improvements were achieved in light stability with TAD modified copolymers whereas nanoparticles modified with aspartic acid and those containing fluorinated groups showed the desired changes in surface properties of the coated paperboard. Finally, reports on preliminary studies with organic-inorganic hybrids are presented. The hybrids prepared by an in situ polymerization reaction consisted of 30 wt% poly(styrene- co-maleimide) (SMI) and high levels of 70 wt% inorganic components of kaolin and/or alumina trihydrate. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images and characterization by Fourier Transform Infrared Spcetroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) revealed that the hybrids had conventional composite structure and inorganic components were covered with precipitated SMI nanoparticles attached to the surface via hydrogen bonding. In paper coating, the hybrids had a beneficial effect on increasing gloss levels...|$|E

Coumarin belongs to a class of flavonoids and a type of benzo- 2 -pyrone, which is a plant secondary metabolite isolated from natural plants and some microorganisms.

Coumarin acts as a safeguard against viral, bacterial, and fungal attacks, wounds, and stress by a process called phytoalexins [3, 4]. The potential biological applications of coumarin were reported as platelet aggregation inhibition, antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant [7, 8]. Coumarin and its derivatives are widely used in synthetic, pharmaceutical, and agrochemicals industries and also used as <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agents,</b> insecticidal, additive in perfumes, and cosmetics [5, 6]. Coumarine serves as an intermediate in the synthesis of several organic reactions, i.e., furocoumarins, chromenes, coumarones, and 2 -acylresorcinols [9].

Then, phthalimide groups were linked to the resulting copolymers by the ring-opening reaction of the anhydride groups with sodium phthalimide salt. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) showed that the incorporation of phthalimide groups as side chains decreased the free volume of the polymers, and therefore, the rigidity and the glass transition temperature (Tg) are increased.|$|R

Color discrepancy as a result of OBAs is analyzed between D 50 and Illuminant A light sources, which are common to pressroom viewing conditions and customer environments. For toner-based digital printing, greater difference in color occurs between light sources when there is a lower percent coverage of ink on the paper.

However, print buyers are increasingly specifying brighter papers, which contain <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> (OBAs). One potential concern facing adopters of soft proofing systems is that they fail to consider the influence of OBA when rendering color images. Proofing systems are largely based on existing published specifications and their ICC profiles.

This research project investigated the use of the substrate-corrected colorimetric aims (SCCA) as the source ICC profile to improve proofing color accuracy. By conducting psychometric experiments and analyzing with Chi-Square statistic, the research concludes that (a) OBA causes the mismatch between the default soft proof and the OBA-loaded print; (b) source ICC profiles, built from both a fully characterized dataset and an SCCA solution, can improve color match between the soft proof and the OBA-loaded print; and (c) color match between the soft proof and the print is image-dependent...|$|R

Paperboards were coated with various coating colours, and subsequently lab printed in offset technique. The effect of artificial ageing on surface properties as well as on image optical and colour stability was monitored. The changes observed in surface characteristics such as smoothness, roughness, air permeability, absorptivity before and after the accelerated ageing process revealed a strong influence of coating components (pigments, binders) and surface treatment type. Increase in roughness, alteration of board absorption behaviour and change in optical and colour parameters - decrease in brightness, increase in yellowness, colour shift with samples containing higher amount of <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> - were the most pronounced results. Measured differences in printing colour (dE) and optical density values indicated that colour stability of offset image approached the limit values, which are set for an image of still acceptable quality.

Simply, the evolution cannot be stopped! Three different ink jet printers and inks were investigated in this work: the Epson Stylus ® Pro 5000, using a dye based ink set, the Epson Stylus ® Pro 5500, employing Archival ink technology, and the Epson Stylus ® Photo 2200, with 7 -color UltraChrome ™ inks. A number of different commercial and experimental substrates were sampled. Printability tests were carried out to test and evaluate ink/printer/substrate interac-tions. Particle size analyses of the three ink types were investigated. Color gamuts and ICC profiles for each of the different printer/ink/substrate sets were compared. In addition, the accuracy of each printer’s color profile was investigated.

40|$|The {{role of a}} color-managed inkjet {{proof is}} to predict and {{simulate}} the visual appearance of printed color. The proof-to-print visual match works well under different viewing conditions when the input ICC profile and the output ICC profile, built from characterization datasets, do not contain <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> (OBA). OBAs influence printed color when measured for characterization and viewed. These <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> absorb UV wavelengths in the illuminant and fluoresce in the blue wavelengths. As more and more OBAs are used in printing paper production, the role of color proofing becomes more difficult. The difference {{in the amount of}} the UV component of the measuring and viewing light sources cause a problem where the OBA effect, as measured, may not be the same amount of OBA effect that should be proofed under the viewing illuminant. There are two objectives in this research project. The first objective is to show how printed colors, under identical printing conditions on OBA and non-OBA substrates, look different than when they are proofed using current characterization for proofing practices. Both M 0 (UV-included) and M 2 (UV-cut) measurement data are collected from color patches with selected tonal values and input ICC profiles created from this data are used to proof the brightened reference print. The results show that the UV-cut characterization treatment produces a very poor proof to the reference, while the UV-included proof was ranked as a fairly high match. A third commercially available software designed to improve upon the UV-included treatment, the X-Rite <b>Optical</b> <b>Brightened</b> Compensation module, was also tested and found to be a good match to the reference as well. The second objective is to propose different ways the characterization data can be adjusted for the OBAs in a reference print on brightened paper, by accounting for the influence of UV in the measurement illuminant, and the influence of UV in the viewing illuminant. By means of psychometric analyses, the results show that (1) the proof-to- print match is the worst when OBA in print and UV in the measurement illuminant are not addressed (UV-cut characterization data from M 2); (2) although not conclusive, the proof-to-print match improves when OBA in print, UV in the measurement illuminant (characterization data from M 0), and UV in the viewing illuminant are addressed...|$|R

In an effort to better address measurement of OBAs, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has published ISO 13566 : 2009, where the illuminations utilized in spectrophotometric instrumentation is more clearly defined than in previous standards. It is recognized that moving ahead the illuminant utilized in spectrophotometers {{should be able to}} better correlate to standardized viewing conditions, including the amount of ultra-violet (UV) present in the illuminant, as the effect of the OBAs is dependent on the amount of UV. Of particular note, ISO 13655 : 2009 recognizes measurement condition M 0 as a 2 ̆ 7 legacy 2 ̆ 7 condition, representative of the wide range of spectrophotometers utilized in the field. Condition M 0 instruments illuminants correspond to illuminant 2 ̆ 2 A, 2 ̆ 2 while measurement condition 2 ̆ 2 M 12 ̆ 2 specifies that that the instrument illumination corresponds to D 50, which is better correlated to standardized viewing conditions and has a more clearly defined UV component.

However, in today 2 ̆ 7 s market, more and more paper is manufactured with OBAs. This could be problematic for commercial printers as OBAs influence not only paper conformity, but also the accuracy printed colors. This can lead to color mismatch between proofs and the final prints. Recognizing this condition, the objectives of this research were two-fold: first, to verify the perceived color difference between prints due {{to the presence of}} OBAs, and second, to study the perceptibility of color differences caused by OBAs in paper substrates, combined with quantitative measurement assessment. In order to satisfy these objectives, the following research questions were investigated: Does CIEDE 2000 (∆E 00) correlate better with visual scaling or ranking for color differences of printed color pairs than CIELABDE (∆E*ab) ? Do different illuminant intensity levels (ISO 3664 P 1 : 2000 lx and P 2 : 500 lx) affect human perceptibility of color differences for color pairs with dark shades? A psychophysical experiment was carried out for evaluating color differences using printed color patches. In total, 27 pairs of printed color patches derived from the IT 8. 7 / 4 Target (1, 617 color patches) were prepared using the same colorants printed on paper with and without OBA. Each pair was assessed at two levels of illumination by a panel of thirty-four observers. The visual results were used to investigate the relationship between color difference metrics and visual scaling (ranking) of color differences induced by OBAs, as well as the relationship between illumination intensity level and visual scaling of color samples with high-density. The results indicated that: (a) There is better correlation between ∆E 00 and the visual scaling of OBA-induced color differences than ∆E*ab; and (b) there is no association between different illumination intensities (i. e., ISO: 3664 P 1, P 2) and visual scaling of color differences in high-density areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} ufthe {{optical character}} reading (OCR) machine for high-speed code marking and sortation of letter mail {{has led to}} the need for a high-speed method of printing the phosphorescent code marks used by the mechanised letter sorting machines. This paper looks at the requirements,for the printing system, the method adopted and the results achieved. 1 HISTORY Early {{in the development of the}} automatic letter sorting system the British Post Ofice (BPO) adopted a system of code marking letter mail with phosphorescent machine readable codes. Phosphorescent encoding was chosen in preference to fluorescent, magnetic, or passive optical encoding because envelopes have no natural phosphorescence thus simplifying the detection of the coded information. Fluorescent and magnetic encoding systems are more likely to suffer from background inter-ference; background fluorescence occurs from <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> (OBAs) added to the paper in manu-facture and background magnetism from enclosures within envelopes. A passive optical system, black and white bars, places a constraint on the customer to leave a set area of the envelope blank and is unacceptable. The method of coding currently in use on coding desks is hot melt transfer which, although highly effec-tive on all envelope materials at coding desk rates, is an inherently slow process having a maximum throughput speed of two items per second. Optical character reading (OCR) machines are cost effective only at high throughput rates, of the order of ten items per second, and so a new method of printing was required to match the increased speed. Enclosures within envelopes can be irregular in shape, raising some parts of the envelope surface and leaving cavities elsewhere, thus the envelope can be ren-dered vulnerable to damage by high pressures from an impact type of printer. An ink jet printer imposes almost zero impact pressure on the printed item and also has the capability of high printing speed; it thus became the first choice solution to the printing problem even though no suitable phosphorescent ink was avail-able at the time.

Fischer and Knoevenagel in the nineteenth century studied the reaction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones with phenyl hydrazine in acetic acid by refluxing, which {{became one of the most}} popular methods for the preparation of 2 -pyrazolines [8]. In 1998, Powers et al. [9] have reported the reaction of chalcones with phenyl hydrazine hydrochloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide and absolute ethanol at 70 °C, where the longer reaction time is the disadvantage of the reaction. K 2 CO 3 -mediated microwave irradiation has been shown to be an efficient method for the synthesis of pyrazolines [10]. The regioselective formation of pyrazolines has been synthesized by the reaction of substituted hydrazine with α,β-unsaturated ketones [11, 12]. Recently, many organic reactions in aqueous media have been described in the literature [13]. In 2007, Li et al. [14] have synthesized 1, 3, 5 -triaryl- 2 -pyrazoline with chalcones and phenyl hydrazine hydrochloride in sodium acetate-acetic acid aqueous solution under ultrasound irradiation. Pyrazolines have been exhibiting various pharmacological activities, such as analgesic [15], anti-inflammatory [16, 17], antimicrobial [18, 19], anti-amoebic [20, 21], antitubercular [22, 23], hypoglycemic [24], anticoagulant [25], antidepressant [26 – 28], pesticide [29], fungicide [30], antibacterial [31], and anticonvulsant activities [32]. Recent report shows some new pyrazoline-substituted thiazolone-based compounds that exhibit anticancer activity [33]. Apart from biological activities, pyrazolines are also extensively used as synthons in organic synthesis [34 – 36], as <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> for textiles, paper, and fabrics, and as a hole-conveying medium in photoconductive materials [37 – 41]. In this present study, the authors have taken efforts to synthesize a series of 1 -phenyl- 3 (5 -bromothiophen- 2 -yl)- 5 -(substituted phenyl)- 2 -pyrazolines from 5 -bromo- 2 -thienyl chalcones and phenyl hydrazine hydrate in presence of fly ash:H 2 SO 4. These pyrazolines were characterized by their physical constants and spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of all synthesized pyrazolines have been studied.|$|R
40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>Brightening</b> <b>Agents</b> (OBAs) are {{chemicals}} {{added to}} paper pulp whose {{purpose is to}} brighten the white point of the paper. Adding OBAs results in a brighter white, increased tonal range, and more chromatic colors. However, adding OBAs can also create problems in visual print-to-proof match where proofing substrates do not contain OBAs. Visual print-to-proof match is the final judge of conformance in a print business. When printing and proofing in conformance to standards and specifications on non-OBA papers, there is visual match between the print and the proof. Printing on OBA loaded papers causes two main problems: (1) difficulty in achieving conformance to printing standards and (2) visual print-to-proof mismatch. To solve the above problems, this research begins by adopting the new 2 ̆ 2 M 12 ̆ 2 measurement condition and the revised ISO 3664 : 2009 viewing conditions. It then assumes that the print on OBA loaded paper is the anchor and the proof must be color managed to match the print using these new measurement and viewing conditions. In order to test the proposed solution, the researcher prepared a series of prints and proofs that (1) reproduced the proof-to-print match traditionally achieved on non-OBA loaded printing papers (the anchor pair), (2) reproduced the proof-to-print mismatch on OBA loaded printing papers (the problem pair), ix and (3) tested the color managed approach to solving the problem described above (the solution pair). Finally, these pairs were evaluated {{by a panel of}} observers in a paired comparison experiment under the revised ISO 3664 : 2009 viewing conditions. The results of the paired comparison experiment first demonstrated that the researcher could reproduced both a proof-to-print match on non-OBA loaded papers and a proof-to-print mismatch on OBA loaded papers. In addition, the solution pair was demonstrated to be preferred to all other pairs at the. 05 level of significance. Finally CIELAB plots of the problem pair and the solution pair under M 1 conditions supported the results of the pair comparison experiment. Under M 1 conditions the proof-to-print mismatch (difference in CIELAB values) for the problem pair was shown to be approximately twice as large as the proof-to-print mismatch for the solution pair. Based on the results of this research, the proposed solution was shown to be a promising approach for solving the industry wide problem of print-to-proof mismatch when printers print on OBA loaded papers...|$|R

Optical photometry obtained April 20 - 24, 1996 shows a steady brightening of the source in B, V, R, and I beginning about six days {{before the start of}} the X-ray outburst. The onset of the <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> was earliest in I and latest in B. However, the rate of the <b>optical</b> <b>brightening</b> was fastest in B and slowest in I. The order of the increases in the different optical filters suggests that the event was an "outside-in" disturbance of the accretion disk. The substantial delay between the optical rise and the rise of the X-rays may provide indirect support for the advection-dominated accretion flow model of the inner regions of the accretion disk.

50|$|The {{intensity}} of fluorescent paints can decline quite rapidly, {{making it difficult}} for conservators to care for. This is because the <b>brightening</b> <b>agent</b> that is mixed into the paint is not stable. Some fluorescent paintings can only be displayed in the dark with UV-lights. These requirements can make choosing appropriate lighting and exhibition and storage space for preventative conservation challenging. For fluorescent paintings that are displayed in dark rooms with UV lights, it is recommended to have an automatic lighting system.|$|R

Both of these features make illegal notes easier to detect and more difficult to successfully counterfeit. The same security features can be applied to identification cards.|$|R
