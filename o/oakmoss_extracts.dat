40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review is presented on extracts of a lichen, oakmoss (Evernia prunastri), {{that are used}} in the fragrance industry. Analytical aspects are discussed in detail, from both qualitative and quantitative standpoints, mainly in relation to the industrial processing of the lichen. It is shown that more than 170 constituents have been identified so far in <b>oakmoss</b> <b>extracts,</b> including 47 depsides or depside-derived compounds and 25 triterpenes or steroids. A survey of industrially relevant synthetic products with an oakmoss odour is included. Toxicology issues related to the use of <b>oakmoss</b> <b>extracts</b> in cosmetics and fragrance formulations are critically reviewed...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} review of extracts from the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea (treemoss) that are used in the fragrance industry. Qualitative and quantitative analytical aspects are critically reviewed and the results are compared to those of the related <b>oakmoss</b> <b>extracts.</b> It is shown that more than 90 constituents have been identified so far in treemoss extracts, including 42 depsides, depsidones or depside-derived compounds, and 42 triterpenes or steroids. Constituents of certain host trees, mainly Pinus species, generate specific analytical and toxicological issues which need to be considered in addition to those related to the known degradation products of lichen compounds. A new classification of lichen extracts used as raw materials in fragrance compounding is proposed...|$|E
30|$|Annex III of the Cosmetic Regulation {{contains}} the ‘List of substances which cosmetic products must not contain except {{subject to the}} restrictions laid down’. <b>Oakmoss</b> <b>extract</b> (Evernia prunastri extract) as a strong contact allergen {{is part of this}} list and must be named in the list of ingredients referred to in Art. 19 (1)(g) when its concentration exceeds 0.001 % in leave-on products and 0.01 % in rinse-off products. Despite this restriction, there were 747 notifiers for <b>oakmoss</b> <b>extract</b> in the C&L inventory. According to the INCI list, <b>oakmoss</b> <b>extract</b> is used with the function of skin conditioning. Oakmoss is also listed in the INCI list part II (perfume and aromatic raw materials), together with treemoss extract (Evernia furfuracea lichen extract).|$|R
25|$|The perfume {{industry}} in the US is not directly regulated by the FDA, instead the FDA controls the safety of perfumes through their ingredients and requires that they be tested {{to the extent that}} they are Generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health. In Europe, as from 11 March 2005, the mandatory listing of a set of 26 recognized fragrance allergens was enforced. The requirement to list these materials is dependent on the intended use of the final product. The limits above which the allegens are required to be declared are 0.001% for products intended to remain on the skin, and 0.01% for those intended to be rinsed off. This has resulted in many old perfumes like chypres and fougère classes, which require the use of <b>oakmoss</b> <b>extract,</b> being reformulated.|$|R
50|$|Oakmoss is commercially {{harvested}} in countries of South-Central Europe and usually exported to the Grasse region of France where its fragrant compounds are <b>extracted</b> as <b>oakmoss</b> absolutes and <b>extracts.</b> These raw materials {{are often used}} as perfume fixatives and form the base notes of many fragrances. They are also key components of Fougère and Chypre class perfumes. The lichen has a distinct and complex odor and {{can be described as}} woody, sharp and slightly sweet. Oakmoss growing on pines have a pronounced turpentine odor that is valued in certain perfume compositions.|$|R
