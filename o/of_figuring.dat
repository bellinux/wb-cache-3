[...] He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that [...] "Lipkin and his colleagues are now capable <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> out how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months.

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles {{considered}} the album [...] "an unexpected magnum opus", and while Pareles felt that [...] "the rock CD overpowers the acoustic one", he considered that [...] "among the quieter songs, {{there are enough}} supple melodies and hypnotic guitar patterns to suggest fine prospects for a follow-through album".

AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered that the record [...] "showcases a reinvigorated band that is eager to stretch out and experiment", with the rock record having a [...] "fluid musicality and a [...] sense of drama that gives it a nearly cinematic sense of scope", and the acoustic album being [...] "quieter, {{but it also has}} a similar flow and easy grace that makes it a fitting complement to the harder first record." [...] Reviewer Joe Gross of Spin described the hard rock disc as [...] "the most consistent rockers of Grohl's career" [...] and considered that the album as a whole [...] "chronicle the physical and mental graffiti <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> out how to emerge from some very large shadows, including his own, with nerve and power" [...] While Mike Schiller of PopMatters considered that [...] "In Your Honor has some great tunes, but {{it is by no means}} perfect", he praised the rock songs for [...] "indications of just how loud this band can get", and regarding the acoustic tracks, wrote that [...] "despite the down-tempo feel, the songs are infectious".|$|E

The writer wants {{to find out the}} kind <b>of</b> Leopold?s <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech in his utterances and also to analyze the function <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech itself. The writer uses Perrine?s theory to analyzing types <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech and Searle?s theory to analyzing the function <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech. The writer describes this research design, in this case, the approach of the study and how she collects and analyzes the data. She uses qualitative approach as the method of the study. The analysis itself consists of choosing the type <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech, deciding the function <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech and mapping both of them into a table. From the findings, the writer may infer several points. From the findings, {{it can be seen that}} the most dominated <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech that Leopold used are simile and hyperbole. Moreover, the highest number <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech that can be seen in this study is hyperbole; it can be meant that the movie writer likes to express his message with exaggerated words. From the language function, the writer found that in this study the most dominated language function is expressive types.

As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar.

2500|$|In his 1958 article Tobin {{also led}} the way in showing how to deal with utility {{maximization}} under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains [...] "One {{way to get out of}} the mess <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer’s choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person’s investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin’s assumptions we can reformulate the person’s decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead of worrying about the investor’s optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market." ...|$|E

It {{is a lot to}} have [...] "resting on her shoulders - she knows that somebody's life is in her hands. Lynsey tries to stand up to Silas, but he outwits her at every turn". At her [...] "lowest ebb", Lynsey confides in Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) whose girlfriend, Jenny (Daisy Turner), was killed by Silas. Hassan {{explained that}} Lynsey takes a big risk in confiding in Doug but Lynsey trusts him to keep it a secret. Lynsey feels like she should not be bringing Doug in to the dangerous situation but she realises that she needs someone to help her. Her portrayer went on to add that Doug believes Lynsey and shows her a lot of kindness and friendship. Lynsey is given clues by Silas to help her identify his next victim, although they leave Lynsey feeling like she has no way <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> the potential victim's identity out as the clues seem to fit everyone. Hassan said that by the time Halloween arrives Lynsey feels [...] "totally tired and exhausted". Silas reveals that Lynsey is the woman he intended to kill but she escapes. Silas kills a woman dressed as Catwoman, initially believing it to be Lynsey until he realises it is his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). Lynsey soon after exposes Silas who is arrested. Hassan said that she had enjoyed seeing Lynsey show gumption during the storyline and hoped to see more of this side of her character. Reflecting on the storyline, Hassan said the storyline was amazing and added that she was enthusiastic to play the storyline. She said that previous to the storyline she had known she could show a feistier side and more depth to Lynsey which she was always aware existed.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} {{monument}} {{race of the}} season, Milan–San Remo, the team came in thinking they had two options for the victory – 2009 winner Cavendish, and the 2011 season's most prolific winner to date Goss. Sporting director Valerio Piva stated that if the race came down to a large field sprint, as it often does, the team's focus would be Cavendish. For {{the second year in}} a row, Cavendish had had a slow start to his season, but stated that he felt he was on good form heading into Milan–San Remo. The race turned out to be atypical of how Milan–San Remo usually plays out. A crash occurred [...] from the finish of the [...] day on Le Manie, one of several small climbs in the profile. This allowed some 45 riders who had been ahead of world champion Thor Hushovd, the man who crashed, to speed clear of the rest of the main field. They quickly took a two-minute advantage and, working cohesively, never gave it up. Goss was the only HTC-Highroad rider to make the split, but his teammates, including Cavendish, who had been caught behind obligingly did nothing to help pull the second group up to the first. Goss effectively stayed in the slipstream of riders like Vincenzo Nibali and Philippe Gilbert, and stayed with the first group on the road over the Poggio where other sprinters like Tom Boonen, Alessandro Petacchi, and Heinrich Haussler were unable, despite having made the 45-rider selection earlier in the day. In the finale, eight riders representing eight different teams approached the finish line together. Since no one had a teammate to perform a proper leadout, the final meters were somewhat strange, as the eight riders continually looked around to see who would open up the sprint. Finally, Nibali, Gilbert, and Yoann Offredo did so, but they effectively performed a leadout for Goss, who came around them at the very end of the race for the victory. Goss was the first Australian rider ever to win the race. Afterward, Cavendish stated that he had been feeling ill on the day the race was run, and that even if he had not been caught behind the crash on Le Manie, he would not have had the form to put in a successful sprint. He said he was happy for his teammate's winning effort. The team had hoped to ride for Cavendish at Gent–Wevelgem in March, but repeated mechanical trouble and also a crash left him well short <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> into the finale. Former Gent–Wevelgem winner Eisel was able to salvage the team's fortunes somewhat by finishing seventh on the day. In April, as the spring season was reaching its height, Cavendish took his third career win at the Scheldeprijs. The Manxman avoided a crash on the final finishing straight, one that doomed the chances for his chief rival Tyler Farrar, and was easily the best sprinter of the 31 riders who finished together at the head of the race.|$|E
