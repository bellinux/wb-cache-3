But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie.

5|$|Michael's domain in Epirus {{became a}} refuge and centre of {{resistance}} of the Greeks against the Latin Crusaders. At about the same time, according to some modern scholars, he may have led the abortive Greek resistance to the Crusaders in the Peloponnese, which was crushed at the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olive</b> Grove of Kountouras; according to other views, he may have led a campaign there between 1207 and 1209. In order to avoid invasion and buy time to consolidate his position in Epirus, Michael soon entered into negotiations with Pope Innocent III, and concluded treaties with the Latin Empire and the Republic of Venice. In the meantime, his rule received a boost in legitimacy when he ransomed the deposed Alexios III from captivity. According to later chroniclers, Alexios III conferred the hereditary rule of Epirus to Michael and his descendants.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} Michael's {{establishment}} in Epirus is obscure. The hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, {{written in the}} late 13th century, maintains that Alexios III had appointed Michael as governor in the Peloponnese and a certain Senachereim, who was Michael's relative by marriage (they both had married first cousins from the Melissenos family), as governor of the Theme of Nicopolis in Epirus. When the local inhabitants rose in revolt against him, Senachereim called upon Michael for aid. Michael rushed to Nicopolis, but not before the locals had killed Senachereim. After that, Michael, himself widowed, took Senachereim's widow as his wife and succeeded him as governor. Although generally regarded as inaccurate due to the many errors it contains, {{this part of the}} hagiography is at least partially corroborated by Villehardouin's account that he married the daughter of a local magnate. It is certain that Michael was never appointed governor of the Peloponnese, but the hagiography's reference to the peninsula has led to suggestions by modern scholars that he is to be identified with the Michael who led the Peloponnesian Greeks in the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olive</b> Grove of Kountouras against the Crusaders, in the summer of 1205. This commonly held identification has been questioned by more recent research by the historian Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, who suggests that Michael leaving Epirus, which still was not securely under his control, to go on campaign in the Peloponnese would have been extremely unlikely as it would leave Epirus open to attack by Boniface. Loenertz does however consider that Michael may indeed have led another expedition into the Peloponnese a few years later, in 1207–09 (see below).|$|E

40|$|AbstractAll-trans {{retinoic acid}} (atRA) is an {{endogenous}} morphogen that regulates gene transcription. Maternal exposure to atRA results in severe developmental abnormalities by disrupting normal patterns of atRA distribution. Previously, {{we have shown}} that the pontine nucleus, which originates from the rhombic lip, is severely atrophied in the mouse on exposure to atRA at gestational days 9 and 10. In this study, we show that this same period of atRA exposure has the contrary effect on <b>the</b> inferior <b>olive</b> and this rhombic lip derivative is expanded in volume and probably contains an increased number <b>of</b> cells. <b>The</b> posterior region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior <b>olive</b> maintains a relatively normal shape but is significantly expanded in size. In contrast, <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior inferior <b>olive</b> is severely disrupted. Because endogenous atRA levels are known to be higher in <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior inferior <b>olive</b> at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> birth of inferior olivary neurons, these results suggest that endogenous atRA may promote the generation, or select <b>the</b> fate, <b>of</b> posterior neurons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior <b>olive.</b> In support of this concept, a reduction in atRA resulting from vitamin A deficiency results in loss <b>of</b> cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior inferior <b>olive...</b>|$|R

Fruit was also boiled down into thick, sweet syrup, referred to in the Bible as dvash (honey). Grapes, figs, dates and apricots were also dried and preserved individually or put on a string or pressed into cakes.

First in Italian, then in both Greek and Italian, finally from 1850 in Greek and English; and it continued for the entire duration of the English Protectorate until 1864.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{competitiveness}} on the global market <b>the</b> major objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world <b>olive</b> growing industry seems to be <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production costs and <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> trees per hectare. The production cost analysis indicates that harvesting is of utmost importance. As a result {{it is important to}} mechanize and innovate the harvesting process. Using olive harvesting mechanization systems it is necessary both to reduce the production costs and to improve <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>olives</b> and subsequently <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil. In <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> increasing importance and cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine, <b>the</b> following <b>olive</b> harvesting mechanization systems are used in high density orchards: hand held shaker or trunk shaker with different interceptor systems. Various tests have been done on the different harvesting systems to compare the fruit removal efficiency and work productivity. Our results have demonstrated that the work productivity increases when the harvesting mechanization systems are used and that productivity increases proportionally to <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanization systems. When the hand held shaker is used the work productivity is doubled, compared with harvesting by hand. However, {{it is important to note}} that the hand held shaker is only suitable for sloping or terracing ground and small family run farms. Other tests were carried out in high density orchard (200 - 300 trees/hectare) using the trunk shaker system. Our test results have demonstrated that if the trunk shaker machine is used the work productivity increases and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> improvement depends on the different interceptor systems ranging from the nets to the reverse umbrella. The conclusion drawn from the tests results is that all the harvesting mechanization systems reduce <b>the</b> production costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>olives</b> and increase <b>the</b> work productivity, improving the competitiveness on the global market...|$|R
