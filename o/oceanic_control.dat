40|$|The {{degree to}} which Southern Hemisphere climatic changes during {{the end of the}} last glacial period and early Holocene (30 - 8 ka) were {{influenced}} or initiated by events occurring in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere is a complex issue. There is conflicting evidence for the degree of hemispheric ‘teleconnection’ and an unresolved debate as to the principle forcing mechanism(s). The available hypotheses are difficult to test robustly, however, because the few detailed palaeoclimatic records in the Southern Hemisphere are widely dispersed and lack duplication. Here we present climatic and environmental reconstructions from across Australia, a key region of the Southern Hemisphere because of the range of environments it covers and the potentially important role regional atmospheric and <b>oceanic</b> <b>controls</b> play in global climate change. Weidentify a general scheme of events for {{the end of the last}} glacial period and early Holocene but a detailed reconstruction proved problematic.

40|$|The {{semi-arid}} US Intermountain West {{is characterized}} by complex hydroclimatic variability, influenced both by topography and by atmosphere and ocean processes operating over a large range {{of time and space}} scales. Understanding climate–hydrology interactions has become increasingly important as demands on water resources grow from both within and beyond the region, particularly in light of pro-jected climate changes. This paper reviews key atmospheric and <b>oceanic</b> <b>controls</b> that impact the Inter-mountain West’s water supply, how those controls vary over multiple timescales, the tree-ring record of hydroclimatic variability in the region, projected climate change impacts, and research needs for the future. Water availability in the Intermountain West is largely influenced by interrelated atmospheric fea-tures that include the strength and position of the Pacific subtropical high, the intensity and geographic location of the Aleutian low, the latitude of the westerly storm track, and teleconnections such as the Pacific North American pattern and the El NiñoSouthern Oscillation system. The tree-ring record of pre-instrumental conditions in the Intermountain West indicates that there have been droughts in the past that were more severe than those experienced in the historical record. Climate model projections of future moisture-related changes, including decreased snowpack and changing seasonality of precipita-tion, may exacerbate strain on the region’s water supply. Advances in climate modeling and in our under-standing of climate variability over multiple time and space scales would improve capacity for water resource management in the Intermountain West...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{dramatic}} {{climate change}} in the Arctic is most manifested by the reduction of multiyear sea ice pack. It has been commonly associated with anomalies of surface air temperature and atmospheric circulation, which in turn {{have been linked to}} the Arctic Oscillation (AO). A typical assessment of such hypotheses is the assumption of the dominant role of external atmospheric forcing and the neglect of effects of processes internal to the Arctic Ocean. Especially the <b>oceanic</b> thermodynamic <b>control</b> of sea ice through the under-ice ablation and lateral melt along marginal ice zones tends to be overlooked. However, those ice-ocean interactions may act to de-correlate AO forcing, which helps to explain some of the timing issues between AO/atmospheric forcing and recent sea ice variability...|$|R
40|$|At DSDP Sites 534 (Central Atlantic) and 535 and 540 (Gulf of Mexico), {{and in the}} Vocontian Basin (France), Lower Cretaceous {{deposits}} show a very pronounced alternation {{of limestone}} and marl. This rhythm characterizes the pelagic background sedimentation and is independent of detritic intercalations related to contour and turbidity currents. Bed-scale cycles, estimated to be 6000 - 26, 000 yr. long, comprise major and minor units. Their biological and mineralogic components, burrowing, heavy isotopes C and O, and some geochemical indicators, vary in close correlation with CaCO 3 content. Vertical changes of frequency and asymmetry of the cycles are connected with fluctuations of the sedimentation rate. Plots of cycle thickness ("cyclograms") permit detailed correlations of the three areas and improve the stratigraphic subdivision of Neocomian deposits at the DSDP sites. Small-scale alternations, only observed in DSDP cores, comprise centimetric to millimetric banding and millimetric to micrometric lamination, here interpreted as varvelike alternations between laminae that are rich in calcareous plankton and others rich in clay. The laminations are estimated to correspond to cycles approximately 1, 3, and 13 yr. in duration. The cyclic patterns appear to be governed by an interplay of continental and <b>oceanic</b> processes. <b>Oceanic</b> <b>controls</b> express themselves in variations of the biogenic carbonate flux, which depends on variations of such elements as temperature, oxygenation, salinity, and nutrient content. Continental controls modulate the influxes of terrigenous material, organic matter, and nutrients derived from cyclic erosion on land. Among the possible causes of cyclic sedimentation, episodic carbonate dissolution has been ruled {{out in favor of}} climatic fluctuations with a large range of periods. Such fluctuations are consistent with the great geographic extension shown by alternation controls and with the continuous spectrum of scales that characterizes limestone-marl cycles. The climatic variations induced by the Earth's orbital parameters (Milankovitch cycles) could be connected to bed-interbed alternations...|$|R

These systems allow controllers to manage significantly more aircraft than traditional systems because the machine is responsible for detecting any potential future conflicts so the controller can then decide on an action that maintains a safe separation between aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Communication, navigation, surveillance, and {{decision}} support capabilities in <b>Oceanic</b> air traffic <b>control</b> are evolving significantly. It {{is important to}} consider the effect of the changes on the controller’s task. In this paper the results from multi-disciplinary studies performed at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and the University of Iceland are presented. At MIT, a human-centered systems analysis was used to identify key human factors issues for the future <b>Oceanic</b> air traffic <b>control</b> environment to be experimentally investigated. At the University of Iceland, a prototype for a future air traffic control display was designed and evaluated. Both studies identified three key human factors issues that require consideration. The first is a mismatch between time and space separation restrictions imposed and information support provided, requiring the controller to cognitively resolve temporal/spatial mismatches to meet restrictions. The second issue is the effects of mixed communication and surveillance equipage, which complicates the control task and requires the controller to cognitively integrate asynchronous information. The final is the importance of cultivating controller trust and understanding issues of complacency and automation disuse when implementing highly automated conflict probes that are being considered in the future Oceanic environments...|$|R

50|$|Since {{there is}} little radar {{coverage}} {{in the middle of}} the Atlantic, aircraft must report in as they cross various waypoints along each track, their anticipated crossing time of the next waypoint, and the waypoint after that. These reports enable the Oceanic Controllers to maintain separation between aircraft. These reports can be made to dispatchers via a satellite communications link (CPDLC) or via high frequency (HF) radios. In the case of HF reports, each aircraft operates using SELCAL (selective calling). The use of SELCAL allows an aircraft crew to be notified of incoming communications even when the aircraft's radio has been muted. Thus, crew members need not devote their attention to continuous radio listening. If the aircraft is equipped with automatic dependent surveillance, (ADS-C & ADS-B), voice position reports on HF are no longer necessary, as automatic reports are downlinked to the <b>Oceanic</b> <b>Control</b> Centre. In this case, a SELCAL check only has to be performed when entering the oceanic area and with any change in radio frequency to ensure a working backup system for the event of a datalink failure.|$|E

A subglacial meltwater stream at the tidewater terminus of McBride Glacier, Glacier Bay, southeast Alaska, discharges large volumes of sediment {{to the base of the}} fjord water column. During four consecutive meltwater seasons (1984 - 1987), water samples, CTD profiles, sediment traps and echosound profiles were collected within 2 -km-long McBride Inlet to quantify ice-proximal suspended sediment transport, deposition and <b>oceanic</b> <b>controls</b> on fjord circulation. Less dense, sediment-laden water rises buoyantly from the submarine efflux to produce an upwelling near the glacier with surface sediment concentrations up to 1. 4 g L- 1. Mixing within the plume increases salinity up to 12 and produces widely dispersed, homogeneous sediment concentrations and flocculated particles. A thick, brackish surface layer is advected downfjord as hypopycnal flow, with highest suspended sediment concentrations (approximately 800 mg L- 1) transported 4 to 6 m beneath the surface. The highest vertical suspended sediment flux is initiated at slack low tide because of tidal control on current velocity of the surface layer. Sand and coarse silt settle as single grains; finer particles settle more slowly as high concentration, turbid layers. Turbid layers are observed to settle at an average rate of 5 m h- 1 in transmissivity and water sample profiles. Cyclically interlaminated sand or silt with mud is deposited on the fjord floor by this process. These deposits are termed cyclopsams (sandy, thinly bedded to thickly laminated) and cyclopels (muddy, thinly laminated). Sediment traps confirm that these couplets are deposited at a rate of two or three per day and are controlled by tidal and discharge dynamics. Sediment accumulation rates are as high as 20 m a- 1 at the terminus. Sedimentation rates decrease exponentially from the terminus: from 24 g cm- 2 day- 1 to less than 1 g cm- 2 day- 1 over a horizontal transport distance of 1. 2 km. Major lithofacies from these meltwater discharges are cyclopsams and cyclopels, bergstone mud (marine outwash and ice-rafted sediment), and homogeneous mud in this temperate, ice-proximal glacimarine setting...|$|R
