Recently, strong interest has emerged in Join-the-Idle-Queue (JIQ) algorithms, which rely on tokens issued by idle servers in dispatching tasks and outperform power-of-$d$ policies. Specifically, JIQ strategies involve minimal information exchange, and yet achieve zero blocking and wait in the many-server limit. The latter property prevails in a multiple-dispatcher scenario when the loads are strictly equal among dispatchers. For various reasons it is not uncommon however for skewed <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> to occur. We leverage product-form representations and fluid limits to establish that the blocking and wait then no longer vanish, even for arbitrarily low <b>overall</b> <b>load.</b> Remarkably, it is the least-loaded dispatcher that throttles tokens and leaves idle servers stranded, thus acting as bottleneck. Motivated by the above issues, we introduce two enhancements of the ordinary JIQ scheme where tokens are either distributed non-uniformly or occasionally exchanged among the various dispatchers. We prove that these extensions can achieve zero blocking and wait in the many-server limit, for any subcritical <b>overall</b> <b>load</b> and arbitrarily skewed load profiles. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the asymptotic results are highly accurate, even for moderately sized systems...|$|R

Nonlinear Static Pushover Analysis is one {{of several}} methods for seismic {{performance}} evaluation of structures. It can evaluate the strength of the structure until its performance level. It can also provide reasonable estimates of the location of the plastic hinge of the members. The performance point of structure in Nonlinear Static Pushover Analysis depends on the lateral <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> applied on the structure. In this study, a 6 story regular building is subjected to two lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> recommended by FEMA 273.

The result of the analysis shows that both applied lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> give the performance of building located between IO-LS level.

For both lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns,</b> the plastic hinge limited to D-E level. In general, the two lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> give the close result.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{attention}} has been paid to the performance-based seismic design that requires designing the building for several expected performance levels. This is achievable through a design procedure based on the inelastic responses. In order to estimate the inelastic seismic responses of a building, the pushover analysis is used, for its simplicity compared with the nonlinear time-history analysis. In pushover analysis, however, the first step is to select a particular lateral <b>load</b> <b>pattern,</b> which affects the resulting capacity curve that may over- or under-estimate building seismic capacity. Therefore, the selection of a reasonable lateral <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> is particularly important in pushover analysis. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> on the seismic performance of low-to-mid-rise Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame buildings. The RC frame buildings, which consist of 6, 9, and 12 stories, are designed according to Egyptian codes ECP- 201 and ECP- 203.

The proposed lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> are based on inelastic behavior and are a fundamental component of a proposed seismic design methodology to limit the extent of structural damage in the system and distribute this damage uniformly along the height. These <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> are expected to provide a uniform distribution of story ductility ratios when compared to the distributions obtained with moment-resisting frames designed based on the code-compliant design lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns.</b> The implementation of the aforementioned methodology would not only distribute damage along the height of the frame, but also help avoid undesirable dynamic responses that occur once structural damage is concentrated in one or in a few stories, e. g., story drift amplifications caused by P-delta effects. The family of structural models used in this study is composed of six to eighteen-story moment resisting frame structures with fundamental periods of vibration that vary from 0. 6 s. to 3. 0 s. On the input side, two basic types of ground motions are used: far-field and near-field ground motions.

The results show that the different lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> influence the lateral capacity of the bridge especially when the rotational mass moment of inertia was considered. The different lateral capacities lead to different incremental dynamic analysis curves (IDA curves) and lead to differences in seismic performance.

30|$|This study {{indicates}} that for structures responding primarily in the first mode, pushover methods may be a reliable choice to estimate inelastic demands. However, the validity depends {{on the level of}} expected inelastic behavior and the number of stories. On the other hand, the results show that in low-rise structures, all <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> provide fairly accurate estimation of the global and inter-story demands. By increasing the number of stories the MMC appears to be promising in terms of better estimating peak values of critical inelastic response quantities such as inter-story drifts. It is shown that considering sufficient number of modes, inter-story drifts estimated by MMC is generally similar to trends resulted from NTHA. Moreover, studying all results shows that due to the pulse like near-fault ground shakings, the MMC method could be used as an appropriate <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> in calculating distributed inelastic demands of structure over the height. However, the accuracy of this <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> is dependent on the inter-story ductility level. Finally, this paper indicates that special care should be taken when using pushover procedures since the lateral <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> used to estimate demand could have a significant influence on the computed demands (each <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> has an inherent capability to estimate specific response). The comparison of the NTHA and NSPs results reveals that the pushover methods tend to underestimate demands at the upper levels, signifying the relevance of higher mode effects in mid to high-rise structures except the result of MMC. Moreover, each <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> has a different result of capacity curve with different elastic and inelastic stiffness. Therefore, using the MMC cannot guaranty the unique ultimate capacity curve of the structure and this is the main disadvantage of this method.|$|R
