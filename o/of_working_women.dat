This research thereby contributes to the research on employment and the family responsibilities <b>of</b> Thai <b>working</b> <b>women.</b> Thus, the study is not only an examination of gender issues in relation to employment and family responsibilities, but the data collected also enables the generation of interesting new hypotheses derived from the narratives provided by women concerning the impact of these dual spheres.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a close {{examination}} of some of Arthur Munby’s personal sketches and photographs <b>of</b> <b>working</b> class <b>women</b> at Wigan coal mine, and of street performers in Victorian England. 　In these sketches and photographs, working-class pit women are seen, with special exaggeration in their manliness in their limbs, deformed facial parts and the blackness of their skin. 　In the case of street-performers, they disguised themselves as black musical performers, who actually existed in the Victorian period, by blackening their faces and hands. The relationship between this kind <b>of</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>working</b> class <b>women</b> with black slaves and the historical background of these two groups is also discussed. The exaggeration of manliness and blackness <b>of</b> these <b>working</b> class <b>women</b> and street performers led to the hybridity in their outlook {{in terms of their}} gender, class and race, which Arthur Munby highly appreciated and to which he had strong fetishistic feelings. Taking into consideration various other commentators’opinions, this paper discusses Munby’s complex feelings about the masculinity and femininity of working-class women in their outward appearance and inner selves...|$|R
