25|$|James Buchanan, Jr. (April 23, 1791 – June 1, 1868) was the 15th President of the United States, serving from 1857 until 1861.

25|$|Python's {{property}} descriptors are similar, {{but come}} with a tradeoff in the development process. If one begins in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable, and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class {{may need to be}} adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby’s design forces all instance variables to be private, but also provides a simple way to declare set and get methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, <b>one</b> <b>never</b> directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside the class; rather, one passes a message to the class and receives a response.|$|E

500|$|Robin Maconie finds that, [...] "Compared to {{the work}} of his contemporaries, Stockhausen's music has a depth and {{rational}} integrity that is quite outstanding... His researches, initially guided by Meyer-Eppler, have a coherence unlike any other composer then or since" [...] Maconie also compares Stockhausen to Beethoven: [...] "If a genius is someone whose ideas survive all attempts at explanation, then by that definition Stockhausen is the nearest thing to Beethoven this century has produced. Reason? His music lasts" [...] , and [...] "As Stravinsky said, <b>one</b> <b>never</b> thinks of Beethoven as a superb orchestrator because the quality of invention transcends mere craftsmanship. It is the same with Stockhausen: the intensity of imagination gives rise to musical impressions of an elemental and seemingly unfathomable beauty, arising from necessity rather than conscious design" [...]|$|E

Kenneth Silber from Space.com criticized the lack of emotion in the episode, writing, [...] "'First Person Shooter' achieves considerable mayhem but remarkably little drama.

500|$|Following her well-received {{performance}} in What Maisie Knew, Moore began 2013 with {{a supporting role}} in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's comedy Don Jon, playing an older woman who helps the title character to appreciate his relationships. Reviews for the film were favorable, and Mary Pols of Time magazine wrote that Moore was {{a key factor in}} its success. Her next appearance was a starring role in the comedy The English Teacher (2013), but this outing was poorly received and earned little at the box office. In October 2013, she played the demented mother Margaret White in Carrie, an adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel. Coming 37 years after Brian De Palma's well-known take on the book, Moore stated that she wanted to make the role her own. By drawing on King's writing rather than the 1976 film, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that she managed to [...] " [...] a history– <b>one</b> <b>never</b> told, just hinted at– of serious damage in [...] past." [...] The film was a box office success, but was generally considered an unsuccessful and unnecessary adaptation.|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} {{identities of}} the Pankhurst children began to emerge {{around the time of}} their father's death. Before long they were all involved in the struggle for women's suffrage. Christabel enjoyed a privileged status among the daughters, as Sylvia noted in 1931: [...] "She was our mother's favourite; we all knew it, and I, for <b>one,</b> <b>never</b> resented the fact." [...] Christabel did not share her mother's fervour for political work, however, until she befriended the suffrage activists Esther Roper and Eva Gore-Booth. She soon became involved with the suffrage movement and joined her mother at speaking events. Sylvia took lessons from a respected local artist, and soon received a scholarship to the Manchester School of Art. She went on to study art in Florence and Venice. The younger children, Adela and Harry, had difficulty finding a path for their studies. Adela was sent to a local boarding school, where she was cut off from her friends and contracted head lice. Harry also had difficulty at school; he suffered from measles and vision problems.|$|E
500|$|Palm wine (called bunuk or bounouk in the Jola language) is an {{alcoholic}} drink {{derived from the}} natural fermentation of palm sap, so is not strictly a wine, which is produced by the fermentation of grapes. The recent partial Islamization of the region has not challenged its consumption. Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men. Supported by a strap, the harvester climbs the tree, cuts the bud, and holds out a funnel which allows the resulting fluid to flow drip by drip into an elongated calabash or, more recently, a bottle. The alcohol content of palm wine develops throughout the day. The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis, and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to fetishes. Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city. Many Jola proverbs attest {{the popularity of the}} drink, such as Bunuk abajut birto, which means [...] "With palm wine, <b>one</b> <b>never</b> stands up," [...] or Ulako, kumusaet jígabulaju, which means [...] "Sit down, don't spill the palm wine." ...|$|E
