500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times {{criticized the}} episode in his review, writing, [...] "It's just {{not all that}} satisfying. After endless weeks of stick-beating and the events <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> it all seemed a little too tidy," [...] and {{additionally}} called Arya's story [...] "anticlimactic." [...] However, Egner also praised the episode's continuation with the King's Landing story, {{as well as the}} follow up with Sandor Clegane and the Brotherhood Without Banners. TV Guides Damian Holbrook criticized as implausible the fact that Arya, after being stabbed multiple times in the previous episode by the Waif, was able to outrun and kill her faster, stronger nemesis in this episode. Hanh Nguyen of Indiewire also felt the Riverrun sequence ended in an anticlimactic fashion as well.|$|E

500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall {{agreed with}} Murray's Lost comparison, writing that {{the ending of}} the episode was [...] "right out of the Lost playbook, a little too on the nose for my liking." [...] Stegall did however call it a [...] "good bridge episode, taking us from the setup <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> to the denouement next week, when it all comes together." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler was more positive about the final sequence, explaining that the [...] "last five minutes of this story changed everything, and made me excited about the series again." [...] While praising the special effects, he also noted his displeasure that Sam Weiss [...] "ends up not being as mystical or magical as previous stories hinted". Isler wished Corrigan had more screen time in the episode, calling it [...] "under-utilization of a great character the writers {{have spent a lot of}} time building up." [...] He rated it 7.5/10, an indication of a [...] "good" [...] episode, but criticized its [...] "slow" [...] pacing.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode [...] "The stories in the North and Meereen stayed a bit quiet as all their action got taken care <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> leaving Cersei's big plot to destroy the Sept and {{everyone}} in it as this finale's big suspenseful and explosive set piece. Elsewhere, there were big reveals and revenge kills that helped everything {{add up to a}} very surprising and satisfying season finale." [...] He continued by praising how the trial sequence played out on screen, writing [...] "The actual staging and pacing of the trial and violent reckoning was really cool, with everyone getting dressed and little puzzle pieces falling into place, little birds leading men to their deaths, and Ramin Djawadi's excellent score." [...] He gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10. Michael Calia of The Wall Street Journal similarly gave praise to the episode, writing [...] "It's a good thing... that the season finale was full of massive developments, tying up several plot threads while leaving some others dangling in the most tantalizing way. This was the most complete episode of Game of Thrones yet, and possibly the best." [...] He also wrote, [...] "Dany and her fleet are finally sailing to Westeros, her great dragons casting shadows over the waves. It's on." ...|$|E

Now they'll say there's no scientific evidence, there's no studies or anything that proves that yet. But turn that around. There are no studies that disprove it either."
