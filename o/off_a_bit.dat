Over each of the next two seasons, they matched that 111 record, added two more SEC titles and finished inside the top-five in the polls. In 1976, which would be Mitchell's last with the team, they fell <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> with a 93 record, but they still remained in the top-fifteen nationwide. Mitchell helped develop Leroy Cook who was a two-time All-America selection drafted in the 10th round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys and selected as one of two defensive ends on the All-time Alabama team named by Sports Illustrated in 2006.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} aspect of Todd's appearance for St. John was his character's hair. His preference was that Todd's hair was a little shorter; he told Soap Opera Weekly (SOW) that he thought that Todd's hair was too [...] "shaggy", which was not his personal style, and that he hoped the writers and producers would let him trim <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> When he first got the role, St. John's hair resembled Howarth's shorter chin-length haircut, which was initially worn from 2000 to 2003, and St. John was told by the writers and producers not to change his hair until further notice. St. John [...] "made the creative choice [...] go because [...] not really right in the old noggin, and gained weight for the role.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as I had {{hoped it would}} be. I mean, {{if you were going}} to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, it would have been nice to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> forced." ...|$|E
500|$|What You Were Hoping For? {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 90, based on six reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman called it [...] "a rare lean, focused album where the in-the-red moments {{are just as}} effective as the twilight ballads", while Jason Heller of The A.V. Club said the record was [...] "twice as raw and thrice as hungry as anything the neo-soul mastermind has previously released ... a full-throated, full-throttle challenge". Writing for WBEZ, Jim DeRogatis called it [...] "as joyful, free-ranging, and wildly inventive a psychedelic-soul classic as any you can name", writing that Hunt's compositions make [...] "even the wildest, most genre-defying flights of fancy ... instantly accessible and equally stimulating to brain and booty." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot dubbed it Hunt's [...] "most adventurous album yet" [...] because he [...] "stretches the parameters of R with a refreshing lack of self-consciousness ... His craftsmanship never devolves into shtick." [...] Kot later named it the fourth-best album of 2011 and wrote that although it is musically varied, [...] "the glue is Hunt's acuity as a songwriter; he knows how to drop hooks and turn a smart phrase, and this album brims with surprises." [...] Michael Tedder from Paste was slightly more critical, feeling that Hunt [...] "sometimes comes <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like he's exploring the idea of a genre more than actually writing a song". He cited drummer Ruth Price as the record's [...] "the secret weapon". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it [...] "a messy album, sometimes thrillingly so, a mélange of psychedelic rock, punk energy and R desperation".|$|E
500|$|Following the song's {{release on}} January 23, 1985, {{as the second}} single from Like a Virgin, [...] "Material Girl" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Author Rikky Rooksby, in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, compared the song with those of Cyndi Lauper because of Madonna's shrill voice in the song. He added that the song was a [...] "pungent satire on the Reagan/Thatcher young-guns-go-for-it era. Which {{just goes to show}} that pop music and irony don't mix." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said that [...] "Material Girl" [...] was one of the songs that made Madonna an icon, the other being [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] from the same album, both remaining as a definitive statement. He added that both tunes overshadow the rest of the record, [...] "because they are a perfect match of theme and sound." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone, felt that the song portrayed Madonna as a more practical girl than previous female singers. Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly, while reviewing the album in 1995, felt that the song came <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> repetitious and immature when compared to the present context. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly felt that the song provided then critics a way to criticize Madonna's work. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Madonna had [...] "defined a generation with hits like 'Material Girl'." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine compared the song with [...] "Everything She Wants" [...] by Wham!. Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the song sustained a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum." [...] Nancy Erlick from Billboard said that [...] "singer and team conquer once more with their irresistible assembly of new and used pop hooks." [...] In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all time for a special issue of Q magazine dedicated to Madonna. [...] "Material Girl" [...] was allocated the 15th spot on the list.|$|E

2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Catherine George {{explained that}} Mason was initially {{inspired by a}} Smithsonian photograph that production designer Ondrej Nekvasil had found of an older lady amongst {{a room full of}} dead birds at the Museum of Natural History, who was a real person from Swinton's childhood. In designing Mason's costume, George found images of women from their late 60s and early 70s, adding that, [...] " [...] a certain type that I remembered growing up who would wear their fur to go into town and scoff at people who were less better <b>off,</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a Margaret Thatcher type, really." [...] George also designed Mason's suit to look [...] "a typical conservative politician shape and style" [...] with the purple adding a royal quality to the attire. She had [...] "collected pictures of dictators wearing elaborate uniforms and crazy hand-made medals" [...] to experiment with the designs of such a character. George later admitted to the similarities to Ayn Rand, although not intentional. George and Bong travelled to Swinton's home in Scotland with [...] "a couple of suitcases of clothes, wigs, glasses and teeth" [...] to play around with ideas.|$|E

[...] While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that [...] "Dev's beats come <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more mellow and her songs {{a little bit more}} electro than pop." [...] In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, [...] "I just feel that I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm {{going to be able to}} give you a little bit more than what you've heard on those records.
