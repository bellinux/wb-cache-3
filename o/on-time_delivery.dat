40|$|Title: Control {{over and}} {{inspections}} {{of the incoming}} flow of deliveries Background: Staples experiences difficulties to get their incoming flow of deliveries to deliver on time. This is because Staples has a poor control of its suppliers in the current situation. Another problem that Staples experience is that their inspection of the incoming flow is taking too long time. These problems can lead to unnecessary tied up capital, backlogs and rest orders. Staples would like to explore the possibility of improving the control and inspection of the incoming flow. Purpose: To identify the amount of late and early incoming flow of deliveries and describe how Staples could control {{them in order to}} receive more <b>on-time</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Moreover to describe how Staples could improve the inspection process {{in order to make the}} incoming flow of deliveries flow faster into storage. Methodology: The study is a case study in Staples central warehouse in Växjö, Sweden. Results: Suggestion has been made for how Staples could improve the control over the incoming flow of deliveries, and the inspections of the incoming flow of deliveries. The suggestions made are based on how Staples could control deliveries in advance in order to receive more <b>on-time</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Moreover specific requirements could be made towards the suppliers to improve the inspections in order to reduce the flow time into storage...|$|R

40|$|<b>On-time</b> {{shipment}} <b>delivery</b> {{is critical}} for just-in-time production and quick response logistics. Due to uncertainties in travel and service times, on-time arrival probability of vehicles at customer locations can not be ensured. Therefore, <b>on-time</b> shipment <b>delivery</b> is a challenging job for carriers in congested road networks. In this paper, such <b>on-time</b> shipment <b>delivery</b> problems are formulated as a stochastic vehicle routing problem with soft time windows under travel and service time uncertainties. A new stochastic programming model is proposed to minimize carrier's total cost, while guaranteeing a minimum on-time arrival probability at each customer location. The aim of this model {{is to find a}} good trade-off between carrier's total cost and customer service level. To solve the proposed model, an iterated tabu search heuristic algorithm was developed, incorporating a route reduction mechanism. A discrete approximation method is proposed for generating arrival time distributions of vehicles in the presence of time windows. Several numerical examples were conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and solution algorithm. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Overhaul {{and repair}} {{services}} are important {{segments of the}} remanufacturing industry, and are characterized by complicated disassembly, repair and assembly process plans, stochastic operations, and the usage of rotable inventory. In view of today’s time-based competition, effectively scheduling such services and managing rotable inventory and uncertainties are becoming imperative to achieve <b>on-time</b> <b>deliveries</b> and low overall costs. In this paper, a novel formulation for overhaul and repair services is presented where key characteristics, such as uncertain asset arrivals and operation processing times, and rotable parts are abstracted to model an overhaul center and multiple repair shops in a distributed framework to reflect organizational structures. Interactions between the overhaul center and repair shops are described by sets of coupling constraints across the organizations. Rotable inventory dynamics is formulated in terms of repair operation completio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{meet the}} {{shipping}} deadlines of dynamic product demands efficiently, the operations and shipping systems in an enterprise must be nimble and responsive {{enough to satisfy}} customers. Organizations have implemented enterprise systems (ESs) to integrate their supply chain processes such as customer order receipt, logistics planning, manufacturing, and dispatch of products. This paper investigates how manufacturing organizations manage their distribution logistics function and implement strategies using an ES and its information. Three case studies are conducted in manufacturing companies that have implemented ESs to examine how these systems support the management practices and strategies in shipping out operations. Findings suggest that ES tools aid information flow for tracking shipment orders, optimization of product packaging, and achieving <b>on-time</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Though firms are sometimes constrained in materials and availability of physical products for dispatch, the underlying ES technology provides the analytical and knowledge-leveraging support to spur the distribution logistics processes efficiently...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{importance}} of incorporating uncertainty into planning models for logistics and transportation systems has been widely recognized in the Operations Research and transportation science communities. Maritime transportation, as a major mode of transport in the world, is subject {{to a wide range}} of disruptions at the strategic, tactical and operational levels. This thesis is mainly concerned with the development of robustness planning strategies that can mitigate the effects of some major types of disruptions for an important class of optimization problems in the shipping industry. Such problems arise in the creation and negotiation of long-term delivery contracts with customers who require <b>on-time</b> <b>deliveries</b> of high-value goods throughout the year. In this thesis, we consider the disruptions that can increase travel times between ports and ultimately affect one or more scheduled deliveries to the customers. Computational results show that our integrated solution procedure and robustness planning strategies can generate delivery plans that are both economical as well as robust against uncertain disruptions.

40|$|At {{cross docking}} {{terminals}} incoming deliveries of inbound trucks are unloaded, sorted, {{moved across the}} dock and finally loaded onto outbound trucks, which immediately leave the terminal towards their next destination in the distribution chain. Accordingly, a cross dock is a consolidation point in a distribution network, where multiple smaller shipments can be merged to full truck loads in order to realize economies in transportation. In this context, the truck scheduling problem, which decides on the succession of truck processing at the dock doors, is especially important to ensure a rapid turnover and <b>on-time</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Due to its high real-world significance, several truck scheduling procedures have been introduced during recent years, which all treat specific cross dock settings. In order to structure and promote scientific progress, this paper introduces a classification of deterministic truck scheduling. With the help of this classification, existing literature is reviewed and future research needs are identified. Moreover, we represent a yet unexplored class of truck scheduling problems which is highly relevant in real-world distribution networks. Logistics Cross docking Scheduling Classification...|$|R

The {{focus of this}} study was on developing strategies that business leaders could use to increase <b>on-time</b> <b>deliveries.</b> The conceptual frameworks for this case study were systems theory, traffic equilibrium theory, bathtub theory, and kinematic wave theory. Data were collected from semistructured interviews with 6 delivery service leaders from 3 delivery businesses in Southcentral Alaska. In addition, secondary data were collected from government information. Interview responses were coded to identify trends including delivery time, business activity, and amount of roadway congestion. Two major themes emerged from the interviews: time of day affecting when traffic congestion occurred, and limited alternate transportation routes causing congestion in Southcentral Alaska. The findings indicated that the best strategy to help reduce traffic congestion involved instituting toll optimization and high occupant vehicles lanes. The implications for effecting social change include how business leaders can help reduce traffic congestion using toll optimization, and how high occupant vehicle lanes could encourage Southcentral Alaskans to carpool...|$|R
