5|$|After degenerating into {{a remnant}} low on September10, {{moisture}} {{associated with the}} former tropical cyclone spread across the Southwestern United States. Aided by above-average water vapor levels and the aforementioned upper-level trough, scattered thunderstorms developed across the region on September14. Two major incidents of flash flooding resulted in 21deaths in Utah, the deadliest flash flood event in the state's history. The previous deadliest event was on August13, 1923, when seven people died near Farmington. Flash floods occur annually in Washington County, Utah, with an average <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two flash flood days per year since 1950.|$|E

5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, {{the giant}} {{freshwater}} stingray inhabits sandy or muddy areas and preys on small fishes and invertebrates. Females give live birth to litters <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> four pups, which are sustained to term by maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species faces heavy fishing pressure for meat, recreation, and aquarium display, {{as well as}} extensive habitat degradation and fragmentation. These forces have resulted in substantial population declines in at least central Thailand and Cambodia. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the giant freshwater stingray as Endangered.|$|E
5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E

5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate {{for weeks}} or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E
5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the {{peppered}} maskray is a bottom-dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter sizes <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the peppered maskray is {{a frequent}} bycatch of bottom trawl fisheries, it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> six pups are born every other year.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after leaving}} TSR, Gygax was {{approached}} by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984. Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply looking for some way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax's name, {{he would be able}} to bring in one to two million dollars of investment. Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI) was publicly announced. To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and Dragon magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two million dollars failed to materialize.|$|E

5|$|In New York, Edouard {{produced}} strong {{waves and}} storm tides <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> twoft (0.3 to 0.6m), causing overwash along southern Long Island {{due to high}} tide. Coastal flooding occurred, including in Hampton Bays where the waves flooded one road and covered another with sand. The flooding trapped six cars, while the strong waves forced several beaches to close. Because the hurricane moved through the New York Shipping Channel, numerous ships reported winds of over hurricane status, though winds remained below tropical storm force on land. A boat capsized {{off the coast of}} Jones Beach Island, though its passengers were not injured. A Celebrity Cruises cruise ship, the MV_Zenith suffered damage from 30 to 50ft (nine to 15m) waves, injuring several passengers and crew members. Rainfall was minimal, peaking at less than a half of an inch in eastern Long Island.|$|E

40|$|Given an {{arbitrary}} bitstream, {{we consider the}} problem of finding the longest substring whose ratio <b>of</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> zeroes equals a given value. The central result {{of this paper is}} an algorithm that solves this problem in linear time. The method involves (i) reformulating the problem as a constrained walk through a sparse matrix, and then (ii) developing a data structure for this sparse matrix that allows us to perform each step of the walk in amortised constant time. We also give a linear time algorithm to find the longest substring whose ratio <b>of</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> zeroes is bounded below by a given value. Both problems have practical relevance to cryptography and bioinformatics. Comment: 22 pages, 19 figures; v 2 : minor edits and enhancement...|$|R

5|$|Small {{bony fishes}} {{are the main}} prey of the nervous shark, while crustaceans, molluscs, and snakes may also be eaten. It is viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos nourished through a placental connection. The details of its life history seem to vary depending on latitudefor example, {{the timing of the}} breeding season and the length of the gestation period. Females produce litters <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> six young either annually or biennially. The harmless nervous shark is caught incidentally by coastal gillnet fisheries and perhaps also by line and trawl fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species except in Australian waters, where its population seems healthy and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe (Giraffa) is a genus of African even-toed {{ungulate}} mammals, the tallest living terrestrial {{animals and the}} largest ruminants.
