5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E
5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object.

Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Cory Shankman et al. {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} a distant massive perturber on the TNOs used to infer the planet's existence. They simulated clones (<b>objects</b> <b>with</b> similar orbits) of 15 <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> semi-major axis > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU under the influence of a 10 Earth-massed Planet Nine in Batygin and Brown's best fit orbit. While longitude of perihelion alignment of the <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> semi-major axis > 250 AU was observed in their simulations, the alignment of the arguments of perihelion was not. The simulations also revealed an increase in the inclinations of many objects, thereby predicting a larger reservoir of high-inclination TNOs. These objects should have been detected in existing surveys but are still unseen so far—suggesting there is a currently missing or unseen signature of Planet Nine. A previously published paper concluded that current observations are insufficient to identify this signature, however. The perihelia of many of the objects also rose and fell smoothly, inconsistent with the current absence of extreme TNOs with perihelia between 50 AU and 70 AU. Their perihelia also reached values where the objects would not be observed and, after declining, fell low enough for the objects to enter planet-crossing orbits leading to their ejection from the Solar System. These factors would require a population of Sednas significantly larger than current estimates, and inconsistent with current models of the early Solar System, to explain current observations. Based on these challenges Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed alignment of the existing TNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the clustering of the perihelia and the orbital poles of distant objects, Planet Nine offers explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna and , for <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> orbits roughly perpendicular {{to those of the}} planets, for high inclination TNOs with semi-major axes less than 100 AU, and for the tilt of the Sun's rotation axis. The objects it dynamically controls would form a cloud centered on its semi-major axis {{with a wide range of}} inclinations.|$|E
5|$|Less formally, if q is 4, for example, {{there are}} 8 (=23) times more {{objects in the}} 100–200km range than in the 200–400km range, and for every object with a {{diameter}} between 1000 and 1010km there should be around 1000 (=103) <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> diameter of 100 to 101km.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals are}} highly {{sensitive}} to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore stationary ones.

Moving <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, even though they are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the outer Solar System with known biases, observed eight trans-Neptunian <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational biases of the survey, no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some biases he found that even with these biases the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform.|$|E

5|$|Using similar arguments, {{this can}} be {{generalized}} to a system with an arbitrary number of particles. In general, as long as all forces are due to the interaction of <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> mass, {{it is possible to}} define a system such that net momentum is never lost nor gained.|$|E
5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these <b>objects,</b> <b>with</b> the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E

50|$|A {{celestial}} object's axial tilt indicates {{whether the}} object's rotation is prograde or retrograde. Axial tilt is the angle between an object's rotation axis {{and a line}} perpendicular to its orbital plane passing through the object's centre. An <b>object</b> <b>with</b> an axial tilt up to 90 degrees is rotating {{in the same direction}} as its primary. An <b>object</b> <b>with</b> an axial tilt of exactly 90 degrees has a perpendicular rotation that is neither prograde nor retrograde.

Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant detached <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> perihelia greater than 70 AU. Their high perihelia keep {{them at a}} sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a distant orbit and a distant encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} classification, {{introduced by}} B. J. Gladman, B. G. Marsden and C. Van Laerhoven in 2007, uses 10-million-year orbit integration {{instead of the}} Tisserand parameter. An object qualifies as an SDO if its orbit is not resonant, has a semi-major axis no greater than 2000 AU, and, during the integration, its semi-major axis shows an excursion of 1.5 AU or more. Gladman et al. suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility. If the object is not an SDO as per the above definition, but the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0.240, it is classified as a detached TNO. (<b>Objects</b> <b>with</b> smaller eccentricity are considered classical.) In this scheme, the disc extends from the orbit of Neptune to 2000 AU, the region {{referred to as the}} inner Oort cloud.|$|E
