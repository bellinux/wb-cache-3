The electricity consumption is calculated from historic data (load profile of the electric consumption in the given area and serves as the lead indicator for the future volumes that will be required to cover the demand. The Electric utility faces a number of options how to procure the necessary volumes of electric energy. If the company owns its own power plants, which is usually the case, it produces a part of the electricity itself.

The relative rigidity of the production, which cannot be flexibly adjusted and the relative uncertainty about the actual consumption, which depends on a number of factors such as weather, industrial production levels etc., are bound to create unpredicted spikes in electricity prices.|$|E

40|$|The common wisdom argues that, in general, large trades cause large price changes, while small trades cause {{small price}} changes. However, for {{extremely}} large price changes, the trade size and news play a minor role, while the liquidity (especially price gaps on the limit order book) {{is a more}} influencing factor. Hence, there might be other influencing factors of immediate price impacts of trades. In this paper, through mechanical analysis of price variations before and after a trade of arbitrary size, we identify that the trade size, the bid-ask spread, the price gaps and the <b>outstanding</b> <b>volumes</b> at the bid and ask sides of the limit order book have impacts on the changes of prices. We propose two regression models to investigate the influences of these microscopic factors on the price impact of buyer-initiated partially filled trades, seller-initiated partially filled trades, buyer-initiated filled trades, and seller-initiated filled trades. We find that they have quantitatively similar explanation powers and these factors can account for up to 44 % of the price impacts. Large trade sizes, wide bid-ask spreads, high liquidity at the same side and low liquidity at the opposite side will cause a large price impact. We also find that the liquidity at the opposite side has a more influencing impact than the liquidity at the same side. Our results shed new lights on the determinants of immediate price impacts. ...|$|R

Since then it has nearly halved, while turnover has continued to rise. The decline in volumes outstanding reflects intensified efforts to reduce counterparty risk, which have eliminated more than $ 65 trillion of offsetting positions. JEL classification: G 23, G 28. After rapid growth, the <b>outstanding</b> <b>volume</b> of CDS fell sharply … … reflecting concerns about counterparty risks … The notional amount of outstanding credit default swaps (CDS) 2 grew rapidly from the market’s beginnings in the mid- 1990 s to a peak of almost $ 60 trillion at the end of 2007, 3 but then declined sharply to just over $ 30 trillion at the end of the first half of 2010 (Graph 1, left-hand panel). This feature argues that the decline did not occur because CDS lost some of their appeal in the light of the recent financial crisis. Indeed, trading volumes have continued to rise. New trade volumes at the major CDS dealers were almost twice as high in the first nine months of 2010 as in the same period in 2007, according to Markit. Instead, the sharp drop in the volume of outstanding CDS is due to trade compression and the move to central counterparties in the CDS market. Perceptions of counterparty risk can explain both the rise and subsequent fall in the volume of outstanding CDS. Until the onset of the subprime mortgag...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese {{economy has}} been in {{stagnation}} since the bubble broke down {{in the beginning of}} the 90 's. The average growth rate of real GDP for the decade is only about 1 percent. And to make matters worse, the growth rate was negative in 1998. The government of Japan decided to use the traditional fiscal policy in order to recover from the recession and increased its expenditure many times since the early 90 's. The Bank of Japan also lowered the interest rate to stimulate the investment of private sector as a usual monetary policy, and tried to increased money supply. But they did not succeed in pulling the nation's economy out of the recession and Japan still remains in stagnation. As the result of these policies in the 90 's, the <b>outstanding</b> <b>volume</b> of the government bond has risen, and the level of the interest rate is very low, nearly 0 percent. If the government issues more bond to raise the fund that it uses as policy expenditure, the price of the bond may fall suddenly and the interest rate may rise to the contrary. The sudden rise of the interest rate reduces the investment expenditure so that the state of the economy will become worse. So the government cannot increase its expenditure to increase the aggregate demand and stimulate the economic activity. It is apparent that the Bank of Japan cannot lower the interest rate more. In this situation, the government and the Bank of Japan cannot use the traditional fiscal and monetary policies. Many researchers and economists have proposed a variety of means different from the traditional policies to rescue the Japanese economy from long-lasting stagnation. Although these policy proposals are different in practical means, the fundamental ideas are classified into few categories. Among these ideas, the important ones are to remove the nonperforming loans from the assets on the balance sheet, and to stop the deflation and realize a mild inflation. The purpose of this paper is to examine and try to appraise the effectiveness of these ideas...|$|E
40|$|Walter Nugent 2 ̆ 7 s Into the West: The Story of Its People adds an <b>outstanding</b> <b>volume</b> to {{the canon}} of Western history, {{reminding}} readers of the intellectual vitality that fuels this discipline. The book undertakes a grand sweep of Western history, from the speculative past of prehistoric tribes to the speculative future of the twenty-first century. On this epic journey across and through the American West, Nugent delivers exactly what he promises: a book about people. Despite romantic notions about the region that haunt Americans, Nugent sees the West as a definable place with a history larger than images of a 2 ̆ 2 frontier heyday. 2 ̆ 2 He presents a chronological account centered on five factors that impelled migration into the West: land hunger, valuable resources, improved quality of life, regional nostalgia, and desire for personal betterment. He writes of the assorted people who, across time, responded to one {{or all of these}} forces. Nugent 2 ̆ 7 s West is a cultural kaleidoscope. Shifting his lens from Native people to Spanish-speakers to Asians to Euro-Americans to African Americans, he details their successes and failures as they competed for contested spaces. Few authors can so successfully combine sterling scholarship with a warm personal prose marked by insight and wit. The writing moves so easily one can hear the author speaking its words. This is not, however, merely a collection of interesting vignettes about the known and the unknown, the Leland Stanfords and the Mabel Tom Lees of the area, but a balanced, inclusive treatment of the various subregions of the West. Nugent paints a richly textured Western mural, drawing on voluminous evidence to show how the West turned on an axis of rural and urban exigencies. Those interested in the Great Plains part of this narrative will not be disappointed. The homesteaders 2 ̆ 7 West is there, with its economics and demographics, its ups and downs, from the past to the present, all ably portrayed. Walter Nugent argues that the West deserves historical treatment that eschews parochialism. Accordingly, this is a book of vision and synthesis. To search out faults would be nit-picking at a graceful, compassionate work that embraces the West with scholarly and critical affection. With striking photographs and powerful descriptions, it weaves irony and contradiction, despair and hope, optimism and humor, greed and frustration into our understanding of the West. This is history-frontier, Western, regional, national-at its best, and Walter Nugent well deserves every accolade he receives for Into the West...|$|E
