5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk <b>of</b> <b>unintended</b> injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction <b>of</b> <b>unintended</b> tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks <b>of</b> <b>unintended</b> pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Any sexual {{activity}} {{that involves the}} introduction of semen into a woman's vagina, such as during sexual intercourse, or even contact of semen with her vulva, {{may result in a}} pregnancy. To reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>unintended</b> pregnancies, some people who engage in penile-vaginal sex may use contraception, such as birth control pills, a condom, diaphragms, spermicides, hormonal contraception or sterilization. The effectiveness of the various contraceptive methods in avoiding pregnancy varies considerably.|$|E
25|$|In France, the 1920 Birth Law {{contained}} a clause that criminalized dissemination of birth-control literature.

25|$|Evidence {{shows that}} a {{combination}} of comprehensive sex education and access to birth control appears to decrease the rates <b>of</b> <b>unintended</b> pregnancies among teenagers. A meta-analysis that compared comprehensive sex education programs with abstinence-only programs found that abstinence-only programs did not reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, but rather may have increased it. Numerous studies show that curricula providing accurate information about condoms and contraception can lead to reductions in the risky behaviors reported by young people as well as reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs. Programs that teach only abstinence have not been shown to be effective.|$|E

It was previously {{shown that the}} same coils used in wireless charging {{can be used for}} detection <b>of</b> <b>unintended</b> radiation. Therefore, these charging pads pose a potential hazard. Malicious charging pads might attempt to extract keys in addition to charging a user’s phone. When coupled with packet sniffing capabilities of public wifi, the keys extracted could be used to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on users. If Far Field attacks are discovered, an attacker only needs to point his antenna at a victim to perform these attacks; the victim need not be actively charging their phone on one of these public pads.|$|E

2500|$|... "Brian Wilson is a genius" [...] is a tagline {{created by}} English {{journalist}} Derek Taylor in 1966, {{who was then}} employed as publicist for American rock band the Beach Boys. It {{was part of a}} larger campaign designed to update the band's antiquated surfing image and promote Brian Wilson's then-unheralded reputation as the [...] "genius" [...] behind the Beach Boys. This promotion coincided with the Pet Sounds album (May 1966), [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] single (October 1966), and Smile sessions (abandoned in 1967). By the end of 1966, NME conducted a reader's poll that placed Wilson as the fourth-ranked [...] "World Music Personality"—about 1,000 votes ahead of Bob Dylan and 500 behind John Lennon. The campaign bore a number <b>of</b> <b>unintended</b> consequences, and is recognized as one of the contributing factors in Wilson's decline.|$|E
2500|$|Beckett {{also wanted}} to explore themes about making hard choices. To {{think outside the box}} {{sometimes}} requires not only [...] "transgressive" [...] but extremely [...] "cruel" [...] behavior, he told Kirkus Reviews. The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number <b>of</b> <b>unintended</b> ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a reactionary response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of patriarchy) but in ways no one can anticipate. Beckett said much of {{the latter part of the}} novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and force people to make sacrifices they do not wish to make.|$|E
2500|$|Structural {{violence}} is often embedded in longstanding social structures, ubiquitous throughout the globe, that are regularized by persistent institutions and regular experience with them. These social structures seem so normal {{in our understanding}} of the world that they are almost invisible, but inequality in resource access, political power, education, healthcare, and legal standing are all possible perpetrators of structural violence. Structural violence occurs [...] "whenever persons are harmed, maimed, or killed by poverty and unjust social, political, and economic institutions, systems, or structures" [...] Structural violence can contribute to worse health outcomes through either harming or killing victims, just like armed violence can have these effects. This type <b>of</b> <b>unintended</b> harm perpetuated by structural violence progressively promotes misery and hunger that eventually results in death, among other effects. Ehrlich and Ehrlich reported in 1970 that between 10 and 20 million of the 60 million annual deaths across the globe result from starvation and malnutrition. Their report also estimated that structural violence was responsible for the end of one billion lives between 1948 and 1967 in the third world.|$|E
