5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage <b>of</b> <b>material</b> in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E

5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} {{a broad and}} faint sheet <b>of</b> <b>material</b> inward of ring 6. This ring was given the temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The ring was located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet <b>of</b> <b>material</b> just inside ring 6. This ring was dubbed the ζ ring. However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E
