This prompted Kübler-Ross to connect Chappell with Dougy and his family, and Chappell to create support groups for grieving children. Despite Kübler-Ross' early influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization,</b> The Dougy Center does not subscribe to the Kübler-Ross model (a series of five emotional stages experienced by survivors of an intimate's death: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) and has even expressed skepticism about the model.|$|E

5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Organization</b> of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E

5|$|Although {{favorable}} conditions {{allowed for}} the uninhibited growth of Iselle early in its development, moderate wind shear briefly impacted the hurricane on August2, preventing thunderstorms from intensifying and causing the storm to become slightly malformed vertically. However, these conditions abated shortly afterwards, allowing Iselle to resume strengthening and reach Category2hurricane status late that same day. With wind shear no longer impinging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> of Iselle, the tropical cyclone gradually became more symmetric, allowing for the hurricane's once ragged eye to clear itself of cloud cover and the storm to intensify to major hurricane status on August3. Attaining some annular tropical cyclone characteristics, Iselle reaching Category4 strength at 12:00UTC on August4. Consequently, Iselle reached peak intensity at 18:00UTC with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). At the same time, the hurricane exhibited an 30mi (45km) eye across.|$|E
5|$|On November3, {{an area of}} {{scattered}} convection persisted about 860km (535mi) {{southwest of}} Mumbai, India, in the central Arabian Sea. The thunderstorms were associated with a weak and broad circulation, located {{in an area of}} low wind shear and warm water temperatures over , both favorable conditions. At the time, the system was located east of Cyclone Chapala, which had recently struck Yemen. On November4, a distinct low pressure area developed in association with a mid- to upper-level low, while the region was in an active Madden Julian Oscillation phase favorable for storm development. The circulation became better defined as outflow increased, amplified by an anticyclone over the system. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization,</b> the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the low as a depression at 00:00UTC on November5. About six hours later, the IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression, and at 12:00UTC that day the agency upgraded it to a cyclonic storm, naming it Megh. Earlier that day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 05A while the storm was about 1,120km (700mi) east of Socotra island offshore Yemen.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1822 as Agaricus indigo by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz, the species was later {{transferred to the}} genus Lactarius in 1838 by the Swede Elias Magnus Fries. German botanist Otto Kuntze called it Lactifluus indigo in his 1891 treatise Revisio Generum Plantarum, but the suggested name change was not adopted by others. Hesler and Smith in their 1960 study of North American species of Lactarius defined L.indigo as the type species of subsection Caerulei, a group characterized by blue latex and a sticky, blue cap. In 1979, they revised their opinions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> of subdivisions in the genus Lactarius, and instead placed L.indigo in subgenus Lactarius based on the color of latex, and the subsequent color changes observed after exposure to air. As they explained:The gradual development of blue to violet pigmentation as one progresses from species to species is an interesting phenomenon deserving further study. The climax is reached in L.indigo which is blue throughout. L.chelidonium and its variety chelidonioides, L.paradoxus, and L. hemicyaneus may be considered as mileposts {{along the road to}} L.indigo.|$|E

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} June, a {{westerly}} wind burst {{moved across}} the western Pacific Ocean, spawning Typhoon Chan-hom {{as well as the}} storm that would become Linfa. On July1, a large area of convection persisted east of the Philippines, with an associated circulation exposed due to moderate wind shear. At 06:00UTC that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis over the subsequent 24hours. However, the system quickly organized, prompting the JTWC to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert later that day, indicating that a storm would likely form imminently. At 18:00UTC on July1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression developed about 500km (300mi) east-northeast of the Philippine island of Samar. Early the next day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 10W, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> of the rainbands about the center. PAGASA – the Philippines' weather agency – also began monitoring the system, giving it the local name Egay.|$|E
