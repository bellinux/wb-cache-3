2500|$|Vaughan bought many Stratocasters {{and gave}} some away as gifts. A sunburst Diplomat Strat-style guitar was {{purchased}} by Vaughan and given to his girlfriend Janna Lapidus {{to learn to play}} on. Vaughan used a custom set of uncommonly heavy strings, gauges [...]013, [...]015, [...]019, [...]028, [...]038, [...]058, and tuned a half-step below standard tuning. He played with so much tension that it was not uncommon for him to separate his fingernail from the quick movement along the strings. The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow some super glue, which he used to keep fingernail split from widening while he continued to play. The super glue was suggested by Rene Martinez, who was Stevie's guitar technician. Martinez eventually convinced Stevie to change to slightly lighter strings. [...] He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile (thicker at the top) which was more comfortable for his thumb-over style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements; Vaughan often had his roadie, Byron Barr, <b>obtain</b> <b>custom</b> stainless steel bars made by Barr's father. Vaughan was also photographed playing a National Duolian, Epiphone Riviera, Gibson Flying V, as well as several other models. Vaughan used a Gibson Johnny Smith to record [...] "Stang's Swang", and a Guild 12-string acoustic for his performance on MTV Unplugged in January 1990. On June 24, 2004, one of Vaughan's Stratocasters, the aforementioned [...] "Lenny" [...] strat, was sold at an auction to benefit Eric Clapton's Crossroads Centre in Antigua; the instrument was bought by Guitar Center for $623,500.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{breakthrough}} in the tradeoff between privacy and data quality has been achieved for restricted access to anonymized population census microdata samples. The IPUMS-International website, as of June 2007, offers to approved researchers integrated microdata for 26 countries (80 censuses), totaling more than 200 million person records. Samples for 60 - 80 additional censuses will be integrated {{over the next four}} years by the global collaboratory led by the Minnesota Population Center. Major funding is provided by the United States National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. The statistical authorities of more than 70 countries have already entrusted microdata to the project under a uniform memorandum of understanding which permits researchers to <b>obtain</b> <b>custom</b> extracts without charge and to analyze the microdata using their own hardware and software. This paper describes the disclosure control methods used by the IPUMS initiative to protect privacy and to enhance quality in providing access to high precision census microdata samples...|$|E

These chips {{are intended to}} be used in acquiring the data needed to qualify Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC's) for space use.

60|$|He was {{the first}} American who {{is known to have}} attempted--in a very humble line, it is true--that art in which we can now reckon so many names already distinguished, or rising to distinction. From his {{earliest}} boyhood he had exhibited a knack,--for it would be too proud a word to call it genius,--a knack, therefore, for the imitation of the human figure in whatever material came most readily to hand. The snows of a New England winter had often supplied him with a species of marble as dazzlingly white, at least, as the Parian or the Carrara, and if less durable, yet sufficiently so to correspond with any claims to permanent existence possessed by the boy's frozen statues. Yet they won admiration from maturer judges than his schoolfellows, and were, indeed, remarkably clever, though destitute of the native warmth that might have made the snow melt beneath his hand. As he advanced in life, the young man adopted pine and oak as eligible materials for the display of his skill, which now began to bring him a return of solid silver as well as the empty praise that had been an apt reward enough for his productions of evanescent snow. He became noted for carving ornamental pump-heads, and wooden urns for gate-posts, and decorations, more grotesque than fanciful, for mantel-pieces. No apothecary would have deemed himself in the way of <b>obtaining</b> <b>custom,</b> without setting up a gilded mortar, if not a head of Galen or Hippocrates, from the skilful hand of Drowne.|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{variability}} {{not only}} affects {{the behavior of}} contemporary ICs but also their vulnerability to transient error phenomenon especially radiation induced soft errors. Such variations in device parameters are caused by static process variations, dynamic variations in power supply and temperature and slow degradation of individual devices due to phenomena like Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) and Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI). In this paper *, we analyze the impact of such variations on the Soft Error Rates (SER) of combinational logic circuits. Other contributions of this work also include tools that model threshold degradation of NMOS due to HCI and PMOS due to NBTI in logic circuits.

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of multiple Coulomb centers in molecules or solids poses a challenge when solving the effective Schrödinger equation, required {{as a crucial}} ingredient in density functional or Hartree–Fock calculations. This is primarily because Kato’s cusp condition needs to be satisfied close to each nucleus and the matrix elements of the Coulomb potential at the nuclei are rather difficult to evaluate when using global basis functions. A novel method for dealing with these challenges is introduced, rewriting the wavefunction {{as a product of}} a function satisfying the nuclear cusp conditions and a smooth function, resulting in a transformed variational principle and a regularized potential. Results of three-dimensional finite element calculations based on this ansatz for the ground state of the molecule H 2 + in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation are presented, which were <b>obtained</b> using <b>custom</b> written Python/Fortran code...|$|R
