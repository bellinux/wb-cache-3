40|$|This paper studies how {{a rise in}} China's {{share of}} U. S. imports could lower {{pass-through}} of exchange rates to U. S. import prices. We develop a theoretical model with variable markups showing {{that the presence of}} exports from a country with a fixed exchange rate could alter the competitive environment in the U. S. market. In particular, this encourages exporters from other countries to lower markups in response to a U. <b>S.</b> <b>depreciation,</b> thereby moderating the pass-through to import prices. Free entry is found to further moderate the pass-through, in that a U. <b>S.</b> <b>depreciation</b> encourages entry of exporters whose costs are shielded by the fixed exchange rate, which further intensifies the competitive pressure on other exporters. The model predicts that certain conditions are necessary to facilitate this 'China explanation' for falling pass-through, including a 'North America bias' in U. S. preferences. The model also produces a log-linear structural equation for pass-through regressions indicating how to include the China share. Panel regressions over 1993 – 1999 support the prediction that a high China share in imports lowers pass-through to U. S. import prices. ...|$|R

We have simulated the biomass potential uses in the two CA cropping systems usually applied in the Alaotra Lake region of Madagascar for producing rainfed rice.

The second is a three year rotation system of maize intercropped with Stylosanthes guianensis, followed by <b>one</b> <b>year</b> of <b>S.</b> guianensis (SG) alone, ultimately followed by rice.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the {{demographic characteristics of}} patients undergoing orthognathic surgery at the University of Otago over a nine-year period. METHODS: The case notes of patients who underwent orthognathic surgery procedures at the University of Otago from 2001 to 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. This was augmented with a brief literature review of surgical considerations and complications in orthognathic surgery among older patients. RESULTS: The 92 patients {{included in the study}} were aged 15 to 56 years. The mean patient age increased over the nine-year observation period, from 22. 1 <b>years</b> (<b>sd,</b> 9. 4) during 2001 - 2003, 25. 0 <b>years</b> (<b>sd,</b> 12. 7) during 2004 - 2006, to 27. 7 <b>years</b> (<b>sd,</b> 11. 4) during 2007 - 2009. Most patients were from New Zealand European or European backgrounds, with only 5. 5 % identifying as Maori, and 3. 3 % as Asian. A female preponderance was observed (with a female:male ratio of 1. 6 : 1). Complications were encountered with 24 patients (26. 1 %). Ten patients had long-term (lasting for <b>one</b> <b>year</b> or more) sensory nerve disturbance; all of those had undergone a mandibular bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) procedure (they comprised 12. 7 % of all BSSO patients treated); half of those patients were over 35 years old, and four were over 40 years old. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increase in the proportion of older patients undergoing orthognathic surgery at the University of Otago.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Members of {{the family}} Simuliidae were studied in a single, {{confined}} drainage system. In addition to determining the occurrence and distribution of the species present, biological and ecological observations were made. Specific measurements and observations were accomplished to determine {{as much as possible}} about the habitat specificity and life cycle characteristics of the simuliids present. Rearing and association experiments were also carried out on many species. Sixteen species representing four genera were studied. In addition, one series of Prosimulium specimens could not be identified definitely, and one new species of Simulium was found and studied. Adult emergence extended from early January to late November. Twinnia and Prosimulium representatives were generally the first black flies to emerge. Light appeared to be the primary limiting factor as to adult emergence in all species studied in detail. Males almost always emerged earlier than the females. All Twinnia, Cnephia, and Prosimulium species, and Simulium argus, S. canadense, S. pugetense, and S. tuberosum had <b>one</b> generation per <b>year.</b> <b>S.</b> articum, S. decorum, S. piperi, S. venustum, and S. sp. # 1 all had two generations per <b>year,</b> and <b>S.</b> vittatum had three. Larval and pupal duration times were recorded for most species, and varied greatly. The effect of water temperature and velocity on these times could not be accurately determined. Although overwintering stages varied, most of the species studied passed the winter months in the egg. Oviposition was never observed, although determinations were made on egg deposition sites and conditions for four species. Drift of Prosimulium larvae was much greater than with the same stages of Simulium. Physical and biological conditions under which black fly immature stages flourished were extremely diverse.

Sequences were found to vary significantly due to seasonal effects, but depth showed no significant correlation. The most abundant taxa among these samples included Synechococcus, Pelagibacteraceae (SAR 11), Bacteroidetes, various Proteobacteria, and Archaea, such as Thermoplasmata. Other taxa found, albeit in low numbers, were the Thiotrichales, and some members of which can indicate pollution, the Alteromonadales, a biofilm forming order. Inlet sequences were found to be significantly different from the outfall and reef communities by various analyses. Unifrac analysis of microbial beta diversity showed a significant clustering pattern for the inlet samples. Precipitation during the three days before and after sampling was low meaning there was little to no high terrestrial runoff during the sampling days.

The importance of rabbits is at its maximum between July and October, that of the ducks between March and June {{and that of the}} cervids between November and February. The prey is selected for the facility in which they may be caught rather than for their abundance. It is estimated that an individual lynx consumes about 74 gr of food per kilo of body weight daily. The impact of the predation on the prey populations is difficult to evaluate, but it seems to be very important on the fallow deer population, relatively important on these of rabbits and red deer and very slight on that of ducks.
