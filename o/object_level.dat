25|$|Psychological {{formalism}} {{is defined}} as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. Human psychology {{is considered to be a}} unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an <b>object</b> <b>level</b> perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).|$|E

50|$|The {{database}} server process maintains lock request queues at the <b>object</b> <b>level</b> to control concurrency {{of access to}} the same object. A request for update will establish a queue if there are any existing readers of an object. The request either goes through when all current readers release their locks or times-out (an exception which can be handled by client is thrown). Locks are generally released at transaction boundaries. When a queue is established by an update request, all other subsequent requests fall in queue behind the update request. Once the update request has been filled, all read requests in the queue rush in and get their read lock, return the object, and if there are no other updates, the queue disappears. In this architecture, locks are done at the <b>object</b> <b>level</b> so false waits and false deadlocks do not occur.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a methodology for cartographic modeling of spatial diffusion of dengue fever epidemics, based on spatial analysis techniques and ArcMap and Idrisi 32 GIS. Data from 109 counties, organized in epidemiological weeks, {{related to a}} dengue fever epidemic that occurred in 2001 in northwestern Sao Paulo state, were used to map the spatial diffusion of cases. The methodology is based on five levels of approaches: four levels that join exact objects/continuous fields models with single/multiple times slices sequences, and a fifth level, {{which is based on}} network analysis of connections between counties. With the single time scale/exact <b>objects</b> <b>level,</b> county clusters, spatial contagion of counties and local incidence rates were mapped; and with the multiple time scale/exact <b>objects</b> <b>level,</b> spatial dynamics of the cases were mapped with a spatial&time sequencing model. Using the single time/continuous field level, isoplethic and tendency surface maps were produced. At the multiple times/continuous field level, spatial diffusion maps and spatial-time mobility of mean geographical center of dengue epidemics are arranged using a sequential maps model. At the last level of methodology, urban node connections are spatially analyzed using road network analysis techniques, to map potential for contagion between counties, spatial dispersion of epidemics between counties, and the path of spread of dengue fever over the region as a whole. The results show the spatial diffusion of dengue fever is most efficient in major highway corridors where the daily trips are more frequent, and where there has been no economic impedance to the circulation of merchandise and people...|$|R
