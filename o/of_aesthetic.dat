5|$|Upon {{returning}} to New York, Koppelman continued his study <b>of</b> <b>Aesthetic</b> Realism, {{and under the}} G.I. Bill, he studied at the Amédée Ozenfant School and became Ozenfant's assistant. While he continued to exhibit sculpture and drawings, he also began printmaking, a medium which, he said, combines the carving quality of sculpture with the subtleties of light and shade in drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. I {{consider}} whether entrepreneurship {{is a distinct}} category within economic theory. More generally, I consider the links between discussions of entrepreneurship and philosophic debates over the nature <b>of</b> the <b>aesthetic.</b> For instance, Kant’s attempt to elevate the category <b>of</b> the <b>aesthetic</b> has {{much in common with}} Kirzner’s attempt to elevate the concept of the entrepreneur. Shackle’s theory of choice refers very directly to the notion <b>of</b> the <b>aesthetic.</b> Theories <b>of</b> the <b>aesthetic</b> and theories <b>of</b> the entrepreneur have common strengths and weaknesses. Key Words: economic method, entrepreneurship, aesthetics, philosophy and economic...|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} by Watanabe {{as an extension}} of his work on the television series, which he treated as a series of miniature films. So as not to alienate fans of the series, a large amount <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> material was incorporated, while also adjusting it to make it accessible to newcomers. Increased budget and production facilities enabled the use of filming styles associated with live action films and a higher animation quality than the series. Arabic thematic elements were incorporated to contrast against the series, which entailed Watanabe traveling to Morocco for research. The Arabic atmosphere was also used in Kanno's music.|$|E
5|$|People visiting {{or living}} in Rome or the cities {{throughout}} the Empire {{would have seen}} art {{in a range of}} styles and media on a daily basis. Public or official art—including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins—is often analysed for its historical significance or as an expression of imperial ideology. At Imperial public baths, a person of humble means could view wall paintings, mosaics, statues, and interior decoration often of high quality. In the private sphere, objects made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce can show varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> quality and artistic skill. A wealthy person might advertise his appreciation of culture through painting, sculpture, and decorative arts at his home—though some efforts strike modern viewers and some ancient connoisseurs as strenuous rather than tasteful. Greek art had a profound influence on the Roman tradition, and some of the most famous examples of Greek statues are known only from Roman Imperial versions and the occasional description in a Greek or Latin literary source.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is {{an updated}} version of , an arcade-style {{fighting}} game, and changes little from the basic gameplay of the original. Players select teams of three different characters to engage in one-on-one combat. The game utilizes the same tag team-based fighting mechanics as its predecessors; players may choose to swap between their characters at any point during a match. Players must use the various attacks in their arsenal, such as character assists, special moves, and hyper combos, to exhaust their opponent's life gauge and defeat the entire enemy team, or have the most cumulative health when time runs out. While the core mechanics remain the same, a number <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> changes have been made in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, with a stronger emphasis on the comic book motif. The HUD, character selection, and stage selection screens have been redesigned. In addition, many returning characters receive balancing changes, which include new moves and animation tweaks.|$|E
