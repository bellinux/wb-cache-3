5|$|Sunshine (1999)—a three-hour {{historical}} epic, and an English-language, international co-production—was {{viewed by}} many critics as Szabó’s most ambitious film, and, along with Mephisto, his most important. Hungary’s Jews had figured in either a marginal or coded fashion in several of Szabó’s earlier films, produced during the socialist period when discourse around {{the history of the}} country’s Jews was more circumscribed. In Sunshine, for the first time, Szabó focused explicitly on this aspect of Hungarian history, which he himself had experienced as a child during the Arrow Cross dictatorship. Ralph Fiennes plays three generations in the Sonnenschein family as they experience the trials <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> Hungarian Jewish history, from the late Austro-Hungarian Empire through the Holocaust to the 1956 Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Westminster, {{which gives}} the borough its name, lies to the {{south-west}} of Charing Cross; it is the location of Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster, which together with St Margaret's parish church comprise a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area's main sculptural showcase is Parliament Square, conceived in the 1860s to improve {{the setting of the}} rebuilt Houses of Parliament, to ease traffic flow and as a site for commemorating politicians of note. Carlo Marochetti's statues of the engineers Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were initially considered for the square, but were rejected as not fitting in with the political theme. They were ultimately erected outside Euston station and on the Victoria Embankment. The square took on its present configuration in a refurbishment of 1949–1950 by the architect George Grey Wornum, though three statues <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> figures which have since been added. Another two political memorials (one of which, the Buxton Memorial Fountain, was moved by Wornum from Parliament Square) and The Burghers of Calais, a work on an historical theme by Auguste Rodin, {{are to be found in}} Victoria Tower Gardens.|$|E

5|$|Willkie warned Republicans {{that only}} a full {{commitment}} to equal rights for minorities would woo African Americans back to the party, and he criticized Roosevelt for yielding to Southern racists among the Democrats. Willkie addressed a convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1942, {{one of the most}} prominent politicians to do so up to that point. He urged integration of the armed forces, and when a violent race riot broke out in Detroit in June 1943, he went on national radio in order to criticize both parties for ignoring racial issues. When the movie hearings of 1941 ended without further action, Willkie had been made chairman of the board <b>of</b> <b>Twentieth-Century</b> Fox. In 1943, he worked with Walter White, executive secretary of the NAACP, to try to convince Hollywood to give blacks better treatment in films. Movie moguls promised changes, and some films featured blacks in major roles, but faced with objections from white Southerners, they reverted to giving blacks stereotyped roles after Willkie's death in 1944, such as servants. After his death, the NAACP named its headquarters the Wendell Willkie Memorial Building.|$|E

25|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> {{art is a}} {{narrative}} of endless possibilities {{and the search for}} new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence.|$|E

25|$|Boulez {{had in mind}} as a {{model the}} Bauhaus, which had {{provided}} a meeting place for artists and scientists of all disciplines. IRCAM's aims would include research into acoustics, instrumental design {{and the use of}} computers in composition. The original building was constructed underground, partly to isolate it acoustically (an above-ground extension was added later). The institution was criticised for absorbing too much state subsidy, Boulez for wielding too much power. At the same time Boulez founded the Ensemble Intercontemporain, a virtuoso ensemble which specialised in the performance <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> music and the creation of new works. Around this time he bought an apartment on the 30th floor of a building at 21-25 Quai André Citroën in the Front de Seine district of Paris.|$|E
25|$|The Common Pursuit, another {{collection}} of his essays from Scrutiny, {{was published in}} 1952. Outside of his work on English poetry and the novel, this is Leavis’s best-known and most influential work. A decade later Leavis was to earn much notoriety when he delivered his Richmond lecture, Two Cultures? The Significance of C. P. Snow at Downing College. Leavis vigorously attacked Snow's suggestion, from a 1959 lecture and book by C. P. Snow (see The Two Cultures), that practitioners of the scientific and humanistic disciplines should have some significant understanding of each other, and {{that a lack of}} knowledge <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> physics was comparable to an ignorance of Shakespeare. Leavis's ad hominem attacks on Snow's intelligence and abilities were widely decried in the British press by public figures such as Lord Boothby and Lionel Trilling.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{proliferation}} of costumes is <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> origin, the occasional use of costumes dates back almost to the date of casting; the oldest costume on display, in the City Museum, being of seventeenth-century origin. In 1756, an inventory indicates that Manneken Pis had five complete costumes. From 1918 to 1940, he was offered some thirty costumes. But it was especially after 1945 that the movement took on an exceptional dimension; he had more than 400 costumes in 1994, more than 750 in 2005, and more than 950 in 2016. The changing of the costume, on the figure, is a colourful ceremony, often accompanied by brass band music. Many costumes represent the national dress of nations whose citizens come to Brussels as tourists; others are the uniforms of assorted trades, professions, associations, and branches of the civil and military services.|$|E

25|$|While the {{scientific}} study of language is known as linguistics and is generally considered a social science, a natural science or a cognitive science, the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as Wittgenstein claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including prose forms (such as the novel), poetry and drama, also {{lies at the heart of}} the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a foreign language usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.|$|E
25|$|Among many {{memorial}} concerts nationwide, {{a memorial}} performance of The Dream of Gerontius was {{given at the}} Royal Albert Hall, at which John Coates and Frederick Ranalow sang with the Royal Choral Society. The Musicians' Benevolent Fund was first established as the Gervase Elwes Memorial Fund for Musicians, and his figure became a presiding genius <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> English music. His particular association with the lyrics of A. E. Housman and the music of Elgar, and his death soon after the First World War, reinforce his embodiment of the lost Edwardian generation, perhaps the last in which his religious conviction could so thoroughly have endeared him to so many. At much {{the same time the}} Glasgow Orpheus Choir instituted a Gervase Elwes Silver Medal, and the Feis Ceoil in Dublin inaugurated its Gervase Elwes Memorial Cup. A choir named after him was established at Walsall. A portrait plaque by Arthur Vokes was set up in the centre of the village of Billing.|$|E
25|$|Born in Montbrison in the Loire {{department}} of France, {{the son of}} an engineer, Boulez studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Olivier Messiaen, and privately with Andrée Vaurabourg and René Leibowitz. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as Music Director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. As a young composer in the 1950s he quickly became a leading figure in avant-garde music, playing {{an important role in the}} development of integral serialism and controlled chance music. From the 1970s onwards he pioneered the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time. His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of completed works was relatively small, but it included pieces regarded by many as landmarks <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> music, such as Le Marteau sans maître, Pli selon pli and Répons. His commitment to the modernist project and the trenchant, polemical tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist, a reputation which softened in later years.|$|E
