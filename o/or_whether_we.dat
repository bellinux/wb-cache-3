He proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics – attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.|$|E

It might be our last {{full-length}} record for a little while, but we've got a lot of things lined up that we want to record, so I think that will happen pretty soon." [...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record." [...] Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, [...] "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> just release songs in batches." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} levels {{was long and}} complicated. [...] It began {{with the creation of}} a general layout of the area to be built by designers. [...] They would pass this concept map to the artists, who added models to it, beginning with the largest objects and ending with small items such as individual pieces of furniture. After everything was put in place by the art team, designers took over again, inserting graphical enhancements, effects, and collision detection code. With a functional level, creatures, items, traps, and triggers were added last, then scripts were written for everything to control behavior. The team found it quite difficult to keep track of changes made to levels, and there were sometimes communication problems between different parts of the team, such as the artists and designers, resulting in inconsistencies between their work. Ray Muzyka, the co-executive producer, wrote, [...] "We learned to make sure all elements of the team are talking to each other and working as a group, rather than as a bunch of individuals!" [...] They did feel they had done a good job automating the level creation process, as levels were rapidly designed. [...] "A designer," [...] wrote Muzyka, [...] "might submit a level description and receive it, art complete, a month later ready for scripting, but missing some key features (almost always a door). We would then have to determine whether the omission was important enough to have the art piece redone, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> could simply tweak the design of the level to fit the finished art." ...|$|E

2500|$|The double slit experiment, {{like the}} other six {{idealized}} experiments (microscope, split beam, tilt-teeth, radiation pattern, one-photon polarization, and polarization of paired photons), imposes a choice between complementary modes of observation. In each experiment we {{have found a way}} to delay that choice of type of phenomenon to be looked for up to the very final stage of development of the phenomenon, and it depends on whichever type of detection device we then fix upon. That delay makes no difference in the experimental predictions. On this score everything we find was foreshadowed in that solitary and pregnant sentence of Bohr, [...] "...it...can make no difference, as regards observable effects obtainable by a definite experimental arrangement, whether our plans for constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> prefer to postpone the completion of our planning until a later moment when the particle is already on its way from one instrument to another." ...|$|E
