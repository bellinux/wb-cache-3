5|$|In the past, some ceremonialists used face paint, {{performed}} {{dances with}} religious significance, and used <b>objectionable</b> terms regarding Native Americans. The OA no longer allows these practices, stating {{that this is}} in recognition of preferences of Native American groups that found such actions offensive.|$|E
5|$|Coprolalia (the {{spontaneous}} utterance {{of socially}} <b>objectionable</b> or taboo words or phrases) {{is the most}} publicized symptom of Tourette's, {{but it is not}} required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. Echolalia (repeating the words of others) and palilalia (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases, while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{objections}} to evolution allege that evolution leads to <b>objectionable</b> results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It {{is argued that}} {{the teaching of evolution}} degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters irreligion or atheism. These may be considered appeals to consequences (a form of logical fallacy), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory {{have nothing to do with}} its objective empirical reality.|$|E
5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} 2 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 516,000 copies {{in its first}} week. It {{produced}} 3 singles that attained chart success and has been certified 6× Platinum by the RIAA; as of August 2015 the album has sold 7,800,000 copies in the United States. 2001 received generally positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the music although some found the lyrics <b>objectionable.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{his tenure}} in Congress, Rowan {{was elected to}} {{represent}} Nelson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1813 to 1817. In 1817, the House debated a resolution instructing Governor Gabriel Slaughter {{to negotiate with the}} governors of Indiana and Ohio to secure passage of legislation requiring citizens of those states to return fugitive slaves. Representative James G. Birney vigorously opposed the resolution, and it was defeated. The pro-slavery members of the House then rallied behind Rowan's leadership to pass a substitute resolution which softened the most <b>objectionable</b> language but retained the call for fugitive slave legislation in Indiana and Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-10 (previously Bill C-33), among a {{long list}} of minor changes to tax law {{contained}} a controversial clause that would give the government power to deny taxation benefits for films made in Canada if the government deems the content to be <b>objectionable.</b> David Cronenberg and Sarah Polley argued it is equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. The Bill was passed in the House October 29, 2007, but opposition parties later said that they did not notice the controversial part and several Senators have said that they intend to send the Bill back to the House.|$|E
5|$|By {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries AD, Virgil had gained a {{reputation}} as a virtuous pagan, a term referring to pagans who were never evangelized and consequently during their lifetime had no opportunity to recognize Christ, but nevertheless led virtuous lives, so that it seemed <b>objectionable</b> to consider them damned. Eventually, some Christians sought to reconcile Virgil's works with the supposed Christianity present in them. Consequently, during the Late Antiquity and beyond, many assumed that the puer referenced in the Fourth Eclogue was actually Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Bill of Rights was {{submitted}} to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill {{as a means of}} silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most <b>objectionable</b> portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the debates and {{legislative}} maneuvering that went into crafting the Bill of Rights amendments was done, many personal opinions had shifted. A number of Federalists came out in support, thus silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective critique. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, were now opposed, realizing that Congressional approval of these amendments would greatly lessen {{the chances of a}} second constitutional convention. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most <b>objectionable</b> portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{argued that}} a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by {{communicating}} with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an <b>objectionable</b> federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable. By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried {{to make clear that}} the Democratic-Republicans were not moving toward disunion.|$|E
5|$|Readers and movie-goers {{of white}} America greeted Chan warmly, seeing {{him as an}} {{attractive}} character who is portrayed as intelligent, heroic, benevolent and honorable {{in contrast to the}} racist depictions of evil or conniving Asians which dominated Hollywood and national media. However, in later decades critics took contending views, finding that Chan, despite his good qualities, reinforces condescending Asian stereotypes such as an alleged incapacity to speak idiomatic English and a tradition-bound and subservient nature. Many found it <b>objectionable</b> that he was played on screen by Caucasian actors in yellowface.|$|E
5|$|The smell {{has been}} {{described}} as initially faint and honey-sweet, but strengthening over time to become overpowering, sickly-sweet and <b>objectionable.</b> Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant. The spore print is white, a common feature of Amanita. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measure 8–10μm (0.30.4mil) long, and stain blue with iodine. The gills, in contrast, stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, Indian {{food safety}} {{regulators}} {{in the state}} of Uttar Pradesh found that samples of Maggi 2 Minute Noodles contained lead up to 17 times beyond permissible limits. On 3 June 2015, New Delhi Government banned the sale of Maggi noodles in New Delhi stores for 15 days because it was found to contain lead beyond the permissible limit. The Gujarat FDA on June 4, 2015 banned the noodles for 30 days after 27 out of 39 samples were detected with <b>objectionable</b> levels of metallic lead, among other things. Some India's biggest retailers like Future Group, Big Bazaar, Easyday and Nilgiris have imposed a nationwide ban on Maggi noodles. Many other states too have banned Maggi noodles.|$|E
5|$|The {{reception}} of the first edition was mixed, but within three years a second was made. The second edition used the more familiar term Testamentum instead of Instrumentum. In the second edition (1519) Erasmus also used Minuscule 3 (entire NT except Revelation; 12th century). The text was changed in about 400 places, with most—though not all—of the typographical errors corrected. Some new erroneus readings {{were added to the}} text. In this edition the text of Jerome's Vulgate Erasmus replaced by his own more elegant translation. The Latin translation had a good reception. After this edition, Erasmus was involved in many polemics and controversies. Particularly <b>objectionable</b> were the annotations from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing <b>objectionable</b> in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|The Family Edition, {{like the}} prior version, {{includes}} parental controls {{and the information}} filtering feature. Parental controls come {{with a list of}} <b>objectionable</b> sites, separated into 32 categories. The list is updated every two weeks by Norton LiveUpdate. Using the list alone, Norton only blocks sites present on the list. Consequently, Norton may not block sites until the next update. Parents can customize the list, adding or removing sites. A list of allowed sites can be created to restrict children to those specific sites. This version uses application blocking rather than protocol or port filtering to control Internet access. Children can be restricted in what applications they used to access the Internet. A parental controls profile can be set up for each child, and settings can be automatically configured based on their age group, whether they be a child, teenager, adult, or administrator. Internet usage and violations are noted in a report presented to parents. PC Magazine found that enabling parental controls added a minute to a computer's boot time.|$|E
5|$|The Sedition Act, Public Entertainments and Meetings Act, and Public Order Act 2009 are {{statutes}} which arguably impose {{restrictions on}} {{the freedom of speech}} and expression, as well as the freedom of assembly, in the interests of public order. The Sedition Act has been used to restrict the propagation of opinions that have a seditious tendency, which includes a tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of Singapore's population. In Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin (2005), the accused was convicted under the Act for posting invective and pejorative anti-Muslim remarks on a blog and a forum on the Internet; and in Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong and another (2009), a married couple were similarly convicted for distributing religious tracts that were considered seditious and <b>objectionable</b> to Muslims. The Public Entertainments and Meetings Act renders it an offence to provide public entertainment and hold meetings without a licence, and its constitutionality has been upheld before the courts in cases concerning political activities organized by opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty <b>objectionable,</b> she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Yasmin Ahmad's (herself a Malaysian Muslim) film Sepet was {{rejected}} by censors who asked that scenes be removed. 10 scenes were <b>objectionable.</b> Among <b>objectionable</b> material queried in the movie was why the movie did not depict any attempt to convert Jason (the Chinese non-Muslim main character) to Islam after he {{had fallen in love}} with a Malay girl.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} that the religious doctrine held by the accused persons was relevant {{to the issue of}} whether the content was <b>objectionable</b> or seditious. If the accused persons had religious beliefs {{similar to that of the}} tracts' author, it would have been unlikely that reasonable individuals in the position of the accused persons would have thought that the content was <b>objectionable</b> or seditious.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{regard the}} eternal {{punishment}} {{of those who}} fail to adopt Christian faith as morally <b>objectionable,</b> and consider it an abhorrent picture {{of the nature of}} the world. On a similar theme objections are made against the perceived injustice of punishing a person for all eternity for a temporal crime. Some Christians agree (see Annihilationism and Trinitarian Universalism). These beliefs have been considered especially repugnant when the claimed omnipotent God makes, or allows a person to come into existence, with a nature that desires that which God finds <b>objectionable.</b>|$|E

25|$|The IPT was {{replaced}} after the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act in 1993, replaced with bodies {{designed to allow}} both more debate and increased consistency, and possession and supply of material that it is decided are <b>objectionable</b> was made a criminal offence.|$|E

25|$|After first {{promising}} {{to support the}} government, he later retracted this support, and his party followed, in part also due to pressure from the Vatican, for which the government's proposed laws in regards to registered partnerships of same-sex couples, and other liberal reforms were <b>objectionable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Waffen-SS in Action was {{included}} in the index of <b>objectionable</b> war books maintained by West Germany's Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons.

A subsequent appeal failed, and the series remains banned.|$|E
