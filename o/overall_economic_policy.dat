We find that the results differ across banks of different size and over different time period. Before and after the financial crisis, a negative relationship is roughly held. However, during the crisis, the results are mixed. Notably, for small banks, the impacts from monetary policy and <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> uncertainty become insignificant. For large and medium banks, the monetary policy uncertainty becomes positively related to bank valuation. And probably because of the cancel-out effect, the <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> uncertainty turns out to be non-negatively associated with bank valuation. We think the results may be explained by “too big to fail” and “constant probability of disaster” theories...|$|E
40|$|The report {{analyzes}} the international competitiveness of furniture industry based on calculations of effective rates of protection and trade indicators. Furniture manufacturing {{remains one of}} the most highly protected industries in Egypt. Although the nominal rate of protection (NRP) for that industry was lowered from 50 percent in 1997 to 40 percent, its rate remains the fourth highest of all manufacturing categories. The effective rate of protection (ERP) for the wood furniture industry is also very high. Moreover, the ERP for the private sector, which dominates the industry, is more than twice as high as that of the public sector. The effect of high import tariffs on furniture products has been to lower overall imports considerably below what they would otherwise have been with growing consumer demand in Egypt. The recommended policy initiatives are designed to strengthen exports of the furniture industry by improving the trade environment, lowering costs and improving efficiency. To be effective, these initiatives need to be viewed as an integral part of the country’s <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> and structural reforms. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{challenge for}} Hungary {{is to achieve}} cohesion with the advanced member states of the EU, and thus being able to improve quality of life. International competitiveness should therefore be significantly enhanced, i. e. it should not and cannot merely be based on low production costs. Hungary is already squeezed in a ‘nut cracker’ formed by advanced countries, on the one hand, and dynamic industrialising countries on the other. The former are capable of controlling international production networks and markets via new technologies, financial muscles and superior business models, while the latter are characterised by extremely low wages and highly disciplined work forces. It is crucial for Hungary to escape this trap. That requires {{a wide range of}} technological and non-technological innovations to raise productivity and find new markets. Macro-economic pressures also call for a successful, competitive economy. Hungarian decision-makers do not realise the close links between domestic R&D efforts, innovation and economic performance. Given the lack of an explicit, coherent innovation strategy and the low level of R&D expenditures, <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> – especially macroeconomic and investment promotion ones – and strategies of foreign-owned companies operating in Hungary are likely to play a much more decisive role in influencing economic performance than science, technology and innovation policies. This is not to suggest, however, that it would be worthless to devise and implement a sound, explicit innovation strategy. On the contrary, an astute innovation strategy should be one of the cornerstones of a comprehensive socio-economic development strategy, aimed at speeding up the cohesion process. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{conservation}} literature {{argues that}} numerous cost-effective conservation measures could be undertaken, {{but they are}} not because market barriers discourage such investments. A review of these barriers indicates that in genera{ they do not discourage investment and they are not market failures. A conventional investment model suggests that business investments in energy efficiency are made with the same decision rules as any other investments. Consumers who invest in energy efficiency require higher rates of return when the investments are illiquid and they are unable to diversify away the risk The high discount rates required by consumers for energy-eficiency investments reflect real costs in a competitive market, not artificial market barriers. Policies that encourage the dissemination of information, such as appliance labelling, may promote energy efficiency and <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> efficiency. <b>Policies,</b> such as appliance standards, that require consumers to invest according to lower discount rates, reduce consumers' <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> wellbeing. Two market failures that illuminate the need for government support of conservation policies are the external costs of energy consumption and production and the lack of aggregate insurance against energy-related risks. ...|$|R

40|$|Macroeconomic {{imbalances}} {{have been}} particularly pressing since 2006 in Hungary. The global economic and financial crisis has further aggravated the prospects for recovery, and access to capital has become even more difficult. Although overall conditions for doing business have improved in recent years, administrative and tax burdens on firms are still high compared to the OECD average. The regulatory environment is characterised by frequent and unpredictable changes. These conditions are not favourable for long-term and high-risk activities, such as RTDI. Only one fifth of firms operating in Hungary are innovative. The majority of companies (59 %) do not innovate {{due to the lack}} of demand for new products and services. Researchers at universities and PROs are not sufficiently motivated to carry out economically relevant research. This, in turn, hinders exploitability of knowledge, and therefore may not provide sufficient incentives for private co-financing of research performed in the public sector. It seems unlikely that R&D investment targets, especially those of the private sector can be achieved simply by providing more public funding. The impact of strictly defined STI policies with the aim of leveraging R&D investments can only be enhanced if framework conditions for RTDI activities are also significantly improved. Given the economic crisis and lack of meaningful communication – let alone co-operation – among the major political parties, it is uncertain if fundamental reforms, needed to create more favourable conditions, can be implemented. Structural reasons, that are difficult to address even by <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies,</b> let alone STI policies, can also be seen as obstacles to induce R&D investments. The large chunk of BERD (around 70 %) is performed by foreign-owned firms, and their RTDI activities are largely determined by their parents’ strategies, while domestic STI policies can only play a relatively minor role. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{considerable}} progress in integrating environmental concerns {{into the mainstream of}} development <b>policy</b> and planning. <b>Economic</b> instruments designed explicitly for environmental purposes may help to achieve cost-effective solutions, and generate public revenues. Macroeconomic and sectoral policies may impact heavily upon the environment, and there is much scope for policy reforms that are justified in both economic and environmental terms. Progress in this area has been much more rapid than in the case of health objectives, even though the rationale for environmental improvement is often ultimately related to human health and well-being. It is proposed that lessons from recent experience in the use of <b>economic</b> instruments and <b>policies</b> to achieve environmental objectives are highly relevant for the health sector, which should seek and encourage support for measures that requires consumer and producers of environmentally degrading products to pay for the economic and social costs of the damage resulting from their use. Policy reform at the macroeconomic or sectoral level may yield cost-effective solutions to some health problems, and may even bring about improvements in health status that involve no net cost at all.

And lack of cooperation between the macroprudential authority and the central bank may even result in conflicting policies, hence suboptimal results. The benefits of introducing macroprudential policy tend to be sizeable when financial or housing market shocks, which affect the supply of loans, are important drivers of economic dynamics.

For a year's {{time from the}} third quarter of 2009, the required reserve ratio dropped from 17.5 % to 15.5 %. It was more than 2 years until October 2010 when the macro-economic policy changed again. From that time onwards, expansionary macro-economic policy changed to an opt-out-when-appropriate direction. Facing pressures of inflation and slowing economic growth, China again adopted a mix of proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy. Compared with the ‘more proactive fiscal policy’ in the past that aimed at cushioning the impact of the {{financial crisis}}, this time the policy was still an expansionary policy, even though it placed controls on the fiscal deficit and government debt. At the same time, a prudent monetary policy that put inflation prevention as its priority replaced the easing policy of the past.

As a result, the required reserve ratio grew from 15.5 % in 2009 to 20.5 % {{in the second quarter of}} 2011, and the interest rate for central bank bills grew from 1.5 % in July 2009 to 3.5 % in 2011 (Yao and Tan 2011).|$|R
