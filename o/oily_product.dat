30|$|The {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy {{analysis of}} the fluorescent nanocapsules and fluorescent lipid-core nanocapsules showed that the fluorescence property is maintained after the preparation of these formulations (Figure  6). The difference in the fluorescence intensity on comparing the NC-RS 100 and NC-S 100 formulations with LNC-PCL was expected since the concentration of fluorescent product in these formulations varied (approximately 3.15  mg of product 1 /mL of suspension for NC-RS 100 and NC-S 100 and approximately 1.52  mg of product 1 /mL of suspension for LNC-PCL) (Figure  6). In the undiluted/unextracted samples of the formulations, it was seen that the bathochromic (7  nm) shift for the λmax-em value in the emission spectrum of the NC-S 100 - 1 formulation {{was accompanied by a}} hyperchromic shift (52  a.u.) when compared to the NC-RS 100 - 1 formulation, which contains the same quantity of fluorescent product, probably due to protonation of the amino group of rhodamine B, as the pH of this formulation was the lowest among the formulations (3.50 [*]±[*] 0.09). As previously reported, rhodamine B has an equilibrium of isoforms, lactonic and the zwitterionic isomers [34]. The zwitterion isomer can be protonated more than once due to the presence of two amino groups [34]. A hypochromic shift was observed in the emission spectra of the undiluted/unextracted samples of the LNC-PCL- 1 (114  a.u.), NC-RS 100 - 1 (230  a.u.), and NC-S 100 - 1 (178  a.u.) formulations compared to the spectrum of the solutions containing the same quantity of the CCT/fluorescent <b>oily</b> <b>product</b> mixture in ACN [solution 1 (1.52  mg/mL) and solution 2 (3.15  mg/mL)] (Figure  6 A,B). Unsurprisingly, {{in the case of the}} samples containing the CCT/fluorescent <b>oily</b> <b>product</b> mixture (Figure  6 C,D), the results for the fluorescence intensity of the diluted/extracted samples of the formulations showed greater similarity when compared to the undiluted/unextracted samples. The previously observed hypochromic shift did not occur and a small hyperchromic shift occurred, especially for NC-RS 100 - 2 (24  a.u.) and NC-S 100 - 2 (27  a.u.). Therefore, these changes in the fluorescence intensity of the undiluted/unextracted samples are probably related to the volume fraction of particles in the dispersed phase of the formulation leading to phenomena such as the inner filter effect, where the presence of other compounds can partially absorb the emission energy, and they were not sufficiently reduced even with the use of a triangular cuvette [35, 36].|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{inactivation}} of pathogens {{has been}} studied extensively, which {{has resulted in a}} wide range of D- and z-values. Estimating the inactivation rate for a specific condition based on these reported values is difficult, since one has to select representative conditions, and data obtained exactly at the required representative conditions are generally not available. Therefore, a first step could be to globally assess a heat treatment taking into account largest effects only. Once the most important parameters are known, a more precise study of inactivation can be performed. Therefore, in this study a large quantity of D-values (n = 4066) was collected from literature for various pathogens and linear regression was applied to obtain average D-values (together with the 95 % upper prediction level) and z-values. When comparing these overall data, it can be seen that most factors reported to have an effect on the D-value are smaller than the variability of all published D-values. Even effects of shoulders disappear in the overall analysis. Only a limited number of factors that did have a significant effect (p < 0. 05) on the D-value were identified: for Salmonella spp., the presence of chocolate ingredients gave protection to the cells, for Listeria monocytogenes the presence of 10 % salt (or aw < 0. 92) resulted in a higher heat resistance, for Bacillus cereus there were significant differences for various strains and in <b>oily</b> <b>products</b> and for Clostridium botulinum there were significant differences in heat resistance between different types of C. botulinum.

40|$|Soil {{contamination}} with <b>oily</b> <b>products</b> poses great {{healthy and}} environmental {{risks to the}} polluted sites. The remediation difficulty mainly comes from the complexity of hydrocarbons. Different kinds of remediation technologies have been applied for hydrocarbon removal from soil. New technologies especially in situ bioremediation technologies are emerging constantly. Soil assessment is a key step in the remediation processes since it provides information about the contamination level and potential risks. In the present study, hydrocarbon contaminated soil samples were collected from two sites (one site was contaminated by weathered oily sludge waste with some vegetated plots; the other was contaminated with fuel oil with short-chain hydrocarbons). The samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties and hydrocarbon degraders were enumerated. Four degrading strains were isolated from the samples and their 16 S rRNA genes were sequenced. The samples and isolates were investigated to check the existence of three catabolic genes involved in petroleum degradation. The objective was to reveal the intrinsic bioremediation potential of contaminated soils by investigating the key remediation “players” i. e. the degrader microorganisms and catabolic genes. The coexistence of abundant degraders and diverse catabolic genes give the soil a good potential for bioremediation. In addition, the relationships between degrader counts, genes detection and soil contamination levels can reveal how the contaminants affect the indigenous microbial community. The differences between vegetated and nonvegetated plots can also suggest if vegetation with legumes has good potential for hydrocarbon bioremediation. According to the results, both sites were moderately contaminated with different hydrocarbon composition. In the landfarming site, the TPH depletion in vegetated fields was higher than the unvegetated bulk soil areas. However, the degrading microorganism counts had {{no significant differences between}} vegetated and nonvegetated plots. The hydrocarbon contamination level had no correlation with the degrader counts. In subsurface soils where aeration was quite limited, degrading microorganisms were much lower than those in surface soils. Catabolic genes were detected from the isolated strains but rarely from the contaminated soil samples. The contaminants co-extracted with soil DNA may inhibit the PCR-based gene detection. With more primer sets or primers targeting broader genetic diversity ranges, more detection results can be expected...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAgricultural {{and food}} {{processing}} wastes {{are one of}} the most abundant resources of biomass worldwide. For instance in 2010, it was estimated that 89 Mt of food waste were generated in the EU- 27. Unlike other traditional biomasses, such as wood, these wastes usually contain more than 50 wt. % water. In comparison with thermochemical processes such as incineration or pyrolysis, Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) does not require the costly preliminary step of drying the biomass: water is a solvent and a reactant for this process. It is therefore possible to economically treat wet wastes. HTL typically generates 4 phases: an <b>oily</b> <b>product</b> known as 'bio-oil', an aqueous phase containing dissolved organics, a solid residue and a gaseous phase. In this study, several agricultural products were tested, including fruit residues and potato starch. All of the feedstocks were subjected to a detailed chemical analysis. These residues were then exposed to subcritical water in a batch autoclave. Operating conditions were 280 - 350 °C, 8. 5 - 20 MPa, and a reaction time between 15 and 60 min. For each experiment, the aqueous, solid and oily fractions were analysed. This paper focuses on the carbon distribution in the different phases recovered, and the organic compounds contained in the aqueous phase, as regards to the operating conditions. Raw resources are mainly acidic (3 < pH < 5), and initial pH values were modified by addition of NaOH or Na 2 CO 3. The results show that increasing the initial pH of the feed has a significant influence on the fraction of organic carbon remaining in the aqueous phase: it increases from 10 % at pH = 4, to 35 % at pH = 12. 5. The nature of the biomass is also important: for example, more organic carbon is transferred from grape to the aqueous phase, compared to starch. This paper mainly consists in exploratory runs: further studies should focus on model compounds, in order to unveil the mechanisms leading to the products. Especially, the knowledge on the dependency to acidity of the aqueous phase will allow us to optimize the liquefaction process, and the role of alkali catalysts would be clarified...|$|E

Both {{compounds}} {{were easily}} obtained in using an aromatic iodination reaction with molecular iodine. The desired products were isolated in nearly quantitative yields after a simple extraction. The crude materials are pure according to NMR. ### Introduction 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dialkylanilines are useful {{building blocks for}} chemical synthesis as highlighted in several recent publications describing diversified applications: medicinal chemistry (1, 2, 3), materials (4) and ligand design for catalysis (5). These synthons are usually obtained by aromatic iodination of commercial 4, 6 -diiodoanilines. Most protocols imply the use of iodine monochloride, a hazardous fuming liquid (1, 4, 5), sophisticated reagents (benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate (3, 6), [K(18 -crown- 6) ](ICl 2) (7) or molecular iodine {{in combination with other}} reagents (Ag 2 SO 4 (8) or iodic acid 2). However, almost 50 years ago, the first publication describing the aromatic iodination of 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (9) implied a much simpler procedure using molecular iodine, which is also less hazardous than ICl. However, the isolation of the desired was reported only in moderate yield after a lengthy steam–distillation. While repeating this experiment we discovered that the crude material quantitatively recovered prior to distillation was analytically pure and could be used for further reactions. This simple protocol was simply scaled up to about 100 g of 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dimethylaniline and 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline. ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ### Reagents 1. 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (liquid) - 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline (liquid) - molecular diiodine (solid) - diethyl ether - saturated aqueous sodium carbonate - saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate - CDCl 3 for NMR sample preparation ### Equipment 1. balance - fume hood - 2 L two-necked round-bottomed flask - funnel - 2 L separation funnel - 1 L or 2 L round-bottomed evaporation flask - 100 mL dropping funnel - mechanical stirrer - rotary evaporator - high vacuum pump - large crystallising dish - NMR spectrometer and tubes for NMR characterisation ### Procedure **Synthesis of 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -diisopropylaniline** 1.

40|$|Das globale Ziel der vorliegenden Dissertation ist es, eine Aussage über den grundlegenden Mechanismus zu treffen, der für die technische Undurchführbarkeit der inversen mizellengestützten Ultrafiltration (inverse MEUF) verantwortlich ist. Die Studie fokussiert auf den Wechselwirkungen zwischen Membran und den nicht-ionischen Tensiden (am Beispiel von Nonylphenol {{ethoxylate}} NP 5) entweder in Wasser oder in 1 -Dodecen für zwei Konzentrationsbereiche: Unterhalb und oberhalb der kritischen Mizellbildungskonzentration (cmc). Aus Mangel an Literatur über inverse MEUF wurde eine Voruntersuchung zur Eignung des Membranverfahrens im ersten Teil der Studie durchgeführt. Dies gilt als erster Schritt einer Prozessauslegung. Das Ergebnis zeigt, dass kaum Rhodium durch inverse MEUF zurückgehalten wird, wobei hoher Rückhalt durch traditionelle MEUF technisch machbar ist. Änderungen an Fluss und Rückhaltevermögen wurden mittels zwei Modellen analysiert: (i) Hermias Blockungsmodelle; (ii) Zhu und Gus Adsorptionsmodelle. Dabei wurden als Grundlage der Forschungsarbeit unterschiedliche Membranen mit einer Ausschlussgrenze oder Cut-off (MWCO) von 10 - 30 kDa in wässrigen sowie organischen Lösungen systematisch eingesetzt. Um den Grund für die Permeabilitätsabnahme in Abhängigkeit der Tensidkonzentration herauszufinden, wurden im zweiten Teil der Studie zwei Versuchsgruppen gebildet: (i) UF von NP 5 / 1 -Dodecen und NP 5 /H 2 O; (ii) Membranspülung mit dem jeweiligen Reinstlösungsmittel. Die Auswertung der Fluss-Daten mittels Hermias Modellen wies drauf hin, dass der verantwortliche Mechanismus nicht aus einer mechanischen Membranverblockung stammt. Als Ergebnis liefert die vorliegende Studie, welche als allererste Studie in der Membranforschung die Modelle von Zhu und Gu anwendet, den Nachweis über die Tensidadsorption als ein für die Fluss-Abnahme entscheidender Mechanismus. Darüber hinaus wurden hierbei unterschiedliche Faktoren wie die Hydrophilie, die Porengröße, sowie die Porengrößenverteilung jeweiliger Membranoberfläche betrachtet. Adsorption in Kapillaren oder an der Oberfläche von der Membran hat einen negativen Einfluss auf den Rückhalt von inversen Mizellen. Die Bildung von inversen Mizellen in einem unpolaren organischen Lösungsmittel wird durch die Adsorption verhindert, selbst wenn die Tensidkonzentration im Feed weiter zunimmt. Bei der Adsorptionssättigung nehmen die Tenside, die in der Überschussmenge in der Bulklösung verbleiben, nicht an dem Adsorptionsvorgang teil. Diese Moleküle diffundieren an die Membrankapillaren. Aus diesem Grund, erweist sich die inverse MEUF, welche herkömmlich als ein effizientes Trennverfahren zum Katalysatorrecycling in der Hydroformulation von 1 -Dodecen erwartet wurde, als technisch ungeeignet. The global aim of {{this thesis}} is to deliver the responsible mechanism for the technical infeasibility of the reverse micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration (reverse MEUF). The flux-reducing mechanism may be a cake layer formation, blocking the membrane pores or molecular interactions between surfactants and membrane surface. This thesis focuses on interactions between membrane and the non-ionic surfactants (nonylphenol ethoxylate NP 5) either in a non-polar organic (1 -dodecene) or in aqueous (water) solvent during the ultrafiltration (UF) at surfactant concentrations below and above the critical micelle concentration (cmc). In the surfactant-based hydroformylation of 1 -dodecene, reverse MEUF {{seems to be an}} attractive concept to recycle catalysts from any product stream as reverse micellar solutions. Owing to a lack of literature on reverse MEUF, this preliminary investigation is an essential step and fundamental for the beginning of the process design. Consequently, reverse MEUF was proven as unsuitable concept for catalyst recovery from the <b>oily</b> <b>product</b> phase of the hydroformylation of 1 -dodecene. Change in flux and retention were investigated by applying two models: (i) Hermia’s blocking models; (ii) Zhu and Gu’s adsorption models. Fundamental research revolves around contrasting MEUF and reverse MEUF using various membranes in aqueous and organic solutions. Above the cmc, surfactants aggregate into “normal” micelles in water or “reverse” micelles in oil. Catalysts embedded in micelles can be recovered by using UF-membranes with a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 10 - 30 kDa. Finding the responsible effect for the differing results of both MEUF types is a great motivation for the research in the next part of this study. To explain the changes in the permeability regarding to surfactant concentrations, the second stage of the study is divided into two parts: (i) UF of binary mixtures, i. e. surfactant/ 1 -dodecene or surfactant/water; (ii) rinsing membranes by filtration with the same pure solvent. As result, the study points out that the flux-reducing mechanism observed in this work is not caused by a mechanical membrane blocking. In the research field of membrane filtration, this work applies Zhu and Gu’s adsorption models for the first time, to the best knowledge of the author, to explain the adsorption mechanism of surfactants from oil, as well as from water onto UF-membranes. Additionally, different impacts such as the surface hydrophilicity, pore size and pore size distribution of membranes are observed with the help of Zhu and Gu’s models, which become to be an interesting tool for membrane screening suggested in this study. Adsorption in membrane capillaries or at membrane surface has a negative impact on the retention of reverse micelles. The formation of reverse micelles in a non-polar solvent is inhibited, even though the surfactant concentration of feed is increased. When adsorption reaches its saturation, the surfactants remaining in the bulk solution do not participate in the adsorption onto membrane. These molecules pass through the membrane capillaries. For this reason, reverse MEUF, which was originally expected to work successfully as a recycling process of the hydroformylation of 1 -dodecene, is proven to be technically infeasible...|$|E
40|$|Pyrolysis seems a {{promising}} route for recycling of heterogeneous, contaminated and additives containing plastics from waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE). This study {{deals with the}} thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of a synthetic mixture containing real waste plastics, representative of polymers contained in small WEEE. Two zeolite-based catalysts were used at 400 °C: HUSY and HZSM- 5 with a high silica content, while three different temperatures were adopted for the thermal cracking: 400, 600 and 800 °C. The mass balance showed that the oil produced by pyrolysis is always the main product regardless the process conditions selected, with yields ranging from 83 % to 93 %. A higher yield was obtained when pyrolysis was carried out with HZSM- 5 at 400 °C and without catalysts, but at 600 and 800 °C. Formation of a significant amount of solid residue (about 13 %) is observed using HUSY. The <b>oily</b> liquid <b>product</b> of pyrolysis, analysed by GC–MS and GC-FID, as well as by elemental analysis and for energy content, appeared lighter, less viscous and with a higher concentration of monoaromatics under catalytic condition, if compared to the liquid product derived from thermal degradation at the same temperature. HZSM- 5 led to the production of a high yield of styrene (17. 5 %), while HUSY favoured the formation of ethylbenzene (15 %). Energy released by combustion of the oil was around 39 MJ/kg, thus suggesting the possibility to exploit it as a fuel, if the recovery of chemical compounds could not be realised. Elemental and proximate analysis of char and GC-TCD analysis of the gas were also performed. Finally, it was estimated to what extent these two products, showing a relevant ability to release energy, could fulfil the energy demand requested in pyrolysis...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to observe the {{relationship}} between the objective and subjective measurement of household food security status in North Luwu in Indonesia. The objective measurement is done by means of the composite Dietary Diversity Score (DDS_) consisted of nine food groups, while the subjective measurement is done using the Subjective Food Security Score (SFSS). Specifically, this study estimated the probability of household for being more food secure due to their dietary diversity status and the composing food groups. For this study, the DDS_ consist of nine groups: grain, tuber, animal product, oil and fat, oily seeds, nuts, sweets, fruits and vegetables, and others. Furthermore, the SFSS has five category of household food security in this measurement: insecure, somewhat insecure, somewhat secure, secure, and highly secure. The descriptive analysis shows that in all DDS_ level the perceived food secure category always have the highest percentage. The household head largely regard that their household are in food secure level even thought they only consume two or three kinds of food groups. Another finding is that keeping the tuber food group, in this case sago starch, available in household will make household heads felt more food secure. From the regression estimation, the DDS_ as a composite score of the availability of food groups in a household is found significantly have potency to improve the perceived food security status of the household. Furthermore, among the food groups composing the DDS_, the existence of tuber, animal <b>products,</b> <b>oily</b> seed, nuts, as well as fruit and vegetables food groups are likely to increase the probability of a household’s SFSS being in a better food security category, whereas the sweets food group give a reverse effect...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{complexes}} of Cu(I/II) and Pd(II) with N,S and N,O ligands. Main focus {{of the study was}} the residual MCl (CuCl, CuCl 2 CoCl 2, ZnCl 2 and PdCl 2) functionality in final products. In some cases the reactions did not afforded the desired products and in most of the reactions the desired target was achived. The reactions were validated by repeating and using other metals in some cases such as Co(II), Zn(II) and Ni(II). Three principle series of ligands (O,N- and S,N-donor) were designed and synthesized and their reactions with salts containing metals like Cu and Pd were carried out under different reaction conditions. The ligands with O,N donor sites derived from pyridine- 2, 6 -carbonyldichloride. Derivatization of 2, 6 -Pyridinedicarbonyl dichloride, thiophene- 2, 5 -dicarbonyl dichloride and phenyl(chloro) dithiofarmate was carried out by treating them with pyrazole (1, 4, 7), 3 methylpyrazole (2, 5, 8) and 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazole (3, 6, 9). These reactions led to the desired products as a result of HCl elimination in the presence of catalytic amount of trimethylamine at room temperature. The aminopyridinato ligand (12) was synthesized by treating the Grignard reagent derived from 2 -bromo- 6 -(2, 6 -dimethylphenyl) pyridine formed in situ, with 2, 6 dibromopyridine in the presence of [NiBr 2 (DME) ] (DME = 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane) and tricyclohexylphosphane (1 : 2 ratio). The reaction led to the corresponding monoarylated bromopyridines. The bromopyridine derivative undergos Pd-catalysed aryl amination (Buchwald?Hartwig amination) with 2, 6 -diisopropylaniline give rise to the expected compound 12. The compounds 1 - 3 and 7 - 9 were colorless solid crystalline material and their structures were determined with the help of X-ray diffraction while compounds 4 - 6 were obtained in liquid state. The solid state structures reveal that short range intermolecular interactions afford 1 D (1, 8) and 2 D (2, 3) supra-molecular chains, respectively. All novel compounds were also characterized with the help of Elemental analysis and NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy. The solution state structures were compared with solid state structures. The pyrazolyl drivitives of Pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarbonyl dichloride upon treating with Cu(CH 3 COO) 2. H 2 O in aqueous medium give complexes 13 - 15 due to the in situ dissociation of 13. The resultant complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and single crystal XRD. The set of data obtained for these complexes showed that MOFs were afforded (13 and 14) while mononuclear heterolyptic complex (15) as a result of in situ dissociation of the corresponding ligand was obtained. Precursors 4 - 6 were <b>oily</b> <b>products</b> and were characterized with the help of 1 H- and 13 CNMR spectroscopy. These ligands were soluble in common organic solvents. They were further treated with CuCl salt to give complexes 16 and 17, the structure of these complexes were confirmed with the help of X-ray diffraction and elemental analysis. These compounds give bimetalic crystalline copper complexes, 16 and 17 with monoclinic and triclinic geometry, respectively. Ligands 4 - 6 were treated with PdCl 2 salt in acetonitrile and complexes 18 - 20 with PdCl 2 residual functionalities were formed in essentially quantitative yield. The ligands were found to be N,S-bidentate linkers and 5 -membered copper and palladacycles were obtained. Reaction of ligand 4 with Ni(II) salt suffers from in situ dissociation of the ligand followed by rearrangement into monoanionic ligand. The rearranged ligand is attached to metal centre in the ratio 2 : 1 (ligand:metal) and metallacycle 21 was afforded. Due to partial solubility of Pd and Ni complexes, complete set of NMR could not be collected, 18 (1 H and 13 C), 19, 20, 21 b (1 H). While single crystal analysis of complexe 18, 19 and 21 was carried out. The results reveal that compound 18 bears triclinic geometry while compounds 19 and 20 are monoclinic. The aminopyridinato ligand 12 was used for the synthesis of complex 22 containing CuCu bond and mononuclear cobalt complex 23. Complexes 22 and 23 were completely characterized with the help of NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and single crystal analysis. The results thus revealed that Cu-Cu bond exists in the corresponding binuclear complex having a separation of 2. 450 Å. When CoCl 2 was treated with aminopyridinato ligand {{in the same way as}} complex 22, the resultant complex was a homolyptic rather than bimetallic containing Co-Co bond. The reactivity of Cu-Cu bond with group 15, 16 and 17 elements amazingly gave no results, and showed tremendous stability. Complexes of M(II) with 3 -methylpyrazole as ligand were prepared at ambient temperature using MCl 2 salts (M = Cu, Co, Pd and Zn). All reactions were straight forward and no appreciable amount of side products was detected. X-ray structures were determined for all the complexes. The structures reveal that 28 and 29 possess Octahedral geometry, while 22 and 23 are square planar and tetrahedral, respectively. The synthesized compounds 28 - 31 have the MCl 2 fragment, thus making the synthesized compounds attractive synthons for further transformations. The cyclic voltammetric investigations indicate the involvement of proton during electron transfer reactions of these complexes. The cyclic voltammograms of the synthesized complexes were obtained and the voltammetric signatures of 28, 29, and 31 showed a single irreversible pHdependent cathodic peak, while 30 gives two reversible cathodic peaks. Involvement of protons accompanying the electron transfer processes was ascertained from differential pulse voltammetric results, indicating peak potential shift as a function of pH. From the results it can be concluded that 15, 28, 29 and 31 show irreversible cathodic peaks so these complexes may be used as good anticancer agents. The ligands 1 - 3 and their complexes were tested against different strains of bacteria as antibacterial agents. The results reveal that ligands possess good inhibition activities compared to their respective complexes. While complex 15 was studied as representative example for DNA bonding potency using Cyclic Voltametric technique. The complexes 16 - 20 were also tested for their catalytic activity in Suzuki-coupling reactions, the complexes having palladium as central metal atoms show some how high catalytic activities as compared with other complexes. The activity is too low which hinders further studies and use of these complexes for commercial purpose...|$|R
