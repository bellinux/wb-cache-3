50|$|A study {{published}} in Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica in 2006 showed that the Lea Symbols 15-line folding distance chart is clinically useful in detecting deficiencies in visual acuity in preschool children. The study, which compared visual acuity diagnoses from Lea symbols tests to those obtained via <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examination,</b> revealed that the Lea symbols chart provided an accurate and sufficient assessment in 95.9% of the 149 preschool-age children tested. This suggests that Lea tests can be used confidently {{as an alternative to}} more costly and time-consuming pediatric tests of visual acuity.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} sickle cell disease retinopathy in children and teenagers from Bahia, the state in northeastern Brazil with the highest incidence and prevalence of sickle cell disease. Methods: A group of 51 sickle cell disease patients (36 hemoglobin SS and 15 hemoglobin SC) with ages ranging from 4 to 18 years was studied. <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> were performed in all patients. Moreover, a fluorescein angiography was also performed in over 10 -year-old patients. Results: The most common ocular lesions were vascular tortuosity, which was found in nine (25 %) hemoglobin SS patients, and black sunburst, in three (20 %) hemoglobin SC patients. Peripheral arterial closure was observed in five (13. 9 %) hemoglobin SS patients and in three (13. 3 %) hemoglobin SC patients.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the risk of development of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ocular manifestations in domino liver recipients. Forty-four cirrhotic patients submitted to liver transplantation were studied, with an average of 6  years of follow up after the procedure. Twenty two patients had received a liver from a FAP donor (Group 1) and 22 had received a liver from a non-FAP cadaveric donor (Group 2). Both groups were similar for mean age and gender. Routine <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> with particular attention to amyloid deposition in the anterior segment and vitreous, peripheral retina state, lacrimal functions tests (Schirmer and tear break-up time) and pupillometry (dynamic and static) were performed.

40|$|Objective: In this study, we {{aimed to}} assess the {{presence}} of minor complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) referred to electroneurography (ENG) laboratory for evaluation of neuropathy. In addition, the relationship between duration of disease, electrophysiologic findings, neurological examination findings, plasma glycated hemoglobin A 1 C levels, glucose levels and microvascular complications were examined. Materials and Methods: One hundred seventy patients with type 2 diabetes were included. Age, gender, duration of disease, results of <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations,</b> neuropathic complaints, electrophysiological examination results, neurological examination findings and laboratory examination results including blood glucose and A 1 C levels, presence of albuminuria were recorded retrospectively. Results: Abnormal ENG findings were found in one hundred forty patients (82. 4 %). In all patients, the rate of retinopathy was 34. 1 % {{and the rate of}} albuminuria was 19. 4 %. The rate of polyneuropathy (PNP(was 78. 2 % in patients with abnormal neurologic examination. Neuropathic complaints and PNP were found to be related with the presence of retinopathy. The rate of retinopathy was higher in patients with albuminuria. Significant relationship was found between disease duration and retinopathy, PNP and neuropathic complaints. Conclusions: This study emphasizes that detailed history, neurological and <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> are easy, cost-effective and reliable examinations in follow-up of type 2 diabetics.

A gold standard was established in all children by two orthoptic examinations in kindergarten. If there were missing, abnormal, or inconsistent findings, children were referred for <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examination.</b> If, by the <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examination,</b> a new case of amblyopia requiring treatment was diagnosed, the gold standard was set "positive.

Screening sensitivity was 0. 80, specificity 0. 58, accuracy 0. 58, and the likelihood ratio 1. 89.  CONCLUSION—Non-cycloplegic refractive screening with the Retinomax led to many false positive referrals due to instrument myopia and "inconclusive" results.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} a causative mutation in a three-generation family with autosomal dominant congenital total cataract and dissect the molecular {{consequence of the}} identified mutation. METHODS: Clinical and <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> were performed on the affected and unaffected family members. Mutation were screened in recruited family members by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the two reported genes (CRYAA and GJA 8) which were linked to human total cataracts and direct sequencing of the PCR product. The molecular consequences of the identified mutation was dissected. The plasmids carrying wild-type and mutant mouse ORF of Gja 8, coding for connexin 50 (Cx 50), were generated and ectopic expressed in 293 cells. Recombinant protein expression and cellular localization of recombinated Cx 50 were assessed by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Clinical and <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> were performed on the affected and unaffected family members. Mutation were screened in recruited family members by PCR of the two reported genes (CRYAA and GJA 8) which were linked to human total cataracts and direct sequencing of the PCR product.

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS, trisomy 21) is {{the most}} common chromosomal disorder and the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability in humans. In DS, triplication of chromosome 21 invariably includes the APP gene (21 q 21) encoding the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) amyloid precursor protein (APP). Triplication of the APP gene accelerates APP expression leading to cerebral accumulation of APP-derived amyloid-b peptides (Ab), early-onset AD neuropathology, and age-dependent cognitive sequelae. The DS phenotype complex also includes distinctive early-onset cerulean cataracts of unknown etiology. Previously, we reported increased Ab accumulation, co-localizing amyloid pathology, and disease-linked supranuclear cataracts in the ocular lenses of subjects with AD. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that related AD-linked Ab pathology underlies the distinctive lens phenotype associated with DS. <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> of DS subjects were correlate...|$|R
