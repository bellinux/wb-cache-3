5000|$|Makapaar has an Islamic {{military}} leadership which is well-known to MILF Commanders and elements. He {{claims that he}} was trained (in guerrilla tactics) in Afghanistan by Osama bin Laden in 1981. He believes himself to be an exemplary model of warfare. In 2000, he created a small outpost <b>over-advance</b> to the parameter of the Camp John Mack's checkpoint in barangay, Inudaran, Kauswagan and declared {{it to be a}} temporary Headquarters of 303rd Brigade (Camp John Mack), BIAF-MILF. He led his Field Commanders in several battles in Linamon, Bacolod, Kauswagan and Maigo towns in Lanao del Norte at the time when former President Joseph Estrada declared all-out-war against the MILF on March 21, 2000. He led several enormous battles in the provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao, and also led in defending the MILF main camp of Camp Abubakar in Maguindanao. He stated to his Field Commanders about the [...] "Battles, and {{it is one of the}} standard to the Soldier of Islam, however the cost figure is the damage [...] "Bullet" [...] spending war made by the government forces which can derive deficit of the Republic of the Philippine".|$|E
40|$|Copyright Â© 2005 SAE International Simultaneous {{reduction}} of nitric oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions {{is possible in}} a diesel engine by employing a Partially Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) strategy. PPCI combustion is attainable with advanced injection timings and heavy exhaust gas recirculation rates. However, <b>over-advanced</b> injection timing can result in the fuel spray missing the combustion bowl, thus dramatically elevating PM emissions. The present study investigates whether the use of narrow spray cone angle injector nozzles can extend the limits of early injection timings, allowing for PPCI combustion realization. It is shown that a low flow rate, 60 -degree spray cone angle injector nozzle, along with optimized EGR rate and split injection strategy, can reduce engine-out NOx by 82 % and PM by 39 %, {{at the expense of}} a modest increase (4. 5 %) in fuel consumption. This PPCI strategy has the potential for meeting upcoming stringent fuel specific NOx emission levels of less than 1 g/kg-fuel and fuel specific PM levels less than 0. 25 g/kg-fuel...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the anatomic relation between the posterolateral drill hole and the lateral structures of the knee. The length of the posterolateral tunnel and the feasibility of the EndoButton CL (Smith & Nephew, Andover, MA) as posterolateral graft fixation device was also evaluated. Methods: An anatomic descriptive study was performed on 24 cadaveric knees. The double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was reconstructed using standard arthroscopic techniques and the EndoButton CL fixation system. The study protocol was as follows: first, an arthroscopy with posterolateral pin placement and drilling of the posterolateral tunnel was performed. Subsequently, the lateral structures were dissected and the distance between the pin and the different anatomic structures was measured. From outside in, the length of the posterolateral tunnel was also measured. Results: This study shows that there is no increased risk of injuring the lateral collateral ligament during posterolateral tunnel placement in double-bundle ACL reconstruction, when performed through a low anteromedial portal in high flexion. Furthermore, a safe margin was noted between the posterolateral tunnel and the adjacent lateral gastrocnemius and popliteus tendons. The length of the posterolateral tunnel was between 32 and 44 mm (mean, 36. 92 mm). Conclusions: We conclude that the posterolateral tunnel can be created safely in double-bundle ACL reconstruction without additional risk to the surrounding structures. A 15 -mm EndoButton CL fixation device is routinely advised as posterolateral graft fixation in order to avoid the risk of <b>over-advancing</b> the device or overdrilling. Clinical Relevance: This study has shown that there is no risk of iatrogenic lesion to the lateral collateral ligament, lateral gastrocnemius tendon, or popliteus tendon with a posterolateral tunnel drilled through a low anteromedial portal in high flexion. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} past, the Diesel engine has been {{improved}} considerably {{in the areas}} of performance, fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions. In Europe, these improvements have resulted in a strong increase in the sales of passenger cars equipped with a Diesel engine. Since the emission of the green house gas CO 2 is directly linked to engine efficiency, the Diesel engine is also attractive from an environmental point of view. However, despite the emission reductions achieved by improvements to the combustion process, the stringent emission legislations of the near future will be difficult to meet without exhaust gas after-treatment systems. Disadvantages of after-treatment systems are the considerable cost as well as durability and servicing issues, which is a motivation to continue studying possibilities to reduce the engine-out emissions. This thesis discusses an experimental study of some of these possibilities, including modifications to conventional Diesel combustion and Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI). An experimental high speed DI Common Rail engine was used in all of the experiments. The effects of post injection and swirl ratio on emission formation have been studied by optical diagnostics of the combustion process. Processing the obtained data with the two- colour pyrometry method provided temporally resolved soot concentration and flame temperature data, which proved to be beneficial in answering the raised questions. Adding a third, post-injection after the main injection showed significant reductions of soot emissions with only minor changes of NOx emissions and fuel consumption. The reason {{is believed to be the}} increased turbulence caused by the extra injection and to some extent the increased flame temperature during the second half of the combustion process, both of which contribute positively to the soot oxidation rate. Increasing the swirl ratio of the intake charge also showed significant reductions of soot emissions. Similar to post injection, the increased turbulence increased the soot oxidation rate late in the combustion process. HCCI combustion is known for its potential to significantly reduce NOx and soot emissions. The experiments involving HCCI combustion of conventional Diesel fuel were focussed on investigating the modifications to the engine hardware and the injection strategy that are necessary for operation in HCCI mode. A major difficulty of HCCI operation with Diesel fuel was found to be preventing <b>over-advanced</b> ignition and excessive combustion rates. The compression ratio was therefore reduced to delay ignition and high loads of EGR were used to further delay ignition and to reduce the combustion rate. Fuel was injected during the compression stroke in five subsequent short duration injections, so that a homogeneous mixture was created before start of combustion. Initially, compression ratios of 11. 5 and 13. 4 were used, while later in the development, the compression ratio was raised to 15. The higher compression ratio was used in combination with retarded intake valve closing timing, which reduced the effective compression ratio. Both NOx and soot emissions were reduced to near-zero levels, while the HC and CO emissions increased significantly. The increase in HC and CO emissions reduced the combustion efficiency, which was the main cause of the significant increase of fuel consumption. With the use of more accurate piezo injector and with modifications to the injection strategy, HC and CO emissions as well as fuel consumption could be reduced significantly, while maintaining low NOx and soot emission levels for most operating loads of up to 0. 5 MPa IMEP...|$|R
