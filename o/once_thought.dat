5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than <b>once</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the past, astronomers <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> {{the rings}} formed {{alongside}} the planet when it formed {{billions of years}} ago. Instead, the age of these planetary rings is probably some {{hundreds of millions of}} years.|$|E
5|$|Although it was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> to be {{a simple}} {{solution}} of molecules, the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include concentration gradients of small molecules such as calcium, large complexes of enzymes that act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and carboxysomes that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.|$|E

5|$|Among {{women living}} closely together, it was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> that the onsets of {{menstruation}} tend to synchronize. This effect was first described in 1971, and possibly {{explained by the}} action of pheromones in 1998. Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> innocuous; in 1931 it was {{suggested}} as being suitable {{for use as a}} vehicle or solvent for injectable pharmaceutical preparations. Numerous cases of poisoning have been reported since then, and it {{has been shown to be}} toxic to humans.|$|E
5|$|The Anthology of Pliny's Natural History is an {{epitome of}} Pliny the Elder's Natural History {{dedicated}} to King Henry II of England. It is of some {{importance in the}} transmission of Pliny's ideas to medieval Europe, {{although it has been}} shown to be less important as a witness to Pliny's text than <b>once</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a large {{quantity}} of unissued Morgan dollars {{was discovered in}} the Treasury vaults, including issues <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value, and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{excavate}} allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap, {{an important source}} of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) feed in this fashion, but the technique is not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn woodpecker and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. It was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{is used as}} a mascot {{for many}} kinds of products, {{especially}} in Mauritius. It appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Mauritius, {{is used as a}} watermark on all Mauritian rupee banknotes, and features as the background of the Mauritian immigration form. A smiling dodo is the symbol of the Brasseries de Bourbon, a popular brewer on Réunion, whose emblem displays the white species <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> to have lived there.|$|E
5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as <b>once</b> <b>thought.</b> Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E

5|$|There is {{one large}} beach {{on the eastern}} side of the isle where the only {{settlement}} of note (‘The Village’) was located and a tiny cove at Skipsdale (Old Norse: ship valley). Bagh na h-Aioneig (Scots Gaelic: bay of the steep promontory) on the western side is a deep cleft in the sea-cliffs <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> to be the highest in the UK which rise to 213m (699ft) above sea level at Builacraig.|$|E
5|$|Unburnt bone can be tested; it is usual to date {{it using}} collagen, the protein {{fraction}} that remains after washing away the bone's structural material. Hydroxyproline, {{one of the}} constituent amino acids in bone, was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> to be a reliable indicator as it was not known to occur except in bone, but it has since been detected in groundwater.|$|E
5|$|While long {{thought to}} have been aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids were not as well-suited for {{swimming}} as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> to have been unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and the tail was also not useful for propulsion because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail from side to side.|$|E

5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
5|$|A coda {{is a short}} {{pattern of}} 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> {{to be a way}} by which {{individuals}} identified themselves, but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals. However, each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks can be used to identify individuals. Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects. Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas. In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas, it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|E
