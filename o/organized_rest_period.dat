50|$|A regular weekly <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> is {{a period}} of at least 45 {{consecutive}} hours. An actual working week starts {{at the end of a}} weekly <b>rest</b> <b>period,</b> and finishes when another weekly <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> is commenced, which may mean that weekly rest is taken in the middle of a fixed (Monday-Sunday) week. This is perfectly acceptable - the working week is not required to be aligned with the ‘fixed’ week defined in the rules, provided all the relevant limits are complied with. Alternatively, a driver can take a reduced weekly <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> of a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. If a reduction is taken, it must be compensated for by an equivalent <b>period</b> of <b>rest</b> taken in one block before the end of the third week following the week in question. The compensating rest must be attached to a <b>period</b> of <b>rest</b> of at least 9 hours - in effect either a weekly or a daily rest period.For example, where a driver reduces a weekly <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> to 33 hours in week 1, he must compensate for this by attaching a 12-hour <b>period</b> of <b>rest</b> to another <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> of at least 9 hours before the end of week 4.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of varying the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> between {{consecutive}} ambulatory bouts in community-based outcomes. Ambulation was assessed in 97 community-dwelling older adults (mean (SD) age 69. 2 (7. 7) years) using an accelerometer (activPAL™) worn on the upper thigh for 7 consecutive days. The volume, pattern and variability of ambulation were calculated over a range of maximum <b>resting</b> <b>periods</b> (1 – 30 s). Outcomes with a maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> from 1 to 6 s did not vary due to device functionality. Non-linear regression (power law, r 2 > 0. 99) showed that increasing the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> from 6 to 30 s resulted in changes in volume (increased duration spent walking, and decreased number of bouts), variability (S 2 increased) and pattern (α decreased), and a linear relationship with an increase in average bout length. With a MRP of 6 s, 6 % of the cohort achieved the public health guidelines of 150 min of ambulation/week accumulated in bouts ≥ 10 min, which increased to 40 % using a maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> of 30 s. Modifying the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> impacts on volume, pattern and variability measures of community based ambulation, and attainment of public health guidelines. This highlights the need for standardised algorithms to aid interpretation and explicit reporting of the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> to aid comparison between studies...|$|R

This could be tested at a pre-clinical stage with dynamic loading experiments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effects of <b>resting</b> <b>periods,</b> which are a considerable part of the daily activity cycle, on the migration characteristics of femoral cemented stems. Ten polished Exeter stems were implanted in composite femurs and loaded either with a continuous load or a discontinuous load. Continuous loading involved 345, 600 loading cycles at 1 Hz, whereas the discontinuous loading involved loading at 1 Hz for 2. 5 hours and a <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> of 21. 5 hours for a period of four days. Hence, a total of 36, 000 loading cycles were applied to these reconstructions. The subsidence patterns of the prostheses were considerably affected by the <b>resting</b> <b>periods.</b> The prostheses exhibited a step-wise migration pattern with migration steps of about 50 microns after every <b>resting</b> <b>period,</b> whereas the continuously loaded prostheses showed a more gradual migration pattern. The final subsidence of the specimens when loaded with <b>resting</b> <b>periods</b> was significantly less than the subsidence measured without <b>resting</b> <b>periods.</b> However, these specimens were loaded with fewer loading cycles. If this was taken into account, the discontinuously loaded specimens had a four fold higher average migration per loading cycle than the specimens that were loaded continuously.
