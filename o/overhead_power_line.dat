The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal placement of conductors.

50|$|A Wireless {{powerline}} sensor {{hangs from}} an <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>line</b> and sends measurements to a data collection system. Because the sensor does not contact {{anything but a}} single live conductor, no high-voltage isolation is needed. The sensor, installed simply by clamping it around a conductor, powers itself from energy scavenged from electrical or magnetic fields surrounding the conductor being measured. <b>Overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>line</b> monitoring helps distribution system operators provide reliable service at optimized cost.|$|E

Magnetic-field strengths at the birth addresses due to the load currents of <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> were calculated on the basis of line-network maps and load records.
