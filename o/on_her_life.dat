A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains {{that as he}} {{could not afford to}} let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored.

Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E
