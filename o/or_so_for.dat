25|$|The {{problem with}} long-run time series for price {{aggregates}} is, {{that they often}} disregard many qualitative changes in the components of those aggregates, or, {{it is assumed that}} these qualitative changes have no real quantitative significance for comparative purposes. A variable is thought to stay qualitatively the same across time, when in reality it does not remain the same. Michael Perelman, for example, shows that the content and economic meaning of capital aggregates can change considerably even within one decade <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> <b>For</b> example, the changing stratification of physical capital assets in the total capital stock, in terms of their age, exerts an independent influence on the productivity and profitability of enterprises.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} {{of students in the}} school transfer from Israeli institutions focusing on post-high school full-time Judaic studies, where most have studied for multiple years. The school has a Yeshiva program, in conjunction with the associated Beis Medrash L'Talmud, for full-time Judaic studies for students who are either pre- or post-college. In accordance with school policy, all students are required to pray with the school's prayer services thrice daily. All students must also attend the morning program of Talmud studies, usually from 9:00am until 2:20pm, each Sunday through Friday, with a break for lunch (the schedule varies by day). Following afternoon prayers at 2:20pm, academic classes start, Monday through Thursday, lasting until 7:00pm <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> most students. Night Seder (evening Judaic studies) from 8pm until 10pm is also officially mandatory.|$|E
500|$|Actual {{spawning}} {{occurs when}} a collection of males gather around gravid females, and begin writhing, twisting, bumping into and slithering {{over the tops of}} females, an activity which triggers the release of eggs. [...] Males release clouds of milt to fertilize the eggs as they are released into the water column. [...] The sticky eggs then attach to submerged vegetation, and development begins. [...] It takes only a few days for the eggs to hatch into larval fish, and another ten days <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> the larval fish to detach from the vegetation and start moving about as young fry. Egg production is variable, and believed to be dependent {{on the size of the}} female. [...] A common formula used for predicting the volume of eggs a female can produce is 4.1 eggs/gram of body weight which gives an average of about 150,000 eggs per spawn. [...] The eggs of alligator gar are bright red and poisonous to humans if ingested.|$|E

Graeme Green of the Daily Express noted that Rogan [...] "concentrates far more on Van the man than it does on his music, with the singer largely portrayed as difficult, selfish and aloof". He noted that Morrison would turn 60 the year the book was published, and commented [...] "When the singer celebrates his landmark birthday this year, it's a safe bet Rogan's name won't be on the invite list." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not all white, blue-eyed foals are {{affected}} with LWS. Other genes can produce healthy pink-skinned, blue-eyed horses {{with a white}} or very light cream-colored coat.

[...] Before reliable information and the DNA test were available to breeders, perfectly healthy, white-coated, blue-eyed foals were sometimes euthanized for fear they were lethal whites, an outcome which can be avoided today with testing and a better understanding of coat color genetics or even waiting 12 hours <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> the foal to develop clinical signs. The availability of testing also allows a breeder to determine if a white-coated, blue-eyed foal that becomes ill is an LWS foal that requires euthanasia or a non-LWS foal with a simple illness that may be successfully treated.|$|E

In total Stanley would report 32 unfriendly meetings on the river, some violent, even though he attempted to negotiate a peaceful thoroughfare.

2500|$|Due {{to surface}} tension, water will rise up {{in a small}} {{capillary}} tube above a free surface of water. [...] Likewise, water will rise up above the water table into the small pore spaces around the soil particles. In fact the soil may be completely saturated for some distance above the water table. [...] Above the height of capillary saturation, the soil may be wet but the water content will decrease with elevation. If the water in the capillary zone is not moving, the water pressure obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, , but note that , is negative above the water table. Hence, hydrostatic water pressures are negative above the water table. The thickness of the zone of capillary saturation depends on the pore size, but typically, the heights vary between a centimeter <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> coarse sand to tens of meters for a silt or clay. In fact the pore space of soil is a uniform fractal e.g. a set of uniformly distributed D-dimensional fractals of average linear size L.

2500|$|Following T cell development, matured, naïve T cells {{leave the}} thymus {{and begin to}} spread {{throughout}} the body, including the lymph nodes. (Naïve T cells are those T cells {{that have never been}} exposed to the antigen that they are programmed to respond to). Like all T cells, they express the T cell receptor-CD3 complex. The T cell receptor (TCR) consists of both constant and variable regions. The variable region determines what antigen the T cell can respond to. CD4+ T cells have TCRs with an affinity for Class II MHC, and CD4 is involved in determining MHC affinity during maturation in the thymus. Class II MHC proteins are generally only found on the surface of specialised antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Specialised antigen presenting cells are primarily dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, although dendritic cells are the only cell group that expresses MHC Class II constitutively (at all times). Some APCs also bind native (or unprocessed) antigens to their surface, such as follicular dendritic cells, but unprocessed antigens do not interact with T cells and are not involved in their activation. The antigens that bind to MHC proteins are always short peptides, 8-10 amino acids long for MHC Class I, and up to 25 <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> MHC Class [...] II.|$|E
