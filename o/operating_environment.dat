5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, new {{versions}} of the Merlin (the 600- and 700-series) were designed and produced for use in commercial airliners such as the Avro Tudor, military transport aircraft such as the Avro York, and the Canadair North Star which performed in both roles.

5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare.

5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the <b>operating</b> <b>environment,</b> and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft Windows {{was first}} {{released}} in 1985, as an <b>operating</b> <b>environment</b> running {{on top of}} MS-DOS, which was the standard operating system shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the time. In 1995, Windows 95 was released which only used MS-DOS as a bootstrap. For backwards compatibility, Win9x could run real-mode MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows 3.x drivers. Windows ME, released in 2000, was the last version in the Win9x family. Later versions have all been based on the Windows NT kernel. Current client versions of Windows run on IA-32, x86-64 and 32-bit ARM microprocessors. In addition Itanium is still supported in older server version Windows Server 2008 R2. In the past, Windows NT supported additional architectures.|$|E
25|$|The first soldier ration {{established}} by a Congressional Resolution, during the Revolutionary War, consisted of {{enough food to}} feed a man for one day, mostly beef, peas, and rice. During the Civil War, the military moved toward canned goods. Later, self-contained kits were issued as a whole ration and contained canned meat, bread, coffee, sugar and salt. During the First World War, canned meats were replaced with lightweight preserved meats (salted or dried) to save weight and allow more rations to be carried by soldiers carrying their supplies on foot. At the beginning of World War II, {{a number of new}} field rations were introduced, including the Mountain ration and the Jungle ration. However, cost-cutting measures by Quartermaster Command officials during the latter part of World War II and the Korean War again saw the predominance of heavy canned C rations issued to troops, regardless of <b>operating</b> <b>environment</b> or mission. The use of canned wet rations continued through the Vietnam War, with the improved MCI field ration.|$|E
25|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} offer significant operating {{advantages over}} steam locomotives. They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives {{continue to have}} 2-man crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the <b>operating</b> <b>environment</b> is much more attractive, being much quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked in multiple with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives throughout a single train—something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered {{for use as a}} single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train still under the control of a single crew. With steam traction a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to double heading with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also {{includes}} a historical debugger for managed code called IntelliTrace. Unlike a traditional debugger that records only the currently active stack, IntelliTrace records all events, such as prior function calls, method parameters, events and exceptions. This allows the code execution to be rewound in case a breakpoint was not set where the error occurred. Debugging with IntelliTrace causes the application to run more slowly than debugging without it, and uses more memory as additional data needs to be recorded. Microsoft allows configuration of how much data should be recorded, in effect, allowing developers to balance the speed of execution and resource usage. The Lab Management component of Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 uses virtualization to create a similar execution environment for testers and developers. The virtual machines are tagged with checkpoints which can later be investigated for issues, {{as well as to}} reproduce the issue. Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 {{also includes}} the capability to record test runs that capture the specific state of the <b>operating</b> <b>environment</b> as well as the precise steps used to run the test. These steps can then be played back to reproduce issues.|$|E

30|$|Among all {{software}} reliability growth models (SRGMs), {{a large family}} of stochastic reliability models based on a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), known as NHPP reliability models, has been widely used to track reliability improvement during software testing. Many existing NHPP {{software reliability}} models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] {{have been carried out}} through the fault intensity rate function and the mean value functions m(t) within a controlled testing environment to estimate reliability metrics such as the number of residual faults, failure rate, and reliability of software. Generally, these models are applied to the software testing data and then used to make predictions on the software failures and reliability in the field. In other words, the underlying common assumption of such models is that the <b>operating</b> <b>environments</b> and the developing environment are about the same. The <b>operating</b> <b>environments</b> in the field for the software, in reality, are quite different. The randomness of the <b>operating</b> <b>environments</b> will affect the software failure and software reliability in an unpredictable way.|$|R
