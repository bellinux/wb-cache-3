2500|$|The Meteor {{was one of}} a {{group of}} mid-1950s gliders to use the NACA 6 series laminar flow airfoil first adopted by the Ross-Johnson RJ-5, which {{required}} careful attention to profile control and surface finish. [...] In plan the wings are straight tapered with unswept leading edges and forward sweep on the trailing edge. [...] The wing tips carries small, elongated bodies termed [...] "salmons" [...] to dampen tip vortices, as on the slightly earlier Bréguet Mouette and has a constant 2° of dihedral. [...] Completely metal-skinned, the wing is built around a box spar within which the thickened skin is internally stiffened with span-wise stringers. [...] The whole trailing edge carries control surfaces; the <b>outer</b> <b>quarter</b> with conventional ailerons, and the rest roughly equally divided between narrower inboard ailerons which droop together when the final inboard section of camber changing flaps are depressed through as much as 20° for low speed flight. [...] These flaps can be raised by 11°, reducing the camber for high speed flight. [...] Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes are fitted at mid-chord, just aft of the box spar at about one third span.|$|E
6000|$|During {{the whole}} pursuit {{it had been}} Nelson's practice, {{whenever}} circumstances would permit, to have his captains on board the VANGUARD, and explain to them his own ideas of the different and best modes of attack, and such plans as he proposed to execute on falling in with the enemy, whatever their situation might be. There is no possible position, it is said, {{which he did not}} take into calculation. His officers were thus fully acquainted with his principles of tactics; and such was his confidence in their abilities that the only thing determined upon, in case they should find the French at anchor, was for the ships to form as most convenient for their mutual support, and to anchor by the stern. [...] "First gain the victory," [...] he said, [...] "and then make the best use of it you can." [...] The moment he perceived the position of the French, that intuitive genius with which Nelson was endowed displayed itself; and it instantly struck him that where there was room for an enemy's ship to swing, there was room for one of ours to anchor. The plan which he intended to pursue, therefore, was to keep entirely on the outer side of the French line, and station his ships, {{as far as he was}} able, one on the outer bow, and another on the <b>outer</b> <b>quarter,</b> of each of the enemy's. This plan of doubling on the enemy's ships was projected by Lord Hood, when he designed to attack the French fleet at their anchorage in Gourjean Road. Lord Hood found it impossible to make the attempt; but the thought was not lost upon Nelson, who acknowledged himself, on this occasion, indebted for it to his old and excellent commander. Captain Berry, when he comprehended the scope of the design, exclaimed with transport, [...] "If we succeed, what will the world say?" [...] "There is no IF in the case," [...] replied the admiral: [...] "that we shall succeed is certain; who may live to tell the story is a very different question." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} once located {{on an island}} with the Aare and Little Aare (Kleine Aare) flowing around it. The old town grew up {{around the edge of}} the island with a large open plaza in the middle.

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-19 mm. The forewings are bronze-brown, irrorated with white, the basal half of {{each scale}} is white, the outer and overlapping half bronze-brown, the white irrorations are caused by the brown not entirely covering the basal white. This arrangement of scales is uniformly distributed over the wing, except on the costal margin <b>outer</b> <b>quarter</b> and outer margin, where {{on account of the}} greater length of the scales, more white is exposed and the colors are almost equal. On the outer margin the same coloration extends half way out on the cilia. The hindwings are fuscous.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the cuisine}} of modern Rome quinto quarto (literally the [...] "fifth quarter") is the offal of butchered animals. The name makes sense {{on more than}} one level: because offal amounts to about a fourth of the weight of the carcass; because the {{importance}} of offal in Roman cooking is at least as great as any of the <b>outer</b> <b>quarters,</b> fore and hind; and because in the past slaughterhouse workers were partly paid in kind with a share of the offal.|$|R

40|$|Magnesium and {{phosphorus}} are major inorganic constituents of the avian eggshell. The Mg/Ca ratio {{has been used}} as a palaeothermometer in a range of calcite biominerals. Eggshells provide the opportunity to examine the Mg/Ca ratio of a calcite biomineral produced in a constant temperature environment. Mg distribution is not constant throughout the shell, decreasing from nucleation until after fusion of the mammillary caps and then increasing to termination. This indicates that temperature of deposition is not the only factor controlling the Mg content of this biomineral system. There is a greater increase in magnesium concentration in the outer region of eggshells from older birds. The variation in magnesium concentration does not appear to correlate with organic content. Phosphorus occurs in the <b>outer</b> <b>quarter</b> of the eggshell and rises to termination and is therefore not confined to cuticular vesicles. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

2500|$|The {{railway station}} was {{completely}} rebuilt {{on the same}} site in 1880 with ten bay platforms and two arched roofs. Constructed of wrought iron, these rested at the outer sides on plain stone walls and classical corinthian style columns down the middle. Glass covered the middle half and timber (inside)/ slate (outside) covered the <b>outer</b> <b>quarters</b> of each span. The four end screens were glazed in a fan pattern with decorative timber outer edging. The dimensions were a length of , a width of [...] for each arch and a height of , track to apex. The railway station never had a formal frontage; instead, passengers entered by {{an opening in the}} northwest side.|$|R
50|$|During the 18th and 19th century, {{the town}} was flooded several times when the river or lake rose. The Jura water {{correction}} projects of 1868-91, lowered the water level and helped protect the town from floods. The Thielle/Zihl river was constrained and the numerous side channels were filled in. The Nidau Buren canal replaced the Thielle/Zihl river as the main waterway in Nidau. It was connected to Biel/Bienne by railroad in 1857 and the two towns began to grow together. A number of new developments opened as Nidau's population grew. Today the <b>outer</b> <b>quarters</b> developments of Nidau flow seamlessly into those of Biel. Industry began to settle in Nidau in 1900, though today it is mostly home to small to medium businesses in the services sector.|$|R
50|$|The station's roof is {{a single}} span wrought iron truss {{structure}} 550 ft long with a span of 210 ft, and was 90 ft high at its apex above the railtracks. Glass covered the middle section, timber (inside) and slate (outside) covered the <b>outer</b> <b>quarters.</b> The end screens were glazed with timber boarding surrounding the outer edges. It was constructed by Andrew Handyside and Co. The substructure and masonry partition were provided by Robert Neill and Sons of Manchester. Underneath the train shed is a large brick undercroft with intersecting tunnel vaults, above which were six platforms above street level which exited the station onto viaducts and bridges. The undercroft was used for storage and connected to the adjacent goods sidings by a carriage lift. The station's two-storey south wall has 15 bays separated by brick pilasters. At ground-floor level the bays have three round-headed windows and at first-floor level three square-headed. In the 20th century a glazed canopy was erected at the entrance at north end.|$|R
50|$|The program {{wraps up}} with what a trip to Mars would entail for a space crew and its vessels. Contributor/spacecraft {{designer}} Ernst Stuhlinger presents his design and details regarding a unique umbrella-shaped MarsShip: The top portion would be a revolving <b>outer</b> <b>quarters</b> ring providing artificial gravity for the crew of 20, under 'parasol' coolant tubes. At the other end would be a sodium-potassium reactor to provide power to the midsection electric/ion drive. Attached upright would be a chemically-fueled winged tail-lander. The mission shown involves six MarsShips, ultimately reaching 100000 mph, taking a 400-day, spiral course to Mars. There, they would spend 412 days on the surface before returning. They even discover the bizarre flora and fauna that inhabit the Martian world, including plants that eat other plants, migratory plants, and cannibalistic plants. Some species of animal life include a trilobite-like creature that eats dust left behind by dust storms, bizarre aliens that rely solely on minerals for nutrition, leaving behind amazing and strange rock formations, {{and a slew of}} predators, including one that has radial symmetry, and uses the Sun's rays to burn their helpless prey.|$|R

50|$|The post's power derived {{not only}} from its {{proximity}} to the Sultan, but also from its association with the powerful queen-mothers, the valide sultanas, who often dominated politics (see Sultanate of Women). The Kizlar Agha was also the de facto sole intermediary between the closed world of the harem and the <b>outer,</b> male <b>quarters</b> of the palace (the selamlik), controlling its provisioning {{as well as the}} messages to and from. In addition, he was the only individual allowed to carry the Grand Vizier's communications to the Sultan and had a recognized role in public ceremonies. Among his duties in the palace was also the supervision of the education of imperial princes until they entered puberty, when they were enrolled in the palace school.|$|R
50|$|Fenwick is set {{off from}} the town center of Old Saybrook by a large cove over a causeway. It is located exactly where the Connecticut River flows into Long Island Sound. The town has two lighthouses, the Inner and the Outer. There is also a single private beach {{about a quarter of}} a mile away from the lighthouse. The Inner is at the tip of Lynde Point, Fenwick's peninsula, and the <b>Outer</b> is a <b>quarter</b> mile off shore, {{connected}} by a rough jetty. The Outer Light is the lighthouse shown on many Connecticut license plates.|$|R

A move to turn an <b>outer</b> layer two <b>quarter</b> (90°) turns in the same direction would be counted as two moves in the quarter turn metric (QTM), but as one turn in the face metric (FTM, or HTM [...] "Half Turn Metric", or OBTM [...] "Outer Block Turn Metric").|$|R
40|$|Nine forty-eight is an {{original}} composition for orchestra. The work lasts approximately eight minutes and thirty seconds, and is scored {{for the following}} instrumentation: two flutes, alto flute, two oboes, english horn, two clarinets in B, bass clarinet in B, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, two tenor trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, four percussionist (playing vibraphone, log drum, slapstick, tam-tam, claves, marimba, temple blocks, suspended cymbal, chimes, roto toms, maracas, lion 2 ̆ 7 s roar, crotales, guiro, and congas), harp, piano and strings. ^ The formal scheme of the work {{could be described as}} two arches of fast music separated by a brief senza misura section. The tempo marking of these <b>outer</b> arches is <b>quarter</b> note at 152 beats a minute, and the music is confined exclusively to measures of common time. This notation was chosen for ease of reading, and thus does not reflect any of the internal phrase groupings that are characteristic of the work. Despite the large instrumental forces employed, the score aspires to a certain transparency and directness of expression. The title is taken from one of the regular trains from London 2 ̆ 7 s King 2 ̆ 7 s Cross station to Cambridge. ...|$|R
