5|$|Fort Greble was an American Civil War-era Union {{fortification}} {{constructed as}} part of the defenses of Washington, D.C. during that war. Named for First Lieutenant John Trout Greble, the first West Point graduate killed in the U.S. Civil War, it protected the junction of the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, and from its position <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> in the Congress Heights, precluded any bombardment of the Washington Navy Yard and southeastern portions of the city. It was supported by Fort Carroll to the northeast and Fort Foote to the south. It never fired a shot during the war, and after a brief stint as a U.S. Army Signal Corps training facility, was abandoned and the land returned to its natural state. As of July 2007, the site of the fort is a community park.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Romney Depot to Depot Valley brought {{residential}} development on the hilltops {{to the west and}} east of Valley. On September27, 1911, George Edward Harmison (1863–1916) conducted a public auction of Valley View farm's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The land was located atop the hill to the west of Valley. Harmison subdivided the fields into lots, and the planned development was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney. Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction, and several lots were sold privately. A free lot was given to J.H.

It sits <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> 250 feet (76 m) above the Hudson River, a few blocks away.

25|$|Graycliff was {{a summer}} estate {{designed}} for his long-time patrons, Isabelle and Darwin D. Martin. Created in Wright's high Organic style, Graycliff {{consists of three}} buildings set within 8.5 acres of landscape, also designed by Wright. Its site, high <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> overlooking Lake Erie, inspired Wright to create a home that was transparent, with views through the building to the lake beyond. Terraces and cantilevered balconies also encourage lake views, and water features throughout the landscape were designed by Wright to echo the lake as well.|$|E

Property owners wanted to name the city Lamartine, but Erath convinced them to name the area Waco Village, after the Indians who had lived there. In March 1849, Shapley Ross built the first house in Waco, a double-log cabin, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> overlooking the springs. His daughter Kate was the first settler child to be born in Waco.|$|E
25|$|Founded in 1828 by {{an act of}} the Georgia Legislature, Columbus was {{situated}} {{at the beginning of the}} navigable portion of the Chattahoochee River and on the last stretch of the Federal Road before entering Alabama.

Across the river to the west, where Phenix City, Alabama is now located, Creek Indians still lived until they were forcibly removed in 1836 by the federal government to make way for European-American settlers.|$|E
