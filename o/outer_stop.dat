50|$|Dongbianmen (東便門 lit. 'Eastern Convenient Gate') {{was located}} at the northeastern corner of the Outer city walls {{at the point where}} the <b>outer</b> wall <b>stopped</b> short and turned toward the Inner city wall. A {{matching}} gate was built on the northwestern corner of the Outer city walls. The gates, originally intended to be temporary, were at first not given names. About ten years after completion, the gates were named Dongbianmen ("eastern side gate") and Xibianmen ("western side gate"). The gate tower at Dongbianmen was similar to the one at Zuo'anmen, but on a slightly smaller scale. It measured 11.2 metres by 5.5 metres and was 12.2 metres high. The gate had no archway; instead it had a smaller wooden side gate on one side. The watchtower was built during the Qianlong era (1735-1796), with two levels of arrow slits, four per level on the northern side and two per level on the eastern and western sides. The barbican and watchtower were dismantled in the 1930s due to lack of funds for maintenance. The gate tower was dismantled in 1958 when Beijing's main train station was built.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} by two-dimensional axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamical simulations (1) jet propagations {{through an}} envelope of a rapidly rotating and collapsing massive star, {{which is supposed}} to be a progenitor of long duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs), (2) breakouts and subsequent expansions into stellar winds and (3) accompanying photospheric emissions. We find that if the envelope rotates uniformly almost at the mass shedding limit, its <b>outer</b> part <b>stops</b> contracting eventually when the centrifugal force becomes large enough. Then another shock wave is formed, propagates outwards and breaks out of the envelope into the stellar wind. Which breaks out earlier, the jet or the centrifugal bounce-induced shock, depends on the timing of jet injection. If the shock breakout occurs earlier owing to a later injection, the jet propagation and subsequent photospheric emissions are affected substantially. We pay particular attention to observational consequences of the difference in the timing of jet injection. We calculate optical depths to find the location of photospheres, extracting densities and temperatures at appropriate retarded times from the hydrodynamical data. We show that the luminosity and observed temperature of the photospheric emissions are both much lower than those reported in previous studies. Although luminosities are still high enough for GRBs, the observed temperature are lower than the energy at the spectral peak expected by the Yonetoku-relation. This may imply that energy exchanges between photons and matter are terminated deeper inside or some non-thermal processes are operating to boost photon energies.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{successfully}} composite computer graphics elements into live action scenes {{it is important}} that the lighting of the CG object match the lighting of the scene into which it is being composited. One technique that has been used to reproduce the incident illumination in a live-action scene is to acquire a high-dynamic-range photograph of a mirrored ball placed in the scene and then use this light-probe image as a source of illumination for image-based lighting. 1 Previous Work Currently, in order to create a high dynamic range image of a mirrored ball one must take an iterative series of photographs with the exposure value of each image being stopped down by a given increment from the exposure value of the one before. Later, each of the images are assembled into a single high dynamic range image using a program such as HDR Shop 3. If an artist wished to accurately illuminate a CG object traveling through a complex lighting environment, it would be necessary to capture these iterative photographs at numerous locations (ideally at every frame) along the object’s path. Clearly, this would be an ambitious task. Technique One solution for creating a real-time high-dynamic range light probe is to develop a system in which multiple exposures of the same image can be captured within a single video frame. We did this by modifying a five point multi-image filter (a faceted lens that is commonly used to create photographic kaleidoscope effects), and applying successively increasing values of neutral density gel to four of the five facets of the filter (3, 6, 10 and 13 stops). This modified filter effectively produces a single image that is divided into five identical regions, with the center region capturing a “direct” view and the four <b>outer</b> regions <b>stopped</b> down to their respective exposure values. This modified filter is placed on a video camera that is mounted along with a mirrored ball on a span of angle iro...|$|R
40|$|Context. Transition disks are protoplanetary disks with inner {{depleted}} dust cavities {{that are}} excellent candidates for investigating the dust evolution {{when there is}} a pressure bump. A pressure bump at {{the outer edge of the}} cavity allows dust grains from the <b>outer</b> regions to <b>stop</b> their rapid inward migration towards the star and to efficiently grow to millimetre sizes. Dynamical interactions with planet(s) have been one of the most exciting theories to explain the clearing of the inner disk. Aims. We look for evidence of millimetre dust particles in transition disks by measuring their spectral index α_mm with new and available photometric data. We investigate the influence of the size of the dust depleted cavity on the disk integrated millimetre spectral index. Methods. We present the 3 -mm (100 GHz) photometric observations carried out with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer of four transition disks: LkHα 330, UX Tau A, LRLL 31, and LRLL 67. We used the available values of their fluxes at 345 GHz to calculate their spectral index, as well as the spectral index for a sample of twenty transition disks. We compared the observations with two kinds of models. In the first set of models, we considered coagulation and fragmentation of dust in a disk in which a cavity is formed by a massive planet located at different positions. The second set of models assumes disks with truncated inner parts at different radii and with power-law dust-size distributions, where the maximum size of grains is calculated considering turbulence as the source of destructive collisions. Results. We show that the integrated spectral index is higher for transition disks (TD) than for regular protoplanetary disks (PD) with mean values of α^(TD) _(mm) = 2. 70 ± 0. 13 and α^(PD) _(mm) = 2. 20 ± 0. 07 respectively.

50|$|Pilus biogenesis {{proceeds}} via {{the strand}} complementation mechanism, the mechanism {{functions as a}} direct consequence of the structures of both the chaperones and pilus subunits. Both the G1 extension of the chaperone and the N-terminal extension of the pilus subunits can bind to the hydrophobic P1-P5 cleft. When the G1 is bound it binds in a parallel conformation stabilising the subunit structure but doesn't form a true Ig fold (which is anti-parallel). It also only binds the cleft from sites P1-P4 leaving the P5 pocket exposed. When another subunit binds the hydrophobic cleft it binds in a P5-P2 anti-parallel fashion creating the most energetically favourable conformation of a true Ig-fold.When a chaperone/subunit complex is brought to the growing usher/pilus complex (note that a chaperone/subunit complex forms the base of this) the NTD and CTDs of the usher dimer bring and hold the chaperone/subunit complex to the pilus base. Here the N-terminal extension of the subunit interacts with the free P5 pocket of the pilus. This binding causes a residue by residue 'unzipping' of the chaperone's G1 strand with concurrent 'zipping' of the N-terminal extension of the chaperone/subunit complex, unknown as the zip in-zip out mechanism. Once the chaperone has been displaced it diffuses back to the sec machinery to bind another emerging pilus subunit. The usher using is CTDs then translocates the longer pilus across the translocation pore by one residue until the chaperone is in close association with the usher. This translocation is coupled with a slight rotation giving the pilus its helical structure. This growth proceeds until a terminating subunit binds the pilus (if one exists), terminating subunits lack the P5 pocket and thus almost irreversibly bind their chaperone. Since the usher can only translocate pilus subunits and not chaperone/subunit complexes, {{and the fact that the}} chaperone can't be energetically out-competed by another subunit (due to lack of P5) this terminating subunit anchors the pilus to the <b>outer</b> membrane and <b>stop</b> any further pilus growth.|$|R
