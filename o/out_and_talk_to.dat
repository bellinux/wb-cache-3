But {{allow me to}} remark that I have a Gryphoness with me who is very frightful to look at, and whom it was my {{intention}} to keep in the bushes; but if you will not give fair answers to my questions, she must come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, {{and that is all}} there is about it." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{told him}} that, {{when we came}} back, if {{one of those things}} was missing I would kill him and his people by witchcraft; and if we died and he tried to steal the rifles I would come and haunt him and turn his cattle mad and his milk sour till life was a weariness, and would make the devils in the guns come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him in a way he did not like, and {{generally}} gave him a good idea of judgment to come. After that he promised to look after them as though they were his father's spirit. He was a very superstitious old Kafir and a great villain.|$|E
60|$|Elder {{brothers}} {{are apt to}} be a little hard on younger ones, so {{it is not surprising that}} Frank, who was an eminently proper boy, was much cut up when Jack publicly confessed to dealings with Jerry, leaving it to be supposed that the worst half of the story remained untold. He felt it his duty, therefore, to collar poor Jack when he came <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him all the way home, like a judge bent on getting at the truth by main force. A kind word would have been very comforting, but the scolding was too much for Jack's temper, so he turned dogged and would not say a word, though Frank threatened not to speak to him for a week.|$|E

60|$|About two o'clock, {{after we}} had eaten and felt better, a white man appeared, {{carrying}} a white flag. Will Hamilton went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him, came back <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> with father <b>and</b> {{the rest of our}} men, <b>and</b> then went <b>out</b> to the stranger again. Farther back we could see a man standing and looking on, whom we recognized as Lee.|$|R
60|$|One {{thing was}} very clear to him. His landlady could not {{possibly}} understand about the strange moth, especially as {{he had failed to}} catch it. No one but an entomologist would understand quite how he felt. She was probably frightened at his behaviour, and yet he failed to see how he could explain it. He decided to say nothing further about the events of last night. After breakfast he saw her in her garden, and decided to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> reassure her. He talked to her about beans and potatoes, bees, caterpillars, and the price of fruit. She replied in her usual manner, but she looked at him a little suspiciously, and kept walking as he walked, so that there was always a bed of flowers, or a row of beans, or something of the sort, between them. After a while he began to feel singularly irritated at this, and to conceal his vexation went indoors and presently went out for a walk.|$|E
60|$|The Christian priest {{felt the}} temptation {{sufficiently}} to be always {{grateful for the}} grace that had carried him through it. At {{the end of a}} year, the old doctor died, and his nephew sold Vincent again. His next master was a native of Nice, who had not held out against the temptation to renounce his faith in order to avoid a life of slavery, but had become a renegade, and had the charge of one of the farms of the Dey of Tunis. The farm was on a hillside in an extremely hot and exposed region, and Vincent suffered much from being there set to field labour, but he endured all without a murmur. His master had three wives, and one of them, who was of Turkish birth,, used often to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, asking him many questions about his religion. Sometimes she asked him to sing, and he would then chant the psalm of the captive Jews: 'By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept;' and others of the 'songs' of his Zion. The woman at last told her husband that he must have been wrong in forsaking a religion of which her slave had told her such wonderful things. Her words had such an effect on the renegade that he sought the slave, and in conversation with him soon came to a full sense of his own miserable position as an apostate. A change of religion {{on the part of a}} Mahometan is, however, always visited with death, both to the convert and his instructor. An Algerine, who was discovered to have become a Christian, was about this time said to have been walled up at once in the fortifications he had been building; and the story has been confirmed by the recent discovery, by the French engineers, of the remains of a man within a huge block of clay, that had taken a perfect cast of his Moorish features, and of the surface of his garments, and even had his black hair adhering to it. Vincent's master, terrified at such perils, resolved to make his escape in secret with his slave. It is disappointing to hear nothing of the wife; and not to know whether she would not or could not accompany them. All we know is, that master and slave trusted themselves alone to a small bark, and, safely crossing the Mediterranean, landed at Aigues Mortes, on the 28th of June, 1607; and that the renegade at once abjured his false faith, and soon after entered a brotherhood at Rome, whose office it was to wait on the sick in hospitals.|$|E

But when I hear a human being wailing that she can't get <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> herself like a mad woman and beating on the shutters with her fists, as she was doing two or three minutes ago, I think it worth mentioning, that is all." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to {{allegations of sexual}} abuse and misconduct, Koresh and his followers were suspected of stockpiling illegal weapons. In May 1992, Chief Deputy Daniel Weyenberg of the McLennan County Sheriff's Department called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to notify them that his office had been contacted by a local UPS representative. A UPS driver described a package that had broken open on delivery to the Branch Davidian residence, revealing firearms, inert grenade casings, and black powder. On June 9, a formal investigation was opened and a week later it was classified as sensitive, [...] "thereby calling for {{a high degree of}} oversight" [...] from both Houston and headquarters. The documentary Inside Waco claims that the investigation started when in 1992 the ATF became concerned over reports of automatic gunfire coming from the Carmel compound. On July 30, ATF agents David Aguilera and Skinner visited the Branch Davidians' gun dealer Henry McMahon, who tried to get them to talk with Koresh on the phone. Koresh offered to let ATF inspect the Branch Davidians' weapons and paperwork and asked to speak with Aguilera, but Aguilera declined. Sheriff Harwell told reporters regarding law enforcement talking with Koresh, [...] "Just go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them, what's wrong with notifying them?" [...] The ATF began surveillance from a house across the road from the compound several months before the siege. Their cover was noticeably poor (the [...] "college students" [...] were in their 30s, had new cars, were not registered at the local schools, and did not keep a schedule which would have fit any legitimate employment or classes). The investigation included sending in an undercover agent, Robert Rodriguez, whose identity Koresh learned, though he chose not to reveal that fact until the day of the raid.|$|E
