40|$|Abstract. A {{method for}} {{formation}} of enhanced <b>ohmic</b> <b>contacts</b> on SiC for operation under adverse conditions has been studied. Ni, NiSi 2 and Si <b>ohmic</b> <b>contacts</b> were prepared and tested at 300 °C on air {{for hundreds of}} hours. NiSi 2 and Si have showed high thermal stability. Moreover, also the so called secondary contacts have showed good electrical and structural properties in the test. The secondary <b>ohmic</b> <b>contacts</b> have been formed from the original <b>ohmic</b> <b>contacts</b> after they were etched off and replaced. Secondary <b>ohmic</b> <b>contacts</b> originate in a certain surface modification of the SiC substrate created during high temperature annealing of the original contact. All applied contact materials enable formation of quality secondary contacts which is especially noteworthy at NiSi 2 and Si. The results bring new SiC device design perspectives with {{the application of the}} secondary <b>ohmic</b> <b>contacts.</b> For example, the contact is designed so that the primary contact attains as good ohmic behavior as possible with the secondary contact providing further important contact properties as high corrosion resistance, wire-bonding simplicity etc...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ohmic</b> <b>contact</b> {{degradation}} between metallisation and semiconductor layers. With gallium arsenide, a {{layer of}} gold-germanium alloy (sometimes with nickel) is used to achieve low contact resistance; an <b>ohmic</b> <b>contact</b> is formed by diffusion of germanium, forming a thin, highly n-doped region under the metal facilitating the connection, leaving gold deposited over it. Gallium atoms may migrate through this layer and get scavenged by the gold above, creating a defect-rich gallium-depleted zone under the contact; gold and oxygen then migrate oppositely, resulting in increased resistance of the <b>ohmic</b> <b>contact</b> and depletion of effective doping level. Formation of intermetallic compounds also {{plays a role in}} this failure mode.|$|E
50|$|Whether a given metal-semiconductor {{junction}} is an <b>ohmic</b> <b>contact,</b> or Schottky barrier, {{depends on the}} Schottky barrier height, ΦB, of the junction.For a sufficiently large Schottky barrier height, where ΦB is {{significantly higher than the}} thermal energy kT, the semiconductor is depleted near the metal and behaves as a Schottky barrier. For lower Schottky barrier heights, the semiconductor is not depleted and instead forms an <b>ohmic</b> <b>contact</b> to the metal.|$|E
50|$|With {{increased}} doping of the semiconductor, {{the width}} of the depletion region drops. Below a certain width, the charge carriers can tunnel through the depletion region. At very high doping levels, the junction does not behave as a rectifier anymore and becomes an <b>ohmic</b> <b>contact.</b> This can be used for the simultaneous formation of ohmic contacts and diodes, as a diode will form between the silicide and lightly doped n-type region, and an <b>ohmic</b> <b>contact</b> will form between the silicide and the heavily doped n- or p-type region. Lightly doped p-type regions pose a problem, as the resulting contact has too high a resistance for a good <b>ohmic</b> <b>contact,</b> but too low a forward voltage and too high a reverse leakage to make a good diode.|$|E

Among many harsh environments that {{must be taken into}} considerations, the high temperature environment is the predominant concern for many industries, especially for automobile, aerospace, and military industry. In order for a device to properly operate and hold its original characteristics reliably at any elevated temperature {{for an extended period of}} time, one of the most critical requirements that must be met is the thermal stability of the <b>ohmic</b> <b>contacts.</b> This thesis presents the fabrication and characterization of the high temperature Ni/Al/Ti/Mo/Ge/In <b>ohmic</b> <b>contacts</b> to N-type GaAs.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Ohmic</b> <b>contacts</b> {{with low}} contact resistance, smooth surface morphology, and a {{well-defined}} edge profile {{are essential to}} ensure optimal device performance. <b>Ohmic</b> <b>contacts</b> often require annealing under vacuum at over 1000 °C, whilst high-κ dielectrics are usually annealed in O 2 rich ambient at temperatures of 800 °C or less, affecting the specific contact resistivity (ρC) and RMS surface roughness. Therefore, protection of the <b>Ohmic</b> <b>contacts</b> during the annealing of a high-κ dielectric layer is a key enabling step in the realisation of high performance MOSFET structures. In order to prevent damage during the high-κ formation, a passivation layer capable of protecting the contacts during annealing is required.
