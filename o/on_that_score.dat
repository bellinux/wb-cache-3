5|$|When Theobald died in 1160, most {{observers}} believed that Foliot {{was the leading}} candidate to become archbishop of Canterbury. Traditionally, the see of Canterbury had been held by a monk, {{at least since the}} replacement of Stigand by Lanfranc in 1070. Although Foliot was a Cluniac monk, they were a subset of the Benedictine Order and thus the cathedral chapter at Canterbury, which was Benedictine but not Cluniac, would have had no objections to him <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>score.</b> Foliot denied that he ever lobbied for the office, but John of Salisbury and Thomas Becket apparently believed that Foliot desired it.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's next {{international}} action {{came during}} the inaugural Women's World Twenty20 tournament, held in England. Despite not being required to bat in England's opening match against India, she was the second most prolific batsmen in the competition, finishing with 199 runs, just one less than New Zealand's Aimee Watkins. In the group stage match against Sri Lanka, Taylor achieved her highest score in Twenty20 International cricket, making an unbeaten 75. Just five days later, she improved <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>score,</b> reaching 76 not out against Australia in the semi-finals. Batting with Beth Morgan, the pair maintained a run-rate of almost 10 runs an over to secure England's place in the final. Facing New Zealand in the final, England dismissed their opponents for 85 runs, but laboured to their total; Taylor top-scored for her side with 39 not out, and was the only England player to score a faster than a run a ball. Taylor was named as player of the tournament, and having only been dismissed once, finished with a batting average of 199.00. In England's subsequent series against Australia, Taylor struggled for runs, scoring 79 runs across four ODI innings, and being dismissed for under 20 runs in each innings of the only Test match. She opted to miss the tour of the West Indies in late 2009 to focus on her work commitments.|$|E

500|$|Bell {{made his}} Test debut in 2004 {{in the fourth}} Test against the West Indies at The Oval, scoring 70 in a ten-wicket England victory. His first century came a year later against Bangladesh at the Riverside Ground, Chester-le-Street. His highest Test score is 235 against India at The Oval. Bell has scored Test centuries at fifteen cricket grounds, {{including}} seven at venues outside England. He has scored his twenty-two Test centuries against eight different opponents; he is most successful against Australia, Pakistan and India, with four against each. England have never lost a test match in which Bell has scored a century. His dismissal for 199 against South Africa in July 2008 made him just the seventh batsman to lose his wicket <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>score</b> in Test cricket. [...] As of November 2015, Bell is joint twenty-eighth among all-time Test century makers, and joint third in the equivalent list for England.|$|E
500|$|The album {{itself was}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the hip hop albums of the century" [...] by the British newspaper The Observer and was successful on European music charts. Other reviews have been positive; Matthew Pollesel of Splendid Magazine praised the album for its lyrical content: [...] "...as Daara J show throughout Boomerang, it's possible to get the meaning of those words just by listening {{to the things that}} surround them—the intensity of the rappers' delivery, the quality of the beats, and how well all those other factors coalesce around the words. And <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>score,</b> Daara J's message comes through loud and clear." [...] However, Katharina Lobeck of BBC Music noted that one of the tracks, the R-influenced [...] "Hip Hop Civilization" [...] is [...] "too generically soppy for even the most hardened R fans", but {{went on to say that}} the album is [...] "a successful sonic adventure which thrives on its defiance of the margins of established sales categories".|$|E

2500|$|Nietzsche and Asian Thought {{represents}} {{a significant contribution}} to the scholarship on Nietzsche's relationship with Asian philosophy, and subsequent works that failed to take account of its scholarship have received criticism <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>score.</b> However, since the time of its publication, some of the scholarship has been superseded; for instance, in 2004, Thomas H. Brobjer published a more extensive account of Nietzsche's reading than that offered by Figl, and, based on that evidence, argues that Sprung had underestimated the amount of Indian philosophy that Nietzsche had read. Other writers have challenged the conclusions entirely; S. M. Amadae, though acknowledging that Nietzsche and Asian Thought features [...] "state of the art" [...] scholarship reaching conclusions typical of work in the area, feels that the work shows that [...] "the extent to which [...] developed his thought in dialogue with the East is almost wholly unacknowledged." [...] Instead, Amadae argues that Indian philosophy (and, specifically, Theravada Buddhism) were [...] "biographically and intellectually relevant" [...] to Nietzsche's philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a single}} match in 1895, he started {{appearing}} {{in a few}} matches for Gloucestershire each season from 1897 to 1907, {{with a couple of}} final matches in 1909. Only in 1899, when he played in 11 games, did he appear in more than half a dozen games, {{and more than half of}} the games he played for the county were early-season matches that started in May, a time when county cricket's regular contingent of amateur players tended to be less available. His highest aggregate of runs was 470 in the 1899 season and in 1901 he was top of the Gloucestershire averages, with 334 runs at an average of 37.11, beating Gilbert Jessop in that season. He hit an unbeaten 109 in that season in the match against Essex. The Wisden obituary records Hale reminiscing about the pace of Essex fast bowler Charles Kortright and claiming that [...] "he hit me black and blue"; in fact, the bulk of the Essex bowling was done by medium-pace bowlers and Kortright failed to take a wicket in his 20 overs. In 1902, he improved <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>score</b> with an innings of 135, including 21 fours and a six, that enabled Gloucestershire to draw the match against Nottinghamshire after being made to follow on. This was the highest score of Hale's first-class career.|$|E
2500|$|During the American Civil War Ordronaux {{served as}} an army surgeon {{stationed}} in New York. He also acted as a military medical advisor and between 1861 and 1863 he published two textbooks {{on the health of}} armies, and an instruction manual of medical criteria for examining recruits. In the introduction to the latter, which was written for the United States Sanitary Commission, he said, [...] "The preservation of health in armies, is everywhere a subject of recognized importance. So much, in fact, depends upon it, that precautionary measures in this behalf can never be exaggerated. All that can be done, should be done to protect troops against preventable disease. It seems to have been formerly believed, that the presence of a surgeon in each regiment was all sufficient for this purpose and that officers and men could go their way free from any responsibility or apprehension <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>score.</b> But experience has proved that the preservation of health, in either one man, or many, is not purely objective with surgeons. Too much, in this particular, is expected from them, and too little is done by officers to cooperate with them. Armies, like patients, must act in concert with their medical advisers, and make the matter of health subjective as well as objective. Officers and men need an insight into the general principles of hygiene, {{in order to be able}} to assist, themselves, in furthering prophylactic measures. To supply them with the requisite amount of information, the accompanying popular manual has therefore been prepared." ...|$|E
