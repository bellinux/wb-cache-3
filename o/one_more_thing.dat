5|$|In {{contrast}} to his regular season, Ginóbili became {{an integral part of}} Gregg Popovich's rotational set up in the playoffs, playing in every game. The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles and in those games his scoring threat took opponents by surprise, giving them <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> to cope with against the now highly favored Spurs. He helped guide them past the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals and then the New Jersey Nets in the Finals, securing San Antonio's second championship. After the win, Ginóbili won his first Olimpia de Oro ("Golden Olympia") as Argentina's sportsperson of the year, and met Argentine president Néstor Kirchner. A gym in Bahía Blanca was dedicated in Ginóbili's honor as well.|$|E

[...] "Maybe", replied Passer, [...] "but it still needs <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> – a billiards table." [...] The trio had a passion for billiards and felt that they could make a success of even the weakest idea if they had ready access to a table. Having found a good one at Dobříš Castle, the three, along with Václav Sasek, wrote a {{screenplay}} that fleshed out Forman's encounter with the young woman from Varnsdorf.|$|E

However they had already been contracted to do <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> at the Moore School: to give a series of talks on computer design.|$|E
2500|$|Computer Gaming Worlds Samuel Baker II scored it 2.5 out of 5. Although {{he praised}} the {{economic}} system, and the complex interrelations {{between the various}} buildings, he was critical {{of the lack of}} an in-depth tutorial, the necessity to return to the main menu so as to load a new game, and overly simplistic combat. He also cited numerous bugs with the copy-protection system. He concluded, [...] "there is something compelling about Settlers III. Many times I played longer than intended, wanting to tweak just <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing.</b> But in the end, the feeling of playing a loser remains." ...|$|E

[...] Another year passed, Satan meets God again and tells him: [...] "Lord God, it's my turn now." [...] God replied: [...] "First of all, don't call me Lord God, but instead Comrade God; second, there is no God; and <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> – don't distract me or I'll be late to the Party meeting." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1944, Smith rebounded {{from his}} {{injuries}} {{and had his}} best season in professional baseball. [...] In May and June 1944, he had separate streaks in which he reached base in 14 and 13 consecutive plate appearances. [...] The latter streak included nine consecutive hits. [...] Smith also won praise in 1944 for his baseball intelligence and as a player who [...] "never made a mistake or missed a signal." [...] In August 1944, Syracuse manager Jewel Ens said: [...] "Smith is the miracle man of the 1944 season[...] [...] [...] [...] He's the best hit-and-run man in the league.

2500|$|Beginning on November 14, 1965, Lt. Col. Moore led the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) in the week-long Battle of Ia Drang. Encircled by enemy {{soldiers}} {{with no clear}} landing zone {{that would allow them}} to leave, Moore managed to persevere despite being significantly outnumbered by North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces that would go on to defeat the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry only two-and-a-half miles away the next day. Moore's dictum that [...] "there is always <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> you can do to increase your odds of success" [...] and the courage of his entire command are credited [...] with this outcome. Blond haired Moore was known as [...] "Yellow Hair" [...] to his troops at the battle at Ia Drang, and as a tongue-in-cheek homage referencing the legendary General George Armstrong Custer, who commanded as a lieutenant colonel the same 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn just under a century before. Moore was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism at Ia Drang. After the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley, Moore was promoted to colonel and took over the command of the Garry Owen (3rd) Brigade.|$|E

And he made a decision {{coming out of that}} conversation that changed his life. And he believes that if it can change his life, it can change the lives of others as well. And that is why he is so committed to this. So the reason we’re all here today is not because some politician needs to knock off <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> on his ‘to do’ list.
