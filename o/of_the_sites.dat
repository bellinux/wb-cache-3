5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 sites in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace {{are the most common}} fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b> White suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites,</b> longnose dace occurred at 70 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites,</b> cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites,</b> and bluegills occurred at 60 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b> Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include rainbow trout. smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and chain pickerel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the central British state began to reacquire control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b> Caernarfon had {{never left the}} direct control of the Crown, but Harlech was {{transferred}} to the control of the Office of Works in 1914, Beaumaris followed in 1925 and Conwy was finally leased to the Ministry of Works in 1953. The state invested heavily in conservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b> The 1920s saw large-scale conservation programmes at both Beaumaris and Harlech, stripping back the vegetation, digging out the moat and repairing the stonework, but otherwise leaving the sites intact and avoiding outright restoration. Major work was undertaken at Conwy in the 1950s and 1960s, including the clearing away of newer buildings encroaching on the 13th-century walls.|$|E
5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation {{is very important for}} biological function, so mathematical methods have been developed for the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

5000|$|City Road itself {{remained}} mainly empty since 2005, with {{a church}} briefly using Studio 5. <b>The</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> remained empty and neglected until November 2009, when demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> began with Studio 5 {{and ending with}} the main building along with the Egypt Cottage pub.

5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish sites as they were known, two of them on Chat Moss. RAF Balloon Command {{was responsible for the}} administration and manning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites,</b> which were fully operational by 23January 1941. Each consisted of an air raid shelter for the crew along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E
5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> where {{fossils of}} A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and {{is thought to}} represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent. This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars, has the incisor less shifted lingually relative to the molars, and has more roots under the molars, {{as shown by the}} preserved alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of A.viridimontanum is {{primarily}} limited by its restricted habitat on serpentine cliffs and talus slopes. However, these sites are also of little value to humans. The most likely {{threat to the}} species is expansion of asbestos mining, which often occurs near populations of the fern, or other reuse of abandoned asbestos mines. Road construction might also threaten some sites, although this is mitigated by the fern's ability to flourish on disturbed serpentine. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> are as yet known to be invaded by non-native plants. The species is considered more difficult to cultivate than either of its parent species.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{geography}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> contextualizes <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> <b>The</b> pattern <b>of</b> pit-houses along <b>the</b> river Lilleå {{coupled with}} the interpreted textile and glass processing production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pit-houses points towards <b>the</b> <b>site’s</b> potential involvement in trade.|$|R

5|$|Differentiating {{the various}} periods {{of human history}} {{involved}} is a complex task. The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice, the Mesolithic until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced. These events may have begun at different times {{in different parts of}} the country. A number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> span very long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.|$|E
5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b> Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Banton was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of a {{detailed}} resource assessment by the Department of Energy (DOE), along with Maricaban Island in Batangas and Balut Island in Saranggani. The study aimed {{to determine whether}} the island can be a site for low enthalpy geothermal power generation. However, no exploitable geothermal resource has been delineated on the island. On 19 March 2013, the National Museum declared as Important Cultural Property the island's Guyangan Cave System, where precolonial wooden coffins, remains, and the Banton Cloth were found.|$|E

5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> {{are located}} in the Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Nesomys narindaensis {{were found}} during {{fieldwork}} in northwestern Madagascar {{that started in}} 2001.

The specific name, narindaensis, where one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> where the species has been found is located.

5|$|The {{area known}} as Croatia today was {{inhabited}} throughout the prehistoric period. Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been unearthed in northern Croatia, with the most famous and the best presented site in Krapina.
