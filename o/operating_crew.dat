25|$|Larger cannon {{were used}} in greater numbers during the Fall of Constantinople: Sultan Mehmet II used 68 Hungarian-made cannons, the largest of which was 26 feet long and weighed 20 tons; this fired a 1,200 pound stone cannonball, and {{required}} an <b>operating</b> <b>crew</b> of 200 men, as well as 70 oxen and 10,000 men just to transport them. For the defenders, the Walls of Constantinople could not be adapted for the operation of artillery, and towers were not good gun emplacements. There was even worry that the largest Byzantine cannon could cause more damage to their own walls than the Turkish cannon. The changing needs of cannon operation thus {{led to the development}} of trace italienne of Italy and the Tudors' Device Forts in England, using specially built cannon batteries to their greatest effect.|$|E
500|$|MARC #286 {{departed}} Brunswick at 4:30 PM Eastern time on February 16, 1996. #286 was a Brunswick–Washington, D.C., {{commuter train}} with a scheduled arrival at Union Station of 5:30 PM. The NTSB described {{the conditions that}} day as a [...] "blowing snowfall" [...] with a [...] accumulation. At the time CSX provided the <b>operating</b> <b>crew</b> for MARC commuter trains under contract to the Maryland Mass Transit Administration; aboard were an engineer, conductor, and assistant conductor. The train consisted of an EMD GP39H-2 diesel locomotive, two passenger coaches, and a control car. The train operated in push-pull mode, meaning that the locomotive was on {{the rear of the}} train and the locomotive engineer controlled operations from the control car in the front. MARC #286 had twenty passengers on board.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, when Sultan Mehmet II laid siege to Constantinople in April 1453, he used 68 Hungarian-made cannon, {{the largest}} of which was [...] long and weighed 20 tons. This fired a 1,200 pound stone cannonball, and {{required}} an <b>operating</b> <b>crew</b> of 200 men. Two such bombards had initially been offered to the Byzantines by the Hungarian artillery expert Urban, which were the pinnacle of gunpowder technology at the time; he boasted that they could reduce [...] "even the walls of Babylon". However, {{the fact that the}} Byzantines could not afford it illustrates the financial costs of artillery at the time. These cannon also needed 70 oxen and 10,000 men just to transport them. They were extremely loud, adding to their psychological impact, and Mehmet believed that those who unexpectedly heard it would be struck dumb.|$|E
500|$|Later {{on large}} cannon {{were known as}} bombards, ranging from three to five feet in length and were used by Dubrovnik and Kotor in defence during the later 14th century. The first bombards were made of iron, but bronze became more {{prevalent}} as it was recognized as more stable and capable of propelling stones weighing as much as [...] Around the same period, the Byzantine Empire began to accumulate its own cannon to face the Ottoman Empire, starting with medium-sized cannon [...] long and of 10in calibre. The earliest reliable recorded use of artillery in the region was against the Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1396, forcing the Ottomans to withdraw. The Ottomans acquired their own cannon and laid siege to the Byzantine capital again in 1422. By 1453, the Ottomans used 68 Hungarian-made cannon for the 55-day bombardment of the walls of Constantinople, [...] "hurling the pieces everywhere and killing those {{who happened to be}} nearby." [...] The largest of their cannon was the Great Turkish Bombard, which required an <b>operating</b> <b>crew</b> of 200 men and 70 oxen, and 10,000 men to transport it. Gunpowder made the formerly devastating Greek fire obsolete, and with the final fall of Constantinople—which was protected by what were once the strongest walls in Europe—on 29 May 1453, [...] "it was {{the end of an era}} in more ways than one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Passenger service {{became an}} issue in Florida {{during the early years}} of the labor strike, which {{essentially}} lasted 14 years, from 1963 to 1977. At the insistence of the City of Miami – which had long fought to get rid of the tracks in the downtown section just north of the county courthouse – Miami's wooden-constructed downtown passenger terminal was demolished by November 1963. Although a new station was planned at NE 36th Street and NE 2nd Avenue, it was never built. Further, while freight trains were operated with non-union and supervisory crews, passenger runs were not reinstated until August 2, 1965, after the City of Miami sued and the Florida courts ruled that the FEC corporate charter required both coach and first class passenger services to be offered. In response, FEC sold [...] "parlour car seating" [...] for first class accommodations in the rear lounge section of a tavern-lounge-observation car. [...] This new state-mandated passenger service consisted of a single diesel locomotive and two streamlined passenger cars, which, in addition to the <b>operating</b> <b>crew,</b> were staffed by a passenger service agent and a coach attendant, who were [...] "non-operating." [...] The mini-streamliner operated all of the way across three previously observed crew districts (Jacksonville to New Smyrna Beach to Fort Pierce to Miami). [...] Following the letter of the law, the train carried no baggage, remains, mail or express; honoured no inter-line tickets or passes; and the only food service was a box lunch (at Cocoa-Rockledge in 1966). On-board beverage service was limited to soft drinks and coffee. [...] Without a station in Miami, the 1950s era station in North Miami became the southern terminus. [...] The service operated six days a week until it was finally discontinued on July 31, 1968.|$|E
