5|$|The 2001 English cricket season saw Key's form improve, {{with him}} scoring four {{first-class}} centuries; including {{one against the}} touring Pakistanis. His highest score {{of the season and}} career to date would come in the final gamehe scored 132 in a rain-affected match against Lancashire. His scoring throughout the season persuaded the national selectors to include him in the National Academy, which went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> tour of Australia, where he showed his ability with an innings of 177 against the side's Australian counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews. It charted {{in the top}} twenty in Japan and New Zealand, and the top forty in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It peaked in the United States at number fifty-three. The accompanying music video features Brown and American R singer Cassie as his love interest. In the video, he yearns for their relationship <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> night in a city and in a desert scene. Brown performed the song on his 2009 Fan Appreciation Tour, and on BET's SOS: Help for Haiti Telethon, which benefited victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the classic}} account of slaves that escaped on the Underground Railroad was Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional work, Uncle Tom's Cabin, which relates the story of Eliza Harris, a young slave girl who escaped the South by {{crossing}} the Ohio River <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> night. Barefooted and carrying her baby, the fictional Eliza was exhausted and nearly dead when she reached safety. After receiving food, clothing, new shoes, and shelter from Stowe's fictional Quaker couple, Simeon and Rachael Halliday, Eliza continued her journey to freedom in Canada. Stow, who {{was living in the}} city at the time, was acquainted with the Coffins, who may have been the inspiration for the Halliday couple in her novel.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1900, Kaiser Friedrich III {{replaced}} Kaiser Wilhelm II as the I Squadron flagship; the latter, as {{the fleet}} flagship, remained {{assigned to the}} squadron for tactical purposes. From 4 to 15 December, Kaiser Wilhelm II and the I Squadron went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> training cruise to Norway; the ships anchored at Larvik from 10 to 12 December. At 01:30 on 2 January 1901, she was steaming from Danzig to Kiel with Kaiser Friedrich III when the latter struck an underwater obstacle. The shock from the collision damaged the ship's boilers and started {{a fire in the}} coal bunkers. Kaiser Wilhelm II took her sister in tow, although the engines on Kaiser Friedrich III were restarted along the way. The ships eventually reached Kiel, where temporary repairs were conducted. Kaiser Wilhelm II went into drydock in January 1901 for overhaul and some modernization work. This included the reconstruction of a larger bridge and the removal of some of her searchlights. While the ship was laid up, Admiral Hans von Koester replaced Hoffmann as the fleet commander, a position he would hold until the end of 1906.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, {{the band}} began {{occasionally}} featuring Jon Sevink, from The Levellers as guest violinist at some shows. Later that year, Hawkwind embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> tour {{to celebrate the}} band's 40th anniversary, including two gigs on 28 and 29 August marking the anniversary of their first live performances.

25|$|Several {{days into}} 2015, Ruben Schaken left the club before signing at Inter Baku. The club then went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> {{training}} camp in Dubai {{to prepare for the}} second half of the season. Feyenoord resumed play after the winter break with a home game against FC Twente on 18 January. Feyenoord won the game by a 3–1 margin after a first half goal by Immers and second half goals by Toornstra and Boëtius. The next Sunday, Feyenoord played De Klassieker away. The game ended in a scoreless draw, the first since 1978.|$|E
25|$|Last Night in Town was {{released}} on August 14, 2001. Subsequent tours with Killswitch Engage and Martyr A.D. followed. The band then embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> tour with Bloodlet. During a show in early January 2002, the band performed as a four-piece with guitarist Jordan Buckley on bass. Shortly afterwards, they announced they were looking a bassist due to their bass player Aaron Ratajczak leaving left to focus on Kid Gorgeous. Further tours followed, as well as appearances at festivals, before Steve Micciche became the group's new bassist in the summer. The group closed the year touring with Eighteen Visions, Converge and Misery Signals, among others.|$|E

25|$|The {{colliery}} had {{an extensive}} internal standard gauge rail network, {{connected to the}} mainline at Snowdown and Nonington Halt. The line was operated by steam locomotives, the last of which survived in working condition after the demise of steam traction on the national mainline in 1968. The colliery railway was by then using a mixed fleet of steam and diesel locomotives, with the final steam withdrawals {{taking place in the}} late 1970s. The final three steam locomotives were named after saints with nearby Canterbury connections. St Thomas (named for St Thomas of Canterbury), St Dunstan (named for Dunstan, also a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury), and St Martin (named for St Martin, patron of England's oldest parish church, St Martin's Church, Canterbury). The colliery railway network was dismantled following the closure of the colliery in 1987. St Thomas and St Dunstan both survive into preservation. St Martin, which had been badly damaged when its tanks were left full of water which froze <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> night, was scrapped.|$|E
25|$|The {{types of}} homes that {{were built in}} that time and area, usually one story rubble masonry with heavy flat roofs that were often already damaged, were not {{resistant}} to even {{a small amount of}} shaking. Public structures like bridges and walls fared better, as they were usually constructed with higher standards. The heavy damage in certain areas occurred for various reasons. Some cities were built on steep hillsides overlooking the plains (done for security reasons), while other sites were located on unstable soil where landslides had occurred previously. These conditions made assessing the intensity of the earthquake difficult, but Ambraseys settled on a maximum value of VII–VIII (Very strong–Damaging) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale for the event. That scale was used primarily in Europe and the Soviet Union up until the 1990s. A higher loss of life was probably seen {{as a result of the}} earthquake occurring <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> evening, as most people were likely in their homes preparing dinner.|$|E
25|$|The city of Basel is a centre for {{numerous}} fairs and events all year round. One {{of the most}} important fairs for contemporary art worldwide is the Art Basel which was founded in 1970 by Ernst Beyeler and takes place in June each year. Baselworld, the watch and jewellery show (Uhren- und Schmuckmesse) one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. The carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, {{despite the fact that it}} starts at exactly four in the morning (Morgestraich) <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing day and night for exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.|$|E

25|$|Support for {{the monarchy}} floated around 80%, unless {{members of the}} royal family engaged in dubious activities. Examples of these are when in 2000, Beatrix went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> sport holiday in Austria, that was boycotted by Europe at the time because Jörg Haider's Freedom Party was in government, or when Willem-Alexander and Máxima had a villa built in Mozambique in 2007, which they {{eventually}} abandoned under great pressure. Geert Wilders, leader of the new right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV), was displeased by the 2007 Christmas speech by queen Beatrix, which he found biased and full of thinly veiled criticism of the PVV. Ever since, he has argued for the king/queen to be deprived of all political powers, but also to maintain a purely ceremonial kingship, although some suspect the PVV and/or Wilders to actually be republican. According to a survey by Maurice de Hond from 2014, the percentage of convinced republican is twice as high amongst PVV voters (29%) than the general public (15%), but still a minority.|$|E
25|$|Injury <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> tour of India ended Gover's run of success: in 1938, {{apart from}} a week in late May and early June when he {{achieved}} his best figures of 14 for 85 against Worcestershire, Gover was clearly unfit (despite periods of rest) and had so little venom his haul of wickets fell from 201 to just 86. Though he recovered somewhat in 1939 with increased fitness, it was already evident Gover would struggle to regain the speed and venom of his two great years. However, when county cricket resumed after World War II in 1946 Gover, at 38, bowled so well under unfavourable conditions that {{he played in the}} Third Test against India. With his strong physique it was surprising he was not chosen for either the 1936/1937 or 1946/1947 Ashes tours. He decided 1947 would be his last year in county cricket, but Gover was still regarded as the best fast bowler in England, and there were calls for him to be selected for the last Test when Harold Butler withdrew and Alec Bedser was out of form.|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} from Where You Want to Be was [...] "A Decade Under the Influence," [...] which was {{released}} to radio in late June 2004.

500|$|The Battle of Alton (also Storm of Alton), of the First English Civil War, {{took place}} on 13 December 1643 {{in the town of}} Alton, Hampshire, England. There, Parliamentary forces serving under Sir William Waller led a {{successful}} surprise attack <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> garrison of Royalist infantry and cavalry serving under the Earl of Crawford. In the context of the First English Civil War, the Battle of Alton was the first decisive defeat of Sir Ralph Hopton, leader of Royalist forces in the south, and the event had a significant psychological effect on him as commander. More important to Hopton was the loss of men, however, as he was already short-handed in much-needed infantry. The successful Parliamentarians were able, after their victory, to attack and successfully besiege Arundel, a larger and more formidable Royalist outpost in the south of England.|$|E
500|$|In 1741, the Austrian {{authorities}} informed Maria Theresa that Bohemian populace {{would prefer}} Charles Albert {{to her as}} sovereign. Maria Theresa, desperate and burdened by pregnancy, wrote plaintively to her sister: [...] "I don't know if a town will remain to me for my delivery." [...] She bitterly vowed to spare nothing and no one to defend her kingdom when she wrote to the Bohemian chancellor, Count Philip Kinsky: [...] "My mind is made up. We must put everything at stake to save Bohemia." [...] On 26October, the Elector of Bavaria captured Prague and declared himself King of Bohemia. Maria Theresa, then in Hungary, wept on learning {{of the loss of}} Bohemia. Charles Albert was unanimously elected Holy Roman Emperor on 24January 1742. The Archduchess, who regarded the election as a catastrophe, caught her enemies unprepared by insisting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> campaign; the same day he was elected emperor, Austrian troops under Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller captured Munich, Charles Albert's capital.|$|E
500|$|As did the nation, fraternities at Dartmouth {{went through}} {{difficult}} {{times during the}} Great Depression. [...] The decade of the 1930s saw almost no building projects {{at all in the}} fraternity system, and many houses could no longer afford regular maintenance. [...] One of the great tragedies at Dartmouth College occurred <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> night in 1934, when nine members of Theta Chi died from carbon monoxide poisoning after a metal chimney on a dilapidated coal furnace {{in the basement of the}} chapter house broke in the night. [...] In 1935, Dartmouth historian and professor Leon Burr Richardson asserted in a survey that, in light of the national suffering, the fraternity chapters should ask themselves if they had [...] "any excuse for existence." [...] Four fraternities dissolved during the Great Depression (Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Omega, Lambda Chi Alpha, and Sigma Alpha Mu), and two (Phi Kappa Sigma and Alpha Chi Rho) merged to pool scarce resources in order to survive. [...] All of the surviving fraternities closed for the duration of World War II, as the campus was largely (although not exclusively) used to educate, train, and house Navy sailors and Marines in the V-12 Navy College Training Program.|$|E
