5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> and other aquatic animals.|$|E

5|$|The convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a {{fish species}} {{from the family}} Cichlidae, native to Central America, {{also known as the}} zebra cichlid.

5000|$|Historically, many {{residents}} of Hōdhado depended <b>on</b> <b>fishing</b> {{as the primary}} source of income, although today retail business along with white collar jobs have diminished the dependency <b>on</b> <b>fishing.</b> One of the traditional harbours of Fuvammulah [...] "Anbule Athiri" [...] is located within Hōdhado which explains the district's dependency <b>on</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is a lowhead dam {{referred}} to by locals as Boone's Dam <b>on</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek near where the creek flows past Bloomsburg. A dam was built <b>on</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek in the northern reaches of Bloomsburg {{with the purpose of}} powering nearby Irondale furnaces. Additionally, a dam was built <b>on</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek about 2 mi north of Bloomsburg in 1818 by John Barton. In the 1800s and early 1900s there were two other dams <b>on</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek. One was in Orange Township, and the other, a 212 ft concrete dam, was in Orangeville. A dam known as the Benton Dam was built <b>on</b> upper <b>Fishing</b> Creek, directly upstream of Benton.|$|R

5|$|The toothed whales (systematic name Odontoceti) form a parvorder of the cetaceans. As {{the name}} suggests, the parvorder is {{characterized}} by having teeth (rather than baleen). Toothed whales are active hunters, feeding <b>on</b> <b>fish,</b> squid, {{and in some cases}} other marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|These {{are highly}} pelagic birds with long, narrow wings and tube-shaped nostrils. They feed at sea <b>on</b> <b>fish,</b> squid and other marine life. They come to land to breed in colonies, nesting in burrows or on cliffs. There are about 77 species worldwide, {{two of which}} are rare vagrants to Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other Bungarus species, who are {{primarily}} snake-eaters, the many-banded krait usually feeds <b>on</b> <b>fish,</b> {{but it is}} also preys on other species of snakes, including members of its own species. This species also feeds on rodents, eels, frogs, and occasionally lizards.|$|E
5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
5|$|An {{outline of}} the origins of the {{parasitic}} life style has been proposed. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.|$|E

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} <b>on</b> <b>fish,</b> {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E
5|$|At the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main {{responsibilities}} were {{to analyze}} and report field data <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public.

However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined <b>on</b> <b>fish,</b> {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E

5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E

5|$|Haas' early third {{millennium}} dates {{suggest that the}} development of coastal and inland sites occurred in parallel. But, from 2500 to 2000 BC, during the period of greatest expansion, the population and development decisively shifted toward the inland sites. All development apparently occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, though they remained dependent <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> and shellfish from the coast. The peak in dates is in keeping with Shady's dates at Caral, which show habitation from 2627 BC to 2020 BC. That coastal and inland sites developed in tandem remains disputed, however (see next section).|$|E
5|$|In late 1960, the Alaska Conservation Society {{became the}} first large {{conservation}} group to oppose construction of the dam. The organization believed the flooding of the Yukon Flats would cause critical damage to Alaska waterfowl and promoted the alternative Susitna Hydroelectric Project to supply Alaska's electric needs. This was followed in early 1961 by an Alaska Sportsmen's Council resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers for reducing its funding for studies {{of the impact of}} the project <b>on</b> <b>fish</b> and game stocks. In April of that year, Alaska Sportsman magazine took a formal stand against the project.|$|E
5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{they feed}} almost {{exclusively}} on euphausiids (mainly the genera Euphausia and Thysanoessa), as well as taking small amounts of amphipods (e.g. Themisto gaudichaudii) and various species of fish.
