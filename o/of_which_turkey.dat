40|$|The aristocrats {{in ancient}} Greek {{did not have}} to do their {{military}} service. They were immune from military service. Immunity is defined as resistance to a certain infectious agent and the state of not being infected or ill with this agent. Even though humans can have an acquired immunity against some illnesses such as measles, varicella, etc, they can also obtain active immunity by vaccination. This practice can help to prevent severe and /or fatal complications. Edward Jenner first developed the variola vaccine using scientific methods in 1778. As a result of the well- planned global-scale vaccine campaigns of the World Health Organization(WHO), variola disease was successfully eradicated worldwide in 1977. The success of the variola vaccination carried out by WHO was followed by the poliomyelitis vaccination campaign. WHO started a global poliomyelitis eradication program in 1988. The last poliomyelitis case was seen in Ağrı in November of 1998, and after this case, poliomyelitis was eradicated in Europe, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Turkey</b> is part. Measles is the next infection to be dealt with, and The Ministry of Health in Turkey is planning to eradicate measles by 2010. It seems that after the success of previous campaigns, plans for other preventable childhood diseases (such as diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis A and B, and varicella) probably follow in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanization}} {{of agriculture}} in Turkey as of 1950 s brought about considerable {{unemployment in the}} labour force, as a result <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Turkey</b> experienced an accelerated immigration movement from rural to urban areas. The inadequate number of dwellings and the insufficient income of this section migrating from rural to urban areas to acquire a dwelling of their own {{played a key role}} in the unplanned urbanization. This research was conducted with the aim of acquainting with prevailing social, economic and physical conditions in slum areas where Ankara experiences substantial increase in squatting. Through interviews carried out with slum dwellers, being characterized as people living away from urban culture due to the general stereotype, their expectations from the urban city and approaches to urban transformation was inquired. In the scope of this study, slums and slum policy; urban transformation and urban transformation processes in Turkey were primarily explained in a conceptual manner and then a fieldwork was performed. As a result of surveys and interviews conducted in Yalçınkaya Quarter where fieldwork was also realized, social, physical and economic problems of slums as well as their expectations from the urban city were identified. The assessments in this respect revealed that shantytowns display a transitional characteristic between rural and urban areas and they are on the horns of dilemma as they possess neither an urban nor a rural lifestyle. The study conducted in Yalçınkaya Quarter revealed the urban poverty once again; however, meeting with people striving to hold on and struggle for life in the quarter where a sort of depression area was expected to be found in ethnical aspects is of high importance in terms of demonstrating the efforts of these people for maintaining their relations with the city regardless of existing social, physical and economical problems...|$|E

40|$|Four {{years have}} passed since the Syrian crisis emerged in the spring of 2011. Four million {{refugees}} have sought refuge in the Syria's neighbouring countries, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Turkey</b> has received 1, 9 million of these refugees so far. The majority of these refugees resides in urban areas in Turkey, of which an estimated 330. 000 stay in Istanbul. Refugees in camps are appointed a form of residence but urban refugees have to find their new houses with very little assistance. The aim of this study is gaining {{a better understanding of the}} housing and home situation of these Syrian urban refugees. In a fieldwork period of three months, in depth interviews were held with 42 participants about their housing situation in Istanbul and about the meaning of this housing in their process of constructing a feeling of home in Istanbul. For this research I have used the concept of a housing pathway as a basis of analysis, meaning the patterns of interaction concerning house and home, over time and space. There is a mutual influence between these housing pathways and a feeling of home. The main finding of this research is that housing functions as a means and a marker to the way in which Syrian refugees construct their homes. Housing is a means to a stronger sense of home, because it provides a space where social connections within communities can be maintained and serves as one of the relational hubs in Istanbul. Housing can be a marker of the social and economic status and of a refugee, acquired in Turkey. Factors that contribute to constructing a feeling of home can be found in the economic, relational and legal domain. Economically, job security affect this process; an important factor in the legal domain is the type of residence; and socially, creating social bonds, social bridges and the arrival of close kin in Istanbul provides social security that leads to a stronger sense of home. However, there are also obstructing, or even destructing factors in creating a feeling of home among the Syrian participants. Socially, processes of discrimination cause a feeling of non-belonging; legally, interactions and bureaucratic annoyances about residence permits result in the feeling that there are very few opportunities to ever establish a legal life in Istanbul; in the economic domain, exploitation in a job can initiate a negative loophole that is difficult to escape within Istanbul's borders. Though I have observed that for most refugees there is process of positive progress going on during the time that they stay in Istanbul, their feeling of home has developed in a fragmented way in which they relate to both their old homes in Syria and their new experience Istanbul...|$|E
