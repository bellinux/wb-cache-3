5|$|The {{appointment}} of Colin Campbell as comptroller general in 1966 fostered substantial changes within Fremantle Prison itself. One {{of his first}} changes was to clear the classification committee's backlog of prisoners awaiting assessment.

Work release and community service programs were also introduced, along with training programs, social workers and welfare officers. Within the midst of Campbell's reforms, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department <b>of</b> <b>Corrections</b> in 1971, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department.|$|E

5|$|The prison barge was {{temporarily}} closed in August 1995 due to less crowded city jails, {{caused by a}} decline in arrests and inmate transfers. In late 1996, the prison was slated for reopening due to the rise in arrests from a campaign targeting drugs and drug dealers. The six-month campaign expected more than seven thousand additional arrests than usual, but the ship was not reopened until 1998 when it {{was used by the}} Department of Juvenile Justice.

Two days later, Guandique was charged in D.C. with Levy's murder. He was indicted by a grand jury on six counts: kidnapping, first-degree murder committed during a kidnapping, attempted first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree murder committed during a sexual offense, attempted robbery, and first-degree murder committed during a robbery. Guandique pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, where a trial date was initially set for January 27, 2010. His lawyers argued that Guandique's federal prison cell was outside the jurisdiction of a court-ordered search. After errors in processing contaminated some of the gathered evidence with DNA from employees of the prosecution, the start date of the trial at the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse was moved to October 4, 2010.|$|E
