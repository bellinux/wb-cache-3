40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{operating}} range <b>of</b> a <b>conventional</b> pulse transformer (PT) and a hybrid pulse transformer (HPT) {{which is designed}} for miniaturization and increased output power of flyback converters. The HPT expands the operating range of the primary magnetomotive force by impressing the dc bias in cores with permanent magnets. The operating ranges <b>of</b> the <b>conventional</b> PT and the HPT are, respectively, 32 and 54 A, the operating range of the HPT is 1. 7 times that <b>of</b> the <b>conventional</b> PT. The maximum output powers 2 <b>of</b> the <b>conventional</b> PT and the HPT are proportional to the square of their respective operating ranges. The 2 values <b>of</b> the <b>conventional</b> PT and the HPT are, respectively, 8. 6 and 23. 2 W, the 2 of the HPT is 2. 7 times that <b>of</b> the <b>conventional</b> PT.

5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century.

Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, {{there was}} serious debate among the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future military policy as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south.

5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution <b>of</b> <b>conventional</b> electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E

To analyze the relations between these methods theoretically, they are all viewed as approximations <b>of</b> the <b>conventional</b> FDTD scheme in present discussion. The errors between these methods and the conventional FDTD method are presented analytically, and the numerical performances, including computation accuracy, efficiency, and memory requirements, are discussed, by comparing with those <b>of</b> the <b>conventional</b> FDTD method. 1...|$|R
