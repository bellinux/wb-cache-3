High and low temperature tests and temperature cycling tests were done. In all tests the used temperatures were inside component’s <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits.</b> After the tests, capacitors were tested for their breakdown voltage. According to results of this research, high or low temperature testing inside component’s <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> does not {{have an effect on the}} breakdown voltage of tantalum capacitors.

40|$|A {{critical}} analysis is presented {{of the operating}} temperature windows for 9 candidate fusion reactor structural materials: four reduced-activation structural materials (oxide-dispersion-strengthened and ferritic/martensitic steels containing 8 - 12 %Cr, V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti, and SiC/SiC composites), copper-base alloys (CuNiBe), tantalum-base alloys (e. g., Ta- 8 W- 2 Hf), niobium alloys (Nb- 1 Zr), and molybdenum and tungsten alloys. The results are compared with the <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> for Type 316 austenitic stainless steel. Several factors define the allowable operating temperature window for structural alloys in a fusion reactor. The lower <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> in all body-centered cubic and most face-centered cubic alloys is determined by radiation embrittlement (decrease in fracture toughness), which is generally most pronounced for irradiation temperatures below ~ 0. 3 TM where TM is the melting temperature. The lower <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> for SiC/SiC composites will likely be determined by radiation-induced thermal conductivity degradation, which becomes more pronounced in ceramics with decreasing temperature. The upper <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> of structural materials is determined by one of four factors, all of which become more pronounced with increasing exposure time: 1) Thermal creep (grain boundary sliding or matrix diffusional creep), 2) high temperature He embrittlement of grain boundaries, 3) cavity swelling (particularly important for SiC and Cu alloys), or 4) coolant compatibility/corrosion issues. In many cases, the upper <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> {{will be determined by}} coolant corrosion / compatibility rather than by thermal creep or radiation effects. The compatibility of the structural materials with Li, Pb-Li, Sn-Li, He and Flibe (Li 2 BeF 4) coolants is summarized...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Hysteresis {{observed}} in the resistive semiconductor-to-metal phase transition in VO 2 causes problems in bolometric readout, and thus is an obstacle in utilizing this strong phase tran-sition in bolometric sensor applications. It is possible to avoid the unwanted hysteresis when <b>operating</b> in <b>limited</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges within the hysteresis loop of VO 2. Nonhysteretic branches (NHB-s) traced in such <b>limited</b> <b>temperature</b> intervals {{turned out to have}} much higher temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) than VO 2 at room temperature: while TCR at 25 ◦C in VO 2 is close to 3 %, peak TCR values in NHB-s reach 6 % in VO 2 films on Si/SiO 2 substrates and 21 % in films on crystalline sapphire substrates. At the same time, the nanoscopic-scale mixture of semiconducting and metallic phases in VO 2 within its hysteresis loop provides for partially shunted low resistivity, thus creating an unprecedented combination of record high semiconducting TCR and metal-like low resistance. This combination may benefit the uncooled focal plane array microbolometer IR visualization technology.

The Variable Frequency Pulse Phase-Locked Loop (VFPPLL) instrument {{is currently being}} used to non-invasively evaluate the human skull for increases in intracranial distances brought about by increases in intracranial pressure. It is designed to determine distance changes, in the sub-micron range, calculated from changes in frequency of an ultrasonic toneburst produced by a transducer, traversed through the skull and received back by the transducer. A bench test model of the human skull will calibrate the VFPPLL by comparing known distance changes to the VFPPLL derived distance changes, and thereby verify {{the accuracy of the}} instrument. Additionally, the bench test model will determine a broad range of <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> on <b>temperature,</b> pressure and elongation over which the VFPPLL can operate accurately.

40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engines are}} {{amenable}} to a large variety of fuels {{as long as the}} fuel can be fully vaporized, sufficiently mixed with air, and receive sufficient heat during the compression stroke to reach the autoignition conditions. This study investigates an HCCI engine fueled with ethanol-in-water mixtures, which we call “wet ethanol”. The motivation for using wet ethanol fuel is that significant energy is required for distillation and dehydration of fermented ethanol (from biosources, not from petroleum), thus direct use of wet ethanol could improve energy balance. Recent modeling studies have predicted that a HCCI engine can operate using fuel containing as little as 35 % ethanol-in-water, with surprisingly good performance and emissions. With the previous modeling study suggesting feasibility of wet ethanol use in HCCI engines, this paper focuses on experimental operation wet ethanol in a 4 -cylinder 1. 9 liter engine running in HCCI mode.

This thesis aimed at the implementation of Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) on Printed Circuit Boards. A standard operating procedure for implementing Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) to increase the reliability of PCBs used in various Waters equipment is developed and validated. For {{the creation of the}} standard operating procedure a very reliable Alliance PCB is selected that acts as a benchmark for screening other boards. Extensive testing is done on the Alliance PCB by subjecting it to thermal and vibration stresses through a Hot Step Stress profile, Cold Step Stress profile, Thermal Cycling, Vibration Step Stress profile and Combined Cycle profile. For validation, the standard operating procedure created is applied to a less reliable Acquity board to check whether the same standard operating procedure is effective in precipitating and detecting failures on a variety of different boards that Waters equipment uses. As expected the <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> of <b>temperature</b> and vibration of the Acquity board are found to be less than the Alliance board i. e. the Acquity experiences failure much earlier than Alliance when subjected to the same stress profiles.
