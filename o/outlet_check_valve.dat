5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid leakage at the packing or seal {{particularly}} when a liquid is dangerous, toxic, or noxious, diaphragm pumps are used for metering. Diaphragm pumps have a diaphragm through which repeated compression/decompression motion is transmitted. The liquid does not penetrate through the diaphragm, so the liquid inside the pump is sealed off from the outside. Such motion changes the volume of a chamber in the pump head so that liquid enters through an inlet check valve during decompression and exits through an <b>outlet</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> during compression, {{in a manner similar}} to piston pumps. Diaphragm pumps can also be made which discharge at fairly high pressure. Diaphragm metering pumps are commonly hydraulically driven.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide the}} high speed flow {{visualization}} and dynamic measurement {{results for the}} U-shaped and the inverted U-shaped heat driven pumps. The U-shaped heat driven pumps at the high heating powers consist of a succession of tiny bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence process. Once the "larger" spherical bubble or the bubble slug forms, it expands quickly in both upstream and downstream directions. The increased pressure leads to the liquid discharge through the <b>outlet</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> When the advancing vapor/liquid interface reaches a higher position in the vertical discharge branch, the condensation heat transfer in the discharge branch shrinks the bubble slug, leading to the decreased pressure and initiating the open of the inlet check valve. Thus the fresh liquid can be sucked into the system. Heat driven pumps operating at the low heating powers display the similar process. However, two major differences are identified. (1) A full cycle includes a set of positive pressure pulses corresponding {{to a set of}} tiny bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence process in each substage. Only {{at the end of the}} cycle, an apparent negative pressure pulse is created (2) For each substage in each cycle, when the newly formed bubble slug is chasing the ahead "old" bubble slug, the deformed liquid bridge is formed due to the gravity,force effect. When the two bubble slugs are merging together, a wave vapor/liquid interface occurs along the bottom of the capillary tube. For the inverted U-shaped heat driven pumps, there are fewer positive pressure pulses included, corresponding to lesser number of new bubble nucleation, growth, and coalescence process. The bubble slug in the capillary tube is very standard with the smooth vapor/liquid interface. The cycle periods and the pumping flow rates are given versus the heating powers...|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in {{the nuclear}} {{industry}} is of great importance from a safety precaution point ofview (McElhaney, 1995). Choosing <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> for these high-pressurized systems comes with agreat challenge. The valves causes what is called <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slams when closing, leading to a hugepressure wave traveling through the system. To prevent this from happening calculations have to bedone {{to see what kind}} of forces are generated during a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam.

The emulsified oil then flows into the vacuum separation chamber through the oil-taking control valve and the oil-taking solenoid valve. After the pressure is increased by the oil circulating pump, the emulsified oil is heated by the heater and the temperature gradually increases. After stabilizing temperature using the temperature controller, an oil mist cover is formed because of the positive pressure {{at the top of the}} vacuum chamber by the atomizer. This mist can prevent the rise of oil bubbles in the vacuum separation chamber and can avoid the injection of the vacuum pump of oil during the operation. Thus, antifoaming is automatically prevented. After atomization, the oil reenters the efficient separation tower, in which an oil film is again formed. The developed area of the oil film significantly increases. The water in the oil rapidly transforms from liquid into vapor. When nitrogen is at the bottom of the vacuum separation chamber, the water vapor in oil is removed and expelled from the top.

40|$|A semi-empirical {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to describe the}} dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. The method is based on parameterized valve models and dimensionless valve characteristics, which may be obtained from experiments. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is considered as a black box with certain input and output characteristics. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure and associated pressure surges are the dominant phenomena. Undamped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> may {{be considered as a}} special case of damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> Much attention is paid to the description of the hydrodynamic (fluid) forces on the internal, moving valve elements. These elements may be considered as translating or rotating bodies with (at least) one plane of symmetry. The equations of motion for the constrained, unsteady motion of such a body in an unconfined, unsteady fluid flow are based on the dynamical theory of Kirchhoff, extended to an unsteady fluid flow. The equivalent equations for a body in a confined fluid are based on Lagrange's method of generalized coordinates. A general (dimensionless) valve equation of motion is developed, which is valid for most of the existing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> types. Basic differential equations are derived for the transient flow in a pipe with constant initial flow deceleration. The equations are applied to describe the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure under reflection free and reflecting boundary conditions in the form of dimensionless, analytical equations. The theory is based on conventional waterhammer theory. The pipe and valve equations are coupled via the integral form of the momentum equation. The uncoupled and coupled, (dimensionless) pipe and valve equations show formally which (dimensionless) variables and valve, system and fluid parameters are relevant to the dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. In that sense they are used in a dimensional analysis to develop (dimensionless) valve characteristics and dynamic scale laws. Based on the dimensionless valve characteristics, models for undamped and damped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> are developed and implemented in the waterhammer computer code CVWP (<b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Waterhammer Program). Experiments are performed in the test facility at Delft Hydraulics to measure several valve characteristics of weakly and strongly damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> The dynamic scale laws are validated by means of numerical simulations. The valve models are validated against experimental data. The study has been performed within the <b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Research Project (CVRP) ...|$|R

Although it had been recognized by component experts that the two most significant factors in determining <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> performance were valve design (i. e., type) and operating conditions, no industry data was available relative to the former. In cooperation with the Nuclear Industry <b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Group (NIC), ORNL has reviewed and analyzed <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> failures from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations` (INPOs`) Nuclear Plant Reliability Database System (NPRDS) according to several parameters,including valve type.

40|$|This study {{systematically}} {{explores the}} relatively neglected surge protection strategy of installing an in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> at an intermediate point within a pipeline. The in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is selected to isolate {{part of the}} system from a high-pressure source of fluid subsequent to a low-pressure water hammer event, in this way greatly reducing or eliminating any return surge. A typical application involving a pipeline with an isolated high point within its profile is numerically investigated. The low pressure transient event first opens an air-vacuum valve at the lineâs high point. However, the violent expulsion and collapse of this air cavity is thereafter avoided, and thus the resulting water hammer pressures dramatically reduced, by an in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> installed between the high point and the downstream reservoir. The effectiveness of the surge protection is shown to depend on hydraulics and topology of the line (particularly the position of the high point), on the position of the <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> and on both the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> Although the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> only protects the lower (normally upstream) portion of the line from the return surge, the transient response of the remainder of the line can sometimes be improved through installing either a bypass around the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> or by perforating the <b>check</b> <b>valveâs</b> working element.
