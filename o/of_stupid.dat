25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy. I {{certainly}} won’t find fault with a man like that. After all, there’s an endless supply <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> fools. The way I see it, if there’s no great shame in it, it's all right.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the character}} from both professionals and fans has been positive. In his DVD review for DVD Verdict, Bill Treadway called Patrick [...] "the village idiot, who sometimes gives SpongeBob some really bad advice, {{but he is a}} loyal friend and that's something we don't see much of these days." [...] He said, [...] "Patrick is the definition <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> and his antics will have you laughing out loud." [...] In a review published in 2007, Peter Keepnews of The New York Times said, [...] "Patrick is a popular character, and the new episodes illustrate why: He is unfailingly enthusiastic, touchingly loyal and absolutely undeterred by his intellectual limitations. Hilariously voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, he is not just an endearing comic creation but a role model for idiots everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, while Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Miliband {{attended}} the UK premiere {{of climate change}} film The Age <b>of</b> <b>Stupid,</b> where he was ambushed by actor Pete Postlethwaite, who threatened to return his OBE and vote for any party other than Labour if the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station were {{to be given the}} go-ahead by the government. A month later, Miliband announced to the House of Commons a change to the government's policy on coal-fired power stations, saying that any potential new coal-fired power stations would be unable to receive government consent unless they could demonstrate that {{they would be able to}} effectively capture and bury 25% of the emissions they produce immediately, with a view to seeing that rise to 100% of emissions by 2025. This, a government source told the Guardian, effectively represented [...] "a complete rewrite of UK energy policy for the future".|$|E

Wolk also noted [...] "many intersecting things wrong on this show and with Britney that I can't possibly prioritize them". Laura Fries of Variety perceived the series as [...] "a visual assault of nauseating camera angles, likely to upset even the most desensitized TV viewer". Hayley Butler of Jam! gave the final episode of the series a mixed review, saying it [...] "was full of tear-jerking moments" [...] and [...] "the only episode not full <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> jokes, childish behaviour and Britney's thoughts on life", commenting that Spears and Federline wedding scenes [...] "looked {{to be a very}} emotional and touching event". Butler also wondered [...] "if they feel their show served its purpose".|$|E

500|$|Love {{claimed she}} was misquoted by Hirschberg, and {{asserted}} {{that she had}} immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant. Record executive Danny Goldberg, who {{was a friend of}} Love and Cobain's, defended her against the claims, and commented on her decision to be profiled in the piece: [...] "Courtney had this yearning for mass-culture acceptability and just couldn't say no to something like that. I had a sense of foreboding about it, but I had no idea it as gonna be as bad as it was. [...] done a lot <b>of</b> <b>stupid,</b> self-destructive things, but I don't believe she screwed around with her pregnancy. Those allegations were anonymous." [...] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state, suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.|$|E

Plus, she wasn't a trumped-up sex symbol. She was herself on stage. That appealed to me. It looked like something I could do. You didn't have to look {{like all the other}} singers." [...] Iyall was highly critical of the music of the day and found inspiration in other mediums. [...] "I hate rock and roll right now. It's turned into some new kind <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> [...] religion... I'd rather listen to Billie Holiday, maybe Tom Waits. [...] Actually, I'll admit I like The Bangles – they have a great sound. But I'd just as soon read novels or paint pictures as listen to music. I love language – plain speech, used in an enigmatic, subliminal way; I'm not [...] much tied to the literal." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E

The employees decide not to tell David about Andy's unapproved absence out of gratitude for Andy's past kindnesses, but at the meeting they cannot resist crafting made-up recent events in the hope that he will blow his own cover. However, when David meets with Andy he is almost completely oblivious to Andy's erroneous statements, and Andy quickly catches on to what the employees are up to.|$|E
500|$|The Treehouse of Horror episodes {{are often}} among the top-rated episodes of their seasons {{and many of}} the Treehouse of Horrors have {{generally}} been well-received by fans. However, like The Simpsons itself, critics have noted a decline in the quality of the later episodes. In its first airing, [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] finished with a 15.7 Nielsen rating and a 25% audience share and would lose to The Cosby Show. It was said that it [...] "set a level of excellence that viewers never expected creator Matt Groening to repeat", although it was also described as [...] "kind <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> and unsatisfying". [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] is considered the best episode by several critics: it finished ninth on Entertainment Weeklys top 25 The Simpsons episode list, fifth on AskMen.com's [...] "Top 10: Simpsons Episodes" [...] list, and was named best episode of the sixth season by IGN.com. In 2006, James Earl Jones, who guest starred in [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] and [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] was named seventh on IGN's [...] "Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|Griswold {{continued}} {{editing and}} contributing literary criticism for various publications, both full-time and freelance, including 22months from July 1, 1850, to April 1, 1852, with The International Magazine. There, {{he worked with}} contributors including Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Mary E. Hewitt and John R. Thompson. In the November 10, 1855, issue of The Criterion, Griswold anonymously reviewed {{the first edition of}} Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, declaring: [...] "It is impossible to image how any man's fancy could have conceived such a mass <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> filth". Griswold charged that Whitman was guilty of [...] "the vilest imaginings and shamefullest license", a [...] "degrading, beastly sensuality." [...] Referring to Whitman's poetry, Griswold said he left [...] "this gathering of muck to the laws which... must have the power to suppress such gross obscenity." [...] Whitman later included Griswold's review in a new edition of Leaves of Grass. He ended his review with a phrase in Latin referring to [...] "that horrible sin, among Christians not to be named", the stock phrase long associated with Christian condemnations of sodomy. Griswold was the first person in the 19th century to publicly point to and stress the theme of erotic desire and acts between men in Whitman's poetry. More attention to that aspect of Whitman's poetry would only surface late in the 19th century.|$|E

500|$|Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall cited [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] as {{the best}} future-set episode of The Simpsons since the first one, [...] "Lisa's Wedding". He noted that it was [...] "the {{emotional}} side of things" [...] that made the episode successful, such as the dissatisfaction Bart and Lisa feel because of their disconnection with the children, and also Homer's transformation into a [...] "very wise, sweet guy after somehow surviving into old age." [...] Sepinwall particularly praised {{the scene at the}} cryonics facility where Homer encourages the children to give Bart another chance as [...] "really sweet", and he described the idea of a frozen Grampa as [...] "a clever variation on the very familiar joke of how Homer and the family neglect [...] because he's such a pain in the ass." [...] Sepinwall also commended the episode for its jokes about the future, highlighting the scenes revolving around air travel as well as the scenes showing Krusty as [...] "the Andy Rooney of 2041" [...] and Ralph Wiggum as [...] "an endless series <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> clones who keep killing one another." [...] In February 2012, [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was listed by Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine as one of [...] "Nine Latter-Day Simpsons Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics". He noted that the [...] "reconciliations between Bart and Lisa and their kids are moving." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E

2500|$|Sainte-Beuve {{puts down}} his {{somewhat}} hard and unsympathetic outlook {{quite as much}} to the uninspiring circumstances of these days as to the general character of his time. He cannot be said to have been early disenchanted, for he never seems to have had any illusions; he grew up with a single passion, [...] "the hatred <b>of</b> <b>stupid</b> books." [...] He was educated at the Collège de Beauvais, and was then sent to study theology at the Sorbonne. He exchanged theology for law, however, and was called to the bar on December 4, 1656. From the profession of law, after a short trial, he recoiled in disgust, complaining bitterly of the amount of chicanery which passed under the name of law and justice. His father died in 1657, leaving him a small fortune, and thenceforward he devoted himself to letters.|$|E
