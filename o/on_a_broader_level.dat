[...] Mountain horses are short and particularly strong. [...] Steppe horses are the tallest, fastest variety of Mongol horses. [...] Specifically, the eastern Khentii Province and Sükhbaatar Province steppe provinces are widely considered to produce the fastest horses in the country. [...] Darkhad horses are known for their strength. A Darkhad horse weighing only 250kg can carry a load of 300kg—the equivalent of carrying another horse on its back.
