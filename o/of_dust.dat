40|$|The {{function}} of the peripheral plasma in the Large Helical Device (LHD) on transport <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> is investigated using a dust transport simulation code (DUSTT) in a non-axisymmetric geometry. The simulation shows that the transport <b>of</b> the <b>dusts</b> {{is dominated by the}} plasma flow (mainly by ion drag force) formed in the peripheral plasma. The trajectories <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> are investigated in two probable situations: release <b>of</b> spherical iron <b>dusts</b> from the inboard side of the torus, and drop <b>of</b> spherical carbon <b>dusts</b> from a divertor plate installed near an edge of an upper port. The trajectories in these two situations are calculated in various sized dust cases. From a viewpoint of protection of the main plasma from dust penetration, it proves that there are two functions in the LHD peripheral plasma. One is sweeping <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> by the effect of the plasma flow in the divertor legs, and another one is evaporation/sublimation <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> by heat load onto the dusts in the ergodic layer...|$|R
40|$|Received 18. 02. 2013; {{accepted}} in revised form 07. 05. 2013 A technology of sands with water glass hardened by liquid esters is a cheap and ecologic method of producing moulding sands. Due to these advantages, {{this technology is}} still very important in several foundry plants for production of heavy iron and steel castings. Reclamation of the mixed moulding and core sands generates significant amounts <b>of</b> <b>dusts,</b> which require further treatments for their reuse. The results of investigations of a pressureless granulation <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> generated in the dry mechanical reclamation process of the mixture consisting in app. 90 % of moulding sands from the Floster S technology and in 10 % of core sands with phenolic resin resol type, are presented in the hereby paper. Investigations were aimed at obtaining granulates of the determined dimensional and strength parameters. Granules were formed from the mixture <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> consisting <b>of</b> 75 mass % <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> after the reclamation of sands mixture and of 25 mass% <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> from bentonite sands processing plant.

In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing.

Within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46million years because of the X-ray emission from the core.

The multiplicity and complexity of sources <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>dusts</b> in urban regions (e. g. industrial complexes composed of a variety of industrial processes, automobiles, construction activities etc.) has put forward the need of source apportionment of these sources indicating their contribution to specific environmental receptor.

5|$|The inner {{boundary}} of the debris disk was estimated at 11â³Â±2â³, or 70â100AU. The disk <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production of the amount <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> observed {{over the course of}} Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting massâestimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter. Hence it is {{more likely to have been}} produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.|$|E

At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. On occasions - such as when the Earth passes through a comet's orbital plane, a tail pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails called the antitail may be seen.|$|E
