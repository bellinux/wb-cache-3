5|$|Although much of Thoughts {{is devoted}} to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few {{passages}} anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), such as her poignant description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.|$|E
5|$|Since many Soviet {{soldiers}} had lost {{family and friends}} during the German invasion and partial occupation of the USSR (about 17 million Soviet civilians plus 10 million Soviet soldiers died in World War II, more {{than in any other}} country), many felt a desire for vengeance. Murders of Axis prisoners of war and German civilians are known from cases at Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved Ostarbeiter ("Eastern workers") were freed, and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> and deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians.|$|E

5|$|Despite his improvements, Alexios did {{not have}} enough {{manpower}} to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor. Having been impressed by the abilities of the Norman cavalry at Dyrrhachium, he sent ambassadors west to ask for reinforcements from Europe. This mission was deftly accomplished– at the Council of Piacenza in 1095, Pope Urban II was impressed by Alexios's appeal for help, which spoke <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of the Christians of the east and hinted at a possible union of the eastern and western churches. Pope Urban was concerned with increasing restlessness of the martial nobility in Western Europe, who, currently deprived of major enemies, were causing chaos throughout the countryside. Alexios's appeal offered a means not only to redirect the energy of the knights to benefit the Church, but also to consolidate the authority of the Pope over all Christendom and to gain the east for the See of Rome.|$|E

Rt. Rev. T. F. Middleton, the first Anglican Bishop in India inaugurated the church, and thought the new church was “handsomer than anyone in England” 2.

25|$|Equiano's {{personal}} {{account of}} slavery, his journey of advancement, and his {{experiences as a}} black immigrant caused a sensation on publication.

Some readers felt shame at learning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> he had endured.|$|E
25|$|In The Hellenic Religion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suffering</b> God (1904), and Dionysus and Early Dionysianism (1921), {{the poet}} Vyacheslav Ivanov elaborates {{the theory of}} Dionysianism, tracing the origins of literature, and tragedy in particular, to ancient Dionysian mysteries. Károly Kerényi characterizes Dionysus as {{representative}} of the psychological life force (Greek Zoê). Other psychological interpretations place Dionysus' emotionality in the foreground, focusing on the joy, terror or hysteria associated with the god. Sigmund Freud specified that his ashes {{should be kept in}} an Ancient Greek vase painted with Dionysian scenes from his collection, which remains on display at Golders Green Crematorium in London.|$|E

With regard to atrocities, other advocacy groups have also chimed in to protest a perceived over-emphasis on the Holocaust.|$|E

25|$|The {{thirteen}} civilians—men, {{women and}} children–have been rounded up for slaughter or enslavement. They are harshly {{presented to the}} viewer in an almost flat plane; slumped, disordered, and unevenly distributed. Their arrangement principally comprises two human pyramids–one pyramid {{to the left of}} the canvas culminating in the man with the red fez, and the other to the right culminating in the mounted soldier. The area between the two pyramids contains two soldiers in shadow, and two more Greek victims–a young man embraced by a young woman. The two men in the pyramid to the left are injured. The man at the front is on or near to the point of death, and the man poised at the top of the group appears unable to prepare a defence for himself. His gaze is in the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> children in front of him, but it does not fall on them. This seeming detachment, coupled with the vacant stare of the dying man lend to this group an air of despondent resignation.|$|E
25|$|New South Wales {{had been}} the {{dominant}} team in the Sheffield Shield and in 1965–66 would win their fourteenth title since the war, but their last for fifteen years. Mike Smith won the toss and only Peter Parfitt failed to pass 50 in the MCC's 527/6 declared. Bob Barber (90) and Eric Russell (93) added 150 for the first wicket in the morning session, until Barber underestimated Booth's fielding, and was run out going for a century before lunch. Colin Cowdrey and Jim Parks both made 63, Smith 59 and the spinners Fred Titmus (80 not out) and Dave Allen (54 not out) made 121 runs for the seventh wicket. The leg-spinner Peter Philpott was the best <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> bowlers with 3/126 and the wicketkeeper Brian Taber took three catches, stumped Russell and ran out Parfitt. The New South Wales reply relied heavily on a third wicket stand of 142 between the 19-year-old Doug Walters (129) and his captain Brian Booth (80), who was standing in for the injured Bobby Simpson. They were out for 288 thanks to the fast bowling of Jeff Jones (3/76), before he was banned from bowling by Umpire Burgess because he was running down the wicket and leaving a groove that could be exploited by the bowlers. The spin of Titmus (3/54) and Allen (2/75) took over and Smith made NSW follow on. Grahame Thomas top scored with 56, but they were out for 240 to Titmus (5/45) and Allen (2/47). The batsmen Barry Rothwell bowled the only over and had Barber out for a duck, but Parfitt made the two runs required and the MCC won by 9 wickets. It {{was the first time}} that the MCC had defeated New South Wales since Douglas Jardine beat them by an innings in 1932–33.|$|E
