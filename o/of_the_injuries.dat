5|$|On July 9, 2006 at 4:45 pm, a {{structural}} {{failure in the}} 'Rose Bowl' section of the ride created a bump on the track that caused a train {{to come to an}} abrupt stop. Twenty-seven injuries were reported in the accident and rescue units were required to evacuate the riders. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> were of the chest or neck. Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of the accident, and two were admitted. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> were life-threatening. After an inspection the following day, the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood. The ride was shut down {{for an extended period of}} time, while the park worked with the State of Ohio to complete a full investigation. The park completed repairs of the ride but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again. The park indicated that the ride would not reopen until the 2007 season.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1996 regular season, the Nebraska Cornhuskers boasted the No. 4 rushing offense in Division I-A college football, averaging 292 rushing yards per game and 422 overall yards per game. Despite those figures, the Cornhuskers' two leading rushers were hampered by injury and their participation was in doubt. Ahman Green, who led the Nebraska offense with 155 carries, 917 rushing yards, and seven touchdowns, suffered a stress fracture in his foot during the second-to-last Nebraska regular-season game. The No. 2 rusher, DeAngelo Evans, had 776 rushing yards and a team-high 14 rushing touchdowns, but was limited by a groin injury. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries,</b> Damon Benning, who earned 465 yards and seven touchdowns during the regular seasons, was anticipated to see significant playing time. Wide receiver Brenden Holbein also suffered an ankle injury in practice, but was able to play.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{violence}} and cannibalism has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered {{by members of the}} Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.|$|E
5|$|Jelena {{was firmly}} {{opposed to the}} pro-Venetian policy of Đurađ II and his sale of Scutari and other towns to the Venetians. She {{did not like the}} Venetians because they {{obstructed}} the contacts between the Zetan Orthodox Metropolitanate and the Patriarchate of Peć, cut off Orthodox monasteries around Lake Skadar from the incomes that they were legally entitled to, and engaged in an aggressive trading policy, which significantly reduced Zeta's earnings. Even before the First Scutari War, she was in a dispute with the Venetians over the jurisdiction of the Zetan Orthodox Metropolitanate over the Orthodox churches around the river Bojana and the Church of St. Peter in Scutari. The reign of 16-year-old Balša III began in April 1403 when Đurađ II died <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> suffered in November 1402 at the Battle of Tripolje. In this battle Đurađ II supported Stefan Lazarević in an attempt to protect the throne of Serbian Despotate from Đurađ Branković. Jelena had a significant influence on the way Balša III governed Zeta. Because he was a minor when he inherited the throne, she actually governed Zeta as his regent. In a dispute between the Venetians and the Zetan Metropolitan bishop appointed by the Patriarchate of Peć, Balša III followed her instructions and protected the ancient rights of the Serbian church.|$|E

Further, <b>the</b> reactive astrocytes in <b>the</b> immediate vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> increase gene expression, thus compounding <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> other astrocytes and contributing to the heterogeneity.

5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> had {{occurred}} from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
5|$|The Tunisia battle {{sequence}} {{that opened the}} film was the last major sequence filmed. The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg wanted to kill Hitler because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> he suffered in the battle. They began a rough cut in October 2007, and between then and June 2008, there were several test screenings without the battle sequence. By June 2008, the filmmakers felt that {{they knew how to}} adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence. Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations, but the candidates did not meet the aesthetic and economic criteria. The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia. Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg's injuries realistic, not enough was left for solely computer-generated fighter planes. Singer instead used two P-40 Warhawks in the battle sequence. The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany, the rebuilding of sets, and lost shooting days, but German tax rebates tempered the growth. The studio reported its final production budget to be $75 million, but competing studios believed it to be closer to $90 million.|$|E

50|$|Because {{there are}} so many factors that {{contribute}} to {{the success or failure of}} neural tissue engineering, there are many difficulties that arise in using neural tissue engineering to treat CNS and PNS <b>injuries.</b> First, <b>the</b> therapy needs to be delivered to <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury.</b> This means that <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> site needs to be accessed by surgery or drug delivery. Both of these methods have inherent risks and difficulties in themselves, compounding the problems associated with the treatments. A second concern is keeping the therapy at <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury.</b> Stem cells have a tendency to migrate out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> site to other sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, thus the therapy is not as effective as it could be as when the cells stay at <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> site. Additionally, <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> stem cells and other morphogens to <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> can cause more harm than good if they induce tumorigenesis, inflammation, or other unforeseen effects.
