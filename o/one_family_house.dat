The designed management strategy aims at regulating the power flow between the generated and the consumed powers of a wind/solar/battery stand-alone system {{in order to}} satisfy the load (<b>one</b> <b>family</b> <b>house).</b> The chosen strategy considers the wind generator (WG) and the photovoltaic panel (PV) as the main energy sources and the battery bank (BS) as storage system. For the power source emergency, it uses the diesel engine (DE) as an additional source. Indeed, the optimal management strategy consists of generating power references for each subsystem. Based on the prediction of weather conditions, these power references are generated with taking into account some constraints related to the reliability of each subsystem. In order to validate the proposed strategy under real situations, measurements of the weather conditions and the power consumption data of an individual house are considered. The simulation results are highlighted to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{enable the}} {{transition}} from fossil fuels as a primary heat source for domestic hot water preparation and space heating solar thermal energy has great potential. The heat from the sun has the disadvantage {{that it is not}} always available when there is a demand. To solve this mismatch a thermal seasonal storage can be used to store excess heat from the summer to the winter when the demand is higher than the supply. Installing a long term thermal storage in a <b>one</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> it needs to be compact and sensible heat storages are not suitable. A latent heat storage with a phase change material (PCM) can provide a more compact way of storing heat. Sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) is a good candidate material as it has a relatively high heat of fusion and in addition it has the ability to supercool to room temperature without solidifying. In this paper results from the test of a solar combi system with a latent heat storage with SAT is presented. The SAT heat storage modules were heated to 80 °C by the solar collectors 53 times in the test period from June to November 2015 and this enabled the modules to supercool. Supercooling was achieved for 39 days for a SAT module after which 11 kWh of heat were discharged...|$|E

40|$|The {{heat pump}} market offers {{a wide variety}} of {{different}} residential heat pumps where most of them utilize refrigerant R- 410 A which has high global warming potential. Considering the fact that global policy starts to focus on issues related to energy efficiency and harmful impact to the environment, it is necessary to investigate over new refrigerants. As an alternative solution is to utilize natural refrigerants, such as ammonia, which has almost zero global warming potential and zero ozone depletion potential. Since the beginning of refrigeration era, ammonia has been used in large capacity systems, whereas no {{attention has been paid to}} residential sector. In this study, small ammonia heat pump with capacity of 8, 4 kW for <b>one</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> has been designed to provide heating of domestic water and space heating via floor system.

Diplomsko delo obravnava opeko kot gradbeni material, ki s svojimi lastnostmi dosega standarde trajnostne arhitekture. V prvem sklopu diplomskega dela smo predstavili razvoj opeke skozi zgodovino, osnovne značilnosti opeke kot gradbenega materiala, vrste opečnih izdelkov ter značilnosti zidanja z opeko. V drugem sklopu naloge so prikazane lastnosti energijsko varčne opeke podjetja Wienerberger in njihovi opečni izdelki. Kot dodatno merilo trajnosti smo primerjali dve različni opeki podjetja Wienerberger, kar smo z analizo dobljenih rezultatov, vključno stroškovni vidik energetske učinkovitosti, preverili na referenčnem primeru stanovanjske hiše Jankovec. Ugotovili smo, da opeka - poleg tega, da zaradi naravnih sestavin brez škodljivih snovi ustvarja ugodno klimo v prostoru – zagotavlja visoko obstojnost ter toplotno in zvočno izolativnost, kar nudi ugodne pogoje za varno in zdravo bivanje.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} design of modern {{domestic}} urban kitchens in Uganda. The research took place in Kampala, which is {{the capital city of}} Uganda. The cultural make up of Kampala residents is diverse; people {{come from all over the}} country of Uganda, as well as beyond. The fieldwork involved investigating daily practices taking place in the domestic urban kitchens of the middle income group. This has been done in order to find out the problems found in using the kitchens so that better designs may be suggested. The thesis addresses mostly, professionals such as architects, who are involved with planning and designing housing, specifically kitchens within them. This work can as well be useful to another country with a similar context to Uganda. It is worth mentioning that kitchen studies started to take place in developed countries about one hundred years ago, yet, they have never been initiated in Uganda, until this moment. The thesis indicates that a kitchen is an important part in a home, which is a busy area, thus demanding a lot of attention in order to be able to get the needed design requirements. While the findings of the thesis are based on the contemporary urban life in Uganda, it is not known what the future will hold; so suggestions are made to benefit contemporary needs. Practices in the urban kitchen have been investigated within the conceptual framework of tradition, modernity, culture and identity in connection with the kitchen designs in place. The research has been motivated by contradictions appearing to take place between modern kitchen designs and the actual practices taking place in them. Generally, the evolution of the kitchen design in some of the developed nations followed the trend parallel to developments in lifestyles, industrialization or women’s emancipation. Kitchen studies made in developing nations have investigated the particular contexts within those nations. So this thesis fills the knowledge gap which exists, as such studies are nonexistent within the Ugandan context. The study is qualitative by engaging the case study methodology. Here, the case is the interaction between the household, the kitchen design, the activities in the kitchen and the house type in place. Interviews have been conducted with household members in the studied cases, as well as with key informants. The main areas of study have been the way food is prepared, cooked and stored in an urban kitchen, and how these activities take place in a mixed situation of tradition and modernity. Seven cases in total have been investigated. The results indicate disharmony between the designs in place and the activities that take place in them. People have to negotiate and reinterpret spaces in their kitchens and around them in order to meet their needs. Some of the most important outcomes from this research is not to let modernity be disruptive but rather to allow the change from tradition be gradual. The thesis endeavors to blend the two phenomena of tradition and modernity so as to create a balance in design and end with better functioning kitchens. One example of such is shown for a <b>one</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> on a plot. QC 20140121 </p...|$|E
