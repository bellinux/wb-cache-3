5|$|The section {{summarizes}} {{the concepts of}} population genetics, a branch of evolutionary theory combining Mendelian genetics and natural selection in mathematical form to explain the pressures <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> societies. In particular, altruism, self-sacrificing behaviour, would die out unless something such as kin or group selection maintains it.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful in {{scientific}} studies <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. Kestrel metabolic rate {{has been found}} to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25‚Å∞ C. Kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> rights extremism, {{concluding that the}} phenomenon is a complex one, and that {{a full understanding of}} individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism. He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E

Shiseido, Japan's largest cosmetics manufacturer, announced in 2013 that it would stop testing cosmetics <b>on</b> <b>animals.</b> [...] In 2015, Humane Society International began leading a Be Cruelty-Free campaign to pressure the National Diet to ban testing cosmetics <b>on</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R
5|$|In some countries, geese {{and ducks}} are force-fed to produce livers with an {{exceptionally}} high fat {{content for the}} production of foie gras. Over 75% of world production of this product occurs in France, with lesser industries in Hungary and Bulgaria and a growing production in China. Foie gras is considered a luxury {{in many parts of the}} world, but the process of feeding the birds in this way is banned in many countries <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> welfare grounds.|$|E
5|$|Joshua Ryan Hutcherson (born October 12, 1992) is an American actor. A {{native of}} Kentucky, Hutcherson began his acting {{career in the}} early 2000s and {{appeared}} in several commercials and minor film and television roles before landing his first major role in 2002 in the pilot episode of House Blend.

5|$|People {{would travel}} long {{distances}} {{to see him}} (on one occasion, a party of14 travelled to London from Guernsey), and many would spend hours speaking with him <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> breeding. A life-sized waxwork of Lambert was displayed in London, where it became extremely popular. Daniel Lambert soon became a popular subject with cartoonists, who often depicted him as John Bull. He mixed well with the upper classes, and on one occasion met King GeorgeIII. The King's and Lambert's reactions to this meeting are not recorded.|$|E

5|$|Prolonged skin {{contact with}} {{glacial acetic acid}} may result in tissue destruction. Inhalation {{exposure}} (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.|$|E
5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1962, the zoo has focused <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> {{conservation}} efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the Arabian oryx, black-footed ferret, Mexican wolf, Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary for {{animals that are}} no longer breeding (for instance the African painted dogs at the zoo), and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the California condor).|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} the muscles and {{skeleton}} is described in the Hippocratic Corpus, an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors.

5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} is a {{predominantly}} seed and grain eating bird which feeds {{on the ground}} in flocks, often with house sparrows, finches, or buntings. It eats weed seeds, such as chickweeds and goosefoot, spilled grain, and it may also visit feeding stations, especially for peanuts. It will also feed on invertebrates, especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> food; it takes insects, woodlice, millipedes, centipedes, spiders and harvestmen.|$|E

5|$|Beddard (1858‚Äì1925) was an English {{zoologist}} {{specializing in}} Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, leeches and nematode worms to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. His decision {{to write an}} accessible book <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time when}} scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was part of an ongoing debate among zoologists about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far other forces ‚Äì such as the direct action of light ‚Äì might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of Animals had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Chicken now {{provides}} some 20% {{of the animal}} protein eaten by the world's human population {{in the form of}} meat and eggs. Chickens are often raised intensively in battery farms; this facilitates production but has been criticised <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> welfare grounds. Other species including ducks, geese, pheasants, guineafowl and turkeys are significant economically around the world. Less commonly-raised species such as the ostrich are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in cholesterol; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{insects that}} {{parasitise}} common starlings include the louse-fly Omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly Camus hemapterus. The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and {{lives on the}} fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers, which feed <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> material such as faeces or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} common starlings, but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode Syngamus trachea. This worm moves from the lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transverses.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of animal rights advocates adopt vegetarian or vegan diets. They may also avoid clothes made of animal skins, such as leather shoes, and will not use products known to contain animal byproducts. Goods containing ingredients that have been tested <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> are also avoided where possible. Company-wide boycotts are common. The Procter & Gamble corporation, for example, tests many of its products <b>on</b> <b>animals,</b> leading many animal rights advocates to boycott the company's products entirely, whether tested <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> or not.|$|R

5|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} {{a small group}} of Cuban iguanas was {{released}} from a zoo on Isla Magueyes, southwest of Puerto Rico, forming an independent free-ranging feral population. As of 2000, there has been talk of removing or relocating this population of iguanas by the US Department of Interior. This feral population is the source for 90% of the captive Cuban iguanas held in private collections and was the source for part of a study <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins, a biologist at Indiana University.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have also}} become popular in Western culture in recent years.
