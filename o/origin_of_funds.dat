Government of India passed the Money Laundering Act 2002 for controlling it. Hence the Bank officials are more vigilant in knowing their customers. For this purpose Reserve Bank of India provided guidelines to all commercial banks to record the details of customers as guidelines for ‘Know Your Customer Programme. ’ It can help the banks to avoid the Reputation Risk, compliance Risk, and legal Risk.

40|$|Money {{laundering}} is {{a process}} to conceal the true <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> that were originally derived from illegal activities. Because it often involves criminal activities, financial institutions {{have the responsibility to}} detect and inform about them to the appropriate government agencies in a timely manner. However, detecting money laundering is not an easy job because of the huge number of transactions that take place each day. The usual approach adopted by financial institutions is to extract some summary statistics from the transaction history and do a thorough and time-consuming investigation on those suspicious accounts. In this article, we propose an active learning via sequential design method for prioritization to improve the process of money laundering detection. The method uses a combination of stochastic approximation and D-optimal designs to judiciously select the accounts for investigation. The sequential nature of the method helps to decide the optimal prioritization criterion with minimal time and effort. A case study with real banking data is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. A simulation study shows the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, as well as its robustness to model assumptions...|$|E
30|$|By {{virtue of}} the {{so-called}} layering, criminals effort to hide the source of illegal proceeds through a massive amount of transactions by circulating around black money (Schneider and Windischbauer 2008). Layering is considered of creating a network of financial transactions {{that in terms of}} volume, complexity, and frequency, complexity and volume mostly are similar to legal financial activity. By dint of the serial transactions and parallel networks, it becomes increasingly hard to reconstruct a paper trail. In the layering process, offshore financial centers perform a crucial function. In this approach, launderers try to conceal real <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> by performing wire transfer into a financial or banking system through offshore accounts (Buchanan 2004).|$|R

50|$|The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> {{can have}} serious {{implications}} for the legitimacy of NGOs. In recent decades NGOs have increased their numbers and range of activities to a level where they have become increasingly dependent on {{a limited number of}} donors. Consequently, competition has increased for funding, as have the expectations of the donors themselves. This runs the risk of donors adding conditions which can threaten the independence of NGOs; for example, an over-dependence on official aid has the potential to dilute “the willingness of NGOs to speak out on issues which are unpopular with governments”. In these situations NGOs are being held accountable by their donors, which can erode rather than enhance their legitimacy, a difficult challenge to overcome. Some commentators have also argued that the changes in NGO funding sources has ultimately altered their functions.|$|R

40|$|The German {{expression}} “Begleitforschung” is {{a concept}} with multiple meanings that {{are the subject of}} controversial discussion, and has no equivalent in English. It could be directly translated as “accompanying research”, and covers research activities which are commonly covered by the abbreviations EHS (Environment, Health, and Safety) and ELSI (ethical, legal, and social issues). Although there is no direct translation, research with the purpose of “Begleitforschung” is financed and carried out in almost all industrialised countries. In this dossier the variety of the meanings and uses of “accompanying research” is elaborated. As the outcome of this analysis, it is argued that the concept only makes sense in a particular political context and cannot be deduced from any disciplinary perspective. It is a relational notion which seeks to express the ratio between the efforts applied to R&D and the efforts made to explore and analyse social aspects which could be related to this technology. Despite practical difficulties, {{due to the fact that}} a general criterion (such as <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding)</b> is not sufficient, it is only possible to decide on a case by case basis whether or not a research activity can be identified as “accompanying research”. The dossier ends with a plea for a differentiated use of the notion and for an explicit specification of what kind of research is meant...|$|R
