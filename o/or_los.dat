5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVP's by that time. Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles. He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played. The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from his injury, Serevi was {{named in the}} Fiji sevens squad in January 2004. This was despite a rule enforced by coach Senivalati Laulau that to be eligible to play, one must attend the team's trials. After being named in the training squad, Serevi was not selected for the squad for the Wellington <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles legs of the IRB World Sevens Series. He then missed selection for the team to play in Hong Kong {{for the second year}} in a row. Pauliasi Tabulutu replaced Laulau as Fiji's coach and recalled Serevi to play in the Bordeaux Sevens. Serevi then played in the London leg of the Sevens Series – his last leg of the year.|$|E
5|$|Production {{originated}} at {{the studios}} of PBS affiliate WHYY-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. WHYY offered Nickelodeon their newly opened production wing to use, and Nickelodeon felt Philadelphia was a better location to initially produce Double Dare because of its lower production costs, instead of cities like New York <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles where national television production is more common. The 65-episode first season was recorded in a 23-day period beginning September 18, 1986. Double Dare premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986. New episodes aired weekdays at 5:30p.m. ET during the original series' run on Nickelodeon. After {{the success of the}} first 65 episodes, a second 65-episode season was ordered.|$|E

25|$|Ratings for the Game of the Week {{had dropped}} {{from an average}} of 6.1 in 1984 to 5.5 in 1988 and an average of 4.8 by July 1989. According to a Major League Baseball report, an average of fewer than five million {{households}} viewed the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week in 1988. In an effort to push the ratings higher, NBC tried to feature a club from one of the major media markets. Of the 32 games it aired during 1988, only three did not feature a club from New York City, Chicago, <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Without a clear {{successor}} of Costilla Sánchez, his faction – the Metros – {{could come}} to an end, although it is still likely {{that there are other}} old-crime boses of lesser importance still trying to keep the Gulf Cartel standing. With the recent arrest of a Gulf Cartel representative in Colombia, the drug business could be disrupted even further. One clear benefactor of the fall of the Gulf Cartel is its rival group, Los Zetas. It is also possible that the several within the Gulf Cartel may decide to join the Sinaloa Cartel <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> Zetas, although the latter seems unlikely given the bitter sentiment both groups have planted.|$|E
25|$|In , ABC {{returned}} to baseball broadcasting {{with a series}} of late-afternoon Saturday games. Jack Buck and Carl Erskine were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season. ABC typically did three games a week. Two of the games were always from the Eastern or Central Time Zone. The late games (no doubleheaders) were usually San Francisco Giants <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers' home games. However, the Milwaukee Braves used to start many of their Saturday home games late in the afternoon. So if the Giants and Dodgers were both the road at the same time, ABC still would be able to show a late game.|$|E

25|$|While not {{on or near}} any {{fault line}} like San Francisco <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles, Mexico City is {{vulnerable}} to earthquakes. The main {{reason for this is}} the surface geology of the area, especially the downtown area. The city was originally built on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, and Aztec rulers built dikes to prevent flooding while Spanish colonial rulers later drained the lakes in response to major flooding. The near surface geology of this area is classified into three sections: the old lake bed which is soft clay from volcanic ash with a high water content, a piedmont area, much of which is capped by 5 to 30 meters of lava less than 2,500 years old, and an old river delta area.|$|E
25|$|Atlanta-based OutKast proved one of {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} Hip-Hop groups from outside of New York City <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles. In the 1990s and 2000s, Atlanta emerged as the leading center of urban music. Artists like TLC, Usher, 112, T.I., Ludacris, YoungBloodZ, OutKast, Goodie Mob (as well as the Dungeon Family music collective of which both are members), and producers like Organized Noize, L.A. Reid, and Jermaine Dupri, the later of whom founded the successful record labels LaFace and SoSo Def, have blurred musical boundaries by blending R singing with Hip-Hop production. More recently, Atlanta is also known as a center of crunk music, an electric bass-driven club music, whose most visible practitioner has been Atlanta-based producer/hype man/rapper Lil Jon. Before moving to Atlanta, Young Jeezy lived in Macon, Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2011–12 NBA season, the Hornets were {{considering}} trade offers for Chris Paul. Paul eventually requested a trade to the New York Knicks. The Hornets looked at many teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors as trade partners, but Paul {{had made it}} clear he wanted to be traded to New York <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles. A three-team trade involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets was agreed upon, but commissioner David Stern vetoed the trade. On December 14, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Clippers that would send Paul to L.A. in exchange for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and a first-round draft pick acquired by the Clippers from a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2004.|$|E
25|$|MIPS I has {{instructions}} for signed and unsigned integer multiplication and division. These instructions source their operands from two GPRs and write their results {{to a pair}} of 32-bit registers called HI and LO, since they may execute separately from (and concurrently with) the other CPU instructions. For multiplication, the high- and low-order halves of the 64-bit product is written to HI and LO (respectively). For division, the quotient is written to LO and the remainder to HI. To access the results, a pair of instructions (Move from HI and Move from LO) is provided to copy the contents of HI <b>or</b> <b>LO</b> to a GPR. These instructions are interlocked: reads of HI and LO do not proceed past an unfinished arithmetic instruction that will write to HI and LO. Another pair of instructions (Move to HI <b>or</b> Move to <b>LO)</b> copies the contents of a GPR to HI and LO. These instructions are used to restore HI and LO to their original state after exception handling. Instructions that read HI <b>or</b> <b>LO</b> must be separated by two instructions that do not write to HI <b>or</b> <b>LO.</b>|$|R
