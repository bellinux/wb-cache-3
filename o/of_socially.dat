40|$|Introduction: This thesis {{investigated}} how {{demographic variables}} affected the social well-being amongst ethnic minorities in Central Europe, building on acculturation and social capital theory. Method: The {{sample consisted of}} 543 respondents from six different countries in Central Europe, all stating that they belonged to an ethnic minority group. Data {{was provided by the}} European Social Survey, round 3. Social well-being was measured as two different outcomes; feeling <b>of</b> being <b>socially</b> integrated and civic engagement. Binary and logistic regression was used to assess the predictive power of the demographic variables on the outcome variables. Results: Five of the demographic variables were found to be significantly associated with the feeling <b>of</b> being <b>socially</b> integrated. The strongest predictor was age, indicating that higher age predicts higher levels of feeling <b>of</b> being <b>socially</b> integrated. For the civic engagement model, only parents born in country' and urbanization' were found to be significantly associated with civic engagement. Discussion: The different measures of social well-being; feeling <b>of</b> being <b>socially</b> integrated and civic engagement, were predicted by different variables. The feeling <b>of</b> being <b>socially</b> integrated model gives support to earlier empirical findings, where income, age, and language play an important role. The civic engagement model explained less variance than the feeling <b>of</b> being <b>socially</b> integrated model. This suggests that other variables are more important in the prediction of civic engagement than those included in this study...|$|R

5|$|It is {{also from}} the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known {{illustrations}} of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt. However protobotany, the first pre-scientific written record of plants, did not begin with food; it {{was born out of}} the medicinal literature of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia and India. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation of the poor and uneducated, while medicine was the realm <b>of</b> <b>socially</b> influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity.|$|E
5|$|On {{the seventh}} day after the person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word both for the funeral ale and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual drinking). The funeral ale was a way <b>of</b> <b>socially</b> demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance. If the deceased were a widow or {{the master of the}} homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.|$|E
5|$|While some {{birds are}} {{essentially}} territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators {{is particularly important}} in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This {{has led to the}} development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources. Costs of flocking include bullying <b>of</b> <b>socially</b> subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms <b>of</b> <b>socially</b> aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his governorship, Romney opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions, but advocated tolerance and supported some domestic partnership benefits. A November 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision required the state to recognize same-sex marriages (Goodridge v. Department of Public Health). Romney reluctantly backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned those marriages but still allowed civil unions, viewing it as the only feasible way to accomplish the former. In May 2004, in compliance with the court decision, the governor instructed town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state, he said no marriage licenses were to be issued to those people not planning to move to Massachusetts. In June 2005, Romney abandoned his support for the compromise amendment, stating that it confused voters who opposed both same-sex marriage and civil unions. Instead, he endorsed a ballot initiative led by the Coalition for Marriage and Family (an alliance <b>of</b> <b>socially</b> conservative organizations) that would have banned same-sex marriage and made no provisions for civil unions. In 2004 and 2006, he urged the U.S. Senate to vote in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression <b>of</b> <b>socially</b> established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
