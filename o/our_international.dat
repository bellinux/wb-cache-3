[...] Videos of Warren's questioning became popular on the Internet, amassing {{more than one million}} views in a matter of days. At a Banking Committee hearing in March, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. With her questions being continually dodged, Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: [...] "If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate <b>our</b> <b>international</b> sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night." ...|$|E

500|$|The Workshop had a {{reorganization}} during 1995, {{and dismissed}} about 12 {{percent of its}} staff. During 1998, {{for the first time}} in the series' history, they accepted funds from corporations for Sesame Street and its other programs, a policy criticized by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. [...] The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship, stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies and financial assistance by PBS. Also during 1998, the Workshop invested $25 million in the cable channel Noggin, initiated during 1999 by the Workshop and Viacom's Nickelodeon. During 2000, the profit the CTW earned from the deal, along with its 1998 revenue caused partly by the [...] "Tickle Me Elmo" [...] craze, enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company's rights to the Sesame Street Muppets from the German media company EM.TV, which had acquired Henson earlier that year. The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel. Gary Knell stated, [...] "Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to bring them home. It protected Sesame Street and allowed <b>our</b> <b>international</b> expansion to continue. Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential.

[...] The international aid is tied to a mechanism that will regularly review how it is being spent, and to guarantees from Kabul that it will seriously take on its deep-rooted corruption problems ‚Äì what the conference called a roadmap of accountability.
