40|$|The new {{deposition}} method with laser-induced controlled vacuum arc (Laser-Arc) {{was used}} for the thin film deposition of diamond-like carbon films on different materials (KBr, KCl, NaCl, ZnSe, KRS- 5, Ge, c-Si and Corning 7059). The substrates were cleaned by argon sputtering for 10 minutes at 200 Cel. Carbon films with a thickness between 50 nm and 200 nm deposited at different deposition rates (0. 1 - 1 nm/s) and pulse durations (37 microseconds, 100 microseconds) are studied. A special moveable substrate holder was used to deposit an all-face protective DLC-coating onto the surfaces of the salt substrates and an <b>one-sided</b> <b>coating</b> onto ZnSe-, KRS- 5, Ge and Corning substrates. The coated substrates are characterized by UV / VIS / NIR and an FTIR spectroscopy in the wavenumber range between 400 cm (exp - 1) and 50, 000 cm (exp - 1). Transmission and reflection measurements of the films on Corning 7059 were used to determine the absorption index and the Tauc-gap, that correlates with the deposi tion conditions and the hydrogen content, respectively. In the infrared spectra of the double sided coatings transmittances above 90 % have been observed. However between 1, 000 cm (exp - 1) and 1, 300 cm (exp - 1) the coatings show antireflectance properties. The content of bonded hydrogen was determined by detailed investigations of the absorption curves...|$|E
40|$|Coherent {{transmission}} and reflection coefficients of individual monolayers of spherical alumina {{particles in the}} wavelength range from 0. 3 to 1. 0 Î¼m and multilayers consisting {{of a set of}} such monolayers are computed. Quasi-crystalline approximation of the theory for multiple scattering of waves and the transfer matrix method are used. Three types of coherent transmittance minima inherent to close-packed regular disperse systems are singled out and described. Spectra of a glass plate with <b>one-sided</b> and double-sided <b>coating</b> with alumina particles are analyzed. Systems for creating antireflection coatings, diffuse light scattering structures, selective and nonselective filters of transmitted and reflected light are considered...|$|R
40|$|Implementing antireflection (AR) {{coatings}} in micromorph tandem {{solar cells}} is a challenging {{process in which}} not only more sunlight should get conducted into the cells, but also the current matching between subcells should either be maintained or get improved. In this work, the novel double-layered AR coatings were prepared on either one side or two sides of glass superstrates using hybridized hollow silica nanosphere (HSN) sols. As a result of improvement in light distribution via double-layered AR coatings, the current difference between {{the top and bottom}} subcells was decreased to be 0. 05 mA/cm(2), much smaller than that of untreated cells, 0. 33 mA/cm(2). Furthermore, the cells grown on the two-sided AR coated superstrates demonstrated the largest increases in current densities of top and bottom subcells, 4. 20 % and 7. 53 %, respectively, which were much higher than those of the cells on <b>one-sided</b> AR <b>coated</b> superstrates. The underlying origin was ascribed to the better light trapping induced by multiscale texturing at front boron-doped zinc oxide (BZO) electrodes, which resulted from the conformal growth of BZO on HSNs with unique surface morphologies. The findings provided a practical way to simultaneously realize light distribution and trapping using the two-sided AR coated glass superstrates without any amendment of layers inside micromorph tandem solar cells.
