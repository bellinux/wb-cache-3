5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and <b>of</b> <b>divorce.</b> In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
40|$|Divorces {{and divorce}} rates The number <b>of</b> <b>divorces</b> dropped sharply in 1982, from a {{historic}} high of 1, 213, 000 in 1981 to 1, 170, 000 in 1982. This {{was the first}} {{decline in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>divorces</b> in 20 years.

50|$|Statistics {{from the}} year of 2000 found that divorce on the ground of legal {{separation}} accounted {{for the vast majority}} <b>of</b> <b>divorces</b> at 93.8%, <b>divorce</b> <b>of</b> the ground of de facto separation accounted for 4.3% <b>of</b> <b>divorces,</b> abuse accounted only for 0.3%, while for 1.6% the cause was unknown.|$|R
50|$|One measure <b>of</b> <b>divorces</b> is {{the crude}} divorce rate, {{which is the}} number <b>of</b> <b>divorces</b> per 1,000 population. It can give a general {{overview}} of marriage in an area, {{but it does not}} take people who cannot marry into account. For example, it would include young children who are clearly not of marriageable age in its sample. A related measure is the refined divorce rate which measures the number <b>of</b> <b>divorces</b> per 1,000 women married to men, so that non-married persons, e.g. young children are left out of the rate.|$|R
5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating divorce, {{partially}} {{because of his}} wife's spendthrift habits and {{partially because}} he strongly suspected she was being unfaithful to him. He spoke to his parents about the possibility <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> on March 18, 1960, telling them that Sharon had agreed {{to give him a}} divorce if he allowed her to keep the house and the couple's daughter and paid her $1,000, but the elder Kinnes, devout Mormons, urged James to stay in his marriage. Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E
5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the resurrection of equitable estoppel and his reform <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> law. A common misconception {{is that most of}} his judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea <b>of</b> <b>divorce,</b> however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E

5|$|Lhermitte {{filed for}} and {{received}} a judgment <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection. Following the trial, Lhermitte {{was not able to}} pay for the trial costs, so under Belgian law it fell to her now ex-husband to pick up the bill. This conformed to the Law of Belgium, with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement. The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system. Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be balanced by decency” given the nature of the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed. Kelly and Kate had gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar were in the process <b>of</b> <b>divorce,</b> though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event <b>of</b> <b>divorce,</b> fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, divorces {{were on a}} {{generally}} upward trend from the 1960s until 2002 when they hit a peak of 290,000.

40|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>divorced</b> marriages, as a phenomenon, is {{becoming}} more and more interesting, specially now, at the time of crisis. The question is what leads to this phenomenon. There is a series of factors which could be the cause of divorce; some of them are measurable, some of them are not, some are of economic nature, some are emotional, some sociodemographic, some related to customs etc. This paper tried to present some of these factors and to establish the relation between them and the number <b>of</b> <b>divorced</b> marriages.

5|$|Prior to his marriage, Cooper had {{a series}} of romantic {{relationships}} with leading actresses, beginning in 1927 with Clara Bow, who advanced his career by helping him get one of his first leading roles in Children <b>of</b> <b>Divorce.</b> Bow was also responsible for getting Cooper a role in Wings, which generated an enormous amount of fan mail for the young actor. In 1928, he had a relationship with another experienced actress, Evelyn Brent, whom he met while filming Beau Sabreur. In 1929, while filming The Wolf Song, Cooper began an intense affair with Lupe Vélez, which was the most important romance of his early life. During their two years together, Cooper also had brief affairs with Marlene Dietrich while filming Morocco in 1930 and with Carole Lombard while making I Take This Woman in 1931. During his year abroad in 1931–32, Cooper had an affair with the married Countess Dorothy di Frasso, while staying at her Villa Madama in Rome.|$|E

5|$|Within the year, Edward {{caused a}} {{constitutional}} crisis by announcing {{his desire to}} marry his twice-divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. Mary disapproved <b>of</b> <b>divorce,</b> which was against {{the teaching of the}} Anglican church, and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Stanley Baldwin, as well as the Dominion governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward abdicated. Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings. Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court, but Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately. She saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved and stammering Prince Albert, Duke of York, who ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British dowager queen to do so. Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of his actions.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight months}} over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain {{on a tour}} of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and {{intended}} to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife {{that she was going to}} leave him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat <b>of</b> <b>divorce,</b> Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.|$|E
