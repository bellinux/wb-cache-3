5|$|Chris Metzen {{teamed with}} author Flint Dille and artist Livio Ramondelli {{to create the}} 12-part, {{bi-weekly}} digital comic series Transformers: Autocracy. Autocracy was published by IDW Publishing in 2012. The series focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> just before the Great War. It is set after Megatron Origin, and presents the Decepticons as an established force, sowing dissent across Cybertron primarily through terrorist actions. The series focuses on Orion Pax, an Autobot commander charged with rooting out these cells. Transformers: Autocracy was released as a collected Trade Paperback in July 2012 with a bonus forward authored by Metzen. Autocracy was followed by Transformers: Monstrosity in 2013 and Transformers: Primacy in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{changes in}} the rat {{placenta}} during {{the last third of}} gestation were for the first time assessed by stereology. Fischer female rats were euthanized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 16 or day 19 of gestation, and 35 placentas were collected. Three randomly selected placentas from each group were stereologically analyzed for the absolute volume. The proportion of the glycogenic cells and the trophoblast giant cells (TGC) in the basal part of the placenta was calculated using volume density.  The absolute volume of <b>the</b> rat placenta <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 16 of gestation was determined as 0. 0638 cm 3. The labyrinth comprised 0. 0274 cm 3, the basal plate 0. 0271 cm 3 and the decidua 0. 0093 cm 3. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 19 of gestation, the absolute volume of the placenta was 0. 1627 cm 3, the labyrinth occupied 0. 0922 cm 3, the basal plate 0. 0596 cm 3 and the decidua 0. 0109 cm 3. The volume density of trophoblast giant cells was 0. 174 cm 0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 16 and 0. 107 cm 0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 19 of gestation. The glycogenic cells comprised 0. 379 percentage of <b>the</b> basal plate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 16 and 0. 236 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 19 of gestation. We conclude that the absolute volume of the whole placenta and the labyrinth has increased from <b>day</b> 16 to <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 19 of gestation. In contrast, the volume density of glycogenic cells and trophoblast giant cells was higher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 16 than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 19 of gestation, probably due to the intensive trophoblast invasion during that time. </p...|$|R

5|$|The largest bores occur {{around the}} times of the {{equinoxes}} but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days. Because the bores {{are associated with the}} phases of the moon, one occurs between 7 a.m. and noon on bore days, and the other between 7 p.m. and midnight GMT, with the largest bores occurring between 9 and 11 in both the morning and evening. Maximum bores occur between one and three days after new and full moons, and smaller ones <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> that precede and follow the maxima.|$|E

5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on {{such things as the}} time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} {{eastern side of}} the house is an orangery, which was built as a {{greenhouse}} in 1701 and has a glazed roof which was added around 1800 by Humphrey Repton. The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to eat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions {{were scheduled to}} be held before the Sunday race: two on Thursday and one on Friday. The first session was due to run for 105 minutes, and {{the second and third}} sessions were scheduled to last 90 minutes. Heavy rain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> before the event resulted in the local clay absorbing a large amount of water. Only a small amount of evaporation had occurred due to low air temperatures. Race officials examined water that emerged through the track's surface in several areas on Thursday. The track surface had been drilled through overnight in an effort to drain collected water and prevent further seepage. CART's jet dryer was used on the track but, despite creating a dry track surface, water continued to appear through it. CART chief steward Chris Kneifel drove the pace car onto the track at 3:00p.m. British Summer Time (UTC+1) along with all 26 racing vehicles and 23 secondary cars under caution for five installation laps with both groups. No improvement was reported, and CART announced an hour later that the remainder of the day's activities were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|USS Philadelphia is a gunboat (referred to in {{contemporary}} documents as a gundalow or gondola) of the Continental Navy. Manned by Continental Army soldiers, {{she was part}} of a fleet under the command of General Benedict Arnold that fought the 11 October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island against a larger Royal Navy fleet on Lake Champlain. Although many of the American boats in the battle were damaged in the battle, Philadelphia {{was one of the few}} actually sunk that day. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> following the main battle, most of the other boats in the American fleet were sunk, burned, or captured.

On August 24, Washington replaced Sullivan with Israel Putnam who commanded the troops on Long Island. Putnam arrived on Long Island the next day along with six battalions. Also that day, the British troops on Long Island received 5,000 Hessian reinforcements, bringing their total to 20,000. There was little fighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> immediately after the landing, although some small skirmishes did take place with American marksmen armed with rifles picking off British troops from time to time.|$|E
