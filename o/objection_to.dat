5|$|A common neo-creationist <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> {{evolution}} is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E

50|$|Alvin Plantinga {{distinguishes between}} {{what he calls}} de facto from de jure <b>{{objection}}s</b> <b>to</b> Christian belief. A de facto objection is one that attempts to show that Christian truth claims are false. In contrast, de jure <b>objections</b> attempt <b>to</b> undermine Christian belief even if it is, in fact, true. Plantinga argues {{that there are no}} successful <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> Christian belief apart from de facto (fact-based) objections.|$|R
5|$|Among {{the ways}} that the {{government}} could assist in manufacturing, Hamilton mentioned levying protective duties on imported foreign goods that were also manufactured in the United States, to withdraw duties levied on raw materials needed for domestic manufacturing, pecuniary boundaries, and encouraging immigration for people to better themselves in similar employment opportunities. Congress shelved the report without much debate (except for Madison's <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> Hamilton's formulation of the General Welfare clause, which Hamilton construed liberally as a legal basis for his extensive programs).|$|E
5|$|Frank and the CCAF's {{position}} against coupon settlements {{was expressed}} in his written <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> {{the case in}} which he stated that they often do not provide meaningful compensation to class members, they often fail to disgorge ill-gotten gains from the defendant, and they often require class members to do future business with the defendant {{in order to receive}} compensation.|$|E
5|$|Goldstone {{insisted that}} he would not follow a one-sided mandate but would {{investigate}} any abuses committed by either side during the conflict. He said that he had initially not been willing to take on the mission unless the mandate was expanded to cover all sides. Despite then-president of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was no <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> the revised mandate, the Human Rights Council never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} Christian <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> Neopagan syncretism are the direct <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> {{witchcraft}} {{found in the}} Old Testament, particularly in Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy.

5|$|On April 23, 2013, about 90 {{students}} held a walkout {{and protest}} in <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> a recent trend of declining enforcement of educational standards. The policy, requiring applicants to have professional kitchen experience, has varied from {{three months to}} a year, and is currently six months; a 2011 revision allowed front-of-house service to count for the requirement. The protesting students signed letters to teachers and the school administration, gave speeches, and donned name tags with their student loan debt written on them.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol {{reinforced}} to the British government that its efforts so far—and those of the international community—would {{not be sufficient to}} bring the civil war to an end. In Westminster, meanwhile, opposition politicians renewed their <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> the continued presence of British forces in Sierra Leone. The government was seeking an exit strategy that would end a politically unpopular deployment without abandoning Sierra Leone.|$|E
5|$|The {{triennial}} Labor {{conference held}} in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage {{to see the}} party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member's bill, rather than a binding vote. Despite Gillard, who had previously stated her personal <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> same-sex marriage, the motion passed narrowly by 208 votes to 184. In February 2012, two bills to allow same-sex marriage in Australia were introduced in the 43rd Parliament.|$|E

5|$|After the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{ruled in}} his favour, {{the book was}} made {{available}} in the UK. However following the publication, the British Government obtained a High Court order to confiscate all proceeds from the book, {{on the grounds that}} the government owned the copyright to anything written by Tomlinson. In September 2008, MI6 ended all legal <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> the publication of The Big Breach, released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation's previous legal actions against him were disproportionate. However, it still refused to reinstate him or compensate him for the loss of his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition.

There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E

5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, Brundage {{wrote to}} other IOC members {{that he had}} no <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> Soviet {{involvement}} in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs). The IOC required that an NOC be independent of the government of the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be. This was a problem not unique to communist states; a number of Latin Americans countries were starting to bring the local NOCs into the political structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who might even be the country's political leader. This mixture of sports and politics worried Brundage.|$|E
5|$|Her {{more radical}} {{positions}} included acceptance of interracial marriage. Despite her opposition to giving African American men {{the right to}} vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to in expressing this opposition, Stanton had no <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> interracial marriage and wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to Helen Pitts, a white woman, in 1884. Anthony, fearing public condemnation of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost, pleaded with Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{gave the}} four {{recognized}} parties free air time for political statements. The television broadcasts's audio tracks served also {{for use on}} radio. The three opposition parties gave their party leader all of the broadcast time, though Diefenbaker, who did not speak French well, played only a limited role in the Tories' French-language broadcasts. In one, he introduced party president Léon Balcer, a Quebecer, who gave the speech. Diefenbaker had no <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> makeup and, according to Meisel, was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective. A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that Diefenbaker made the strongest impression of the four leaders.|$|E
5|$|In Didden v. Village of Port Chester (2006), an {{unrelated}} case {{brought about by}} the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to a statute of limitations lapse – of a property owner's <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent Kelo v. City of New London ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the post–World War II baby boom, the New South Wales Department of Education, under Bob Heffron, queried the University of Sydney in 1951 on its thoughts about training and certifying schoolteachers by external studies and/or correspondence courses. The university rejected the idea, stating that external degree or certification programs would be significantly inferior to residence education. Undeterred, Heffron asked New England about its willingness to conduct external studies. Madgwick enthusiastically supported the idea and instructed his college's staff to begin preparing an external studies program. Heffron asked the University of Sydney if it had any <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> New England being granted independence to operate the state's external education program. The university replied {{that it had no}} objection.|$|E
