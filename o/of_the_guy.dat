This section begins with the guy knocking on the door, Lopez inviting him in, and then eventually showing him the door when she sees him attempting to look/flirt with other women at the party. As he leaves, she goes on entertaining the other guests. The second part of the video involves scenes with Lopez, Ja Rule and Cadillac tah in a white room, Ja Rule in a recording studio in Lopez's home, Lopez sitting in a chair singing bits of the song, and Lopez and Ja Rule singing the parts of the final verse against a gold backdrop.|$|E

Under <b>the</b> condition <b>of</b> meeting <b>the</b> uplift tensile forces, the optimization design and analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guyed</b> anchor is studied through the optimization program using <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> network searching. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil properties, <b>the</b> <b>guyed</b> anchor structure, <b>the</b> uplift tensile forces and directions on the optimized embedded depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guyed</b> anchor is discussed in detail. These results will provide some theoretical evidences and technical supports for <b>the</b> <b>guyed</b> anchor manufacture and <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embedded depth...|$|R

[...] "I {{think a lot of}} us were inconsistent [...] because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> we were waiting for after the show." [...] During the tour, Mustaine noticed problems developing with Behler and brought in drummer Nick Menza as Behler's drum technician. As with Samuelson, Menza was expected to take over if Behler could not continue the tour. Menza replaced Behler in 1989.

500|$|The costume {{redesign}} for Anarky in Batman: Arkham Origins, while stylized, {{attempted to}} thematically highlight the character's anarchist sentiments by updating his appearance utilizing black bloc iconography. Donning a red puffer flight jacket, hoodie and cargo pants, the character sported gold accents decorating his black belt, backpack and combat boots, and completed this with an orange bandana wrapped below his neck. His metallic mask {{was replaced with}} a white theatrical stage mask, evocative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guy</b> Fawkes mask made popular among protesters by V for Vendetta and Anonymous. The jacket is itself emblazoned with a painted circle-A. [...] "He looks like a street protester in our game," [...] commented Eric Holmes, the creative director of the game, [...] "and there's no accident to that." [...] This design was later used as model for a DC Collectibles figure, released {{as part of a}} series based on villains featured in the game.|$|E
500|$|V for Vendetta {{sets the}} Gunpowder Plot as V's {{historical}} inspiration, contributing to {{his choice of}} timing, language, and appearance. For example, the names Rookwood, Percy and Keyes {{are used in the}} film, which are also the names of three of the Gunpowder conspirators. The film creates parallels to Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo, by drawing direct comparisons between V and Edmond Dantès. (In both stories, the hero escapes an unjust and traumatic imprisonment and spends decades preparing to take vengeance on his oppressors under a new persona.) The film is also explicit in portraying V as the embodiment of an idea rather than an individual through V's dialogue and by depicting him without a past, identity or face. According to the official website, [...] "V's use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guy</b> Fawkes mask and persona functions as both practical and symbolic elements of the story. He wears the mask to hide his physical scars, and in obscuring his identity– he becomes the idea itself." ...|$|E

[...] Chris Nashawaty, {{reviewing}} the film for Entertainment Weekly, called it [...] "the most feminist summer action flick in years". Bustles Alicia Lutes described Rita as [...] "ruthless and exacting in her takedown ... of a bunch of aliens" [...] and said: [...] "This is very much counter to the age-old ideals about ladies being the constant, delicate flowers of emotional heartstring-pulling." [...] Lutes noted how Cage's strength depended on Rita's guidance, as [...] "she trains him, aids him, and protects him (and in turn the fate of humanity) time and time again." [...] Tasha Robinson, writing a piece in The Dissolve about [...] "strong female characters" [...] that lack real purpose in films, said that Rita in Edge of Tomorrow was an exception. Robinson acknowledged that Rita existed to support Cage in his trials, but believed that [...] "the story doesn't degrade, devalue, weaken, or dismiss her".|$|E
500|$|Film writer Paul Simpson notes {{how closely}} Steiger {{prepared}} for his roles, {{and how he}} [...] "effortlessly" [...] recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a [...] "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of New York Magazine, reviewing Duck, You Sucker!, commented that Steiger was [...] "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his [...] "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, [...] "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how he does it. It's {{almost as if he}} gets inside the skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> he's playing and starts being that person for a while". Steiger said: [...] "I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd try to do it a little different." [...] His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger's [...] "powerful and wrenching performance" [...] in The Pawnbroker.|$|E
500|$|Protesters in Boston, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Toronto, Edinburgh, London, {{and other}} cities worldwide, wore Guy Fawkes masks modeled after the 2005 film V for Vendetta. (Guy Fawkes was an English Catholic {{executed}} for a 1605 attempt to destroy the House of Lords. In V for Vendetta, a rebel against a near-future fascist regime uses the mask in his public appearances and distributes many of its copies to the population to enable mass protests. The Boston Globe characterized usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guy</b> Fawkes masks as [...] "an allusion to the British insurgent and a film depicting an antigovernment movement". Aaron Tavena of College Times wrote that the Guy Fawkes masks provided a [...] "dramatic effect" [...] to the protests, and Nick Jamison of The Retriever Weekly wrote: [...] "During the February 10 protests, Anonymous was informative, Anonymous was peaceful, and Anonymous was effective. After seeing all of the pictures from the 10th with everyone in disguise, many sporting Guy Fawkes masks, I {{wanted to be a}} part of that." [...] Scott Stewart of University of Nebraska at Omaha's The Gateway wrote: [...] "Many participants sported Guy Fawkes masks to draw attention both to their identity as Anonymous and the Church of Scientology's abuse of litigation and coercion to suppress anti-Scientology viewpoints." ...|$|E

[...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish.

2500|$|Helen Cooper of Cambridge University {{considers}} the subject matter, stagecraft, and topical references {{to point to}} a composition date just after Christopher Marlowe's plays became influential, and that the text of Guy Earl of Warwick reflects Marlowe's [...] "mighty line" [...] and phrasing, so that the play very likely dates to the early 1590s. The similarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guy</b> Earl of Warwick subject to a 1593 play based on the legend of Huon of Bordeaux argues for a date c. 1593-94, and Cooper believes {{that to be the}} most likely period of Guy Earl of Warwick's composition. The character of Oberon in the play seems uninfluenced by Oberon as depicted in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, so Cooper believes it probable that Guy Earl of Warwick was written before A Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1595-96).|$|E
