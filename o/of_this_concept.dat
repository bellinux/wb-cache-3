5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>concept.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that {{it has been argued that}} it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} social {{solidarity}} {{is one of}} the fundamental notions in classical social theory. The paper presents a study <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>concept’s</b> development in famous sociologist’ works (O. Compte, H. Spenser, F. Tönnies, E. Durkheim, K. Marx) as well as modern Ukrainian, Russian, European and American social scientists’ researches. The author develops a theoretical definition of the concept “social solidarity" by drawing on three approaches to the notion definition. These are attributes distinction, explanation of the functions and description <b>of</b> relationships between <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> and other concepts of social theory. As a conclusion, a general definition of “social solidarity" is presented, which is an important conceptual precondition for developing and usage of the concept in empirical studies...|$|R
5|$|Originally, {{the prince}} wanted a {{strictly}} Classical design, {{and plans for}} such a design were executed, in Chester by architect Thomas Harrison and modified, on site, by Odessa architect Francesco Boffo. The two architects had previously worked together on the design for Vorontsov's official residence in Odessa. Harrison's plans for he palace at Alupka show a classical villa {{on the site of}} the present palace's corps de logis with bedroom floors below, on what are now the lower terraces of the present palace. On the garden front, facing the sea, the plans show a large double height classical exedra; Vorontsov must have approved <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> as it was the only feature (albeit transformed to an Islamic style), to be incorporated from Harrison's plans into the new plans.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{comprised}} six sessions {{including a}} lecture on law, a humorous presentation, and multiple discussions {{about the role of}} women in society. Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents, the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions, to be debated and modified before being put forward for signatures. A heated debate sprang up regarding women's right to vote, with many – including Mott – urging the removal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>concept,</b> but Frederick Douglass, who was the convention's sole African American attendee, argued eloquently for its inclusion, and the suffrage resolution was retained. Exactly 100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document, mostly women.|$|E
5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E

25|$|The {{network of}} {{electrodes}} connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge {{to the surface}} electrode repels the particles {{to the bottom of}} local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white.

25|$|The {{principle}} of revolutionism {{went beyond the}} recognition of the reforms made during Atatürk's lifetime.

The current understanding <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> can be described that active modification. Turkey and its society, taking over institutions from Western Europe, must add Turkish traits and patterns to them and adapt them to the Turkish culture, according to Kemalism. The making of the Turkish traits and patterns of these reforms takes generations of cultural and social experience (which results in the collective memory of the Turkish nation).|$|E
