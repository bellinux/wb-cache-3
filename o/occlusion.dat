5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of <b>occlusion,</b> which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold <b>occlusion,</b> the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm <b>occlusion,</b> the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

40|$|Background: The ideal {{population}} of patients for endovascular therapy (ET) in acute ischemic stroke remains undefined. Recent ET trials have moved towards selecting patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) or {{internal carotid artery}} <b>occlusions,</b> which will likely leave a gap {{in our understanding of}} the treatment outcomes of M 2 <b>occlusions.</b> Objective and methods: To examine the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of M 2 compared with M 1 MCA <b>occlusions</b> in patients undergoing ET by assessing comprehensive MRI, angiography, and clinical data. Results: We found that M 2 <b>occlusions</b> can lead to massive strokes defined by hypoperfused and infarcted volumes as well as death or moderate to severe disability in nearly 50 % of patients at discharge. Compared with M 1 <b>occlusions,</b> M 2 <b>occlusions</b> achieved similar Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2 b/ 3 recanalization rates, with significantly less hemorrhage. M 2 <b>occlusions</b> presented with smaller infarct and hypoperfused volumes and had smaller final infarct volumes regardless of recanalization. TICI 2 b/ 3 recanalization of M 2 <b>occlusions</b> was associated with smaller infarct volumes compared with TICI 0 - 2 a recanalization, as well as less infarct expansion, in patients who received IV tissue plasminogen activator as well as those that did not. Successful reperfusion of M 2 <b>occlusions</b> was associated with improved discharge modified Rankin scale. Conclusions: If suitable as targets of ET, M 2 <b>occlusions</b> should be given the same consideration as M 1 <b>occlusions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most {{binocular}} stereo algorithms {{assume that}} all scene elements are visible from both cameras. Scene elements that are visible from only one camera, known as <b>occlusions,</b> pose an important challenge for stereo. <b>Occlusions</b> are important for segmentation, because they appear near discontinuities. However, stereo algorithms tend to ignore <b>occlusions</b> because of their difficulty. One reason is that <b>occlusions</b> require the input images to be treated symmetrically, which complicates the problem formulation. Worse, certain depth maps imply physically impossible scene configurations, and must be excluded from the output. In this chapter we approach the problem of binocular stereo with <b>occlusions</b> from an energy minimization viewpoint. We begin by reviewing traditional stereo methods that do not handle <b>occlusions.</b> If <b>occlusions</b> are ignored, {{it is easy to}} formulate the stereo problem as a pixel labeling problem, which leads to an energy function that is common in early vision. This kind of energy function can be minimized using graph cuts, which is a combinatorial optimization technique that has proven to be very effective for low-level vision problems. Motivated by this, we have designed two graph cut stereo algorithms that are designed to handle <b>occlusions.</b> These algorithms produce promising experimental results on real data with ground truth...|$|R

Methods: From January 2005 to June 2006, 33 patients (23 men; age range 39 – 90 years) with 36 <b>occlusions</b> were treated using ultrasound-enhanced thrombolytic therapy for acute and chronic arterial and venous <b>occlusions.</b> After diagnostic angiography, the <b>occlusions</b> were crossed with an appropriately sized Lysus infusion catheter for infusion of urokinase (80, 000 – 120, 000 IU/h). Results: Technical success and complete lysis was achieved in 96 % of the arterial and 83 % of the venous <b>occlusions.</b> Two patients with chronic <b>occlusions</b> (one superficial femoral artery and one iliac vein) were refractory to lytic therapy. Average time for complete lysis was 16. 4 hours (range 3 – 25) for arterial <b>occlusions</b> and 21. 2 hours (range 6 – 43) in patients with deep vein thrombosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mechanical {{disruption}} of a clot with a microcatheter and a guidewire {{has not been}} detailed in conjunction with intra-arterial thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of mechanical {{disruption of}} an embolus in the carotid artery distribution. METHODS: We analyzed clinical and radiologic findings and functional outcomes 3 months after thrombolysis with mechanical disruption. Outcomes were classified as good for modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores of 0 – 2, moderate for mRS scores of 3, and poor for death and mRS scores of 4 or 5. RESULTS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with severe hemispheric symptoms were treated with several methods of mechanical embolus disruption during the intra-arterial administra-tion of urokinase. Twelve patients had <b>occlusions</b> of the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA), and 11 had <b>occlusions</b> of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA).

40|$|Within a {{surveillance}} video, <b>occlusions</b> are commonplace, and accurately resolving these <b>occlusions</b> is key when seeking to accurately track objects. The challenge of accurately segmenting objects is {{further complicated by}} the fact that within many real-world surveillance environments, the objects appear very similar. For example, footage of pedestrians in a city environment will consist of many people wearing dark suits. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to segment groups and resolve <b>occlusions</b> using optical flow discontinuities. We demonstrate that the ratio of continuous to discontinuous pixels within a region can be used to locate the overlapping edges, and incorporate this into an object tracking framework. Results on a portion of the ETISEO database show that the proposed algorithm results in improved tracking performance overall, and improved tracking within <b>occlusions.</b> ...|$|R

The new energy penalizes nearby opposing extremities of the network, and thus favours the closure of the gaps created by <b>occlusions.</b> Nearby opposing extremities are identified using a sophisticated interaction between pairs of points on the contour. This new model allows the extraction of fully connected networks, even though <b>occlusions</b> violate common assumptions about the homogeneity of the interior, and high contrast with the exterior, of the network. We present experimental results on real aerial images that demonstrate the effectiveness of the new model for network extraction tasks. 1...|$|R
