40|$|This thesis uses {{different}} {{research methods}} and sources to investigate Antony Gormley's participatory artwork <b>One</b> and <b>Other,</b> 2009. It {{starts with a}} discussion of participatory art practice, which provides a backdrop to the main thesis topic. Gormley's <b>One</b> and <b>Other</b> is introduced as aspiring to enact a form of direct democracy. However it is noted that aspects of Gormleyâs artwork limited rather than extended a form of direct democracy. A considered description of <b>One</b> and <b>Other</b> is progressed, the result of which is a reconsideration of <b>One</b> and <b>Other</b> as a complex artwork with plurality at its centre. The concept of civil society is introduced. Its structuring around private and public realms, as well as its end goals of individual autonomy and voluntary association, make it the ideal context within which to comprehend <b>One</b> and <b>Other.</b> This points the way to a reappraisal of <b>One</b> and <b>Other</b> and its place within participatory art. In conclusion the thesis asks for <b>One</b> and <b>Other</b> to be reconsidered. Despite its manifest defects, <b>One</b> and <b>Other</b> was a genuinely interesting artwork in which competing forces and different identities productively developed, together. Even though it seemed an unlikely candidate, <b>One</b> and <b>Other</b> has a lot to offer participatory art and those who wish to use this field of art to develop democratic agendas. Ultimately it is the mixed nature of <b>One</b> and <b>Other,</b> framed through the multi-faceted nature of civil society, that produces the artwork's democratic effect and not the aspiration to realise an archaic form of direct democracy. Paradoxically <b>One</b> and <b>Other</b> did achieve its desire to enable men and women to 'self-realise' and 'self-represent', but the path to this goal was contradictory and imperfect. </p...|$|R

60|$|If {{speculation}} tends thus to {{a terrific}} unity, {{in which all}} things are absorbed, action tends directly backwards to diversity. The first is the course of gravitation of mind; {{the second is the}} power of nature. Nature is the manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature opens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate all things, all thought; the one, the many. One is being; the <b>other,</b> intellect; <b>one</b> is necessity; the <b>other,</b> freedom; <b>one,</b> rest; the <b>other,</b> motion; <b>one,</b> power; the <b>other,</b> distribution; <b>one,</b> strength; the <b>other,</b> pleasure; <b>one,</b> consciousness; the <b>other,</b> definition; <b>one,</b> genius; the <b>other,</b> talent, <b>one,</b> earnestness; the <b>other,</b> knowledge; <b>one,</b> possession; the <b>other,</b> trade; <b>one,</b> caste; the <b>other,</b> culture; <b>one</b> king; the <b>other,</b> democracy; and, if we dare carry these generalizations a step higher, and name the last tendency of both, we might say, {{that the end of the}} one is escape from organization,--pure science; and the end of the other is the highest instrumentality, or use of means, or executive deity.|$|R
