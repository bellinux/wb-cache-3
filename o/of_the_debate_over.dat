5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E
5|$|In April 1901, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{announced}} track {{depression and}} raising throughout {{portions of the}} line through Newark and the Oranges. Although the depression went into Newark, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> localities of stations was basically into the Oranges. In 1903, the track depression reached the Roseville Avenue Station, and the lines were depressed through Roseville. The new station built during the track depression was of similar style, with the station {{in the middle of}} the five-track interlocking, with one platform servicing the Montclair Branch's two tracks and one for the Main Line's two tracks. Rather than crossing at-grade, Roseville Avenue was bridged over the tracks with a brand new street-level interlocking tower present at the intersection of Roseville and Seventh Avenues.|$|E

5|$|Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an {{unfavourable}} settlement {{by which}} Wulfred gained {{control over the}} debated monasteries {{in exchange for a}} large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king. Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop. In September 822, Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king, which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop. After Ceolwuf's deposition in 823 Wulfred's situation improved. The new Mercian king, Beornwulf, presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down. Coenwulf's daughter Cwenthryth, abbess of Winchcombe and Minster, paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent. Later in 825 (or possibly the following year), however, Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun. Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold, and coinage in Wulfred's name appears to have ceased for a time, though it had been restored before Wulfred's death in 832. Final settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston, shortly before Egbert's death.|$|E

25|$|The Conservatives {{had come}} to power with a pledge to reform {{industrial}} relations laws. When the detailed proposals were unveiled in October 1970, Adamson gave a welcome for the principle while observing {{that they were more}} far-reaching than the CBI's suggestions on enforcability of agreements. The plans were vociferously opposed by the trade unions. Adamson largely stayed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> the Industrial Relations Bill during its stormy passage through Parliament, but tried {{to play the role of}} an intermediary between the Government and the National Union of Mineworkers after the union went on strike in early 1972, making another plea for greater co-operation between unions and management.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> {{the viability of}} neo-Lamarckism, in 1896 James Mark Baldwin, Henry Fairfield Osborne and C.

They proposed that if individuals in a species benefited from learning a particular new behavior, the ability to learn that behavior could be favored by natural selection, and the end result would be the evolution of new instincts and eventually new physical adaptations. This {{became known as the}} Baldwin effect and it has remained a topic of debate and research in evolutionary biology ever since.|$|E

50|$|In {{increasingly}} modern, multicultural societies, {{the contested}} concept and construct of identity received growing emphasis, and was <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> many <b>debates.</b> As a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> identity, and inevitably in a globalising, modern, multicultural world, <b>the</b> issues <b>of</b> citizenship came into play.

Later that year, Judge Richard Fred Suhrheinrich, writing for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of ACLU of Kentucky v. Mercer County, wrote that a display including the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Ten Commandments, the Magna Carta, The Star-Spangled Banner, and the national motto could be erected in the Mercer County courthouse.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> {{contemporary}} Canadian {{identity is}} argued in political terms, and defines Canada {{as a country}} defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values. To the political philosopher Charles Blattberg, Canada should be conceived as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, one that contains many other kinds of communities within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, civic (the provincial and municipal governments) and civil associational sorts, but also national communities. Blattberg thus sees Canada as a multinational country and so asserts that it contains a number of nations within it. Aside from the various aboriginal First Nations, {{there is also the}} nation of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between English Canadians and French Canadians {{stemming from the}} French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between English Canadians and the British Empire, resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power; and finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to the United States. In the 20th century, immigrants from African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have shaped the Canadian identity, a process that continues today with the ongoing arrival {{of large numbers of}} immigrants from non-British or non-French backgrounds, adding the theme of multiculturalism to the debate. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> contemporary Canadian identity is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values.|$|E

25|$|Overall {{health care}} costs were {{projected}} in 2011 to increase by 5.8 percent annually from 2010 to 2020, {{in part because of}} increased utilization of medical services, higher prices for services, and new technologies. Health care costs are rising across the board, but the cost of insurance has risen dramatically for families and employers as well as the federal government. In fact, since 1970 the per-capita cost of private coverage has grown roughly one percentage point faster each year than the per-capita cost of Medicare. Since the late 1990s, Medicare has performed especially well relative to private insurers. Over the next decade, Medicare’s per capita spending is projected to grow at a rate of 2.5 percent each year, compared to private insurance’s 4.8 percent. Nonetheless, most experts and policymakers agree containing {{health care costs}} is essential to the nation’s fiscal outlook. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> the future of Medicare revolves around whether per capita costs should be reduced by limiting payments to providers or by shifting more costs to Medicare enrollees.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparison}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> reform <b>of</b> working-class and middle-class women’s education among the British middle {{classes in the}} years 1860 to 1890. Participants in both debates presented an image of an uneducated working-class man or middle-class woman unable to contribute meaningfully to society and then argued that education would integrate these people into that society, presenting {{a vision of a}} new society. This similarity shows how the liberal middle classes made and used a set of standards that defined their world, namely character, culture, service, civilisation and progress. Examining these debates provides a new understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Victorians’ practical application of liberal philosophy...|$|R

500|$|Grimani's {{libretto}} {{is based}} on much the same story used [...] as the subject of Monteverdi's 1642 opera L'incoronazione di Poppea. Grimani's libretto centres on Agrippina, a character who {{does not appear in}} Monteverdi's darker version. [...] Grimani avoids the [...] "moralizing" [...] tone of the later opera seria libretti written by such acknowledged masters as Metastasio and Zeno. According to the critic Donald Jay Grout, [...] "irony, deception and intrigue pervade the humorous escapades of its well-defined characters." [...] All the main characters, with the sole exception of Claudius's servant Lesbus, are historical, and the broad outline of the libretto draws heavily upon Tacitus's Annals and Suetonius' Life of Claudius. It has been suggested that the comical, amatory character of the Emperor Claudius is a caricature of Pope Clement XI, to whom Grimani was politically opposed. Certain aspects of this conflict are also reflected in the plot: the rivalry between Nero and Otho mirror aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> the War of the Spanish Succession, in which Grimani supported the Habsburgs and Pope Clement XI France and Spain.|$|E
