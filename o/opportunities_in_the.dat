5|$|After the First Opium War, Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and {{the colony}} {{soon became a}} popular {{stopover}} for missionaries travelling onwards to China. The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, and work began on a new and permanent church soon afterwards. The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street. Construction was completed in 1843. Within the next few years, the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly, {{partly due to the}} emigration of people from neighbouring Macau. The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline, and many people who resided there sought better <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young and prospering colony of Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade {{began to take}} {{advantage}} of the new trading <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse. The trade routes were expanded further reaching Cyprus, Amman in the Near East, Apulia in Italy and Spain. At that time (c. 1400 BC), the palace of Knossos yielded the earliest records of the Greek Linear B script, based on the previous Linear A of the Minoans. The use of the new script spread in mainland Greece and offers valuable insight of the administrative network of the palatial centers. However, the unearthed records are too fragmentary for a political reconstruction of Bronze Age Greece.|$|E

Kartik then took 3/36 in the next match as India scraped home by three wickets, but he was punished in his fourth outing of the series, conceding 69 runs in nine overs without success, after which he was dropped. He had taken four wickets at 47.25, at an economy rate of 4.84.|$|E

5|$|The Netherlands scored first, but Kean soon equalised, {{assisted}} by Stewart. The Dutch team responded, but Gauci took two points with a fast break, and then assisted Crispin in putting Australia in the lead, one which the Gliders would not relinquish. Stewart made {{the next two}} scores, from outside the paint, and assisted Crispin to bring the score to 6–16. The Dutch team fought back, {{but there was a}} 12–18 deficit at quarter time. The Australian defence shut down their <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second quarter, and the score was 20–30 in Australia's favour at half time, and 29–40 {{by the end of the}} third quarter. The Dutch team redoubled their efforts in the final quarter, and won the quarter 20–18, but the Gliders won the game, 49–58.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} as an improvement of Just Cause; its team saw missed <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first game, analyzing and refining it.

5|$|The {{removal of}} the eastern threat {{and the rise of}} the Byzantines' {{confidence}} also opened up <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west, where the Bulgarian ruler Boris (r. 852–889) had been negotiating with the Pope and Louis the German (r. 817–876) for a possible conversion of himself and his pagan people to Christianity. This expansion of Rome's ecclesiastic influence up to Constantinople's very doorstep could not be tolerated by the Byzantine government. In 864, the victorious eastern armies were transferred to Europe and invaded Bulgaria, in a demonstration of military might that convinced Boris to accept Byzantine missionaries instead. Boris was baptized, taking the name Michael in honor of the Byzantine emperor, thus beginning the Christianization of Bulgaria and initiating the nation's absorption into the Byzantine-influenced, Eastern Orthodox world.|$|E

A 142-acre public park known as the Nay Aug Park is also in the watershed. It was founded and 1893 and was popular until the 1950s, when the area entered an economic decline. The park once had a wooden roller coaster and a small zoo, the latter of which was reopened in 2003. There is a ball field at the mouth of the stream.|$|E
5|$|York {{were beaten}} 4–1 {{at home to}} Morecambe, with Walker scoring York's only goal with a first half penalty, before {{enduring}} their largest defeat of the season after losing 4–0 away to Wycombe. Jamie Reed was loaned to Cambridge United {{for the rest of}} the season, with his <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team limited. Burton midfielder John McGrath and Aldershot striker Michael Rankine were signed on loan, with the former joining for one month and the latter {{for the rest of the}} season. Both started in York's 0–0 draw at home to Gillingham. York opened the scoring against Barnet at home through a David Stephens own goal, although goals from Andy Yiadom and Jake Hyde saw the away team win 2–1. Everson was loaned out to Gateshead for a month, having struggled for <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team, and Platt returned to Harrogate on loan for the remainder of the season. York drew 0–0 away to Oxford, with the best chance of the match falling to Blair when he headed straight at goalkeeper Luke McCormick. O'Connell's loan was extended until the end of the season. Daniel Nardiello scored a stoppage-time equaliser for Rotherham when York were leading 1–0, after the away team had taken the lead through Blair earlier in the second half. Johnson was released after making seven appearances for the club, having been hindered during the season by stomach and groin problems.|$|E
5|$|Guerrero {{was raised}} in the Jamaica Plain and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston after being taken in by other Colombian families. She has had an {{interest}} in acting since a young age and took advantage of free <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood or at school. Then she attended Boston Arts Academy, a performing arts high school, where she was in the music department. Among her high school activities was singing with a jazz group, but she anticipated pursuing political science and communications in college. In 2010, she appeared in the Faces music video that was shot in Norwood, Massachusetts for Louie Bello. Her first job after college was in a law office. At age 24, she decided to pursue a career in acting. In 2011, she moved to New York City and studied acting at the Susan Batson Studios where she met her manager Josh Taylor. Guerrero's life experience compels her to advocate for immigration reform and is an influence that she draws upon in her acting.|$|E

5|$|He enjoyed more <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ODI {{arena in}} 2005, when Kumble was dropped by newly {{appointed}} coach Greg Chappell {{due to his}} lack of athleticism, {{as well as the}} introduction of the experimental rules which allowed the use of one substitute, thus opening an extra position in the team. Kartik had a modest start under the new regime, taking 1/52 from nine overs in a win over a depleted host Zimbabwe team. He returned to India and started the new season in fine all-round form. After taking 2/34 in the first innings, he scored his highest first-class score of 96 to guide Railways to 311, giving them a first-innings lead of 88 runs over the Rest of India in the Irani Trophy. He then took 3/28 to dismiss the Rest of India for 137 in their second innings, setting up a nine-wciket win. He then took seven wickets at 16.85 at an economy rate of 4.56 in three matches for India Seniors in the Challenger Trophy, including a match-winning 5/29 in the final against India B.|$|E
5|$|In 195758, the Australian Test team toured South Africa {{during the}} {{southern}} hemisphere summer, opening up <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shield competition back in Australia. Booth established himself at first-class level with 503 runs at 50.30. After scoring two fifties, he broke through for his maiden first-class century against the Victorian Bushrangers at the Sydney Cricket Ground, in his last match of the season. He put on a partnership of 325 with future Test teammate Norm O'Neill in fewer than four hours. It was his fifteenth first-class match, and helped his state secure a fifth successive title with a ten-wicket win over their arch-rivals. With the Test players returning to Australia in 195859, Booth again faced more competition for places. He struggled, playing six matches and aggregating only 190 runs at 31.66. He only had six innings for the entire season, and in his only opportunity against Peter May's touring Englishmen, he made a duck. Booth passed 50 on two occasions during the season, making 75 and 85. In one high-scoring match against South Australia, he took 0/97 with his part-time off spin.|$|E
