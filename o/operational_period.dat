25|$|The {{primary surface}} mission for Spirit was planned to last at least 90 sols. The mission {{received}} several extensions and lasted about 2,208 sols. On August 11, 2007, Spirit obtained the second longest operational duration {{on the surface}} of Mars for a lander or rover at 1282 Sols, one sol longer than the Viking 2 lander. Viking 2 was powered by a nuclear cell whereas Spirit is powered by solar arrays. Until Opportunity overtook it on May 19, 2010, the Mars probe with longest <b>operational</b> <b>period</b> was Viking 1 that lasted for 2245 Sols {{on the surface of}} Mars.

25|$|Chandrayaan-1 was India's first {{mission to}} the moon. The {{unmanned}} lunar exploration mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor called the Moon Impact Probe. ISRO launched the spacecraft using {{a modified version of}} the PSLV on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008. It carried high-resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. During its 312 days <b>operational</b> <b>period</b> (2 years planned), it surveyed the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and 3-dimensional topography. The polar regions were of special interest, as they possibly had ice deposits. The spacecraft carried 11 instruments: 5 Indian and 6 from foreign institutes and space agencies (including NASA, ESA, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Brown University and other European and North American institutes/companies), which were carried free of cost. Chandrayaan-1 became the first lunar mission to discover existence of water on the Moon. The Chandrayaan-166 team was awarded the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics SPACE 2009 award, the International Lunar Exploration Working Group's International Co-operation award in 2008, and the National Space Society's 2009 Space Pioneer Award in the science and engineering category.|$|E

40|$|On-site aerobic {{sequencing}} {{batch reactor}} (SBR) treatment plants are implemented in many Australian wineries {{to treat the}} large volumes of associated wastewater they generate.

This paper represents the first attempt to analyze the communities of three such systems sampled during both vintage and nonvintage <b>operational</b> <b>periods</b> using molecular methods. Alphaproteobacterial tetrad forming organisms (TFO) related to members of the genus Defluviicoccus and Amaricoccus dominated all three systems in both <b>operational</b> <b>periods.</b> Candidatus ‘Alysiosphaera europaea’ and Zoogloea were codominant in two communities. Production of high levels of exocellular capsular material by Zoogloea and Amaricoccus is thought to explain the poor settleability of solids in one of these plants. The dominance of these organisms is thought to result from the high COD to N/P ratios that characterize winery wastes, and it is suggested that manipulating this ratio with nutrient dosing may help control the problems they cause...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work entitled Molecular Characterization of Eubacteria in a Biological Water Processor was to {{gain an understanding of}} the microbial diversity and species stability of the consortia that inhabit an anoxic bioreactor and to correlate those factors with functional performance, mechanical reliability, and stability.

Study 2 was designed to investigate the impact of an inoculum source on BWP performance.

50|$|Psychologist Jean Piaget {{created the}} theory of {{cognitive}} development, which talks about how the mentality of children develops and matures {{as they grow older}} and further interact with society. Piaget defined four main periods of development which include the sensorimotor period, the pre-operational period, the concrete <b>operational</b> <b>period</b> and the formal <b>operational</b> <b>period.</b> The sensorimotor period takes place from birth to about two years of age and is defined as the stage in which infants learn by using their senses and motor skills. In this stage, the main goal is for an infant to learn that an object still exists even when it is not directly in sight; this is known as object permanence. During the pre-operational period, from roughly two to seven years of age, a child is much more capable of conceiving symbolic thought, but is not capable of reasoning yet. Also, children during this period cannot comprehend conservation, which is the ability to understand that different-looking objects can have the same measurable features, such as area, volume, and length. The next period, the concrete <b>operational</b> <b>period,</b> takes place from ages seven to eleven. In this stage, children are able to solve problems or mental operations, only in regards to real events or tangible objects, in their minds. The final stage is the formal <b>operational</b> <b>period,</b> taking place from age eleven through adulthood, and is the period in which individuals learn to solve problems based on hypothetical situations; during that stage, the person can think logically, symbolically and abstractly.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of a recursive estimator process (e. g., a Kalman filter is assured for long time periods by periodically resetting an error covariance P(t. sub. n) {{of the system}} to a predetermined reset value P. sub. r.

The process stability for an extended <b>operational</b> time <b>period</b> T. sub. o is verified by performing the resetting step at the end of at least one reset time period T. sub. r whose duration is less than the <b>operational</b> time <b>period</b> T. sub. o and then confirming {{stability of}} the process over the reset time period T. sub. r.
