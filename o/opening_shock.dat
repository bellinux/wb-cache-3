50|$|The reserve canopy is a {{derivative}} of the British Low Level Parachute (LLP) aero-conical design that includes apex scoop pockets {{at the top}} of the reserve canopy and skirt assist lines at the system’s hem to promote fast opening of the reserve system during low-speed malfunctions. Unlike the current reserve parachute system, the T-11R reserve uses an omni-directional, center-pull deployment system. The T-11 harness is designed to displace <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> forces of the reserve parachute equally along the long axis of the jumper’s body.|$|E
50|$|The main canopy is a {{modified}} version of a cross/cruciform platform. The canopy has an increased inflated diameter of 14 percent and a 28 percent increase in surface area, when compared with the T-10D assembly. The T-11 main canopy utilizes a unique deployment sequence to reduce the <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> and canopy oscillation. The T-11 is designed to have an average rate of descent of 19 ft/s for the 95th percentile service member, compared with 24 ft/s with the T-10C. This reduction is intended to result in significantly lower landing injury rates for jumpers.|$|E

5000|$|For {{training}} {{students in}} civilian operations, modifications to existing static line equipment {{may be made}} to simplify operations. One such modification is to attach the deployment bag to the parachute instead of the static line, which also requires some modification to allow the static line to detach, typically a Velcro fastener. This leaves much less material [...] "in the wind" [...] behind the plane after the jumper has left. This isn't a problem for larger cargo aircraft used in military jumping, but presents a major issue for smaller aircraft used in civilian operations. This modification also results in a somewhat slower opening, which softens the <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> {{at the cost of}} altitude, a minor concern for jumpers exiting at 2800 ft.|$|E
5000|$|A slider {{is a small}} {{rectangular}} {{piece of}} fabric with a grommet near each corner used to control the deployment of a [...] "ram-air" [...] parachute. A ram-air parachute {{has a tendency to}} open very rapidly. At high velocities, the <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> from such a rapid deployment can cause damage to the canopy or injury to the jumper. The slider was developed as a way of mitigating this. During deployment, the slider slides down from the canopy to just above the risers. It is slowed by air resistance as it descends and reduces {{the rate at which the}} lines can spread and therefore the speed at which the canopy can open and inflate. The slider also deflects some of the rising air column away from the center of the canopy as it inflates. This also helps moderate the speed of opening. [...] This invention solved the rapid deployment problem with ram-air designs. Sliders also reduce the chance of the lines twisting to cause a malfunction.|$|E
50|$|In skydiving, Spectra {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} used for suspension lines, largely supplanting the earlier-used Dacron, being lighter and less bulky. Spectra has excellent strength and wear-resistance, but is not dimensionally stable (ie. shrinks) when exposed to heat, which leads to gradual and uneven shrinkage of different lines as they are subject to differing amounts of friction during canopy deployment, necessitating periodic line replacement. It is also almost completely inflexible, which can exacerbate the <b>opening</b> <b>shock.</b> For that reason, Dacron (PET) lines continue to be used in student and some tandem systems, where the added bulk is less of a concern than the potential for an injurious opening. In turn, in high performance parachutes used for swooping, Spectra is replaced with Vectran and HMA (high-modulus aramid), which are even thinner and dimensionally stable, but exhibit greater wear and require much more frequent maintenance to prevent catastrophic failure. Spectra / Dyneema are also used for reserve parachute closing loops when used with automatic activation devices, where their extremely low coefficient of friction is critical for proper operation in the event of cutter activation.|$|E

50|$|The {{second week}} of Jump School {{concentrates}} on the jump towers. Prospective troopers will continue using the 34-foot tower {{in addition to the}} swing-landing trainer, a suspended harness trainer, and occasionally the 250-foot tower. Soldiers will become familiar with the mock door trainer to simulate mass exit training (how to exit an aircraft in flight). Additionally, prospective troopers are taught the different phases of parachute flight from aircraft exit, through <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> and chute deployment, then onto the deployment of the risers, steering the chute, and all the way to landing. One critical skill learned is how to identify a parachute malfunction and deal with it. This may involve emergency procedures including when and how to deploy the reserve parachute. Soldiers also learn about oscillation, landing falls, and how to recover from drag. The T-10D and T-11 parachutes are partially steerable using the parachute risers and students are taught the different techniques to steer their chutes into the wind and aim for the Point of Impact {{at the center of the}} Drop Zone. The second week completes a soldier's individual skill training and begins building team effort skills. Once successfully completing the skills required and the physical fitness requirements, a soldier progresses to jump week.|$|E

40|$|The skydiving/parachuting sport {{which has}} {{recently}} gained popularity {{is also known}} for its accidents and injuries. However, {{there are a few}} studies related to its occupational ergonomic risks and occupational musculoskeletal diseases. It has been reported that the sudden hyperextension of the neck during the parachute opening, so called <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> results in neck pain. It has been found that the jumpers are subjected to an average deceleration of 3 – 5 times the earth’s gravitational acceleration (3 – 5 G) during parachute <b>opening</b> <b>shock.</b> It is considered that the spinal cord is destabilized by the impact of this force.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new {{calculation of the}} <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> factor C (sub k) characterizing the inflation performance of NASA's Orion spacecraft main and drogue parachutes opening under a reefing constraint (1 st stage reefing), as currently tested in the Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) program. This calculation {{is based on an}} application of the Momentum-Impulse Theorem at low mass ratio (R (sub m) is less than 10 (sup - 1)) and on an earlier analysis of the opening performance of drogues decelerating point masses and inflating along horizontal trajectories. Herein we extend the reach of the Theorem to include the effects of payload drag and gravitational impulse during near-vertical motion - both important pre-requisites for CPAS parachute analysis. The result is a family of C (sub k) versus R (sub m) curves which can be used for extrapolating beyond the drop-tested envelope. The paper proves this claim {{in the case of the}} CPAS Mains and Drogues opening while trailing either a Parachute Compartment Drop Test Vehicle or a Parachute Test Vehicle (an Orion capsule boiler plate). It is seen that in all cases the values of the <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> factor can be extrapolated over a range in mass ratio that is at least twice that of the test drop data...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed which is capable of predicting {{the performance of a}} wave rotor (pressure exchanger) of specified geometry over a wide range of operating conditions. The model can account for the major loss mechanisms of leakage from the tube ends, fluid viscosity, heat transfer to the tube wails, finite tube <b>opening</b> time, <b>shock</b> waves, and non-uniform port flows. It is a one dimensional flow model which follows a single tube as it rotates past the various stationary ports. Since the model is relatively simple (i. e., one dimensional) it uses little computer time. This makes it suitable for design as well as analytical purposes. This paper will present {{a brief description of the}} model then discuss a comparison between the model predictions and several wave rotor experiments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical approach {{to compute the}} performance of a double diaphragm shock tube facility for structural response investigations. To assess the influence of different sources of dissipation, including partial diaphragm <b>opening</b> and <b>shock</b> tube vibration, numerical simulations are carried out using several different finite element models of increasing complexity to compute shock tube performance. The numerical model accounting for tearing and partial opening of the diaphragms is the one that best reproduces the results of the experiment, thus indicating that the diaphragm non-ideal opening process is the most relevant cause of losses. Both the numerical and the experimental results agree in predicting shock tube efficiency in terms of intensity of the reflected shock of about 50 – 60 % with respect to ideal, one-dimensional conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} filter oscillatory transients from measurements of a time series which were at least {{an order of magnitude}} larger than the signal to be measured. Based on a Kalman filter, it has an optimality property and a natural scaling parameter that allows to tune it to high resolution or low noise. 1 How transients can spoil measurements In her Matura thesis [5], Carmen Müller tried to measure the <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> of small parachutes in the Ackeret wind tunnel of the Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich (ETHZ). A specially constructed mounting tube ejected the parachute using a piston powered by a small black powder charge into the air stream. While this accurately reflected the way parachutes are usually ejected from small rockets, it also induced heavy oscillations in the measurement equipment and probably also excited waves within the wind tunnel. As a result, the data was almost unusable. The large amplitude transients were at least one order of magnitude larger than the effects to be measured (figure 1). Upon inspection of the data, two oscillatory components with frequencies of about 40 Hz and 12. 2 Hz were found. Assuming that the measured signal is a superposition of the actual force to be measured f(t) and a transient of period T, convolution with a function of constant value T − 1 on the interval [−T, 0], or equivalently a moving average over the samples that fit in an interval of length T, eliminated the transient. In this way, the two dominant transients could be removed, and an approximation to the <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> force was obtained. Th...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a derivation of the <b>opening</b> <b>shock</b> factor (Ck) and inflation duration (tfill) {{that characterize the}} inflation of slider-reefed parafoils. The results apply to large-mass ratio systems, such as personnel parachutes, that inflate along a downward vertical trajectory and experience maximum drag (Fmax) during slider-descent. The derivation of Ck {{is based on a}} formulas derived from the well-validated inflation computer model discussed in another paper presented at this conference (see paper 2007 - 2501). The formula for tfill is obtained by merging this result with a general expression for Ck, obtained from the Momentum-Impulse theorem in which the inflation time is a crucial input. These derivations are followed by an altitude-scaling study of the maximum deceleration (and force) sustained by the system. The importance of the duration and characteristics of the “slider-up ” phase in determining overall inflation performance is also examined...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedA program was initiated {{to develop a}} radio-controlled fighter aircraft {{to be used for}} supermaneuverability and agility flight research. High angle-of-attack flight testing a high-risk and very expensive endeavor in manned aircraft, and wind tunnel testing to duplicate dynamic maneuvers is extremely difficult. Another means to conduct agility fight research in a low-cost, low- risk environment has been sought. Construction of a scaled generic Navy fighter model, to be powered by ducted-fan engines and controlled by radio command, was begun. Also, it was deemed essential to incorporate an emergency recovery system in the aircraft, should control be lost due to radio component failure, primary flight system malfunction, or departure from controlled flight.

40|$|Autonomous airdrop systems exhibit {{significant}} improvements over their unguided counterparts {{due to the}} addition of control mechanisms and real-time feedback. Increased landing accuracy comes with a high dependence on accurate sensor measurements (primarily GPS) and a consistent nominal system and environment. Unfortunately, airdrop systems represent a highly uncertain class of aerial vehicles where operation at off-nominal, degraded conditions is the norm and not the exception. Degraded conditions are caused by numerous effects including: parafoil rigging changes caused by canopy <b>opening</b> <b>shock,</b> parafoil damage during canopy inflation, parafoil canopy collapse, payload mass and inertial loading imbalances, human rigging errors, etc. Additionally, the loss of GPS feedback due to environmental causes (urban or canyon environments blocking the signal or causing multi-pathing issues) and active GPS denial by tech savvy adversaries present a second classification of degraded flight. These issues must be addressed to aid the continued expansion of the parafoil technology for delivery and re-entry purposes. This work applies two solutions to overcome the problems of physical degraded flight conditions and loss of GPS feedback. A highly adaptive control law is embedded {{at the core of}} the new guidance, navigation and control (GNC) algorithm to identify system dynamics and control sensitivity using a discrete nonlinear Hammerstein dynamic model. All model parameters are estimated in-flight to maintain a high level of landing accuracy under a large range of degraded flight conditions. In addition, an analysis into the feasibility of radio frequency (RF) beacons as a redundant feedback system to GPS is analyzed. Novel GNC algorithms are introduced to handle the limited feedback that RF beacons provide in comparison to the rich data embedded in GPS. Performance of the proposed autonomous algorithms are tested through rigorous simulation of a validated flight dynamic model and experimental testing on a small scale autonomous parafoil and payload system.
