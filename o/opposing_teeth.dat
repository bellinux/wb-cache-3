5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth.</b> There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth.</b> Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E
500|$|Examination of {{the jaws}} and teeth gave {{information}} about the dental health of those buried in the priory. The degree of wear of teeth was greater than it is at present, while the incidence of dental caries was much lower than it is now, as was the incidence of periodontal disease. A consequence of the wear of the teeth was [...] "compensatory eruption" [...] of the teeth {{in order to keep}} contact with the <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth.</b> It was concluded that the people buried in the priory had few problems with their teeth or jaws. Loss of teeth was due to wear of the teeth, rather than from caries or periodontal disease.|$|E
25|$|Smoothing an <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> which bites {{into the}} {{affected}} operculum can eliminate this source of trauma.|$|R
50|$|Attrition {{occurs as}} a result of <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> {{surfaces}} contacting. The contact can affect cuspal, incisal and proximal surface areas.|$|R
2500|$|When an <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> bites {{into the}} operculum, it can {{initiate}} or exacerbate pericoronitis {{resulting in a}} spiraling cycle [...] of inflammation and trauma.|$|R
500|$|After placement, {{implants}} need to {{be cleaned}} (similar to natural teeth) with a Teflon instrument to remove any plaque. Because of the more precarious blood supply to the gingiva, care should be taken with dental floss. Implants will lose bone at a rate similar to natural teeth in the mouth (e.g. if someone suffers from periodontal disease, an implant can be affected by a similar disorder) but will otherwise last. The porcelain on crowns {{should be expected to}} discolour, fracture or require repair approximately every ten years, although there is significant variation in the service life of dental crowns based on the position in the mouth, the forces being applied from <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth</b> and the restoration material. Where implants are used to retain a complete denture, {{depending on the type of}} attachment, connections {{need to be}} changed or refreshed every one to two years. [...] A powered irrigator may also be useful for [...] cleaning around implants.|$|E
500|$|The tips of {{the jaws}} bore a {{semicircle}} of 48 teeth which were even in size, triangular, and compressed sideways. The teeth {{have been described as}} [...] "petal-like" [...] or [...] "lancet-like". The teeth had sharply pointed crowns and triangular roots that were shorter than the crowns. Most tooth crowns had slightly blunted points, or were somewhat worn. The margins of the tooth crowns were not serrated, but had faint keels. There were 24 upper teeth, restricted to the part in front of the nostril, and 24 lower teeth, restricted to the symphysal region. The upper and lower teeth interlocked, forming a [...] "razor-edged" [...] or [...] "zig-zag" [...] outline. The front teeth were closely spaced, and the hind teeth were more widely spaced, with recesses for the <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth.</b> A sharp projection between two teeth at the middle front of the mandible has been described as an odontoid (or [...] "pseudo-tooth"), but was previously interpreted as an actual tooth. The odontoid may have been encased in a keratinous covering so that it could occlude with the teeth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{range of}} {{potential}} morphologies resulting from evolution {{is limited by}} complex interacting processes, ranging from development to function. Quantifying these interactions is important for understanding adaptation and convergent evolution. Using three-dimensional reconstructions of carnivoran and dasyuromorph tooth rows, we compared statistical models {{of the relationship between}} tooth row shape and the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> row, a static feature, as well as measures of mandibular motion during chewing (occlusion), which are kinetic features. This is a new approach to quantifying functional integration because we use measures of movement and displacement, such as the amount the mandible translates laterally during occlusion, as opposed to conventional morphological measures, such as mandible length and geometric landmarks. By sampling two distantly related groups of ecologically similar mammals, we study carnivorous mammals in general rather than a specific group of mammals. Results Statistical model comparisons demonstrate that the best performing models always include some measure of mandibular motion, indicating that functional and statistical models of tooth shape as purely a function of the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> row are too simple and that increased model complexity provides a better understanding of tooth form. The predictors of the best performing models always included the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> row shape and a relative linear measure of mandibular motion. Conclusions Our results provide quantitative support of long-standing hypotheses of tooth row shape as being influenced by mandibular motion in addition to the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> row. Additionally, this study illustrates the utility and necessity of including kinetic features in analyses of morphological integration. </p...|$|R
50|$|Active {{eruption}} {{is known}} as eruption of teeth into the mouth towards the occlusal plane. This is a natural path of eruption of all the teeth as they emerge from gingiva and continue erupting until they {{make contact with the}} <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stabilizing or Michigan-type occlusal splints are {{generally}} {{flat against the}} <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth,</b> and help jaw muscle relaxation, while repositioning occlusal splints are used to reposition the jaw to improve occlusion.|$|E
50|$|Dental {{porcelain}} {{is generally}} regarded as biologically inert. However, other toxicities may exist from depleted uranium {{and some of the}} other accessory materials, and the fillings may increase wear on <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Porcelain, cobalt-chrome, {{and gold}} {{are used for}} {{indirect}} restorations like crowns and partial coverage crowns (onlays). Traditional porcelains are brittle and are not always recommended for molar restorations. Some hard porcelains cause excessive wear on <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Increased biting {{force on}} one tooth can cause {{temporary}} increased mobility until corrected. A common scenario {{is a new}} filling or crown which is {{a fraction of a}} millimeter too prominent in the bite, which after a few days causes periodontal pain in that <b>tooth</b> and/or the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{measures}} that are taken during {{management of the}} acute phase might include reducing {{the height of the}} tooth with a dental drill, so it no longer contacts the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> when biting down; and regular use of hot salt water mouth washes (antiseptic and encourages further drainage of the infection).|$|R
30|$|If the {{extraction}} side is not restored {{in a proper}} time following <b>tooth</b> extraction, the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> is erupted, and shortening of vertical dimension for prosthetic treatment occurs [1]. In this case, securing of insufficient intermaxillary space for fixed or removable prosthesis {{can be an important}} point in establishing treatment plan [1, 2].|$|R
50|$|Diastema {{is defined}} as a space between two {{adjoining}} teeth. Food can be trapped between teeth leading to severe periodontal disease and poor dental health overall. It is very difficult to correct. The unopposed overgrowth of the <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth</b> must be reduced.|$|E
50|$|If a {{temporary}} crown becomes decemented, {{it is important}} that a dentist examine the patient as overeruption of the <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth</b> may prevent accurate fitting of the final crown. If a dentist cannot be seen in a timely manner, the temporary crown may be recemented by applying temporary cement to the temporary crown.|$|E
5000|$|A {{malocclusion}} is a misalignment or incorrect {{relation between}} {{the teeth of the}} two dental arches when they approach each other as the jaws close. The term was coined by Edward Angle, the [...] "father of modern orthodontics", as a derivative of occlusion. This refers to the manner in which <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth</b> meet ( [...] + occlusion = [...] "incorrect occlusion").|$|E
25|$|Removal of the {{associated}} tooth will eliminate the plaque stagnation area, and thus eliminate any further episodes of pericoronitis. Removal is indicated when the involved tooth will not erupt any further due to impaction or ankylosis; if extensive work {{would be required to}} restore structural damage; or to allow improved oral hygiene. Sometimes the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> is also extracted if no longer required.|$|R
30|$|Dental {{fluorosis}} in {{the anterior}} teeth affects the tooth appearance, and severe dental fluorosis with tooth defects in posterior teeth negatively influences mastication [5]. Restorations, such as crowns, inlays, or onlays, are often required {{to restore the}} teeth damaged by dental fluorosis [6, 7]. Matching of the mechanical behavior of the restorative material {{to that of the}} <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> enamel is especially important to prevent excessive wear of the natural tooth enamel or the applied material itself [8 – 11]. Ceramics are widely used as restorative materials because of their high biocompatibility and similar esthetics to the natural tooth enamel [47]. However, ceramics present high wear resistance, which causes excessive wear of the <b>opposing</b> natural <b>tooth</b> enamel [47, 48]. Materials with low wear resistance, such as PICN and composite resin block, have been developed as alternatives to ceramics [48, 49]. PICN exhibits a wear resistance {{similar to that of the}} outer layer of the normal tooth enamel. Thus, when the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> is a normal tooth, PICN is the proper material for restoration. However, the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> in dental fluorosis requiring restoration likely presents mild dental fluorosis. In this case, materials with nanotribological properties similar to those of the mild dental fluorosis enamel are necessary to restore dental fluorosis. Conventional composite resins, such as Z 350, reveal a wear resistance lower than that of the outer layer of mild dental fluorosis; such a characteristic may lead to increased wear of the restorative materials. Composite resin block, such as LUV, is fabricated under high temperatures and high pressures and possesses mechanical properties superior to those of the conventional composite resins [50]. In the present study, composite resin block showed a wear resistance similar to that of the outer layer of the mild dental fluorosis enamel. This characteristic implies that this material is appropriate for use as restorative material for dental fluorosis. As the nanomechanical behavior of dental fluorosis enamel determines the selection of the restorative material, the appropriate material should be applied for dental fluorosis to achieve better clinical outcomes. Thus, additional studies on the nanomechanical behavior of dental fluorosis enamel should be conducted, and novel restorative materials should be further developed.|$|R
25|$|Pericoronitis {{is caused}} by an {{accumulation}} of bacteria and debris beneath the operculum, or by mechanical trauma (e.g. biting the operculum with the <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth).</b> Pericoronitis {{is often associated with}} partially erupted and impacted mandibular third molars (lower wisdom teeth), often occurring at the age of wisdom tooth eruption (15-24). Other common causes of similar pain from the third molar region are food impaction causing periodontal pain, pulpitis from dental caries (tooth decay), and acute myofascial pain in temporomandibular joint disorder.|$|R
50|$|Centric {{occlusion}} is the occlusion of <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth</b> {{when the}} mandible is in centric relation. Centric occlusion {{is the first}} tooth contact and {{may or may not}} coincide with maximum intercuspation. It is also referred to as a person's habitual bite, bite of convenience, or intercuspation position (ICP). Centric relation, {{not to be confused with}} centric occlusion, is a relationship between the maxilla and mandible.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} members of the diplogastrid family, Micoletzkya {{nematodes}} have movable <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth</b> and show a mouth dimorphism. Dimorphic species of the genus can express two alternative mouth phenotypes: stenostomatous (narrow mouth and small teeth) and eurystomatous (wide mouth and large teeth). The two alternative phenotypes are thought to represent a resource polyphenism, or specialized for feeding on different foods, such as microorganisms and other nematodes respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Coors Biomedical Co., a Porcelain subsidiary, {{developed}} a low-shrinkage, high-alumina porcelain for [...] dental restorations {{in the early}} 1980s, that could be fitted and fabricated in the dentist’s office.

[...] The technology became the property of Johnson & Johnson after Coors Biomedical’s demise in the late 1980s.|$|E
50|$|An {{extraction}} {{can also}} serve as treatment for dental caries. The removal of the decayed tooth is performed if the tooth is too far destroyed from the decay process to effectively restore the tooth. Extractions are sometimes considered if the <b>tooth</b> lacks an <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> or will probably cause further problems in the future, as {{may be the case}} for wisdom teeth. Extractions may also be preferred by people unable or unwilling to undergo the expense or difficulties in restoring the tooth.|$|R

50|$|The {{crowning}} of two {{fairly large}} molars to sling {{a bridge between}} them for a missing tooth is a costly and sometimes oversold procedure. The increased food and bacteria trapping of {{the underside of the}} bridge often offsets the benefits of the bridge element in maintaining the positions of the <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth</b> and the loss of the ease of use and mouth feel of two big natural teeth.|$|E
50|$|The {{theory of}} Posterior Guided Occlusion (PGO) has a static and dynamic {{component}}. The static component is {{a position where}} the mandible is in a braced, neuromuscular position at which the posterior teeth touch stable, non-deflecting surfaces on <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth.</b> It allows the antero-medial aspect {{of the head of}} the mandibular condyle to be firmly braced on the medial aspect of the glenoid fossa. This anatomical position allows for the maximal coordinated contraction of the major muscles of closure of the mandible.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the jaws}} close, for {{instance}} during chewing or at rest, {{the relationship between}} the <b>opposing</b> <b>teeth</b> is referred to as occlusion. When trauma, disease or dental treatment alters occlusion by changing the biting surface of any of the teeth, the teeth will come together differently, and their occlusion will change. When that change has a negative effect on how the teeth occlude, this may cause tenderness, pain, and damage to or movement of the teeth. This called traumatic occlusion.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, {{the area}} {{underneath}} the operculum is gently irrigated to remove debris and inflammatory exudate. Often warm saline is used but other solutions may contain hydrogen peroxide, chlorhexidine or other antiseptics. Irrigation may be assisted {{in conjunction with}} Debridement (removal of plaque, calculus and food debris) with periodontal instruments. Irrigation may be enough to relieve any associated pericoronal abscess; otherwise a small incision {{can be made to}} allow drainage.Smoothing an <b>opposing</b> <b>tooth</b> which bites into the affected operculum can eliminate this source of trauma.|$|R

40|$|A {{new family}} of {{compliant}} and self-locking tapered torsional couplings {{have been developed}} as an alternate to spline-type couplings.

The taper is self-locking to prevent radial deflection under torsional load. This eliminates backlash between parts while maintaining a relatively high torsional stiffness.
