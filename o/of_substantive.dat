5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E
5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis {{in the words of the}} Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{regulation}} of executive action was met with judicial reluctance to intervene. Certain types of governmental discretion, exercised using prerogative powers, were regarded as {{beyond the scope of}} judicial scrutiny because they involved issues <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> policy. However, developments focused on the substance of the issues at hand, rather than merely accepting that the prerogative power is non-justiciable per se. Simply put, the focus shifted from the source of the power to the subject matter.|$|E

5|$|The {{subsequent}} push inland towards Carpiquet and the Caen–Bayeux railway line achieved mixed results. The {{sheer numbers}} {{of men and}} vehicles on the beaches created lengthy delays between the landing of the 9th Brigade and the beginning <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> attacks to the south. The 7th Brigade encountered heavy initial opposition before pushing south and making contact with the British 50th Division at Creully. The 8th Brigade encountered heavy resistance from a battalion of the 716th at Tailleville, while the 9th Brigade deployed towards Carpiquet early in the evening. Resistance in Saint-Aubin prevented the Royal Marines from establishing contact with the British 3rd Division on Sword. When all operations on the Anglo-Canadian front were ordered to halt at 21:00, by which time The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada had reached its D-Day objective, and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had succeeded in pushing farther inland than any other landing force on D-Day.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E

25|$|The {{previous}} term, the Court had dramatically enlarged {{the activities}} that {{were considered to be}} in or to affect interstate commerce.

25|$|The President of the Czech Republic has the {{authority}} to act independently in a number <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> areas.

Gaudron J was accompanied by Dawson, McHugh and Gummow JJ.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to offer a {{complete}} description of the dec 1 ension <b>of</b> the <b>substantives</b> in the Grigorovich's prophetologium (Grig), a Macedonian church Slavonic literary work from the end ofthe 12 th or {{the beginning of the}} 13 th Century, and {{on the basis of this}} description to establish the system relations among the various paradigms and herewith discover the development tendencies which are expresse'd in the dec 1 ension <b>of</b> the <b>substantives</b> <b>of</b> this literary work in the context of the church Slavonic literature of that time.

25|$|Much {{substantive}} {{due process}} litigation involves legal challenges about unenumerated rights that seek particular outcomes instead of merely contesting procedures and their effects. In successful cases, the Supreme Court recognizes a constitutionally based liberty that considers laws {{that seek to}} limit that liberty to be unenforceable or limited in scope. Critics <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> due process decisions usually assert {{that there is no}} textual basis in the Constitution for such protection and that such liberties should be left under the purview of the more politically accountable branches of government.|$|E
25|$|The Taney Court (1836–64) {{made several}} {{important}} rulings, such as Sheldon v. Sill, which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit {{the jurisdiction of}} the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects. Nevertheless, it is primarily remembered for its ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford, which helped precipitate the Civil War. In the Reconstruction era, the Chase, Waite, and Fuller Courts (1864–1910) interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution and developed the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> due process (Lochner v. New York; Adair v. United States).|$|E

25|$|The {{courts have}} largely {{abandoned}} the Lochner era approach (ca. 1897–1937), when substantive due process {{was used to}} strike down minimum wage and labor laws to protect freedom of contract. Since then, the Supreme Court has decided that numerous other freedoms, {{even if they are}} not in the text of the Constitution, are protected by it. If they were not protected by the federal courts' doctrine <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> due process, they could nevertheless be protected in other ways; for example, some rights are protected by other provisions of the state or federal constitutions or by legislatures.|$|E
25|$|Dawson J also {{attacked}} {{the notion that}} legal equality might arise from the Constitution as a free agreement of the people; he noted {{that there was a}} degree of equality lacking, with regards to women and Aboriginals. In relation to the common law, even if there were a common law right <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> equality, the Commonwealth parliament has the ability to usurp the common law otherwise its concurrent power will be less than that of the States. Finally, even with the existence of Chapter III courts, {{it is not possible to}} declare a law invalid because it is substantively unequal.|$|E

It struck down single-sex state schools as a violation of equal protection (United States v. Virginia), laws against sodomy as violations <b>of</b> <b>substantive</b> due process (Lawrence v. Texas), and the line item veto (Clinton v. New York), but upheld school vouchers (Zelman v. Simmons-Harris) and reaffirmed Roes restrictions on abortion laws (Planned Parenthood v. Casey). The Court's decision in Bush v. Gore, which ended the electoral recount during the presidential election of 2000, was especially controversial.|$|E
