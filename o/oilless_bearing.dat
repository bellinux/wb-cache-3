40|$|Abstract. Oilless bearings, {{which are}} made with metal powders and then {{impregnated}} by oils, are widely used in rotating components. The friction coefficients and the oil loss rates of two types of oil-impregnated sintered-metal bearings (porous bearings, oilless bearings, or oilless metals) with varying loads were measured. One is the Cu-based bearing {{and the other is}} Fe-based bearing. The frictional forces of the bearings were measured using the journal bearing tester. By measuring the change of weight before and after sliding tests, the oil losses of oilless bearings were surveyed. Also, PV curves, which could be used to predict the life of the <b>oilless</b> <b>bearing,</b> were plotted. By observing the roundness, the cylindericity and the images of scanning electron microscopy of bearings before and after sliding tests, the tribological characteristics of the bearings were evaluated. It was found that Fe-based bearing show lower friction, more oil flow, less wear and longer life than Cu-based bearing...|$|E
5000|$|The FM3a {{is built}} {{to a high}} level of {{workmanship}} and material quality. It shares the advantages of the FM and the FM2N, both generally regarded as two of the most reliable cameras ever built (both in terms of operation under extreme conditions and in day-to-day reliability reports from repair shops and magazine surveys). It has an extremely strong body of copper silumin alloy. The electronics are well protected within the body and of extremely high quality, including the flexible circuits. The FM3A's film transport consists of high-strength hardened metal gears and moving parts, mounted on clusters of ball bearings. The vertical metal shutter utilises precision tapered high-strength aluminium alloy blades and <b>oilless</b> self-lubricating <b>bearings.</b> The guide rails are made of stainless steel. The mirror is made of titanium. It is large to reduce chances of vignetting with super-telephotos of up to 800 mm, and uses the same mechanism found on Nikon's pro F2, with some improvements designed to further reduce effects of vibration and mirror bounce.|$|R
