50|$|The {{obstruction}} {{that creates}} an NLOS link {{may be the}} Earth itself, such as would exist if {{the other end of}} the link was beyond the <b>optical</b> <b>horizon.</b> A very useful property of the Earth's atmosphere is that, on average, the density of air gas molecules reduces as the altitude increases up to approximately 30 km. Its relative permittivity or dielectric constant reduces steadily from about 1.00536 at the Earth's surface. To model the change in refractive index with altitude, the atmosphere may be approximated to many thin air layers, each of which has a slightly smaller refractive index than the one below. The trajectory of radio waves progressing through such an atmosphere model at each interface, is analogous to optical beams passing from one optical medium to another as predicted by Snell's Law. When the beam passes from a higher to lower refractive index it tends to get bent or refracted away from the normal at the boundary according to Snell's Law. When the curvature of the Earth is taken into account it is found that, on average, radio waves whose initial trajectory is towards the <b>optical</b> <b>horizon</b> follows a path that does not return to the Earth's surface at the horizon, but slightly beyond it. The distance from the transmit antenna to where it does return is approximately equivalent to the <b>optical</b> <b>horizon,</b> had the Earth's radius been 4/3 of its actual value. The '4/3 Earth's radius' is a useful rule of thumb to the radio communication engineers when designing such a NLOS link.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{experimental}} {{claim of}} {{the detection of}} analogue Hawking radiation in an optical system [PRL 105 (2010) 203901] has led to some controversy [PRL 107 (2011) 149401, 149402]. While this experiment strongly suggests some form of particle creation from the quantum vacuum (and hence it is per se very interesting), {{it is also true}} that it seems difficult to completely explain all features of the observations by adopting the perspective of a Hawking-like mechanism for the radiation. For instance, the observed photons are emitted parallel to the <b>optical</b> <b>horizon,</b> and the relevant <b>optical</b> <b>horizon</b> is itself defined in an unusual manner by combining group and phase velocities. This raises the question: Is this really Hawking radiation, or some other form of quantum vacuum radiation? Naive estimates of the amount of quantum vacuum radiation generated due to the rapidly changing refractive index [...] - sometimes called the dynamical Casimir effect [...] - are not encouraging. However we feel that naive estimates could be misleading depending on the quantitative magnitude of two specific physical effects: "pulse steepening" and "pulse cresting". Plausible bounds on the maximum size of these two effects results in estimates much closer to the experimental observations, and we argue that the dynamical Casimir effect is now worth additional investigation.

40|$|Presently, {{the most}} widely used {{navigation}} technologies for unmanned air vehicles(UAVs) are integrated inertial-satellite navigation systems (INS/GPS). Such a tandem shows good results. However the inertial part of such a system often based on low-cost MEMS sensors and still is the only source of information about an UAV's angular attitude. At the same time on such an UAVs the onboard video equipment including video cameras are often installed. Using this camera and computer vision technology for video image processing one can build <b>optical</b> <b>horizon</b> sensor (OHS) which can provide additional information about aircraft motion parameters. In this paper a problem of improving the measurement accuracy of pitch and roll estimation of integrated navigation system by means of OHS introduction is discussed. Specially developed image processing algorithm is able to recognize the horizon line. The algorithm assumes applying of the morphological operators and Sobel edge detector for image pre-filtering, as well as the usage of linear Hough transform for horizon line building. Knowledge of horizon line position on the image allow us to estimate roll and pitch angles of the aircraft according to the principal of linear perspective. The algorithm showed high estimation accuracy of the orientation angles and got a real time implementation that allowed to build the OHS on its basis. At the next stage the OHS was introduced into the UAV's loosely coupled integrated navigation system, which also included a three-axis inertial measurement unit, GPS receiver and magnetometric sensor of heading. In order to clarify the feasibility of using OHS in such system the error standard deviations of OHS, basic navigation system and basic navigation system with OHS obtained from simulation series are presented in comparison. In conclusion the error levels of basic navigation system primary sensors for which it is appropriate loosely coupled integration with OHS was specified. A problem of improving the measurement accuracy of pitch and roll estimation of integrated navigation system by means of <b>optical</b> <b>horizon</b> sensor introduction is discussed.

To date, it is still under discussion which sensory cues helicopter pilots use for this stabilization task, and how these cues are combined. Here we investigated how cues from different sensory modalities (visual cues and body cues) are used when humans stabilize a simulated helicopter at a target location in a closed perception-action loop. Participants were seated inside a closed cabin on a Stewart platform equipped with a projection screen. They had to stabilize a simulated helicopter on a target spot. To investigate the influence of individual visual cues on the stabilization, a minimalistic visual scene was used. Two spheres in the scene represented the location of the target and the position of the helicopter. Optical flow was provided by world-stationary random dots, and a horizon was produced by a black ground plane and white sky. We measured stabilization performance in ten different conditions: black background, <b>horizon,</b> <b>optical</b> flow, both <b>horizon</b> and <b>optical</b> flow, and horizontal stripes; all of these both with and without platform rotation cueing. Physical pitch and roll body rotations were presented by tilting the platform exactly as the simulated helicopter tilted. Our results show that all manipulated cues – <b>horizon,</b> <b>optical</b> flow, and platform rotations – can help the participants to stabilize a simulated helicopter. In particular, adding physical rotation cues to visual stimulation in a simulator can significantly improve the ability of trained participants to stabilize the simulated helicopter at a target location.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedABSTRACT A method for passive ranging {{based on the}} principle of triangulation is considered In the basic triangulation scheme that is a single baseline model the precision in the bearing readings can be related to the precision in the range estimation. For some target orienta- tions the precision in the triangulated target range is completely lost This phenomenon i'i known as "geometric dilution. " A proposed orthogonal dual baseline scheme eliminates the "geometric dilution" effect The performance of each of the two orthogonal baselines depends on target orientation. For specific target orientations the triangulation range mea- surements for the two baselines are equivalent The dual baseline scheme would require "smart electronics" which would switch between baselines at crossover points in the range estimation precision. It is shown that the crossover points depend primarily on the ratio of the two baselines. A general expression for the maximum triangulation range consistent with limitations in minimum tolerance precision in range estimation is derived. The depen- dency between maximum range and target orientation are presented in polar form. Limitations in the dual baseline model due to physical limitation created by the <b>optical</b> <b>horizon</b> are also considered. Hellenic Army autho...|$|E

In 1993 the NATO MAPTIP trial allowed us to observe an infrared point source from a platform at sea with a 10 micron FLIR, at various ranges (0. 5 - 5 NM) and in various directions. In 1994 an infrared source was used at fixed distances on a platform at sea, with heights at the platform ranging between 1. 5 and 7 m above the sea level. Some additional sources, at different height levels, were installed later in the experiment. The receiver system was placed at 18 km on a pier near the Dutch coast. Recordings took place with the receiver at two heights, 40 and 15 m above the average sea level. A single recording consisted of 10 seconds of measurements at 25 Hz with a 64 by 64 Cincinnati IRC- 64 A camera in the 3 - 5 micrometer band. Also data in the 10 micrometer band is available.

40|$|Abstract — Visualization {{of general}} {{relativity}} illustrates aspects of Einstein’s insights into the curved nature {{of space and time}} to the expert as well as the layperson. One of the most interesting models which came up with Einstein’s theory was developed by Kurt Gödel in 1949. The Gödel universe is a valid solution of Einstein’s field equations, making it a possible physical description of our universe. It offers remarkable features like the existence of an <b>optical</b> <b>horizon</b> beyond which time travel is possible. Although we know that our universe is not a Gödel universe, it is interesting to visualize physical aspects of a world model resulting from a theory which is highly confirmed in scientific history. Standard techniques to adopt an egocentric point of view in a relativistic world model have shortcomings with respect to the time needed to render an image as well as difficulties in applying a direct illumination model. In this paper we want to face both issues to reduce the gap between common visualization standards and relativistic visualization. We will introduce two techniques to speed up recalculation of images by means of preprocessing and lookup tables and to increase image quality through a special optimization applicable to the Gödel universe. The first technique allows the physicist to understand the different effects {{of general relativity}} faster and better by generating images from existing datasets interactively. By using the intrinsic symmetries of Gödel’s spacetime which are expressed by the Killing vector field, we are able to reduce the necessary calculations to simple cases using the second technique. This even makes it feasible to account for a direct illumination model during the rendering process. Although the presented methods are applied to Gödel’s universe, they can also be extended to other manifolds, for example light propagation in moving dielectric media. Therefore, other areas of research can benefit from these generic improvements. Index Terms—General relativity, Gödel universe, nonlinear ray tracing, time travel. ...|$|E

40|$|The optical analog of {{an event}} horizon, in which an intense optical soliton {{propagating}} in a nonlinear waveguide prevents a weak probe wave travelling at a different velocity from passing through it, has recently attracted {{a lot of attention}} for theoretical similarities with general relativity as well as for potential applications [1, 2]. Among others, {{it has been shown that}} the strong light-light interaction occurring at the <b>optical</b> event <b>horizon</b> can be exploited for high efficient frequency conversion [3] or for the realization of useful all-optical transistors [4]. Here we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first optical analog {{of an event}} horizon in integrated photonic nonlinear structures, through the reflexion of a continuous wave (CW) on an intense pulse. We use a 7 mm-long, 800 nm-wide silicon-on-insulator waveguide with standard 220 nm silicon thickness, which has a zero dispersion wavelength located around 1710 nm. At the input, we launch an intense pump pulse (200 fs, 82 MHz) at 1940 nm together with a weak continuous probe wave at 1540 nm. The later wavelength is chosen close to the wavelength that is group velocity matched with the soliton at 1940 nm [~ 1550 nm, see in Fig. 1 (b) ]. Experimental output spectra are plotted in Fig. 1 (a) in the range 1. 2 - 1. 7 µm, i. e. up to the wavelength cut-off of our optical spectrum analyzer.

40|$|We discuss new {{observations}} of X-ray novae which provide {{strong evidence that}} black holes have event <b>horizons.</b> <b>Optical</b> {{observations of}} 13 X-ray novae indicate that these binary stars contain collapsed objects too heavy to be stable neutron stars. The objects {{have been identified as}} black hole candidates. X-ray observations of several of these X-ray novae in quiescence with the Chandra X-ray Observatory show that the systems are approximately 100 times fainter than nearly identical X-ray novae containing neutron stars. The advection-dominated accretion flow model provides a natural explanation for the difference. In this model, the accreting gas reaches the accretor at the center with a large amount of thermal energy. If the accretor is a black hole, the thermal energy will disappear through the event horizon, and the object will be very dim. If the accretor is a neutron star or any other object with a surface, the energy will be radiated from the surface, and the object will be bright. We discuss alternate interpretations of the data that eliminate the need for advection-dominated accretion. Most of these alternatives still require an event horizon to explain the unusually low X-ray luminosities of the black hole candidates. In addition, some of the alternatives are inconsistent with observations. ...|$|R
