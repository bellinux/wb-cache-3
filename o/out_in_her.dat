She believed that some very general social laws influence the life of any society, including the principle of progress, the emergence of science as the most advanced product of human intellectual endeavour, and the significance of population dynamics and the natural physical environment.|$|E

Many trade goods were bought in Punt, notably frankincense and myrrh.|$|E

She also took 2/28 with her medium-pace bowling {{in the same}} match, which was followed by 3/21 in the next game against Ireland. Van Noortwijk also featured in the 1990 and 1991 editions of the tournament, with a notable performance being 3/13 against Denmark in the opening game of the 1991 tournament, helping her side to a narrow four-run victory.|$|E
25|$|Knowing her {{background}} in anthropology and various Native American organizations, {{it is not}} surprising that the most prevalent image in her poetry are bones. In her poetry, the image of battered bone is the direct link to native American sense of self. The bones of dead Indians almost form the words on the page and are the spine holding together each of her volumes of poetry. Stemming from her work with anthropology, she writes about bones auctioned, objects sold, and bodies stuffed for our edification in a museum display. Those dead Indians both form the phantoms that haunt her poetry and at the same time are given new life and the chance to speak <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> poetry.|$|E

She took three wickets at 35.00 at an economy rate of 3.00, and hit 54 in a six-wicket defeat in the fourth and final match of the series. Before the 2004–05 season started, Andrews toured Sri Lanka in September as part of the Australian Under-23s to play against the hosts' national team. Australia won three of the four one-dayers, the other was washed-out. Andrews took six wickets at 13.00, including 3/44 in the second match, and scored 10 not out and 31 not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> only innings. The tour ended with a first-class match against the Sri Lankan team. Andrews took 3/24 and 1/11 in a 144-run win. She also made seven and a duck on her first-class debut.|$|E
25|$|There seem to {{have been}} very few victims of the Black Death at higher levels of society. The only member of the royal family who can be said with any {{certainty}} to have died from the Black Death was in France {{at the time of her}} infection. Edward III's daughter Joan was residing in Bordeaux on her way to marry Pedro of Castile in the summer of 1348. When the plague broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> household she was moved to a small village nearby, but she could not avoid infection, and died there on 2 September. It is possible that the popular religious author Richard Rolle, who died on 30 September 1349, was another victim of the Black Death. The English philosopher William of Ockham has been mentioned as a plague victim. This, however, is an impossibility. Ockham was living in Munich at the time of his death, on 10 April 1347, two years before the Black Death reached that city.|$|E
