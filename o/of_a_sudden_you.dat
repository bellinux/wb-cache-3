Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were {{and used it to}} his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, [...] "He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them."
