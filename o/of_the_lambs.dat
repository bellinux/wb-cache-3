5|$|The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> a film {{adaptation}} of Harris' next Lecter novel, {{was released in}} 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> was followed in turn by a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic wave {{transmitted}} in {{the plate}} is called <b>Lamb</b> wave. <b>The</b> dispersion characteristic <b>of</b> <b>Lamb</b> wave {{makes it very}} complicated {{to be used in}} material Nondestructive Testing (NDT). In order to solve this problem, <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> frequency-dispersion characteristic of Lamb wave is made in this paper, and <b>the</b> dispersion curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lamb</b> wave in specific plate are plotted, then the physical propagation model of Lamb wave is established. Under <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> FFT, <b>the</b> expressions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lamb</b> wave in specific plate are obtained. By combining with <b>the</b> dispersion characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lamb</b> wave, <b>the</b> changes <b>of</b> waveform in different propagation distances are simulated. With <b>the</b> deep researches <b>of</b> new algorithms, Lamb wave will be applied in wider area...|$|R

5|$|Hannibal is a 2001 American {{psychological}} horror film {{directed by}} Ridley Scott, {{adapted from the}} novel {{of the same name}} by Thomas Harris. It is the sequel to the 1991 Academy Award–winning film The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> in which Anthony Hopkins returns to his role as the iconic serial killer, Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore co-stars, in the role first held by Jodie Foster, as FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling.|$|E
5|$|Set {{ten years}} after The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> Hannibal follows Starling's {{attempts}} to apprehend Lecter before his surviving victim, Mason Verger, captures him. It is set in Italy and the United States. The novel Hannibal drew attention for its violence. Hannibal broke box office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in February 2001, but was met with a mixed critical reception.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> and its sequels {{as the reason for}} the increased interest in Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this resurgence in appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a metascore of 78 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 33 reviews.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{arose in the}} early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an {{assistant}} film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on serial killer Ed Gein in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> (1991). During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface.|$|E
5|$|The dump months {{evolved over}} the course of the 20th century. Although during the studio era most major {{releases}} followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like The Kid, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January 1991 that went on to win that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Several years before that, Dirty Dancing and Fatal Attraction became hits following releases in August and September respectively.|$|E

5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all declined {{to be involved in}} its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a cameo role in {{the comedy}} The Ladies Man, Moore's only other {{appearance}} in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs.</b> Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she {{was not interested in}} upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction–comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received.|$|E
5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, leading to the commission of the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim in further developing the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line, and the English television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration was also taken from Carter's memories of watching Kolchak: The Night Stalker and The Twilight Zone in his youth; {{as well as from}} the then-recently released film The Silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> which was the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was also keen on keeping the relationship between the two lead roles strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and John Steed (Patrick Macnee) in the series The Avengers.|$|E
