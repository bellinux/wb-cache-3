5|$|The {{paintings}} {{of the first generation}} of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult <b>of</b> <b>Mary</b> was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the Life <b>of</b> <b>Mary</b> vastly predominate.|$|E
