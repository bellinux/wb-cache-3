500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's just not the Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that it was terrible... but this one just seemed to meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was a little bit too surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt {{like something out of a}} bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get soup for the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what? My arms?".|$|E
2500|$|After the Oscar {{ceremony}} on February 27, 2011 {{in which}} Portman won the Academy Award for Best Actress {{and where she}} thanked many people but didn't mention Lane, dancer and editor-in-chief of Dance Magazine Wendy Perron published a March 3, 2011 blog post in which she asks why a visual effects video clip showing Lane's face being replaced by Portman's was once available online but later removed from the Internet prior to the Oscars. She also speculates as to whether Portman deliberately didn't mention Lane, by asking {{if this was a}} case of [...] "forgetfulness {{in the heat of the}} moment? <b>Or</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> omission, and the deletion from the video, planned by the studio's publicity machine?" [...] Perron also asks, [...] "Do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that many people believe that Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a March 3, 2011 {{blog post}} (written {{prior to the}} DVD release) for Dance Magazine, its {{editor-in-chief}} Wendy Perron asked why a visual effects video clip showing Lane's face being replaced by Portman's was once available online but later removed from the Internet prior to the Oscars. She also speculated as to whether Portman's omission of Lane's name during her acceptance speech {{was a case of}} [...] "forgetfulness {{in the heat of the}} moment? <b>Or</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> omission, and the deletion from the video, planned by the studio's publicity machine?" [...] It was also noted that Lane is credited as [...] "Lady in the Lane" [...] and as [...] "Stunts" [...] rather than as Portman's double in the theatrical release of the film. This led to a number of responses regarding Portman. Aronofsky and Fox Searchlight released a joint statement that argued: [...] "We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did. However, Natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film." [...] Benjamin Millepied and Kunis also argued in defense of Portman's dancing. Lane responded through an essay published in The Wall Street Journal (Portman declined through a representative to write one as well) and an interview on 20/20 that her interest lies primarily in defense of ballet as an art form that cannot be mastered in a year.|$|E
