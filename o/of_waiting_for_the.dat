5|$|After the {{overthrow}} of the Mongol Yuan dynasty by the Ming dynasty in 1368, Manchuria remained under control of the Mongols of the Northern Yuan dynasty based in Mongolia. Naghachu, a former Yuan official and a Uriankhai general of the Northern Yuan dynasty, won hegemony over the Mongol tribes in Manchuria (Liaoyang province of the former Yuan dynasty). He grew strong in the northeast, with forces large enough (numbering hundreds of thousands) to threaten invasion of the newly founded Ming dynasty in order to restore the Mongols to power in China. The Ming decided to defeat him instead <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Mongols to attack. In 1387 the Ming sent a military campaign to attack Naghachu, which concluded with the surrender of Naghachu and Ming conquest of Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|Sarrail, {{who was not}} in Damascus at {{the time}} of the rebel assault, ordered aerial {{bombardment}} of the city, leading to the destruction of whole neighborhoods and the deaths of hundreds of Damascus residents. By 24 October, the rebels were routed, and al-Bakri escaped. He became the target of criticism among other rebel leaders, namely Said al-'As. Al-'As stated that al-Bakri sought personal glory when he decided to prematurely launch a mostly uncoordinated attack with small numbers of armed volunteers, instead <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arrival of al-Atrash's reinforcements, who numbered around 1,000. Al-Bakri was the only member of the Damascus nationalist elite to directly participate in the fighting on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Although {{details of}} the siege were not recorded, it {{appeared}} to be bloodless. The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled regime of Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a jizya (tribute), on condition that the caliph came to Jerusalem to sign the pact and accept the surrender. It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, Shurahbil ibn Hassana, one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> caliph to come all the way from Madinah, Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar. The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July 1828, the {{expedition}} boarded the ship Egl√© at Toulon and set sail for Egypt and {{they arrived in}} Alexandria on August 18. Here Champollion met with Drovetti who continued to warn about the political situation but assured Champollion that the Pasha would give his permission for {{the expedition}} to proceed. Champollion, Rosselini and Lenormant met with the Pasha on August 24, and he immediately gave his permission. However, {{after more than a}} week <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> permissions, Champollion suspected that Drovetti was working against him and took a complaint to the French consulate. The complaint worked and soon the pasha provided the expedition with a large river boat. The expedition bought a small boat for five persons. Champollion named them the Isis and the Athyr after Egyptian goddesses. On September 19, they arrived in Cairo, where they stayed until October 1 when they left for the desert sites of Memphis, Saqqara and Giza.|$|E
5|$|This left Chaltin's {{expedition}} as the spearhead for Leopold's northern campaign, and {{the commandant}} continued his mission despite the grave loss of Dhanis' forces. Chaltin {{had in his}} column eight companies, each containing one-hundred Congolese soldiers led by a Belgian lieutenant. He {{was accompanied by a}} contingent of five hundred Azande under chiefs Renzi and Bafuka. The expedition reached the Nile on 14 February 1897, where a small party of Mahdists from Rejaf exchanged fire with Chaltin's scouts. After two days <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> supply train and rear guard to arrive, a Mahdist force approached the Belgian camp in the evening of 16 February, and prepared to attack. Chaltin ordered his artillery to fire at the Mahdists, causing the assembled rebels to flee under the barrage. The next day, at six o'clock in the morning, Chaltin took to the offensive and began to advance on Rejaf.|$|E
5|$|After {{the legions}} under Flamininus had {{returned}} to Italy, the Greek states were once again on their own. The dominant powers in the region at this time were the kingdom of Macedon, which had recently lost a war against Rome, the Aetolians, the strengthened Achaean League and a reduced Sparta. The Aetolians, who had opposed the Roman intervention in Greek affairs, incited Nabis to retake his former territories and position among the Greek powers. By 192, Nabis who had built a new fleet and strengthened his army, besieged Gythium. The Achaeans responded by sending an envoy to Rome with a request for help. In response the Senate sent the praetor Atilius with a navy to defeat Nabis' navy {{as well as an}} embassy headed by Flamininus. Instead <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Roman fleet to arrive, the Achaean army and navy headed towards Gythium under the command of Philopoemen. The Achaean fleet was defeated by the recently constructed Spartan fleet, with the Achean flagship falling to pieces in the first ramming attack. On land as well the Achaeans could not defeat the Spartan forces outside Gythium and Philopoemen retreated to Tegea. When Philopoemen reentered Laconia for a second attempt his forces were ambushed by Nabis' but nevertheless he managed to gain a victory. The Achaeans now could ravage Laconia for thirty days unopposed while the Spartan troops remained in their fortified city. Plans for capturing Sparta itself had been laid by the time the Roman envoy Flamininus arrived and convinced the Achaean strategus Philopoemen to spare it. For the time being Nabis decided to accept the status quo in return and surrender under the same conditions as the last treaty.|$|E

5|$|Kingston {{lost its}} most {{influential}} advocate as permanent {{site of the}} Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955. By 1958, the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston. Clarence Campbell, then President of the NHL, grew tired <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction to begin and withdrew the NHL's support to situate the hall in Kingston. In the same year, the NHL and the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) reached an agreement {{to establish a new}} Hall of Fame building in Toronto, in the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame located at Exhibition Place. The temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in August 1958, and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair. Due {{to the success of the}} exhibit, NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the Exhibition Place was needed. The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place, and construction began in 1960. The first permanent Hockey Hall of Fame, which shared a building with the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, was opened on August 26, 1961, by Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Over 750,000 people visited the Hall in its inaugural year. Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame was free until 1980, when the Hockey Hall of Fame facilities underwent expansion.|$|E

WCW pulled together a 16-team tournament that saw seven teams made up of regular WCW competitors as well as teams from various countries such as Japan, Mexico, Canada and more. The eight matches {{of the first round}} all took place on June 16, 1992 at WCW's Clash of the Champions XIX. During the show WCW started a storyline feud between WCW's top tag team, the Steiner Brothers, and the favorite non-WCW team of Steve Williams and Terry Gordy, who {{had been one of the}} top teams in Japan for years prior to the tournament. During the show Gordy and Williams attacked the Steiners' opponents prior to the match, leading to the Steiners winning by forfeit. During the show the Steiners challenged Gordy and Williams to face them in the second round that night instead <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next round. In the main event of the Clash of Champions Gordy and Williams defeated the Steiner Brothers to advance to the semi-finals. In the month between the first round and the rest of the tournament Gordy and Williams defeated the Steiner Brothers to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

500|$|By mid-1968, the Doors had {{established}} themselves {{as one of}} the most popular groups in the US. The band's third studio album Waiting for the Sun, released in July of the same year, became the Doors' only number one hit on the Billboard 200, while also spawning their second single to peak at number one with [...] "Hello, I Love You". The album was the first commercial breakthrough for the band in the UK, reaching number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. After the release <b>of</b> <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sun, the Doors commanded vast sums of money to perform before large crowds in arenas such as the L.A. Forum, the Hollywood Bowl, and Madison Square Garden. Additionally, local Los Angeles Top 40 radio stations, particularly KHJ Radio, which had previously refused to play the band's records, began sponsoring the Doors' live performances. On September 2, 1968, the group played dates in Europe, along with Jefferson Airplane, before ending their long, grueling touring schedule with nine concerts back in the US. While the 1968 tours managed to capitalize on the chart success <b>of</b> <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sun, it also left little time for the Doors to compose new songs for The Soft Parade, having already exhausted all the material from Morrison's songbooks.|$|E

500|$|The general tone of {{the next}} day's press reviews ranged from {{disappointment}} to outrage. The more conservative critics complained about [...] "Wagnerism" [...] and the subordination of the voice to {{the noise of the}} orchestra. There was consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue; Galli-Mari√©'s interpretation of the role was described by one critic as [...] "the very incarnation of vice". Others compared the work unfavourably with the traditional Op√©ra-Comique repertoire of Auber and Boieldieu. L√©on Escudier in L'Art Musical called Carmens music [...] "dull and obscure ... the ear grows weary <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cadence that never comes". It seemed that Bizet had generally failed to fulfill expectations, both of those who (given Hal√©vy's and Meilhac's past associations) had expected something in the Offenbach mould, and of critics such as Adolphe Jullien who had anticipated a Wagnerian music drama. Among the few supportive critics was the poet Th√©odore de Banville; writing in Le National, he applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Op√©ra-Comique [...] "puppets".|$|E
500|$|A second {{effort was}} mounted by David Grant Grimshaw and Patricia Roche in 1993. A sum of $25,000 cash and in-kind {{services}} was raised with fundraising and annual Preservation Balls; {{it was later}} matched by the City of Bridgeport's Board of Park Commissioners with another grant of $25,000. During {{the night of the}} 1996 Preservation Ball the lighthouse was mysteriously lit, but Grimshaw did not arrange the illumination. D'Entremont writes that [...] "maybe the spirit of Kate Moore had grown tired <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> restoration." [...] The 1998 restoration was conducted under the direction of David Barbour, a local architect. The restoration included masonry repairs, reglazing the lantern room, rust removal from the railings, new doors and windows with vandal-proof steel panes. The lighthouse was repainted with graffiti-resistant paint in the original paint and mortar colors. The light, relit in 2000, does not serve as an active navigational aid. The light is powered by solar panels {{on the top of the}} lighthouse; it was donated by United Illuminating and Bridgeport Energy. In 2004, vandals smashed the solar panels and new panels with protective cages were installed in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Among leading musical figures at {{the premiere}} were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, and Charles Gounod. Genevi√®ve, {{suffering}} from an abscess {{in her right}} eye, was unable to be present. The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-Sa√´ns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: [...] "Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the sauce that masks the fish". Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue. Galli-Mari√©'s performance was described by one critic as [...] "the very incarnation of vice". Others complained {{of a lack of}} melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Op√©ra-Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu. L√©on Escudier in L'Art Musical called the music [...] "dull and obscure... the ear grows weary <b>of</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cadence that never comes". There was, however, praise from the poet Th√©odore de Banville, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Op√©ra-Comique [...] "puppets". The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: [...] "I foresee a definite and hopeless flop".|$|E
