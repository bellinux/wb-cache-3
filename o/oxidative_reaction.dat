40|$|Hemoglobin (Hb) {{continuously}} undergoes autoxidation producing superoxide which dismutates into {{hydrogen peroxide}} (H 2 O 2) {{and is a}} potential source for subsequent <b>oxidative</b> <b>reactions.</b> Autoxidation is most pronounced under hypoxic conditions in the microcirculation and for unstable dimers formed at reduced Hb concentrations. In the red blood cell (RBC), <b>oxidative</b> <b>reactions</b> are inhibited by an extensive antioxidant system. For extracellular Hb, whether from hemolysis of RBCs and/or the infusion of Hb-based blood substitutes, the <b>oxidative</b> <b>reactions</b> are not completely neutralized by the available antioxidant system. Un-neutralized H 2 O 2 oxidizes ferrous and ferric Hbs to Fe(IV) -ferrylHb and oxyferrylHb, respectively. FerrylHb further reacts with H 2 O 2 producing heme degradation products and free iron. OxyferrylHb, in addition to Fe(IV) contains a free radical that can undergo additional <b>oxidative</b> <b>reactions.</b> Fe(III) Hb produced during Hb autoxidation also readily releases heme, an additional source for oxidative stress. These oxidation products are a potential source for <b>oxidative</b> <b>reactions</b> in the plasma, but {{to a greater extent}} when the lower molecular weight Hb dimers enter cells and tissues. Heme and oxyferryl have been shown to have a proinflammatory effect further increasing their potential for oxidative stress. These <b>oxidative</b> <b>reactions</b> contribute to a number of pathological situations including atherosclerosis, kidney malfunction, sickle cell disease and malaria. The toxic effects of extracellular Hb are of particular concern for increased hemolysis due to hemolytic anemia. Hemolysis is further exacerbated in various diseases and their treatments. Blood transfusions are required whenever there is an appreciable decrease in RBCs due to hemolysis or blood loss. It is, therefore, essential that transfused blood, whether stored RBCs or blood obtained by an Autologous Blood Recovery System from the patient, does not further increase extracellular Hb...|$|R

This {{is the most important}} enzyme for the oxidative metabolism, but also other cytochrome P-450 enzymes may be involved. The <b>oxidative</b> <b>reaction</b> by Cytochrome-P450 enzymes will lead to the formation of an epoxide intermediate, which shows reactivity. This epoxide intermediate is highly unstable and could lead to the formation of cyanide via different transformations. For example via epoxide hydratase (EH) or via interactions with a sulfhydryl compound, which leads to the formation of a cyanohydrin that could rearrange to an aldehyde and thereby can possibly result in cyanide release.The epoxide can also be conjugated with GSH.|$|E

5000|$|The {{phytochrome}} chromophore {{is usually}} phytochromobilin, and {{is closely related}} to phycocyanobilin (the chromophore of the phycobiliproteins used by cyanobacteria and red algae to capture light for photosynthesis) and to the bile pigment bilirubin (whose structure is also affected by light exposure, a fact exploited in the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns).The term [...] "bili" [...] in all these names refers to bile. Bilins are derived from the closed tetrapyrrole ring of haem by an <b>oxidative</b> <b>reaction</b> catalysed by haem oxygenase to yield their characteristic open chain.

50|$|Under milder condition, <b>oxidative</b> <b>reaction</b> yields {{aldehydes}} instead. RuO4 readily converts secondary alcohols into ketones. Although {{similar results}} can be achieved with other cheaper oxidants such as PCC- or DMSO-based oxidants, RuO4 is ideal when a very vigorous oxidant is needed but mild conditions must be maintained. It is used in organic synthesis to oxidize internal alkynes to 1,2-diketones, and terminal alkynes along with primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. When used in this fashion, the ruthenium(VIII) oxide is used in catalytic amounts and regenerated {{by the addition of}} sodium periodate to ruthenium(III) chloride and a solvent mixture of acetonitrile, water and carbon tetrachloride. RuO4 readily cleaves double bonds to yield carbonyl products, {{in a manner similar to}} ozonolysis. Osmium(VIII) oxide, a more familiar oxidant that is structurally similar to RuO4, does not cleave double bonds, instead producing vicinal diol products.|$|E
50|$|Most common {{heterogeneous}} photocatalysts are {{transition metal}} oxides and semiconductors, which have unique characteristics. Unlike the metals {{which have a}} continuum of electronic states, semiconductors possess a void energy region where no energy levels are available to promote recombination of an electron and hole produced by photoactivation in the solid. The void region, which extends {{from the top of}} the filled valence band to the bottom of the vacant conduction band, is called the band gap. When a photon with energy equal to or greater than the materials band gap is absorbed by the semiconductor, an electron is excited from the valence band to the conduction band, generating a positive hole in the valence band. Such a photogenerated electron-hole pair is termed an exciton. The excited electron and hole can recombine and release the energy gained from the excitation of the electron as heat. Exciton recombination is undesirable and higher levels lead to an inefficient photocatalyst. For this reason efforts to develop functional photocatalysts often emphasize extending exciton lifetime, improving electron-hole separation using diverse approaches that often rely on structural features such as phase hetero-junctions (e.g. anatase-rutile interfaces), noble-metal nanoparticles, silicon nanowires and substitutional cation doping. The ultimate goal of photocatalyst design is to facilitate reactions between the excited electrons with oxidants to produce reduced products, and/or reactions between the generated holes with reductants to produce oxidized products. Due to the generation of positive holes and electrons, oxidation-reduction reactions take place at the surface of semiconductors. In the <b>oxidative</b> <b>reaction,</b> the positive holes react with the moisture present on the surface and produce a hydroxyl radical.|$|E
