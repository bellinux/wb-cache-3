40|$|AbstractThe <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the {{software}} {{represents one of}} the most important attributes of software quality, and the estimation <b>of</b> the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> {{the software}} is a problem hard to solve with accuracy. Nevertheless, in order to manage the quality of the software and of the standard practices in an organization, it is important to achieve an estimation <b>of</b> the <b>reliability</b> as accurate as possible. In the present work there are described the principles and techniques which underlie the estimation <b>of</b> the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the software, starting from the definition of the concepts which express the attributes of software quality. It is taken into account the issue of the estimation of a software part.

Like in any other system here too the overall <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the system is a function <b>of</b> <b>reliabilities</b> <b>of</b> all the components used in the system and their interfaces with each other. In this paper an attempt has been made to compute the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the system as a function <b>of</b> <b>reliabilities</b> <b>of</b> its components. Components along a path, called Course-of-execution, are executed during each simulation run. Starting from any component during any Course-of-execution, control is transferred to any other component as per the Markov process [7, 8, 9]. If we are able to reach the last component in the system, which is assumed to be a terminating component, that pass is assumed to be successful otherwise it is assumed to be unsuccessful. At the end we compute <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the system by dividing the number of successful passes by total no of simulation runs and get the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the component based system [...] Key words...|$|R

25|$|While {{considering}} the issue <b>of</b> <b>reliability</b> {{of the primary}} data provided by corrective labor institutions, {{it is necessary to}} take into account the following two circumstances. On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree <b>of</b> <b>reliability</b> of the reports.|$|E

The purpose of this study is to develop a method of estimation for the value <b>of</b> travel time <b>reliability.</b> METHODS: Highway type (urban/rural highway) and traffic flow type(interrupted/uninterrupted) was considered to estimate he value <b>of</b> travel time <b>reliability.</b> And Double-bounded Dichotomous Choice among Contingent Valuation Method(CVM) was applied to survey the willingness-to-pay of drivers when travel time reliability is improved. Finally the value <b>of</b> travel time <b>reliability</b> was estimated using the results of survey and logit model. The value <b>of</b> travel time <b>reliability</b> was estimated considering travel objectives, time constraint travel and non-time constraint travel. RESULTS: The value <b>of</b> travel time <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> business trip is higher than that of non-business trip. The value <b>of</b> travel time <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> time constraint travel is higher than that of non-time constraint travel. The value <b>of</b> travel time <b>reliability</b> in urban area is higher than that in rural area. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the proposed method in this study is more realistic and proper to estimate the value <b>of</b> travel time <b>reliability</b> because it reflects the situations of time constraint travel and non-time constraint travel...|$|R
