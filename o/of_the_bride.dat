5|$|The Roce (anointing) ceremony, {{conducted}} one or {{two days}} before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> and bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> and groom, who are anointed with roce, a mixture of coconut milk and coconut oil, while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead. The marriage traditions include Soirik (betrothal), exchange of Paan Pod (betel leaves) during the marriage ceremony, which known as Badalchen (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage). The bride is adorned with the Sado (wedding sari) and Pirduk (wedding necklace). Other rites include the Onpnni (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride),</b> Porthoponn (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of Honvious (hymns). Some non-marriage traditions include Novemjeevon (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and Novem (blessing of new harvests).|$|E

5|$|Decorating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bride</b> {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). The painting is undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of the painting {{is said to have been}} created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while to her left the bride's mother clasps her hands and cries with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl on the verge of tears standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bride</b> had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive {{rights to}} the {{painting}} were acquired by Zagreb merchant Petar Nikolić shortly after its creation, and lithographic prints were published soon thereafter. The painting was owned by the French Gallery until 1893, when it was purchased by a London buyer. In 1935, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased the work {{and gave it to}} the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains. It is classified under inventory number 31–115. The museum has been closed to the public since the early 2000s, pending renovation. This has not kept Jovanović's works, including Decorating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bride,</b> from being displayed at other venues, including the National Museum's foyer, which is sometimes open to the public.|$|E

5|$|In England {{he met the}} King {{on several}} {{occasions}} and dined {{with a number of}} influential British politicians, including William Pitt, Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke. Metternich was nominated the new Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands and left England in September 1794. Unfortunately, he found an exiled and powerless government in headlong retreat from the latest French advance. In October a revitalised French army swept into Germany and annexed all of the Metternich estates except Königswart. Disappointed, and affected by strong criticism of his father's policies, he joined his parents in Vienna in November. On 27 September 1795 he married Countess Eleonore von Kaunitz, a granddaughter of former Austrian chancellor Wenzel Kaunitz. The marriage was arranged by Metternich's mother and introduced him to Viennese society. This was undoubtedly part of the motivation for Metternich, who demonstrated less affection for her than she for him. Two conditions were imposed by the father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride,</b> Prince Kaunitz: first, the still youthful Eleonore was to continue to live at home; and second, Metternich was forbidden from serving as a diplomat as long as the Prince was still alive. Their daughter Maria was born in January 1797.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{fought against}} the {{orthodox}} traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated to enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed {{that it would be}} a sin to marry after puberty. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} Christianity {{in the north}} of Britain gained ground when Edwin of Northumbria married Æthelburg, a {{daughter}} of Æthelbert, and agreed to allow her to continue to worship as a Christian. He also agreed to allow Paulinus of York to accompany her as a bishop, and for Paulinus to preach to the court. By 627, Paulinus had converted Edwin, and on Easter, 627, Edwin was baptised. Many others were baptised after the king's conversion. The exact date when Paulinus went north is unclear; some historians argue for 625, the traditional date, whereas others believe that it was closer to 619. Higham argues that the marriage alliance was part of an attempt by Eadbald, brother <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride,</b> to capitalise on the death of Rædwald in about 624, in an attempt to regain the overkingship his father had once enjoyed. According to Higham, Rædwald's death also removed one of the political factors keeping Eadbald from converting, and Higham dates Eadbald's baptism to the time that his sister was sent to Northumbria. Although Bede's account gives all the initiative to Edwin, it is likely that Eadbald also was active in seeking such an alliance. Edwin's position in the north also was helped by Rædwald's death, and Edwin seems to have held some authority over other kingdoms until his death.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride,</b> she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

25|$|The notable {{example to}} this is the Hanafi school (the largest of the four {{classical}} schools of Islamic thought), which holds that a bride's permission is required if she has reached puberty.

A wali other than the father or the paternal grandfather <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride,</b> then called wali mukhtar, needs the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> according {{to the majority of}} scholars.
