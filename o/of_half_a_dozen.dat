5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out <b>of</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At {{the time in}} her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice {{at the age of}} 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E

Legge was one <b>of</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> amateur players, and equalled his then-highest score when he made 120 against Orange Free State. That and other decent scores in first-class matches led to his selection for the first Test, but he failed to score in his only innings, being one of eight England batsmen who contributed only 13 runs between them to a match-winning score of 313.

On two occasions, the crew recalled last night, he handed away a lifeline from the hovering machine that could have dragged him to safety. The helicopter crew who rescued five people, the only persons who survived from the jetliner, lifted a woman to the riverbank, then dragged three more persons across the ice to safety.

2500|$|In {{the later}} Medieval and early Renaissance periods, wealthy and {{powerful}} English noble houses sometimes maintained a troupe <b>of</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> [...] "players," [...] just as noblemen kept jesters or jugglers for entertainment. English theatre benefited greatly from the predilection for theatricality displayed by the Tudors. Henry VII kept {{a company of}} players called the [...] "Lusores Regis", which probably consisted of four men and a boy who were used to swift costume changes and multiple roles. In the early period the difference between players, acrobats and other entertainers was not hard and fast. A troupe of players, however, was more costly to keep than a jester; players (who usually had other household duties as well) could defray expenses by touring to various cities and performing for profit a practice that began the evolution away from the medieval model of noble patronage and toward the commercial and capitalistic model of modern entertainment. It is from the scattered records of such touring, and from occasional performances at the English Royal Court, that our very limited knowledge of English Renaissance theatre in the early and middle 16th century derives.|$|E
