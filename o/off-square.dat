25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the PWD are widely {{thought to be the}} Standard Poodle. Like Poodles and several other water dog breeds, PWDs are intelligent, can have curly coats, have webbed toes for swimming, and do not shed. However, Portuguese Water Dogs are more robustly built, with stout legs, and can have a wavy coat instead of tightly curled. If comparing the structure to that of a Poodle, there are {{significant differences between the two}} breeds. The Portuguese Water Dog is built of strong substantial bone; well developed, neither refined nor coarse, and a solidly built, muscular body. The Portuguese Water Dog is <b>off-square,</b> slightly longer than tall when measured from prosternum to rearmost point of the buttocks, and from withers to ground. Portuguese Water Dog eyes are black or various tones of brown, and their coats can be black, brown, black and white or brown and white.|$|E
50|$|A loaded, weighted, or crooked die is {{one that}} has been {{tampered}} with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for creating loaded dice, including rounded faces, <b>off-square</b> faces and weights. Transparent acetate dice are used by casinos as they are harder to tamper with than other dice.|$|E
50|$|Yarmouth Castle {{is a small}} <b>off-square</b> {{blockhouse}} {{built by}} Henry VIII in 1547, to guard Yarmouth, Isle of Wight harbour. It was built as part of Henry's second device programme to fortify the English coast with a chain of coastal defences known as Device Forts or Henrician Castles. These were built to guard against the threat of foreign invasion. As it is a later fortification {{it did not have}} the earlier rounded or concentric shape but a square keep with angular bastions. It is now owned by English Heritage.|$|E
5000|$|The Eckert House is a {{historic}} building located in Guttenberg, Iowa, United States. The two-story brick structure was built in 1860 by Henry Eckert. [...] It is a combination commercial and residential building that features an <b>off-square</b> layout, metal [...] "S" [...] beam hardware on the north wall {{that was used to}} accommodate its unique shape, and metal numbers on the exterior that date the structure, which is not the norm in Guttenberg. Ida Eckert operated a millinery shop in first floor commercial space. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.|$|E

50|$|The Kooikerhondje is a small, flashy, {{orange and}} white spaniel-like {{sporting}} dog. Originally bred in Holland as a duck decoy dog, its heavily white plumed tail waves jauntily to entice and lure ducks {{to follow it}} into Eendenkooi (duck cages). When not working the traps, Kooikers were expected {{to work on the}} farm to catch vermin.The preferred height at the withers is 15 to 17 inches for males and 14 to 16 inches for females. The proportion of the Kooiker is <b>off-square.</b> The bone and substance of the Kooiker is moderate. The head should be in proportion to the dog. The expression is gentle and alert. Ears should be red in color and well feathered and ideally adorned with earrings. The color for the Kooiker should be predominately orange-red and may be patched or solid on pure white although a few small spots on the legs are acceptable. A black tail ring where the color changes from orange-red to white is permitted.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report the}} {{development}} of a diagnostic expert system, DESPLATE, to assist less experienced operators to diagnose the <b>off-square,</b> camber, and taper shapes of plates. The system also incorporates graphics and animation routines written in Turbo-Pascal to provide a more user-friendly interface. DESPLATE has been found by experienced operators to be capable of providing systematic guidance in searching for faults. The authors first provide a brief overview of the production process in the plate mill and describe the problems that motivate {{the development of}} DESPLATE. The goal of DESPLATE is to locate possible causes for abnormal shapes, such as electrical failures, mechanical breakdowns, wear, operational errors, or prerolling conditions. They describe the knowledge base architecture and user interface and examine the control structure of the system. The authors address {{some of the issues that}} arose during the development of DESPLATE, including the use of graphics for the interface, forward and backward chaining techniques, and knowledge acquisition methodologies from multiple experts from different disciplinary backgrounds. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
