40|$|Background: Since {{outsourcing}} is {{used more}} and more {{it is interesting to}} investigate the interorganizational cooperation between the buyer and the supplier (Corbett, 2004). This new form of interfirm collaboration brings light to new consequences and problems that may occur in the relationship. These aspects have caused an increased focus on the contracts and the management of relationships in interfirm relations. Problem: How is the interfirm cooperation between a buyer and a service supplier handled on the strategic and operative level, when the service is performed at the buyer’s facilities? Purpose: We elaborate in the interfirm organizational area in order to get an enhanced understanding of how the strategic and <b>operational</b> <b>cooperations</b> and relationships between a buyer and a service supplier functions. Method: A case study is conducted and several interviews with people at different levels in the case company and its suppliers are performed. The interviews are semi-structured in order to enable the respondents to talk freely and for us to find out more in depth how the cooperation functions. The empirical findings are then analyzed through comparing them to the frame of references. Conclusion: The interfirm cooperations on the strategic- and operational levels are handled differently due to many different aspects. The cooperation on strategic level do not involve any day to day work which implies that it is easier for them to exert formal control. The contract is written on the strategic level and is rather used as a backbone for the operative cooperation than as a set of strictly regulating rules. This is due to that differences here are solved through communication and trust. The operational relationship is structured by a tradeoff between trust and control. The parties have to interact with each other, as both parties work at the buyer’s facilities, and hence the human aspects have to be taken into consideration when exerting control. Future areas of investigation: It would be interesting to investigate if there are any differences within the company, due to other cultures or macro factors, at stores in other countries compared to the stores in Sweden that we have visited. It would also be interesting to look at how people at other levels in both the Group and the supplier look at the cooperation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhile Hippocrates {{recognized}} that health {{is influenced by}} the external environment, it is only recently that the relationship between health and climate has become a focus of community and public health services. Advances in understanding of weather and climate sciences {{on the one hand and}} human health on the other are providing new opportunities for early detection, prediction and prevention of the adverse health effects of hazards as diverse as tropical cyclones, floods, heatwaves and cold spells, air quality, wildfires, droughts and disease epidemics. Early warning of disease outbreaks and a timely response makes prevention possible. For some climate-sensitive diseases, our understanding is sufficient to make health forecasting possible; for others, the relationship between the disease and any causal environmental effect remains unclear, and the focus of active research programs. Institutional changes are also taking place to improve <b>operational</b> and research <b>cooperation</b> between the health sector and the weather and climate communities, ranging from joint service delivery platforms to combined research and development programs...|$|R

40|$|In today’s complex {{security}} environment integrated operations involving military, {{civilian and}} non-governmental agencies {{are key to}} success. The challenge is to achieve unity of effort despite cultural differences and competing interests. To overcome these challenges new concepts, such as Civil-Military Cooperation and the Multinational Interagency Group, {{have been developed to}} establish connections between military and civilian organisations. While seeking to integrate efforts and build relationships, such concepts have placed emphasis on coordination, with less importance set on explicit mechanisms for achieving <b>cooperation.</b> <b>Operational</b> experience indicates that the level of cooperation achieved can be variable, particularly between the military and NGOs. The importance of achieving cohesion requires that a more considered approach be explored. Drawing on the idea of fairness as developed in John Rawls Theory of Justice, this paper introduces the concept of establishing fair principles of cooperation to govern the allocation of responsibilities and shape command arrangements. Augmenting the strategic planning process, the concept incorporates the application of structured bargaining between organisations as a means of establishing fair principles by agreement. By extending game theory approaches to fair social outcomes, consideration will be given to constructing bargaining situations supporting the emergence of fair and robust cooperative arrangements...|$|R

This stems from the need of collision avoidance, search-and-rescue operations and other maritime purposes. Ground-based AIS receiving station usually cannot cover ships over the horizon, but with space-based AIS signal receivers, the global ship monitoring became possible, providing data service for maritime administrations, cargo liners, and even navies. Since 2007, a number micro-satellites and nano-satellites have been launched for technical demonstration in this respect. However, at present the space-based global AIS data service is not fully <b>operational</b> and international <b>cooperation</b> is limited. In this paper, a constellation of 3 self-deorbiting nano-satellites, with a mass equivalent to 3 U cubesats, carrying AIS receivers is proposed to complement the existing systems. The feasible study presented here showed that this mission can be realized at very low cost, and quick-launched. Three other important features of the mission are: international cooperation, making a practical use of smaller nano-satellites and taking the responsibility for deorbiting the satellites {{at the end of}} mission. It is also the hope that this mission will become a milestone that marks the maturity of smaller nanosats, and give the "student satellite" projects around the world a new dimension for real application and sustainable business application...|$|R
