5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} passage of the Statute of Westminster, Canada and other Dominions became fully {{sovereign}} from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal <b>of</b> <b>Canada</b> of George VI, where the royal arms <b>of</b> <b>Canada</b> replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal <b>of</b> <b>Canada</b> for Elizabeth II, where the title has been redefined as Queen <b>of</b> <b>Canada.</b> These are the coat of arms of the Queen <b>of</b> <b>Canada.</b>|$|E
