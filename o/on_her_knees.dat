Then she finds herself in another dimension, as moving flowers surround her. As the video advances, Madonna walks on other different kinds of roads. She walks on a path of red flowers in the sky, and then walks <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> on a deep, blue colored sea, as she is followed by little white fairies. At the end of the video, when there is destruction in the real dimension, Madonna finds peace and is surrounded by the fairies. When they go away, Madonna disappears altogether.|$|E

25|$|The Earl of Pembroke, a {{moderate}} baron with strong French links, intervened {{in an attempt}} to defuse the crisis. Edward continued to refuse to negotiate or exile the Despensers, so Pembroke arranged for Queen Isabella to publicly go down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers. This provided him with a face-saving excuse to exile the Despensers and defuse the crisis, but it was clear Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln Cathedral {{reportedly}} received £100,000 {{in exchange}} for the right to film there, with filming there occurring between August 15 and 19, 2005, mainly within the cloisters of the cathedral. The cathedral's bell, which strikes the hour, was silent {{for the first time since}} World War II during that time. Although it remained a closed set, protesters led by a 61-year-old woman named Sister Mary Michael demonstrated against the filming. Sister Mary Michael spent 12 hours praying <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> outside the cathedral in protest against what she saw as the blasphemous use of a holy place to film a book containing heresy.|$|E

25|$|A {{monument}} {{dedicated to}} the troops of the 72nd Mizil Infantry Regiment, who fought during the Romanian Campaign of World War I (1916-1917), stands in the town. Built in 1921, the pedestal is 1.8 m high and the sculptures reach 2.7 m. They depict a woman in folk costume embodying the Fatherland, with her right hand raised in salute and her left holding the standard; a soldier and a woman sitting before her, the latter with an open book <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and representing History. There is a bronze plaque showing a battle scene, another featuring an inscription, and others naming the 1190 officers and enlisted men who died in battle.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Hugh de Despenser {{the younger}} became an {{increasing}} favourite of Isabella's husband, and was {{widely believed to}} have begun {{a sexual relationship with}} him around this time. Hugh was the same age as Edward. His father, Hugh the elder, had supported Edward and Gaveston a few years previously. The Despensers were bitter enemies of Lancaster, and with Edward's support began to increase their power base in the Welsh Marches, in the process making enemies of Roger Mortimer de Chirk and his nephew, Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, their rival Marcher lords. Whilst Isabella had been able to work with Gaveston, Edward's previous favourite, it became increasingly clear that Hugh the younger and Isabella could not work out a similar compromise. Unfortunately for Isabella, she was still estranged from Lancaster's rival faction, giving her little room to manoeuvre. In 1321, Lancaster's alliance moved against the Despensers, sending troops into London and demanding their exile. Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, a moderate baron with strong French links, asked Isabella to intervene in an attempt to prevent war; Isabella publicly went down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers, providing him with a face-saving excuse to do so, but Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity.|$|E

500|$|An {{official}} {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, {{and he and his}} wife and little daughter {{are on the verge of}} starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [...] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 2011, Beyoncé {{performed}} a free concert {{as part of}} Good Morning America Summer Concert Series. She sang [...] "1+1" [...] while kneeling {{on top of a}} white grand piano. Beyoncé also performed the song live on the TV show, The View. She sang [...] "1+1" [...] live on August 14, 2011 during 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, held in Roseland Ballroom, New York City. Wearing a gold dress, she performed the song in front of 3,500 people while her band and orchestra were watching on. During the performance, Beyoncé climbed on top of a piano and sang <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees.</b> Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine wrote that Beyoncé performed [...] "1+1", [...] "wrapped up in smoke and red hued lights, reminiscent of her live performance on the American Idol finale." [...] Ramirez stated that Beyoncé sang the ballad with [...] "impeccability." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator praised how Beyoncé [...] "wrung every ounce of emotion from the lyrics of '1+1' and hit each note perfectly", concluding that it was [...] "an impressive display." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Brad Wete wrote that Beyoncé's voice [...] "rang soulfully, only breaking to let the crowd fill in gaps for a sing-along feel." [...] Joycelyn Vena of MTV News commented that on [...] "1+1", Beyoncé's vocal abilities [...] "outshined it all." [...] On September 14, 2011, Beyoncé stopped at Target perform at the managers meeting. Wearing a red dress, she sang [...] "1+1" [...] accompanied by three backup singers and a pianist.

500|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} pair of jealous {{strippers}} applying lipstick and caddying back-and-forth between backstage, in a South of the Border strip zoo named [...] "La Jungla". Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that the new girl, Isabella, has been listening to the conversation and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through a dimly lit aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him. The video doesn't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video, including the iguana shot, the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella.|$|E
