Hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, even with limited or no symptoms, may {{increase the risk of}} pre-eclampsia, offspring with lower intelligence, and the risk of infant death around the time of birth. Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy has also been associated with gestational diabetes and birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> before 37 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated by Parker's {{perseverance}} {{despite everything}} that's been inflicted, Osborn publicly reveals that he's alive on Halloween. During the battle that ensues between them, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker (and immediately deteriorates on death as all clones do), Parker realises {{he is actually}} the original. During this same period, Osborn {{may or may not}} have been responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently prematurely induces Mary Jane's pregnancy and the stillbirth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b>|$|E
5|$|In linking these shots together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier multi-shot films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three shots are used {{to set up the}} plot, that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> being stolen by a beggar woman. Nearly all of the following shots show Rover tracking down the child. When the dog returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse as the dog travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when the dog brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by a shot of the reunited family.|$|E

Reluctant to hand the baby over, the two are forced to protect him from the triads who hired them in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Ste told Amy's father Mike to {{look after}} Lucas and Leah in the {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> plot because he didn't {{think he was a}} good father. Richardson reported that he enjoyed working with Jude and Jessica Croft-Lane, the young actors who played Lucas and Leah. He reported that Jude was camera shy and liked to play with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft-Lane that his name was actually Ste. Richardson concluded the storyline was different and he felt it gave him a chance to showcase his acting abilities.|$|E

50|$|James F Sorce et al. {{tested to}} see how {{maternal}} emotional signaling affected <b>the</b> behaviors <b>of</b> 1-year-olds on <b>the</b> visual cliff. To do this they placed the infants on <b>the</b> shallow side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual cliff apparatus and had their mothers on <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual cliff eliciting different emotional facial expressions. When the mothers posed joy or interest most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> crossed <b>the</b> deep side but if the mothers posed fear or anger, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> did not cross the apparatus. In <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> depth, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> crossed regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother’s facial expressions. This suggests that babies look to their mother’s emotional expressions for advice most often when they are uncertain about a situation.|$|R

While visiting Laura in her cell, Wayne attempts to steal her soul, but the EMT is able to save her life, much to Wayne's surprise. Meanwhile, Wayne has another wife, Betsy Monroe, who is also pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Tim Webber of VFX house Framestore CFC was {{responsible}} for the three-and-a-half minute single take of Kee giving birth, helping to choreograph and create the CG effects of the childbirth. Cuarón had originally intended to use an animatronic baby as Kee's child {{with the exception of the}} childbirth scene. In the end, two takes were shot, with the second take concealing Clare-Hope Ashitey's legs, replacing them with prosthetic legs. Cuarón was pleased with the results of the effect, and returned to previous shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in animatronic form, replacing them with Framestore's computer-generated baby.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{marriage}} and children, Walter Jones reportedly had a wandering eye. On April 18, he met Sharon Kinne when {{she bought a}} Ford Thunderbird from his dealership {{using some of the}} insurance payout from her husband's death, and the two began an affair shortly thereafter. Kinne viewed him as a prospect for a second husband, but Jones was uninterested in leaving his wife despite the rockiness of their relationship. When he declined to go on a trip to Washington with her in May, Kinne reluctantly went with her brother instead. Although the couple reunited on May 25, shortly after Kinne returned to Missouri, the relationship was quickly set on the rocks when Kinne told Jones that she was pregnant and he was the father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Jones, instead of responding with what Kinne expected to be an agreement to divorce his wife, ended the affair.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{reorganization}} of legal education in Ontario in the mid-1950s, Queen's Faculty of Law opened in 1957 in the newly built John A. Macdonald Hall. Other construction projects at Queen's in the 1950s included the construction of Richardson Hall to house Queen's administrative offices, and Dunning Hall. By {{the end of the}} 1960s, like many other universities in Canada, Queen's tripled its enrolment and greatly expanded its faculty, staff, and facilities, as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> boom and generous support from the public sector. By the mid-1970s, the number of full-time students had reached 10,000. Among the new facilities were three more residences and separate buildings for the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Biology and Psychology, Social Sciences and the Humanities.|$|E
5|$|Gonne's {{marriage}} to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began {{to visit him}} in London. After {{the birth of her}} son, Seán MacBride, in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> and MacBride having visiting rights.|$|E
5|$|She {{then begins}} {{an affair with}} rodeo cowboy Dusty Farlow and enters into {{psychiatric}} treatment. Eventually, she gains the strength to connect with her child. After Cliff sues for paternity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> tests reveal that J.R. {{is in fact the}} biological father. Sue Ellen, meanwhile, makes plans to leave J.R. for Dusty; however, Dusty is reportedly killed in a plane crash, and this news sends Sue Ellen back to the bottle. In 1981, Sue Ellen learns that Dusty is in fact alive but has been horribly crippled {{as a result of the}} plane crash. Nonetheless, Sue Ellen remains dedicated to her love for him and leaves J.R., taking their son with her to live at the Southern Cross Ranch, the home of Dusty's father, Clayton Farlow. Sue Ellen divorces J.R. and gains custody of John Ross, but her relationship with Dusty ends when he regains the use of his legs and decides to resume his life's passion as a rodeo cowboy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next day}} the defense calls the nurse, Jennice Morrow, who told Rubirosa about <b>the</b> killing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newborn <b>baby.</b> Morrow details how Benning asked the patient if he should {{complete}} the abortion even though <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> was born alive, and the patient responded, [...] "Yes, finish it." [...] Morrow says Benning inserted scissors into <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> skull to kill it.|$|R

5|$|The baby drifts downriver to {{a village}} of the Nelwyn (dwarves). She comes into the care of Willow Ufgood, a kind farmer and conjurer who hopes to become a real sorcerer; his wife Kiaya and his {{children}} {{fall in love with}} the baby immediately, and Willow too soon grows to love her as one of his own. During a town festival, the village is attacked by a Nockmaar hound which is quickly killed by the village warriors. The High Aldwin, the village sorcerer, learns about the baby and selects Willow, due to his devotion to the child, to accompany a party of volunteers returning the baby to the Daikini (human) people. At a crossroads, they find a human warrior named Madmartigan trapped in a crow's cage. The rest of the party want to give the baby to Madmartigan and go home immediately, but Willow and his friend Meegosh refuse, so the others leave. After spending the night at the crossroads and meeting an army led by Airk Thaughbaer, an old friend of Madmartigan's marching against Bavmorda, Willow reluctantly decides to free Madmartigan so that he can take care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> for them.|$|E
5|$|The {{protective}} effect {{does not begin}} immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for {{those who live in}} areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother. The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E
5|$|While {{pursuing}} the thief, Spyro discovers a world once inhabited by the dragons, but long abandoned and forgotten. This world {{is under the}} iron-fisted reign of the Sorceress and her Rhynoc army. Spyro meets with Shiela the Kangaroo, Sergeant Byrd the Penguin, Bentley the Yeti, and Agent 9 the Monkey who help him on his quest. Shiela tells Spyro how when the dragons left the realm, the world's magic began to dry up. Spyro travels through each world in the forgotten realm, acquiring aid from the local inhabitants and rescuing the dragon eggs. It is revealed that the Sorceress is seeking not the baby dragons themselves, but merely their wings to concoct a spell that can grant her immortality. Once Bianca learns about this, she turns against the Sorceress and decides to help Spyro defeat her. Spyro fights and defeats the Sorceress, but she survives the battle and waits for him. After he defeats her again and retrieves the last dragon egg, Spyro returns all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> dragons to the Dragon Realms.|$|E
