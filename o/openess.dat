5000|$|Gorbachev's {{election}} to the General Secretaryship was the quickest in Soviet history. The Politburo recommended Gorbachev to the Central Committee, and the Central Committee approved him. The Politburo meeting, which elected Gorbachev to the General Secretaryship, did not include such members as Dinmukhamed Konayev, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky and Vitaly Vorotnikov. Of these three, Konayev and Shcherbytsky were Brezhnevites, and Vorotnikov, while not supporting Gorbachev, {{took it for granted}} that Gorbachev would succeed Chernenko. It is conceivable, according to historian Archie Brown, that Konayev and Shcherbytsky would rather have voted in favour of Viktor Grishin as General Secretary, than Gorbachev. At the same meeting, Grishin was asked to chair the commission responsible for Chernenko's funeral; Grishin turned down the offer, claiming that Gorbachev was closer to Chernenko than he was. By doing this, he practically signaled his support for Gorbachev's ascension to the General Secretaryship. Andrei Gromyko, the longtime foreign minister, proposed Gorbachev as a candidate for the General Secretaryship. The Politburo and the Central Committee elected Gorbachev as General Secretary unanimously. Ryzhkov, in retrospect, claimed that the Soviet system had [...] "created, nursed and formed" [...] Gorbachev, but that [...] "long ago Gorbachev had internally rebelled against the native System." [...] In the same vein, Gorbachev's adviser Andrey Grachev, noted that he was a [...] "genetic error of the system."Gorbachev's policy of glasnost (literally <b>openess)</b> meant the gradual democratisation of the party.

40|$|This paper probes {{the limits}} of {{transparency}} in monetary policymaking along two dimensions: feasibility and desirability. It argues that, even central banks that are considered champions of <b>openess</b> are not very clear about their measures of the output gap and about their beliefs regarding the effects of policy on inflationary expectations. This is due mainly to limited knowledge about the economy. It implies that feasibility constraints on transparency are more serious than stylized models of the transmission mechanism would imply. In addition no central bank has made clear statements about its objective function, including in particular the relative weight on output versus inflation stabilization, the policy discount factor and the shape of losses from the inflation and the output gaps over the possible ranges of realizations of those variables. Through discussion {{of the reasons for}} this, the paper probes some of the feasibility constaints on transparency.

The general principle of the proper management reflects in all legal forms of disposition of agricultural properties owned by the State Treasury. Its violation doesn’t cause an invalidity of the sale contract. Appropriate principles, which shall be applied to the tender are as follows: principle of <b>openess,</b> principle of equal treatment and equal access to the tender, principle of fair competition, principle of uniformity and principle of equivalency. Unlike opinions in legal doctrine, the author states that the <b>openess</b> and uniformity are the separate principles. All principles indicate values on which the legal institution of the tender is founded. These principles are also the grounds to formulate the rules of interpretation, which are useful during the operation of decoding of the legal norms. Uniwersytet w Białymstok...|$|E

40|$|China has {{recently}} embraced globalization {{in the area}} of trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) by joining WTO. Globalization has had positive results on its economic growth through trade expansion and FDI that opened new channels for economic expansion. The Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in Doha, Qatar approved China's Protocol of Accession. China's accession to the WTO means a more open China. As a result, China has transformed itself from one with virtually no foreign-invested firms to the largest developing-country destination for FDI. Giving the above scenario, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the FDI inflows in China from the selected ASEAN countries using panel data analyses. The FDI model has been utilized in determining factors that influence FDI inflows into China from selected ASEAN countries. In panel estimation, two alternative models, one-way fixed effect model and random effect model were used to estimate factors affecting the FDI inflows into China. The results of the study are consistent with the predictions of the previous study particularly related to trade openness (<b>OPENESS)</b> and relative exchange rate (RELEXC).
