He theorises that life might have evolved differently in the nebula because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within the nebula. Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data seeks the opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn). Data decides to pursue the relationship and goes to D'Sora's cabin with a bunch of flowers, where he informs her that he created a romantic subroutine for the relationship.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to masks depicting humans and animals, other masks {{deal with the}} fantastic, abstract and supernatural. In the Nahua community of Zitlala, Guerrero, the mask for a ceremonial jester is red, with lizards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> sometimes the nose. Masks to indicate the indigenous in the Tastoanes dance often originally had scorpions painted on them, but evolved to include hooked noses and other grotesque features. Today the noses are made of wood and images of bikini-clad women are painted on. Skull masks have their origins in the pre Hispanic period. The depiction of death in pre Hispanic Mexico was not fearful but rather part of life. Skull masks represent death still, and can be basic white or with fanciful decorations. Some are serious and others are laughing. Some masked characters represent abstract concepts such as time and the Seven Deadly Sins.|$|E
25|$|The forbidding of shaving {{the corners}} of the head was {{interpreted}} by the Mishnah as prohibiting the hair at the temples being cut so that the hairline was a straight line from behind the ears to the forehead; thus it was deemed necessary to retain sidelocks, leading {{to the development of a}} distinctly Jewish form of sidelock, known as payot. As for the beard, more complicated views arose; {{the corners of}} the beard were explained to refer to five extremities in the Talmud. There are many opinions in mediaeval scholars as to what these five points are. For example, it may be a point on each cheek near the temples, a point at the end of the cheek bone towards the centre of the face, and the point of the chin. Or it may be 2 on the mustache, 2 somewhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> one on the point on the chin. As a result, Shulchan Aruch prohibits the shaving of the entire beard and mustache.|$|E

Two squadrons of the {{regiment}} served in Beurnonville's Advance Guard under Auguste Marie Henri Picot de Dampierre at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792. The 12th Chasseurs fought at the Battle of Aldenhoven on 1 March 1793 from which Henri Christian Michel de Stengel brought off the army pay chest with one squadron from the regiment.

500|$|Nixon {{spent most}} of 1946 campaigning in the district, and worked hard to extend his name {{recognition}} beyond his hometown of Whittier. [...] In 1952, as Nixon ran for vice president, the Madera News-Tribune set forth its view of why Nixon beat Voorhis, [...] "He rang doorbells, he talked on street corners and in auditoriums, he kissed babies, patted old ladies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> otherwise made himself known wherever and whenever two people would stop and listen to him. He made friends with the press and radio, he {{went out of his}} way to be congenial and likable." [...] Bullock indicated that regardless of the tactics used, Nixon would likely have beaten the incumbent given the national Republican tide that swept the party into power in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1931.|$|E

500|$|There {{were several}} reasons the tournament went so badly for El Salvador. First of all, El Salvador took 20 players to the World Cup, leaving behind Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel González. According to Luis Guevara Mora, goalkeeper {{of the team}} by that time, the Salvadoran Football Federation decided to take members of the Federation, {{as well as the}} friends and family of many members of the Federation, and spent so much money they couldn't afford to bring a full 22-man squad. Some fellow players tried to gather money to pay to bring their {{teammates}} but couldn't get enough. Further heightening controversy, the team took many detours and stops throughout Europe {{under the direction of the}} Federation, taking 3 days to arrive in Spain and were the last team to do so. Once arrived, there was more trouble. Adidas sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player, but mysteriously only three white and one blue arrived. The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association. They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, someone stole the balls that the team would train with. The day prior to the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them and trained with them while El Salvador had none and was unable to train. To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play. The only knowledge that they had about the team was a lone outdated video that they had bought. On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by Francisco Jovel's sudden deafness. Jovel had received a heavy blow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> almost could not hear. So when Guevara Mora cried off to stop a ball, the defender did not hear him. Mora attempted to pass to Jovel, but Jovel wasn't looking and the ball went past him and went straight in front of the net. The Hungarian player only had to tap it in. After the match, the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation. The coach was dismissed immediately and the following matches against Belgium and Argentina were managed by players Jovel, Huezo and Fagoaga. Although the tournament overall was a big disappointment, there were also several bright spots. Jorge [...] "Mágico" [...] González was considered by the national and international press as the best player. [...] "Mágico" [...] González stayed in Spain after the tournament and played for Cádiz CF and Real Valladolid. Ricardo Guevara Mora, the goalkeeper, was the youngest player to play at the 1982 FIFA World Cup at 20 years old.|$|E
