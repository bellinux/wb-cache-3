In a bar scene, Nielsen calls out, [...] "Hey, you <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows!", after which Marvin steps forward. When Nielsen asks Marvin to [...] "accompany" [...] him (police talk for taking someone down to the station), Marvin literally accompanies him, on the guitar, as Nielsen sings the product's jingle.|$|E
2500|$|Presently {{the moon}} rose, dead ahead of me; and painted boldly across its face was {{the figure of}} an Indian. He wore this war-bonnet of the Sioux, at his {{shoulder}} was a rifle pointed at someone in the river-bottom 30 feet [...] below; in another second he would drop one of my friends. I raised my old muzzle-loader and fired. The figure collapsed, tumbled down the bank and landed with a splash in the water. 'What is it?' called McCarthy, as he hurried back. 'It's <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water.' 'Hi!' he cried. 'Little Billy's killed an Indian all by himself!' So began my career as an Indian fighter.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an article}} from The New York Times, [...] "over the years, Frazier has lost a fortune through a {{combination}} of his own generosity and naïveté, his carousing, and failed business opportunities. The other headliners from his fighting days—Ali, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes—are millionaires." [...] Asked about his situation, Frazier became playfully defensive, but would not reveal his financial status. [...] "Are you asking me how much money I have?" [...] he said. [...] "I got plenty of money. I got a stack of $100 bills rolled up <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of the room." [...] Frazier blamed himself, partly, for not effectively promoting his own image. [...] In a 2006 HBO documentary on the fight in Manila, Frazier was interviewed living in a one-room apartment {{on the second floor of}} his gym.|$|E

2500|$|Zhirinovsky {{also has}} a history of igniting {{personal}} violence in political contexts. In his notorious debate with Boris Nemtsov in 1995 a [...] "juice fight" [...] broke out. In 2003, Zhirinovsky engaged in a fistfight after a television debate with Mikhail Delyagin. In 2005, Zhirinovsky ignited a brawl in the parliament by spitting at a Rodina party legislator, Andrei Saveliyev. In 2008, he showed himself shooting a rifle at the targets representing his political rivals. During the 2008 televised presidential debate, he threatened Nikolai Gotsa, the representative of Democratic Party of Russia candidate Andrei Bogdanov with violence, saying he's going to [...] "smash his head" [...] and ordering his bodyguard to [...] "shoot that bastard <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corridor". Gotsa sued Zhirinovsky in civil court for 1 million rubles (approximately US$38,000) in damages and eventually received a judgment of 30,000 rubles (approximately US$1,150). In April 2014, Zhirinovsky made strong verbal threats against a pregnant journalist during a press conference in the Duma, including ordering his aide to rape the journalist, who had asked Zhirinovsky about possible sanctions against Ukraine amidst the military tensions between the two countries. The ethics committee of the Duma will investigate the incident.|$|E

Often the French would free their concubines and mixed-race children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners.
