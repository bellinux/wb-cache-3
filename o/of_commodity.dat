5|$|Following World War I, Belgium possessed two {{colonies in}} Africa—the Belgian Congo, {{which it had}} {{controlled}} since its annexation of the Congo Free State in 1908, and Ruanda-Urundi, a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the League of Nations. The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, {{making it one of}} the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time. The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The Great Depression led to a collapse <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment. The only industry that expanded during the time period was centered around cotton production.|$|E
5|$|Around Playford, much {{activity}} was occurring. Legislation {{provided for the}} tools {{that he was to}} inherit later as Premier: aggressive economic initiatives, a malapportioned electoral system and a staid internal party organisation. The state had been persistently in deficit in recent times, and as an agriculture-dominant state, had been at the mercy <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> prices, so a strategy of industrialisation was initiated under the guidance of senior politicians, public servants and industrialists. The creation of the LCL was dependent on the implementation of various policies to ensure the strength of the party's country faction. There had been an electoral bias in favour of rural areas since the Constitution Act of 1857, but it was now to dramatically increase. In 1936, legislation was brought in that stipulated that electoral districts were to be malapportioned to a ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of country areas. In addition, the 46 multimember districts were replaced with 39 single-member districts—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Over the next three decades, Adelaide's population grew until it had triple the population of the country, but the distribution of seats in the legislature gave rural voters a disproportionate influence by a factor of six. The desired long-term effect was to lock the opposition Labor Party out of power; the unexpected short-term effect was a large number of dissatisfied rural independents in the 1938 election. Although he played no part in its development or implementation, the electoral system gerrymander was later christened the 'Playmander', {{as a result of its}} benefit to Playford, and his failure to take action towards reforming it.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is to reveal the {{hypothetical}} character <b>of</b> labour−values <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> based on the precise determination of the concept of labour−value. Labour−values <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> are not the actual labour embodied in the commodities but the necessary labour to reproduce them under socially averaged conditions of production. The substance and the following three features of labour−values give the concept hypothetical character which has often been overlooked conventionally. (1) Labour−value <b>of</b> each <b>commodity</b> takes the form of labour commanded by the proportional money to the social necessary labour <b>of</b> the <b>commodity</b> and the command of labour by money stays in potentiality before the money is actually expended. (2) The aggregated amount <b>of</b> labour−value <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> in an economy for a given period is more than that of labour necessary to reproduce the commodities under socially averaged conditions of production because the labour−values <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> often constitute the parts of labour−values <b>of</b> other <b>commodities</b> as means <b>of</b> production. (3) The aggregated amount <b>of</b> labour−value <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> in a department for a given period is not equal to that of labour necessary to reproduce the commodities under individual conditions of production because the compositions of homogeneous means of production are variable in each individual process of production and the variations necessarily cancel out neither in their own department nor in the economy as a whole. The hypothetical character of labour−value, however, does not mean the concept useless or unrealistic. Labour−values <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> can indicate the unequal exchanges of labour under their equilibrium prices in a pure market economy, which exit behind the market prices <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> as the centres of their fluctuations...|$|R

It generally consisted of material that was compact, easily transportable and had a widely recognized value.

Ideally, commodity money had to be widely accepted, easily portable and storable, and easily combined and divided in order to correspond to different values. The main items <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> money in Japan were arrowheads, rice grains and gold powder.|$|E
