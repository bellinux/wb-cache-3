They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

Many residents also evacuated to motels and homes in neighboring communities. Some residents of Grand Forks criticized the National Weather Service for its incorrect prediction of the river level, as it had prevented them from securing their possessions from their homes. One resident said: [...] "If they'd said earlier the river would hit , I would have moved my stuff out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> At 49, it was safe." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E

500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not know when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not know when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E

Much to Jephthah's dismay, his only daughter greeted him upon his triumphant return. Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah did as he had vowed, but [...] "shies away from explicitly depicting her sacrifice, which leads some ancient and modern interpreters (e.g., Radak) to suggest {{that she was not}} actually killed." ...|$|E

Explaining the somewhat odd situation, Watkins said that [...] "it seems like a humble place. I didn't want to put it out in plain view <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> I didn't feel like displaying it right when you walk in. It's a nice crown for the porcelain."

2500|$|Another {{possible}} {{instance of}} human sacrifice {{mentioned in the}} Bible is the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter in Judges 11. Jephthah vows to sacrifice to God whatsoever comes to greet {{him at the door}} when he returns home if he is victorious. The vow is stated in the Book of Judges, 11:31: [...] "Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer Him a burnt offering." [...] When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs out to greet him. She begs for, and is granted, [...] "two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends", after which [...] "he [...] did to her as he had vowed." [...] According to some commentators of rabbinic literature, Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the trial}} in November 1929, Shuler's lawyer cross-examined Cryer about {{allegations}} that he [...] "pitched dice at in Farmer Page's place," [...] and about his accumulation of wealth during his eight years as mayor. [...] Cryer testified {{that he had a}} personal fortune of $160,000 when he took office in 1921 and left office in 1929 with a personal wealth of $450,000 which Cryer credited to [...] "realty deals absolutely uninfluenced by his political position." [...] Asked if he had ever taken a bribe, Cryer replied: [...] "No, sir; never at any time, directly or indirectly. [...] I never profited by my office. [...] In fact, I considered it a financial detriment. [...] It was the darndest job I ever had. [...] It took practically all of my time, Sundays and every other day, and most of the night. [...] I had to take the telephone out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> so I could get a little sleep.

2500|$|In 2014, the Chick tract Unforgiven was {{distributed}} by Bible Baptist Church in Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract {{tells the story}} of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. [...] Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. “It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true,” he said. “It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, ‘If you weren’t my grandma, I’d kill you where you stand, Allahu Akbar.’” In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he’ll “die in [...] sins” and be unforgiven by God if he doesn’t. But the young man isn’t swayed by her pleas. “I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!,” he screams. “Get out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> you infidel!” Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.|$|E

2500|$|Human {{sacrifice}} {{can also}} have the intention of winning the gods' favour in warfare. In Homeric legend, Iphigeneia was to be sacrificed by her father Agamemnon to appease Artemis so she would allow the Greeks to wage the Trojan War. According to the Bible, Jephthah vowed to devote to God the first creature {{to come out of}} his house to meet him if he won the battle against the Ammonites. Judges 11:30-31; [...] "And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will Him a burnt offering." [...] His daughter was the first to come out and meet him. Judges 11:34; [...] "And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter." [...] Although there is some uncertainty as to whether this was human sacrifice or consecration, academia discusses this in the context of human sacrifice, drawing parallels to Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 author Naomi Wolf {{wrote an}} article for New York Magazine accusing Harold Bloom of a sexual [...] "encroachment" [...] {{more than two decades}} earlier, by {{touching}} her thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a [...] "victim", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote, [...] "I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge." [...] When asked about the allegations in 2015, Bloom stated, [...] "I refuse to even use the name of this person. I call her Dracula's daughter, because her father was a Dracula scholar. I have never in my life been indoors with Dracula's daughter. When she came to the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> unbidden, my youngest son turned her away. Once, I was walking up to campus, and she fell in with me and said, 'May I walk with you, Professor Bloom?' I said nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1976, Shakespeare left Sherbet citing 'personal reasons'. He later {{explained}} [...] "I couldn't even go out {{the front}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> because {{there were all these}} girls just hanging on the fence [...] There was always a deadline for Garth and me - another album, another tour. When it did finally end, I was relieved more than anything because I had had enough.

The last single he played on was [...] "Child's Play", which was a No.5 hit in February. Shakespeare was briefly replaced by journeyman guitarist Gunther Gorman (ex-Home) but within weeks a more permanent replacement, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel) joined. Meanwhile, Mitchell had stepped up to join Porter as Sherbet's new main songwriting team. The pair were responsible for penning [...] "Howzat" [...] (1976), the band's only international hit, which was inspired by the sport of cricket. The song's success led to an extensive international tour in 1976-77. [...] "Howzat" [...] went to numberone in Australia, and in New Zealand, it was a Top10 hit in several European countries – including numberfour on the UK Singles Chart, numbersix in The Netherlands, and numbereight in Norway. It reached the top10 in South Africa, South-East Asia, and Israel. The single had less chart success in the United States where it reached No.61 on the Billboard Hot100. The album of the same name also made No.1 in Australia, No.12 in New Zealand, but failed to chart in the US.|$|E
