5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> can accomplish in a day.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{satellite}} ground stations owned by individuals began appearing, and some found the live feed. Satellite dish owners began to document their sightings in technical journals, giving viewers knowledge <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> were {{not meant to}} see. Carson and his production staff grew concerned about this and pressured NBC into ceasing the satellite transmissions of the live taping in the early 1980s. The satellite link was replaced by microwave transmission until the show's editing facilities were moved to Burbank.|$|E
25|$|Reception to Wenjack {{was later}} {{overshadowed by the}} controversies around Boyden's {{genealogy}} and tribal affiliations. Debbie Reese, an Indigenous author and researcher of Native American portrayal in children’s literature, had an overall negative perception of Boyden’s novella. In a series of tweets {{a few months after}} the release of Wenjack, she criticizes Boyden’s act as just one of many that “ Native ancestry … the centerpiece of who they are”, and the belief that “they can speak/write <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> ought not.” Pieta Woolley, in an article titled “Cultural thieves” for the United Church Observer, mentioned Wenjack as an introduction to labelling Boyden as “the latest alleged offender” in the midst of social questions regarding cultural thievery.|$|E

Gameplanet's Aylon Herbet wrote that if both Leon and Chris would share starring roles in a Resident Evil game it would be [...] "awesome", believing both of them to be the main protagonists of the series. In 2010, GameDaily predicted that Leon, along with Claire Redfield, would be the protagonist of the next main Resident Evil title, citing the series' pattern of alternating protagonists and Leon's last such appearance in Resident Evil 4. In 2013, GamesRadar staff included Leon among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcom's history, stating that [...] "he’s been battling Chris Redfield for the top spot as resident Resident Evil lead, but to us there’s no contest between the cool, fashionable Leon and the bullish Chris." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer to the kinds <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> were coined to refer to, thus {{the kinds of things}} their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have never seen such a thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E

500|$|Themes in {{the series}} often revolve around {{forbidden}} love, such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart, Graystripe and Silverstream, Leafpool and Crowfeather, and Dovewing and Tigerheart. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats (such as Leafpool), who cannot have mates, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is forbidden by the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on [...] "faith and spirituality" [...] in StarClan. [...] All books {{in the series}} feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, {{but in terms of}} prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. [...] Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. [...] Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are [...] "equally valid." [...] This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> do not understand. Holmes said that [...] "ignorance is a very scary thing!" [...] Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{practically}} all Inuit have legal names based on southern naming traditions, {{at home and}} among themselves they still use native naming traditions.

2500|$|Because Aristotle {{believes}} people receive {{all kinds}} of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or [...] "imprints", people are continually weaving together new [...] "imprints" [...] <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> experience.

2500|$|Drexler and {{coworkers}} responded {{to these two}} issues in a 2001 publication. [...] Drexler and colleagues noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers {{able to make a}}bsolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>They</b> challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in Nanosystems. [...] Drexler maintained that both were straw man arguments, {{and in the case of}} enzymes, Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, [...] "...using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles..." [...] Drexler also addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be. [...] Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, Chemical & Engineering News carried a 4-part debate.|$|E
2500|$|Aristotle later {{created a}} {{systematic}} programme of philosophy which was teleological: Motion and change {{is described as}} the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what types <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> are. In his physics, the sun goes around the earth, and many things have {{it as part of}} their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a formal cause, a final cause, and a role in a cosmic order with an unmoved mover. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy), they did not argue for any other types of applied science. Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically [...] "when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty".|$|E

[...] Her guide, the Space Hopper, reassures the Cat with a modern view of quantum decoherence. Ursula K. Le Guin wrote a story entitled [...] "Schrödinger's Cat" [...] in 1974 (reprinted in The Compass Rose, published in 1982), which also deals with decoherence. Greg Egan's novel Quarantine, billed as [...] "a story of quantum catastrophe", features an alternative solution to the paradox: [...] in Egan's version of quantum mechanics, the wave function does not collapse naturally. [...] Only certain living things—human beings among them—collapse the wave function <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> observe. [...] Humans are therefore highly dangerous to other lifeforms which require the full diversity of uncollapsed wavefunctions to survive.|$|E
