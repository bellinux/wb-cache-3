5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based <b>on</b> <b>where</b> the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E

5|$|Mark Livolsi realized, as McKenna had on {{the other}} end, that the film worked best when it focused on the Andrea-Miranda storyline.

5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974.

The players bounce the ball back and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the trajectory of the ball dependent <b>on</b> <b>where</b> it strikes the paddle.

5|$|Researchers {{discovered}} that where the P. rebeli {{lay their eggs}} {{is based on the}} size of the G. cruciata leaves and not upon the location of the closest Myrmica ant colony. Evidence for P. rebeli oviposition depending upon the range of the food plant rather than the range of the ants is supported by the timing of its oviposition. P. rebeli lays their eggs during the warm summer season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground. Researchers also observed females did not base their oviposition <b>on</b> <b>where</b> they found Myrmica nests.|$|E

However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a kind}} of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending <b>on</b> <b>where</b> a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.|$|E

5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated <b>on</b> <b>where</b> they should be located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked like a big step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago.|$|E
