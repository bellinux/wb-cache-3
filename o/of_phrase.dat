5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns <b>of</b> <b>phrase,</b> such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E
5|$|Kearsley's {{version was}} a marked popular success. Over {{the next few}} years, the {{publishing}} house issued further editions in quick succession, adding still more non-Raspe material along the way; even the full-length Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, again not by Raspe and originally published in 1792 by a rival printer, was quickly subsumed {{into the body of}} stories. In the process of revision, Raspe's prose style was heavily modified; instead of his conversational language and sportsmanlike turns <b>of</b> <b>phrase,</b> Kearsley's writers opted for a blander and more formal tone imitating Augustan prose. Most ensuing English-language editions, including even the major editions produced by Thomas Seccombe in 1895 and F. J. Harvey Darton in 1930, reproduce one of the rewritten Kearsley versions rather than Raspe's original text.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{word and}} <b>phrase</b> theory <b>of</b> Turaev, we {{interpret}} links or virtual links as equivalences <b>of</b> <b>phrases</b> over an alphabet consisting four letters. V. Turaev constructed {{a version of}} the Jones polynomial for phrases. We study the well-definedness of the Jones polynomial for phrases in word theory. On the other hand, M. Khovanov introduced a collection of homology groups which is a strictly stronger link invariant than the Jones polynomial and O. Viro reconstructed these Khovanov homology groups. We construct phrase invariants as the homology groups of certain chain complexes for phrases where the coefficients of the Jones polynomial are the Euler characteristics of these complexes using the Viro’s method of Khovanov theory. The invariance of these homology groups is showed in only terminology of Turaev’s theory <b>of</b> <b>phrases.</b> Moreover, we apply the homology groups to getting invariants for an other type <b>of</b> <b>phrases</b> over an alphabet consisting any letters.

25|$|In some cases, {{particularly}} with noun and adjective phrases, {{it is not}} always clear which dependents are to be classed as complements, and which as adjuncts. Although in principle the head-directionality parameter concerns the order of heads and complements only, considerations of head-initiality and head-finality sometimes take account of the position of the head in the phrase as a whole, including adjuncts. The structure of the various types <b>of</b> <b>phrase</b> is analyzed below in relation to specific languages, with a focus on the ordering of head and complement. In some cases (such as English and Japanese) this ordering is found to be the same in practically all types <b>of</b> <b>phrase,</b> whereas in others (such as German and Gbe) the pattern is less consistent. Different theoretical explanations of these inconsistencies are discussed later in the article.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{usage of}} the term 'transformation' in {{linguistics}} refers to a rule that takes an input typically called the Deep Structure (in the Standard Theory) or D-structure (in the extended standard theory or government and binding theory) and changes it in some restricted way {{to result in a}} Surface Structure (or S-structure).

40|$|This note {{describes}} {{a new type}} of automaton that has been developed at CIS Munich for efficient recognition <b>of</b> <b>phrases</b> in large German corpora. The concept of a constraint-based automaton is tailored to sets <b>of</b> <b>phrases</b> where grammaticality depends on morphological agreement conditions. It incorporates features from three sides: traditional finite state techniques, methods from constraint programming, and, on the implementation side, technology from large-scale electronic dictionaries. We describe the main ideas behind the concept, and we give some experimental results that compare the performance of constraint based automata with Prolog. 1 Introduction In computational linguistics, efficient recognition <b>of</b> <b>phrases</b> is an important prerequisite for many ambitious goals, such as, e. g., automated extraction of terminology, part of speech disambiguation, and automated translation. If one wants to recognize a certain well-defined set <b>of</b> <b>phrases,</b> the question <b>of</b> which type of computational d [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Tan {{posits that}} most sexual {{language}} in the Philippines is patriarchal: it focuses on the actions and expectations of the male, rather than female, participants. As an example, gamit tends {{to be used as}} Ginamit ako ng mister ko ("My husband 'used' me"), but such turn <b>of</b> <b>phrase</b> would never be used by a straight man. Tan uses other metaphors, such as the relationship between the euphemisms pagdidilig ("to water plants") and magpadilig ("to be watered"), and a woman waiting patiently for sex is described as uhaw (thirsty), to forward this theory: in his view, the Tagalog language subconsciously puts the woman in the passive role.|$|E

25|$|Dependency is a {{one-to-one}} correspondence: {{for every}} element (e.g. word or morph) in the sentence, there is exactly one node {{in the structure}} of that sentence that corresponds to that element. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. This situation should be compared with the constituency relation <b>of</b> <b>phrase</b> structure grammars. Constituency is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence, which means that, for every element in a sentence, there are one or more nodes in the structure that correspond to that element. The result of this difference is that dependency structures are minimal compared to their constituency structure counterparts, since they tend to contain many fewer nodes.|$|E
25|$|The Victor Codex, Codex Bonifatianus I, {{also known}} as the Codex Fuldensis, was {{produced}} {{in the middle of the}} sixth century for Victor of Capua, and is hailed as one of the famous manuscripts in the world for its content, script, and history. It contains a Gospel harmony and is an important witness for a number of textual cruxes in the New Testament. Victor himself corrected and edited the manuscript, and signed off on it on 12 April 547. It was long thought that a particular turn <b>of</b> <b>phrase</b> found also in Boniface's correspondence was evidence of his having used the manuscript, but Malcolm Parkes proved that the phrase was added to the Codex by an eighth-century scribe in Fulda after Boniface's death.

Warren finally had enough and resigned – coincidentally right before the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November 1888. Every superintendent on the force visited him at home to express their regret. Warren's resignation hindered the investigation. He had given an order that if another murder occurred, nobody was to enter the scene – a strange turn <b>of</b> <b>phrase</b> as the four previous victims had all been found in the open street – until he arrived to direct the investigation. Consequently, when the murder of Kelly was discovered by a rent collector who looked in through the window of her room in a Spitalfields lodging house, the police did not enter the room for some three hours because, unaware of his resignation, they were waiting for Warren to arrive. He returned to military duties.|$|E
