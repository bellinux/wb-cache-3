5|$|After the war, Kurosawa, {{influenced}} by the democratic ideals of the Occupation, sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards {{the individual and the}} self. The first such film, No Regrets for <b>Our</b> <b>Youth</b> (1946), inspired by both the 1933 Takigawa incident and the Hotsumi Ozaki wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie (Setsuko Hara), who born into upper-middle-class privilege, comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme (and because the protagonist was a woman), the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title into a postwar catchphrase.|$|E

5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We had a nice childhood and <b>our</b> <b>youth</b> was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E

However today, <b>our</b> <b>youths</b> with the influence of foreign permissive culture have found themselves experiencing sex at a younger age than their parents did. Bearing in mind the different constraints faced by our society with which sexuality is treated, one finds that youths fall prey to the consequences of poor sexuality and sex education due to societal reactions to issues that bother on sexuality. This paper discusses the importance of sexuality education in the Nigerian school system as a source of preventing the social problems of teenage pregnancy, which reduces the number of female students in school, a sure indication of undermining valuable human resource and therefore development. Social problems of death through abortion, destitution and spread of sexually transmitted diseases were shown to thrive in the absence of Sexuality Education. The paper suggests suitable methods of teaching sexuality related subjects at various levels...|$|R

Eventually, Marie came to believe that she and Ferdinand were [...] "the best associates, the most loyal companions, but our lives intertwine only in certain matters".

Bo’s {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs…To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times [...] "We know these songs from <b>our</b> <b>youth.</b> We grew up with revolutionary spirit {{and we want to}} pass that on to our children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country’s strong economy.|$|E

His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in <b>our</b> <b>youth</b> and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E

In the consideration of this romance, the judicious critic cannot but feel that one rule of good writing has been studiously observed. His work will not incur the censure passed by the late Mr. Collins upon his Persian Eclogues, namely, that, from erroneous manners, they were 'Irish.'" [...] The review continued, [...] "He tells us it is metrical... He will excuse our ears, but we cannot agree with him. Among the sins of <b>our</b> <b>youth,</b> we, like him, have traded in desultory versification, but have long been brought back to lyrical rhyme, and heroic blank verse. The reasons are obvious...

500|$|Many {{supporters}} of Native American mascots {{feel that the}} financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate {{millions of dollars in}} sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless. The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: [...] "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk {{in one hand and a}} beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us.

We, the Christian minority community, need protection from kinds of anti-social, anti-religious activities".

The emerging new media that are shaping the communication in society today are the social media. The exponential growth of social media is making them part of our youths’ daily communication. This paper explores the possible impact of the social media on the lives of Malaysian youths. Do the social media complement the usage of the mass media in Malaysia?
