50|$|Many factors {{led to the}} end of the Tehuelche. On one hand, {{there was}} inflation; the cost of beef, for example, rose 250% in 1959. On the other hand, there was the {{instability}} of the government. The continuous change of government during those years did not ensure any kind of permanence. Tired of coping with these circumstances, Rafaldi and Fattorini decided to abandon the partnership. They established their own workshop dedicated to prepare the same engines for racing motorcycles, and to cater to their clientele generally. In that workshop, they manufactured the “tapa 100”, a cylinder head which was bigger in size than what had been available and with better cooling capacity. They also incorporated into the motorcycle an <b>oil</b> <b>pump,</b> <b>chain</b> distribution for the camshaft and other details that improved the performance of the Tehuelche.|$|E
50|$|KMC Chain Industrial Co., Ltd. is {{a roller}} chain {{manufacturer}} headquartered in Taiwan, R.O.C. with corporate entities in the US, Continental Chain Company, and Europe, KMC Chain Europe BV. They make cam driving chains, balance driving <b>chains,</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>chains,</b> motorcycle chains, and industrial chains. They manufacture and market bicycle chains and master links under their own KMC brand and supply them to others, including Shimano. KMC chains {{are used in the}} Tour de France by riders such as Gustav Larsson, Swedish time trial champion. KMC was founded by Charles Wu in 1977, and was the largest bicycle chain manufacturer in the world in 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{intake and exhaust}} ports and intake and exhaust manifolds are shape optimized for better volumetric efficiency. Mitsubishi lowered the friction of the engine by including elastic grinding of the valve stems, adopting a high-efficiency shroud equipped plastic impeller in the water pump and using 0W-20 low-viscosity oil. Mitsubishi increased the combustion efficiency by optimizing {{the design of the}} {{cylinder head}} intake and exhaust ports, by incorporating the MIVEC system on both intake and exhaust valves and by using injectors that give an ultra micro droplet fuel spray. To lower the engine's weight, Mitsubishi used die-cast aluminium for the cylinder block, plastic for the cylinder head cover and intake manifold, and stainless steel for the exhaust manifold. The engine features a compact balancer shaft module with an integrated <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b> A silent <b>chain</b> is used to drive the camshafts. The compact balancer module, the silent chain, the stable combustion yielded by the intake and exhaust MIVEC system, and high rigidity designs for the cylinder head and cylinder block realize low vibration and noise.|$|R
50|$|Electric <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> are not used, {{again for}} reliability. Some 'turbo timer' {{electric}} auxiliary <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> are sometimes fitted to turbocharged engines. These are a second <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> {{that continues to}} run after the engine has stopped, providing cooling oil to the hot bearings of a turbocharger for some minutes, whilst it cools down. These are supplementary pumps and do not replace the main, mechanical, <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{a common}} oiling problem with the pre-1992 R32 RB26 motors, as the surface where the {{crankshaft}} meets the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> was machined too small, eventually leading to <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> failure at high rpm. This issue was resolved in later versions of the RB26 with a wider <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> drive. Aftermarket performance parts makers also make <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> extension drive collars to rectify this problem. More recently a spline drive solution has been developed by an aftermarket tuner Supertec Racing who {{moves away from the}} OEM flat drive system and uses splines to drive the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> gears {{in the same way as}} Toyota's 1JZ GTE engine as found in the Supra MKIII. This kit is available for most uprated RB26 <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> including Nissans own OEM, N1 and Nismo.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{hydraulic}} efficiency, modern automatic transmissions tend to apply electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> in their hydraulic system. The electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> can support the mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> for cooling, lubrication, and maintaining the line pressure at low engine speeds. In addition, the start–stop function can be realized {{by means of the}} electric oil pump; thus, the fuel consumption can be further reduced. This article proposes a method of applying two-pump system (one electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and one mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump)</b> in automatic transmissions based on the forward driving simulation. A mathematical model for calculating the transmission power loss is developed. The power loss transfers to heat which requires oil flow for cooling and lubrication. A leakage model is developed to calculate the leakage of the hydraulic system. In order to satisfy the flow requirement, a flow-based control strategy for the electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> is developed. Simulation results of different driving cycles show that there is a best combination of the size of electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and the size of mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> with respect to the optimal energy conservation. Besides, the two-pump system can also satisfy the requirement of the start–stop function. This research is extremely valuable for the forward design of a two-pump system in automatic transmissions with respect to energy conservation and start–stop function...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the adequate lubrication of the moving parts, the oil flow in a hermetic reciprocating compressor has a significant influence on the thermal characteristics of a compressor. The present work {{is concerned with the}} investigation of the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> system of a reciprocating hermetic compressor used in household refrigeration appliances. The considered <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> system consists of a centrifugal pump immersed in the oil sump of the hermetic compressor and a helical groove machined on the crankshaft. The focus of this work lies on the immersed part of the centrifugal <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and its interaction with the oil in the oil sump. To analyse the flow in the immersed area of the <b>oil</b> <b>pump,</b> the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS Fluent is used. The free surface of the oil flow is modelled with the volume of fluid (VOF) method. A numerical investigation is used to study the influence of the immersion depth and the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> design on <b>oil</b> mass flow rate and flow field at the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> intake. To evaluate the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> regarding the applicability in variable speed compressors, the influence of the rotational speed on the oil mass flow is also explored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The fluid {{noise of}} rotor <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> is studied in this paper, and the {{turbulent}} and flow sound field model of rotor <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> are built. Based on CFD software, three dimensional unsteady internal flow field numerical simulation of some type rotor <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> is carried out. And, the velocity and pressure simulation results at different speeds are obtained. Based on acoustic finite element and infinite element method, CFD software and acoustic solver software {{are used to}} simulate the flow induced noise of rotor <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b> And, the sound pressure level values of monitor points in the pump are obtained. This paper puts forward some methods to reduce noise which has been verified by the experiment result effectively...|$|R
40|$|In the oil {{production}} process, some <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> {{exist in the}} light load running and empty pumping problems, which result in the waste of electric energy. In order to realize the <b>oil</b> <b>pumping</b> energy saving optimal control by adopting <b>oil</b> <b>pumping</b> start-stop intermittent control scheme, an intelligent energy saving optimal control system based on genetic algorithm and wavelet neural network is proposed in this paper. The Morlet wavelet is adopted as the activation function of neural network and builds the wavelet neural networkandthe structure and parameters of the wavelet neural network which are chromosome encoded, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the connection weights and the scale parameters {{in order to improve}} the generalization ability and the approximation ability of neural networks. The parameters of effective <b>oil</b> <b>pumping</b> energy saving optimal control are measured using multisensors. The system is used in the {{oil production}} plant; the test data show that the <b>oil</b> <b>pumping</b> energy conservation effect is obvious...|$|R
