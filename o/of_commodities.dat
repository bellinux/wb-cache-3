5|$|Consequently, {{the rise}} of slavery {{was due to the}} {{increasing}} rise of crops being produced and traded, more specifically {{the rise of}} the plantation economy The rise of the plantations was the main reason for the trade <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} differences between proto-globalization and archaic globalization was the switch from inter-nation trading of rarities to the trading <b>of</b> <b>commodities.</b> During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain, silk and spices. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and other crops.|$|E

5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court.

Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and {{their relationship with the}} court.

5|$|By mid-1974, Australia {{was in an}} {{economic}} slump, suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed {{the other half of the}} duumvirate.|$|E
5|$|During Madagascar's First Republic, France heavily {{influenced}} Madagascar's economic planning and policy {{and served as}} its key trading partner. Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was {{a key factor in}} launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import–export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.|$|E
40|$|I {{identify}} a “slope” {{factor in the}} cross section <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> futures returns: high-basis commodity futures have higher loadings on this factor than low-basis commodity futures.

Jack leaves town but gets lost in the woods, encountering pagan worshippers and witch hunters. He successfully escapes them by finding safe passage through a mine connecting to Leibniz's. Eliza and Jack move on to Amsterdam, where Eliza quickly becomes embroiled in the trade <b>of</b> <b>commodities.</b> Jack goes to Paris to sell the ostrich feathers and Turk, leaving Eliza behind. When he arrives in Paris, he meets and befriends St. George, a professional rat-killer and tamer, who helps him find lodging. While there, he becomes a messenger for bankers between Paris and Marseilles. However, during an attempt to sell Turk Jack is captured by nobles. Luckily, the presence of Jack's former employer, John Churchill, ensures {{that he is not}} immediately killed. With Churchill's help, Jack escapes from the barn where he has been held prisoner. During the escape, he rides Turk into a masquerade at the Hotel d'Arcachon in a costume similar to that of King Louis. With the aid of St. George's rats he escapes without injury but destroys the ballroom and removes the hand of Etienne d'Arcachon.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the incidence <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> taxes, finding that, when demand and marginal cost schedules are linear. the burden <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> taxation is distributed between {{buyers and sellers}} so that each suffers the same percentage reduction on pre-tax surplus. This equiproportionate reduction in surplus is the outcome <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> taxes set at any rate, and is unaffected by relative demand and supply elasticities. Hence, when demand and marginal cost schedules are linear, commodity taxes resemble flat-rate taxes imposed on market surplus. Similar results apply to nonlinear schedules with certain ranges. ...|$|R
