50|$|Hosmer’s rise to its brief fame in the British Columbia Crowsnest Pass {{began in}} 1906 when the Canadian Pacific Railway {{established}} the settlement. The town was a vital link {{in a long}} line of coal mining communities that sprang up with great optimism from the Alberta side of the Pass, and westward into British Columbia’s Elk Valley. A year later, the CPR established the Pacific Coal Company to take charge of the mining operation in Hosmer through a company called Hosmer Mines Ltd.By 1908, a comprehensive coal mining site at Hosmer, intended to supply coke to the CPR’s smelter at Trail, B.C., was under construction, including a tipple, boiler house, coke <b>ovens,</b> <b>machine</b> shops, powerhouse and a magnificent array of 240 three and a half meter in diameter, two meter-high beehive ovens..|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This {{paper will}} provide an {{overview}} of a application using a wireless data network to monitor and control the mobile <b>machines</b> for coke <b>ovens</b> in a steel mill. This system uses Siemens PLC on the mobile coke <b>oven</b> <b>machines</b> to send real-time data via wireless modems to fixed bases PLC. The data from the fixed base PLC is send to a computer system. This paper will Provided the reader with reasons why the customer applied wireless communications in this harsh industrial environment. The coke oven plant on a steel works has not, in the past, been regarded as a prime user of modern instrument technology. The reason for this perception {{may be due to the}} fact that the basic design of the coke battery has been changed little over the years. The recording and analysis of oven pushing force on a routine basis is seen as a means of monitoring plant operation. A torque sensor is set up at the shaft of the rotor for measuring pushing force. One of the most important features of this work is that it allows problems in the ovens to be identified at an early stage and for corrective action to be taken before it may develop into a refusal to push. The mechanical loads imposed on the battery structure can be maintained are necessary minimum controlled by the coal blending design, so helping to prolong its service life...|$|R

40|$|Trends in {{technologies}} have mostly {{focused on the}} work environment, entertainment and communication technologies. Some developments have been made for the home such as microwave <b>ovens,</b> washing <b>machines,</b> HDTV, etc but most tasks are still manually executed. Washing machines are used in laundry but there hasn’t been a significant saving in time compared to manual laundering. The effects of misuse of the machine can be very destructive to clothes. This calls for proper sorting of clothes and adjustment of washing settings as appropriate. However, sorting has become a time consuming activity that {{requires a lot of}} attention {{on the part of the}} individual. Due to fatigue, individuals may in turn not pay much attention to washing instructions.

This article summarizes the individual steps of this technical, economic, and environmental analysis to facilitate the understanding of the policy intentions: The study followed a standardized methodology and identified, through this approach, a significant energy savings potential of 7. 6 petajoules per year and suitable policy options. The article discusses these options, addressing in particular the challenges faced by industrial equipment. Some shortcomings of the methodology to be used have to be stated. These are time and resource constraints to develop policy measures with adequate resources, uncertain market evidence, and the challenge to forecast the effect of engineering options not yet implemented in a product.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the recent results achieved by AIM consortium [AIM, 2008] {{in developing and}} demonstrating a new {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) architecture for modelling, virtualising and managing the energy consumption of home appliances. The architecture aims at fostering a harmonised technological frame for profiling and optimizing the energy consumption patterns of home appliances. The intention is to offer users a number of standalone- and operator-based residential services {{that will allow them to}} manage efficiently the energy consumed in households. To make these services possible the frame adopts a generalised method for household appliances management, which is based on an accurate modelling of operational modes of appliances and the ability of the home network to switch on or off some of their internal functions without limiting their control just to the active or stand-by states. As a pilot application, the appliances being considered for the first implementation of the architecture are: white goods, e. g. refrigerators, <b>ovens,</b> washing <b>machines,</b> dryers; audiovisual equipment, e. g.

40|$|The {{daily life}} of a common man {{revolves}} around various forms of appliances/gadgets he uses throughout the day such as a mobile phone, laptop, printer, microwave <b>oven,</b> washing <b>machine,</b> etc. Although these appliances/gadgets are taken {{by most of the}} people for granted, the problem occurs when any of these things do not work as they are expected to. Getting them to the repair shops for every small glitch is expensive as well as time consuming. Although most of the companies which produce these appliances/gadgets do supply them with basic manuals, which deal with how to solve these minor issues, but reading them {{and at the same time}} repairing the corresponding appliance/gadget can be a frustrating task at times. These problems can be reduced to a large extent if some kind of live guidance is available. In this paper we propose a method to do so with the help of an augmented reality based system that will guide the user to carry out small scale repair jobs on these gadgets. All that is required is a decent webcam and a computing device, with a processor of 1 GHz or more and a display screen...|$|R
40|$|The Equivalent System Mass (ESM) metric {{developed}} by NASA describes and compares individual system {{impact on a}} closed system {{in terms of a}} single parameter, mass. The food system of a Mars mission may encompass a large percentage of total mission ESM, and decreasing this ESM would be beneficial. Yeast breads were made using three methods (hand 2 ̆ 6 <b>oven,</b> bread <b>machine,</b> mixer with dough hook attachment 2 ̆ 6 oven). Flat breads were made using four methods (hand 2 ̆ 6 oven, hand 2 ̆ 6 griddle, mixer with dough hook attachment 2 ̆ 6 oven, mixer with dough hook attachment 2 ̆ 6 griddle). Two formulations were used for each bread system (scratch ingredients, commercial mix). ESM was calculated for each of these scenarios. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the ESM of yeast and flat bread production for a Martian surface outpost. Method (equipment) for both types of bread production was demonstrated to be the most significant influence of ESM when one equipment use was assumed. When multi-functional equipment was assumed, type of bread and formulation began influencing ESM calculations to a great extent. This data indicates the need to develop food formulations and menu options simultaneously with multi-functional equipment for minimizing the food system ESM of a Mars mission.
