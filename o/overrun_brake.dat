50|$|An <b>overrun</b> <b>brake</b> (called a surge brake when invented) is a {{brake system}} {{commonly}} used on small trailers, where {{the motion of}} the trailer with respect to the towing vehicle is used to actuate the brake.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{trailers}} {{are usually}} fitted with brakes. These {{can be either}} electrically operated, air operated, or <b>overrun</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
25|$|HGV test— Goods {{vehicles}} over 3,500kg GVW and trailers over 1,020kg {{unladen weight}} or 3,500kg GVW if fitted with <b>overrun</b> <b>brakes</b> (test conducted by DVSA/DVA staff their own stations, or at a DVSA authorised testing facility (ATF) or designated premises (DP)).|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a {{transversely}} mounted, water-cooled two-cylinder, two-stroke 764 cc, 25 hp (19 kW) thermosiphon engine {{based on a}} DKW design, giving {{a top speed of}} 105 km/h. The transmission had three gears, the first unsynchronised. In order to overcome the problems of oil starvation during <b>overrun</b> (engine <b>braking)</b> for the two-stroke engine, a freewheel device was fitted. The suspension was by torsion bars.|$|R
50|$|The Saab 93, {{pronounced}} ninety three, is {{the second}} production automobile that was manufactured by Saab that was first presented on December 1, 1955. It was styled by Sixten Sason and had a longitudinally-mounted three-cylinder 748 cc Saab two-stroke engine giving 33 hp (25 kW). The gearbox had three gears, the first unsynchronised. In order to overcome the problems of oil starvation on <b>overrun</b> (engine <b>braking)</b> for the two-stroke engine, a freewheel device was fitted. In 1957, two-point seatbelts were introduced as an option. The 93 was the first Saab to be exported from Sweden, with most exports going to the United States. A Saxomat clutch and a cabrio coach (large cloth sunroof) were available as options.|$|R

50|$|Flux braking {{is another}} method, based on motor losses, for {{handling}} an <b>overrunning</b> load. When <b>braking</b> {{in the drive}} system is needed, the motor flux and thus also the magnetizing current component used in the motor are increased. The control of flux can be easily achieved through the direct torque control principle. With DTC the inverter is directly controlled to achieve the desired torque and flux for the motor. During flux braking the motor is under DTC control which guarantees that braking can be made according to the specified speed ramp. This is very different to the DC injection braking typically used in drives. In the DC injection method DC current is injected to the motor so that control of the motor flux is lost during braking. The flux braking method based on DTC enables the motor to shift quickly from braking to motoring power when requested.|$|R
2500|$|The {{commission}} {{found that}} the approach and landing were normal with natural variations but that the spoilers were not deployed when the pilot pulled the lever. No conclusion to the cause was found, although the commission believed it must either have been a mechanical fault in the spoiler lever mechanism or a fault {{in two of the}} four thrust lever micro switches. The pilots received warning of the failure of deployment and also noticed the lack of sufficient retardation, but failed to connect the two issues, instead focusing on the wheel brakes. This caused the removal of the anti-skid system, which caused hydroplaning and subsequently reduced braking effect. The lack of runway grooving was decisive for the hydroplaning to take place. The aircraft was estimated to travel at [...] {{at the time of the}} <b>overrun.</b> Had optimum <b>braking</b> taken place the aircraft would probably have come to a stop on the runway. The massive damage was not caused by the overrun as such, but rather the steep slopes on the side of the runway.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the work is to {{research}} the dynamics of DC motor of series excitation with pulse speed control and determine the possibility of the drive circuit simplification. Research methods: With the help of simulation and analytical methods of calculation techniques developed a simulation model, identified the advantages of using a modernized impulse control scheme. The obtained results: The modernized scheme of series excitation DC current motor pulse control is designed. For the proposed and existing pulse regulation schemes the models are developed; they help to investigate the electromechanical processes of electric drive in these schemes and to perform the comparative analysis. The results of the modernized DC motor speed impulse control scheme investigation in the acceleration mode, <b>overrun</b> and electro-dynamic <b>braking</b> are given. Scientific novelty: Developed advanced pulse regulating sequential excitation DC motor scheme. For existing and proposed schemes impulse regulation developed models that allow study of electromechanical processes in electric drive for existing and proposed impulse control schemes. The practical significance: It is shown that the addition of a shunt field winding diode to pulsed regulator scheme reducing the rate of current decay in the winding. It is determined that the proposed upgrade allows to use electro-dynamic braking mode at the motor self-excitation. The proposed scheme design avoids the use of additional independent power sources and simplify the technical implementation and reduce costs...|$|R
50|$|The driver {{can also}} select several driving modes: SPORT, COMFORT and ECO PRO. Using the gear selector, the driver can either select {{position}} D for automated gear selection or can switch to SPORT mode. SPORT mode offers manual gear selection {{and at the}} same time switches to very sporty drive and suspension settings. In SPORT mode, the engine and electric motor deliver extra performance, accelerator response is faster and the power boost from the electric motor is maximized. And to keep the battery topped up, SPORT mode also activates maximum energy recuperation during <b>overrun</b> and <b>braking</b> as the electric motor’s generator function, which recharges the battery using kinetic energy, switches to a more powerful setting. The Driving Experience Control switch on the center console offers a choice of two settings. On starting, COMFORT mode is activated, which offers a balance between sporty performance and fuel efficiency, with unrestricted access to all convenience functions. Alternatively, the ECO PRO mode can be engaged, which, on the BMW i8 as on other models, supports an efficiency-optimized driving style. On this mode the powertrain controller coordinates the cooperation between the gasoline engine and the electric motor for maximum fuel economy. On deceleration, the intelligent energy management system automatically decides, in line with the driving situation and vehicle status, whether to recuperate braking energy or to coast with the powertrain disengaged. At the same time, ECO PRO mode also programs electrical convenience functions such as the air conditioning, seat heating and heated mirrors to operate at minimum power consumption, but without compromising safety. The maximum driving range of the BMW i8 on a full fuel tank and with a fully charged battery is more than 500 km in COMFORT mode, which can be increased by up to 20% in ECO PRO mode. The BMW i8’s ECO PRO mode can also be used during all-electric operation. The vehicle is then powered solely by the electric motor. Only if the battery charge drops below a given level, or under sudden intense throttle application such as kickdown, is the internal combustion engine automatically activated.|$|R
