25|$|Acrylamide is {{considered}} a potential <b>occupational</b> <b>carcinogen</b> by U.S. government agencies and classified as a Group 2A carcinogen by the IARC. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set dermal occupational exposure limits at 0.03mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. In animal models, exposure to acrylamide causes tumors in the adrenal glands, thyroid, lungs, and testes. Acrylamide is easily absorbed by the skin and distributed throughout the organism; {{the highest levels of}} acrylamide post-exposure are found in the blood, non-exposed skin, kidneys, liver, testes, and spleen. Acrylamide can metabolically-activated by cytochrome P450 to a genotoxic metabolite, glycidamide, which {{is considered}} to be a critical mode of action to the carcinogenesis of acrylamide. On the other hand, acrylamide and glycidamide can be detoxified via conjugation with glutathione to form acrylamide- and isomeric glycidamide-glutathione conjugates, subsequently metabolized to mercapturic acids and excreted in urine. Acrylamide has also been found to have neurotoxic effects in humans who have been exposed. Animal studies show neurotoxic effects as well as mutations in sperm.|$|E

The population attributable fraction (PAF) was estimated as impact measure. RESULTS: Men showed an increased lung cancer risk even at low exposure to asbestos (OR: 1. 76; 95 % CI: 1. 42 - 2. 18), crystalline silica (OR: 1. 31; 95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 71) and nickel-chromium (OR: 1. 18; 95 % CI: 0. 90 - 1. 53); risk increased with exposure level. For polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, an increased risk (OR: 1. 64; 95 % CI: 0. 99 - 2. 70) was found only for high exposures. The PAFs for any exposure to asbestos, silica and nickel-chromium were 18. 1, 5. 7 and 7. 0 %, respectively, equivalent to an overall PAF of 22. 5 % (95 % CI: 14. 1 - 30. 0). This corresponds to about 1016 (95 % CI: 637 - 1355) male lung cancer cases/year in Lombardy.
