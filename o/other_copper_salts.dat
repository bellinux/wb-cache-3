According to an older opinion, chrysocolla was borax, which {{had been found in}} ancient gold foundries and is still used for soldering gold. Aristoteles (De mirabilibus) mentions that the Chalcedonian island Demonesus has a mine of cyan (κυανόσ) and chrysocolla. Theophrastus (De lapidibus) describes chrysocolla as a kind of [...] "false emerald" [...] found in gold and copper mines, used for soldering gold. Pliny (Historia Naturalis) and Celsus mention that chrysocolla is extracted along with gold, and is used as a pigment and medicament. Dioscorides (De materia medica) describes the purification of the ore and its use in healing wounds, also noting its poisonous effect.|$|R

40|$|Copper {{formulations}} and <b>copper</b> <b>salts</b> are {{the most}} frequently used plant protection agents. Therefore copper concentrations in agriculture soils can easily exceed limit emission value for copper (60 mg Cu/kg for the dry soil), which migh already affect the behavior and consequently the ecological function of soil organisms. Data from literature show that different copper formulations and different salts have different impact on animals. The aim of our study was to find out which copper formulations or <b>copper</b> <b>salts</b> have the greatest impact on the avoidance behavior of earthworms. Avoidance behaviour was studied by the rapid avoidance test on earthworms Eisenia Andrei (ISO 17512 - 1). We estimated EC 50 values for different <b>copper</b> furmulations and <b>salts</b> used. In the study two kinds of <b>copper</b> <b>salts</b> (CuCl 2 * 2 H 2 O and CuSO 4 * 5 H 2 O) and three most frequently applied cooper formulations in Slovenia were used (Cuprablau Z, Cuprablau Z Ultra and Champion). Salts have high solubility, while copper formulations have low solubility and create suspension. To increase water solubility and for better effect of active substance copper formulations usually contain different additives. We found out that avoidance behaviour is more prominent in the soil with <b>copper</b> <b>salts</b> than in the soil with copper formulations, among which differences were also found. The range of <b>copper</b> formulations and <b>salts</b> sorted from the lowest to highest calculated EC 50 values is: CuCl 2 * 2 H 2 O < CuSO 4 * 5 H 2 O < Champion < Cuprablau Z Ultra < Cuprablau Z...|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} oxygen plasma treatment on the substrate, the contact angle was measured. As shown in Fig. S 1 a and b, the substrate treated with oxygen plasma has lower contact angle values {{than that of the}} non-treated substrate. In addition, Figure S 1 c–g shows that as the <b>copper</b> <b>salt</b> content is increased, the contact angle becomes larger, increasing from 40.8 to 82.7 (0.75 – 1.75  g mL− 1) on the PET substrate. Furthermore, because the contact angle influences the thickness of the coated <b>copper</b> <b>salt</b> film, it significantly determines whether or not the bottom layer of the copper ions can absorb enough energy to be reduced by laser. According to our experimental results, the 1.25  g mL− 1 copper nitrate solution is the optimal condition for coating the film on the substrate. Figure S 2 shows a typical SEM image of <b>copper</b> <b>salt.</b> Various shapes can be observed in copper, such as the irregular sphere, rod. The mean size of these particles is about 10  µm.|$|R
