5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor.

50|$|An {{impact on}} {{polycarbonate}} by a projectile at temperatures below −7 °C sometimes creates spall, pieces <b>of</b> <b>polycarbonate</b> that are broken off and become projectiles themselves. Experiments {{have demonstrated that}} the size of the spall is related to the thickness of the laminate rather than the size of the projectile. The spall starts in surface flaws caused by bending <b>of</b> the inner, <b>polycarbonate</b> layer and the cracks move “backwards” through to the impact surface. It has been suggested that a second inner layer <b>of</b> <b>polycarbonate</b> may effectively resist penetration by the spall.|$|R

40|$|Thermoplastic polycarbonates {{are widely}} used in several {{manufacturing}} domains because of their extraordinary combination of transparency, toughness, ductility and chemical inertness at low and moderate temperature. They are, thus, ideal candidates to substitute float glasses, where lightweight and safety are of utmost relevance. In contrast, polycarbonates feature limited scratch and mar resistance, being characterized by very low surface hardness. This suggests the protection <b>of</b> <b>polycarbonates</b> with hard transparent coatings. However, poor interfacial adhesion between conventional coatings and polycarbonates, reduced cohesive strength of some hard coating materials and, in particular, their limited compliance when deposited on ductile substrates often reduce significantly their performance. In this respect, the present work analyzes {{the pros and cons}} of protecting thermoplastic polycarbonates with specialty coatings, emphasizing the real advantages of applying surface overlying layers and their drawbacks. Different formulations of the coatings were herein studied to optimize their interfacial adhesion with polycarbonates and cohesive strengths. Tribological (scratch, wear and mar) tests were, thus, performed to assess the performance of the coatings. After appropriate designing, specialty coatings might be useful to increase hardness and mar resistance <b>of</b> <b>polycarbonates.</b> Nevertheless, they are still largely ineffective to improve wear resistance <b>of</b> <b>polycarbonates.</b> © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Polycarbonate plastic is a lightweight, {{high-performance}} plastic that {{possesses a}} unique balance of toughness, dimensional stability, optical clarity, high heat resistance and excellent electrical resistance.
