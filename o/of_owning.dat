Jack is excited at the idea <b>of</b> <b>owning</b> a piece of Geiss's legacy as Jack considered Geiss his mentor. At the will reading, Jack inherits Geiss's beloved pet peacock named Argus. When Argus begins acting peculiar, Jack enlists the help of NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth—who knows all the peafowl calls—tells Jack that Argus muttered senpai and kōhai—master and pupil—nicknames that Geiss and Jack had for each other (a ruse conceived by Liz, who knew of the nicknames). Immediately, Jack is convinced that Geiss's soul has inhabited Argus, prompting Jack to release his grief to Argus and finally accepting Geiss's death.|$|E
40|$|In {{conditions}} of reorganization of economical societies, owners {{make decisions about}} further juridical future of their capital. Consequently, the main task concerning accounting <b>of</b> operations with <b>own</b> capital is to arrange them according to law to provide accounting protection of stockholders’ property rights in operations with stocks. The existing approaches to the definition <b>of</b> <b>own</b> capital don’t allow to see accounting and juridical essence of operations with property in {{conditions of}} reorganization in detail. The {{aim of the research}} is to create an exact definition <b>of</b> <b>own</b> capital for organization of accounting about providing own capital management in conditions of reorganization. To reach the goal the author systematizes the structure <b>of</b> <b>own</b> capital and determines the value of net assets, corporative rights (nominal, balanced value) and explains their function as instruments in operations with property. The current research allows to define the essence <b>of</b> <b>own</b> capital in conditions of reorganization of economical societies as the obligation before economical societies-sellers’ owners about the exchange of their corporative rights ensured with net assets for the corporative rights in the society of legal successor. Such understanding <b>of</b> <b>own</b> capital gives a possibility to outline all the spectrum of calculating and accounting operations with it and provide the connection <b>of</b> <b>own</b> capital accounting with stockholders’ property interests...|$|R

40|$|Mere {{knowledge}} {{that the company has}} acquired own shares is not always of great importance. Information on the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>own</b> shares from dissenting shareholders or the squeeze-out of minority shareholders is not of great importance to the users of financial statements. In the first case, it is far more significant to disclose the significant event that allowed dissenting shareholders to resign from the company. However, the purchase <b>of</b> <b>own</b> shares due to certain reasons, such as the purchase <b>of</b> <b>own</b> shares at a premium in order to influence the market value of shares, the repurchase focused on preventing greater harm to the company, which is especially true at a time of financial crisis, or the repurchase <b>of</b> <b>own</b> shares as a means of disbursing shareholders, is of great importance to the users of financial statements. Therefore, modern legislation in developed countries obliges companies to disclose a range <b>of</b> information regarding <b>own</b> shares, including the reasons for the acquisition.
