5|$|Upon {{crossing}} the Millstone River, Route 27 {{runs along the}} border <b>of</b> <b>Franklin</b> Township, Somerset County {{to the west and}} South Brunswick Township, Middlesex County to the east, passing through the historic community of Kingston.

Route 27 briefly runs entirely into Somerset County before resuming along the Middlesex/Somerset County border. The route continues north to an intersection with County Route 518 (Gateway Boulevard), where it resumes its northeast direction and heads into Kendall Park as a variable two- to four-lane road, entering denser suburban development. Route 27 then passes through Franklin Park, intersecting County Route 610 (Henderson Road). Past that intersection, Route 27 forms the border <b>of</b> <b>Franklin</b> Township to the west and North Brunswick Township to the east, passing through suburban development with some areas of farmland, seeing about 38,487 cars a day.

5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} background or sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), {{but he was a}} voracious reader with an obsession for the Arctic. After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's focus was directed toward the Arctic. He was able to launch two expeditions in search <b>of</b> <b>Franklin</b> and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E

Because of the arrival <b>of</b> <b>Franklin,</b> 2008 was the first since 2005 that head coach Ralph Friedgen did not call the offensive plays himself. At Maryland, Franklin installed a West Coast offense, which was well suited to quarterback Chris Turner's playing style and an experienced wide receiver corps that included play-maker Darrius Heyward-Bey and sure-handed Danny Oquendo.|$|E

5|$|NY132 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with the concurrency of US202 and NY35 in front <b>of</b> <b>Franklin</b> D. Roosevelt State Park {{in the town}} of Yorktown. NY132 proceeds north along Old Yorktown Road, crossing through a residential section of Yorktown.

5|$|Several {{geographic}} {{features are}} named after Patrick Cleburne, including Cleburne County in Alabama and Arkansas, {{and the city}} of Cleburne, Texas.

5|$|The phylogenetic {{study of}} Alfredo Justo and colleagues showed that Volvariella earlei {{is closely related}} to Volvariella gloiocephala and that this group of species {{constitutes}} a separate lineage from the majority of the species traditionally classified in Volvariella. Therefore, this taxon was transferred to the newly proposed genus Volvopluteus. The specific epithet earlei comes from the surname <b>of</b> <b>Franklin</b> Sumner Earle, the collector of the original samples, to whom Murrill dedicated the species. The original specimens of this species are still preserved at the herbarium of the New York Botanical Garden.|$|E
