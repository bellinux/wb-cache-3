40|$|Hypertension {{is defined}} as an {{asymptomatic}} disease {{which means that the}} disease is not related to the experience of physical symptoms. This illness is mainly managed by means of oral drug therapies, but research shows that many patients fail to take their medication as they should. Non-compliance is the main problem associated with drug-related treatments, specifically amongst patients diagnosed with chronic conditions, such as hypertension. Past research has focused on many different factors accounting for the high <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> Psychological factors relate to patients’ beliefs about their diagnosed illness and their prescribed treatment regimen. These beliefs are conceptualized in terms of the self-regulation model as constituting 5 main dimensions: identity or symptoms of their illness, the consequences of their illness, timeline or specifically referring to the course of the illness (chronic or acute), causes of the illness and controllability. Compliance is vital in the treatment and management of hypertension and research attempting to understand the relation between compliance and patients’ illness cognitions are thus important. The already high prevalence of this condition coupled with {{an increase in the number}} of people reporting low compliance suggests the need for intervention. The research question informing the present study was based on the role that psychological factors play in impacting patients’ medication-taking patterns. The medication adherence model describes medication compliance in terms of purposeful action, patterned behaviour and feedback. Purposeful action concerns patients’ intentional decisions to take their medication while patterned behaviour relates to the medication-taking patterns that patients develop. The feedback dimension guides the medication-taking patterns, providing feedback about blood pressure for example. The theory informing the present study involved social cognitive theory, which highlights the role of self-efficacy and outcome expectancies. Self-efficacy is linked with feelings of personal control and specifically refers to people’s belief in their ability to perform certain actions that will produce desired outcomes. Outcome expectancies are described as people’s ability to consider the consequences of their actions and using this information to direct their behaviour. Bearing in mind these two aspects of social cognitive theory, patients’ belief in their ability to conform to their medication instructions together with their expectations that it will improve their health will direct their medication-taking behaviour (i. e. their compliance). The illness-perception questionnaire-revised and the medication-taking questionnaire were used to obtain information about patients’ illness cognitions and their medication compliance. The correlational findings as well as the results produced by regression analysis revealed that, although illness cognitions can play a determining role in patients’ compliance, the present findings found no relation between how patients take their medication and psychological factors, defined in terms of the self-regulation model. Only one of the factors used during factor analysis revealed to significantly predict medication. Limitations associated with the present study might account for this finding and it is recommended that future research should focus on a larger sample and also use supplementary assessment measures in conjunction with self-report measures.

Implementing a risk based inspection system can contribute to an effective and efficient organic control system, hence improving organic farming relative competitiveness. This study is part of the CERCOST EU project, and analyses data from inspections on a sample of Italian organic farms, aiming at the identification of management and structural risk factors contributing to the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliances.</b> Risk analysis is based on the estimation of both parametric and non-parametric models using negative binomial panel estimators and Bayesian network modelling...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose is}} to provide an {{analysis}} of the risk factors influencing non-compliance in UK organic farming. The paper uses a formal econometric model of risk analysis to provide empirical evidence on the determinants <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> in organic farming. A panel of data from the archives of the largest control body in the UK for 2007 - 2009 is used, and specific analyses are performed for two types <b>of</b> <b>non-compliances.</b> A zero inflated count data model is used for the estimation, taking into account the fact that the <b>occurrences</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> are very sparse. Results show the existence of strong co-dependence of non-compliant behaviours (i. e. the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> major and critical non-compliance increases the probability <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> the minor one; similarly the probability <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> major <b>non-compliance</b> increases when minor non-compliance occur). Besides, livestock production and farm size are relevant risk factors. Albeit highly representative, the findings are based on Soil Association data only and not on all UK organic farms. The paper provides practical indications for control bodies, concerning aspects that could be strengthened for more efficient risk-based inspections. The paper advocates the use of financial information like turnover or capital stock, and of data concerning the characteristics of the farmers, that could substantially improve the probability of detecting the most severe non-compliances. Certification is essential for organic farming, and an improvement of inspection procedures through a risk-based approach could add efficiency and effectiveness to the whole organic food system, with obvious advantages for consumers and the society as a whole. This paper provides for the first time empirical evidence concerning the implementation of the organic certification system in the UK...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Italian and German organic certification systems, including the institutions involved and the definitions <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and sanctions. Although {{they are both}} implementations of the same EU regulatory framework, these systems differ in many respects. Case study data from control bodies on non-compliance and sanctions are presented and analysed using binary choice models. This analysis shows that the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> slight <b>non-compliance</b> and greater farm acreage are significant risk factors that explain severe non-compliance in both countries. However, to implement an efficient risk-based inspection system in the future, the data collection process must be improved and extended to examine personal attributes of farmers and operators. ...|$|R

AimsTo examine prevalence rates <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin; variations between clinical settings, types <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and methods <b>of</b> detection; and potential factors influencing non-compliance with digoxin. MethodsThis was a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin in patients with HF and/or AF, published in English. The studies were identified through these bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, IPA and Cochrane CENTRAL. Subgroup analysis examined the influence of clinical settings, types <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and methods <b>of</b> detection. ResultsTen studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1841 patients with HF and/or AF. The corresponding prevalence rates <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> for outpatients, after hospital discharge and inpatients were 43. 1 % (interquartile range [IQR] 29 – 48 %), 25 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 12 – 37 %) and 4. 5 %, respectively. In patients with HF and AF co-morbidities, the prevalence rate <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin was 38. 7 % (IQR 27 – 46 %); the corresponding prevalence rates of overdosing and underdosing were 33. 04 % (IQR 22 – 49 %) and 33. 8 % (95 % CI 25 – 42 %), respectively. Rates varied depending on the methods <b>of</b> detecting <b>non-compliance.</b> Regularity <b>of</b> prescribed dose, diuretic use, coronary artery bypass, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, number of office visits and pill boxes demonstrated strong associations with non-compliance with digoxin. ConclusionsNon-compliance with digoxin is prevalent among patients with HF and/or AF.

30|$|The paper {{begins by}} {{developing}} a simple theoretical model in which the obvious benefits <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> for an employer are to be set against the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> We model these as composed of the probability of getting caught, and the fine imposed if caught. However, alternative interpretations of the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> are possible, including peer effects. We model the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> {{as a function of}} the total short fall of the wage bill compared to full compliance, allowing for the possibility that employers adjust partially towards the minimum wage. The model predicts that employment will fall as the result of a minimum wage, but that a spread of wages below the minimum wage should be observed in response to the law. Employer responses to a minimum wage law depend on the level at which the minimum wage is set, relative to the existing wage. Wages will rise towards the minimum wage, and under certain conditions, the lowest wages will rise proportionately more than those close to the stipulated minimum.|$|R

40|$|The Dutch Inspectorate of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment has {{developed}} a method, the so-called "compliance-strategy", to determine the risks <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with the law. On {{the basis of these}} risks the Inspectorate allocates extra time for law enforcement on regulations leading to high levels <b>of</b> risk and <b>non-compliance.</b> The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has found the method suitable for this purpose. RIVM also recommends several improvements to enhance convenience and transparency, and to make the method better accessible to policy makers and the public. One of these is defining the risks using a method based on agreements on how to assess risk from the estimated effects and chances <b>of</b> <b>occurrence.</b> Experts at the Institute have applied the same method to estimate the risks associated with the legislation. These risks are estimated lower by RIVM than by the Inspectorate. In cases where risk is the product of effect and the chance <b>of</b> <b>occurrence,</b> RIVM experts estimate lower chances <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> at the same level of effects. Upon their review of the compliance strategy, local authorities and other inspectorates have recommended explicit marking of administrative priorities and concretizing definitions; for example, what is considered a small chance <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> (once a year or once in a hundred years) ? RIVM also advises checking on costs in cases <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> applied to the laws and regulations originating in European legislation aimed at economic development <b>of</b> a region. <b>Non-compliance</b> may lead to high costs or to high losses due to underdevelopment. Some of these laws and regulations are classified as low risk in terms of public health and sustainable development. In cases where high costs seem probable, a separate approach to the legislation in the annual working programmes may be necessary...|$|R
