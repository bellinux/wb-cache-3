5|$|Lhermitte {{filed for}} and {{received}} a judgment of divorce before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection.

The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system. Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be balanced by decency” given the nature of the tragedy.|$|E
