50|$|Recently, {{there have}} been {{advances}} in ceramics which include bio-ceramics, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. Hydroxyapatite, the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically {{from a number of}} biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> made from these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions. Because of this, they are of great interest for gene delivery and tissue engineering scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength and are used to coat metal orthopaedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopaedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nano crystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopaedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopaedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein collagens, synthetic bones.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The loss of bone {{integrity}} {{can significantly}} compromise the aesthetics and mobility {{of patients and}} can be treated using <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants.</b> Over the past decades; various orthopaedic implants; such as allografts; xenografts and synthetic materials; have been developed and widely used in clinical practice. However; most of these materials lack intrinsic osteoinductivity and thus cannot induce bone formation. Consequently; osteoinductive functionalisation of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> is needed to promote local osteogenesis and implant osteointegration. For this purpose; bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -functionalised coatings {{have proven to be}} a simple and effective strategy.

These infections are characterized by the formation of persistent bacterial biofilms on the implanted materials, causing inflammation, periprosthetic osteolysis, osteomyelitis, and bone damage, resulting in implant loosening and failure. An <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implant</b> infection model was used in which a titanium Kirshner-wire was surgically placed in femurs of LysEGFP mice, which possess EGFP-fluorescent neutrophils, and a bioluminescent S. aureus strain (Xen 29; 1 × 10 (3) CFUs) was inoculated in the knee joint before closure. In vivo bioluminescent, fluorescent, X-ray and μCT imaging were performed on various postoperative days. The bacterial bioluminescent signals of the S. aureus-infected mice peaked on day 19, before decreasing to a basal level of light, which remained measurable for the entire 48 day experiment. Neutrophil EGFP-fluorescent signals of the S. aureus-infected mice were statistically greater than uninfected mice on days 2 and 5, but afterwards the signals for both groups approached background levels of detection. To visualize the three-dimensional location of the bacterial infection and neutrophil infiltration, a diffuse optical tomography reconstruction algorithm was used to co-register the bioluminescent and fluorescent signals with μCT images. To quantify the anatomical bone changes on the μCT images, the outer bone volume of the distal femurs were measured using a semi-automated contour based segmentation process. The outer bone volume increased through day 48, indicating that bone damage continued during the implant infection. Bioluminescent and fluorescent optical imaging was combined with X-ray and μCT imaging to provide noninvasive and longitudinal measurements of the dynamic changes in bacterial burden, neutrophil recruitment and bone damage in a mouse <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implant</b> infection model...|$|R

40|$|Typically, The Journal Of Bone and Joint Surgery publishes {{papers that}} report {{the results of}} {{clinical}} or basic-science inquiry and has dealt only fleetingly with government policy, malpractice, hospital administration, new technology, and the like. The Journal does consider and publish so-called non-conventional articles when these reports deal with issues of major importance. One could argue that such non-traditional articles lack scientific validity as the important variables that they discuss, such as quality, service, and satisfaction, are not quantified.

The Journal has done this by including two articIes 4 dealing with the cost of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> in the present issue. The cost of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> is staggering.

40|$|Magnesium (Mg) -based {{biodegradable}} {{materials are}} promising {{candidates for the}} new generation of implantable medical devices, particularly cardiovascular stents and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants.</b> Mg-based cardiovascular stents represent the most innovative stent technology to date.

Thus various surface coatings have been introduced to protect Mg-based stents from rapid corrosion and to improve biocompatibility. Similarly, different coatings have been used for <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants,</b> e. g., plates and pins for bone fracture fixation or as an interference screw for tendon-bone or ligament-bone insertion, to improve biocompatibility and corrosion resistance.

Bovine serum is currently recommended {{for use by the}} International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) for the wear testing of these implant materials, however, the rheological properties of bovine serum do not match fully those of the body’s natural lubricant, synovial fluid. This study looks at a potential alternative to bovine serum for the testing of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implant</b> materials; 0. 5 % gellan gum fluid gel. Wear tests using multidirectional motion were conducted on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) pins rubbing against stainless steel plates.

40|$|The longevity, success, {{or failure}} of an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implant</b> is {{dependent}} on its osseointegration especially within the initial {{six months of the}} initial surgery. The development of strains plays a crucial role in both bone modelling and remodelling. For remodelling, in particular, strains of substantial values are required to activate the osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity for the osseointegration of the implant. Bone, however, is subject to ‘damage’ when strain levels exceed a certain threshold level. Damage is manifested in the form of microcracks; it is linked to increased elastic strain amplitudes and is accompanied by the development of ‘plastic’ (irrecoverable, residual) strains. Such strains increase the likelihood for the implant to subside or loosen. The present study examines the rates (per cycle) by which these two components of strain (elastic and ‘plastic’) develop during fatigue cycling in two loading modes, tension and compression. The results of this study show that these strain rates depend on the applied stress in both loading modes. It also shows that elastic and plastic strain rates can be linked to each other through simple power law relationships so that one can calculate or predict the latter from the former and vice versa. We anticipate that such basic bone biomechanics data would be of great benefit to both clinicians and bioengineers working in the field of FEA modelling applications and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implant</b> surgery...|$|R
