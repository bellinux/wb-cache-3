5|$|US219 passes {{along the}} eastern edge of Mount Nebo Wildlife Management Area and crosses Hoop Pole Hill. North of Sand Flat Road, the highway passes Mayhew Inn Road, which leads west to Swallow Falls State Park. US 219 descends from Hoop Pole Ridge and reaches the southwestern shore of Deep Creek Lake in the hamlet of Thayerville. After passing Glendale Road, which heads east toward Deep Creek Lake State Park and other {{destinations}} {{on the east side of}} the lake, the highway turns northwest and parallels the west shore of the lake east of Roman Nose Hill. After passing Lakeshore Drive, US219 crosses the lake on the Deep Creek Bridge. The highway becomes a partially controlled access highway on the hillside above the lake, while Deep Creek Drive follows the shore. US219 continues north through the unincorporated village of McHenry. In McHenry, the highway intersects Mosser Road, which provides access to Garrett College and Garrett County Airport, and Sang Run Road, which leads to Wisp Ski Resort. After meeting the northern end of Deep Creek Drive, the highway leaves Deep Creek Lake and curves northeast at its junction with MD42 (Friendsville Road). US219 continues northeast along Rocklick Creek and the South Branch of Bear Creek. After leaving the South Branch, the highway follows Main Street through the town <b>of</b> <b>Accident.</b> Within the town, the highway intersects Accident Friendsville Road and Accident Bittinger Road, which heads east toward the James Drane House.|$|E

Dumas held a 24-second advantage over Lotterer with di Grassi in third, while Evans moved back into the LMP2 lead. Both Toyota cars were battling for fourth position with Webber close behind. Webber overtook Davidson for fifth at the Radillion corner exit moving ahead of Sarrazin on the Kemmel straight one lap later. Di Grassi slowed with technical problems and limped into his garage for an engine control unit and front-left nose change. Toyota's No. 1 car was pushed into its garage with mechanical problems; it rejoined the circuit for a few laps until a throttle problem emerged, causing the car to run at a reduced pace. Lotterer retook the lead after the No. 18 Porsche driver switch took longer than expected. Rast passed Conway around the outside for fourth at the Bus Stop chicane. Vilander challenged Lietz for second in LMGTE Pro until Vilander was issued a track limit abuse penalty. Lotterer and Lieb battled each other for first place. Lotterer drove defensively after passing slower traffic going into Les Combes corner to keep the position. Lieb ran wide off the track at the Stavelot corner exit while lapping a slower car.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{characteristics}} and trend <b>of</b> road <b>accidents</b> on a selected stretch of NH- 1 between RD 98 km and 148 km. Four year road accident data from 2007 to 2010 of 50 km long stretch was collected which includes the period when construction of 6 -laning project started on NH- 1. The paper also brings forth the result of widening project on road accidents. The data was analyzed to identify cause <b>of</b> <b>accidents,</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> and type <b>of</b> injury, type of vehicles involved and time <b>of</b> <b>accidents.</b> The widening project has resulted in tremendous increase in number <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> on the road.

Findings show that head on/rear end collisions, caused mainly due to overspeeding/driver's fault account for 46 % <b>of</b> the <b>accidents.</b> It is seen that trucks/canter/buses are found involved in maximum number <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> (42 %).
