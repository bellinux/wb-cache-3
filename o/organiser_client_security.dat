50|$|The Perforce Helix client {{completely}} trusts the server, including writing arbitrary files {{anywhere in}} the local filesystem, and therefore running arbitrary code from the server. That means the server has complete control over the client user's account, including reading and writing and sending all non-source code files of the user. In environments where the Perforce server is managed by a third party, this poses a significant threat to the <b>client's</b> <b>security</b> and privacy.|$|R
50|$|This {{securities}} segregation requirement {{was developed}} due to {{problems in the}} U.S. stock markets {{towards the end of}} the 1960s. At the time, there was not any requirement that brokers segregate <b>client</b> <b>securities</b> from the firm's own assets on the firm's books and records. When brokers went bankrupt, therefore, they were unable to return <b>securities</b> to their <b>clients,</b> inasmuch as they had not maintained accurate books and records of their clients' holdings.|$|R

50|$|The more {{technology}} improves,everyday {{tasks that}} used to be performed by human employees can now be carried out by computer systems. Telephone answering systems replacing live receptionists is one example of such substitution. It is, however, important to understand that often these changes can lead to issues as well as benefits. Losing personal communication with <b>clients,</b> <b>security</b> issues, etc. may have a heavy impact in company value. Such aspects must be considered before, during and after all decisions and implementations for IT management to be successful.|$|R

The thesis defines terms of "consumer" and "investor", explains why they are considered bank clients and introduces reasons of their protection. It describes elements of bank clients' protection such as: deposit insurance (including comparison of foreign systems - Switzerland and New Zealand), consumer credits rules, payment system and Bureau of Financial Arbiter, personal information security and bank secret. The last chapter addresses investor protection, falling under European directive MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) ...|$|R
50|$|Two {{separate}} {{methods were}} developed to invoke <b>client</b> <b>security</b> for use with FTP clients: Implicit and Explicit. While the implicit method requires that a Transport Layer Security is established {{from the beginning of}} the connection, which in turn breaks the compatibility with non-FTPS-aware clients and servers, the explicit method uses standard FTP protocol commands and replies in order to upgrade a plain text connection to an encrypted one, allowing a single control port to be used for serving both FTPS-aware and non-FTPS-aware clients. This is very similar to the way HTTPS and STARTTLS implement Transport Layer Security for HTTP and SMTP protocol, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Many {{businesses}} have poor IT infrastructure {{and are in}} need of a major overhaul. University of Louisville Properties (ULP), in particular, needed the ability to share files between staff, backup data, secure data, and eliminate viruses and malware. Along those lines, ULP was looking for a secure, stable, reliable, and most importantly, a costeffective Microsoft solution to their IT woes. For consistency and reliability, a Symantec Ghost image was created of such a system. This system was created using Windows XP Professional, Microsoft Office 2003, Symantec <b>Client</b> <b>Security,</b> and Microsoft Sysprep. The image was deployed to all ULP computers, creating the exact environment for which they were looking. Each user began logging in with a user name and password, which alone increased security significantly. A file server was implemented so that data could be centralized and shared among staff members. In addition, a backup system was implemented that automated the backup process to cover all PCs including the central file server. Also, Microsoft Sysprep enabled one image to be distributed to multiple hardware platforms, which reduced image creation time drastically. Symantec <b>Client</b> <b>Security</b> added the antivirus and firewall components needed to control network traffic, viruses, and malware. These changes eliminated the problems that ULP faced and allowed the staff more functionality in their IT environment. With data redundancy, file security, and system reliability, the staff now enjoys a care-free computing experience for very little cost...|$|R
40|$|Computerisation {{facilitates}} instantaneous {{and direct}} links between {{all of us}} in our work and social lives. At the same time, and counterintuitively so, securities are increasingly held indirectly through chains of custodians that operate between issuers and investors. This disconnects investors from issuers and can significantly reduce the value of assets. The regulatory framework does not prevent this effect. UK regulated holders of <b>client</b> <b>securities</b> should be required to hold these directly {{in the name of the}} investor. At an international level it is worth asking if the technology underlying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be used to create an un-intermediated securities ledger connecting investors and issuers directly...|$|R
