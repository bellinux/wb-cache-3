From river engineering relatively extensive information is available for bed protections with currents as primary load. From coastal engineering relatively extensive information is available for low-crested rubble mound structures with waves as primary load. Information on the stability of bed protections with waves, {{or a combination of}} waves and currents, is relatively scarce. Also information on the stability of rubble mound structures with a very low-crest (i. e., near-bed structures) under loading of waves and currents is scarce. Most availabledata concerns data related to start of damage, providing little information on damage levels related to failure of these structures. In the present study physical model tests have been performed to contribute to the understanding of relevant processes and to fill relevant gaps in the existing information on near-bed structures and bed protections.

Jakarta metropolitan faced the very high population growth, urban sprawling, traffic jams, flooding, green open space reduction, environmental degradation, urban slums and illegal street hawkers. Flooding and traffic congestions were {{the two most important}} issues to solve. SWOT analysis and urban design solutions were produced to create a sustainable solution. Related to transportation issues, Singapore Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) concept was evaluated. Meanwhile the Netherlands’ polder concept as well as Singapore’s Integrated Water Management were also analyzed. The development of above ground MRT as well as Busway could be developed to connect Jakarta Metropolitan Region. The networks were developed on the main toll road networks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rainfall in the Netherlands has {{moderate}} intensities {{and is more}} or less {{evenly distributed}} over the year while in Thailand rainfall occurs at high intensities and predominantly in the rainy season. The aim of the water management system in an urban area in a polder is to provide good drainage and discharge out of the polder. This paper presents a mathematical model for the optimisation of the main components of the water management system in urban areas in polders in the Netherlands and in Thailand. The main components of the water management system in an urban area in a polder are cross-sections of the sewers, distances between the canals, percentages of open water, canal water levels below the surface and discharge capacity of the <b>outfall</b> <b>structures</b> or the pumping stations. In order to find optional values for these main components the software package OPOL has been further developed. This package takes into account the relevant hydrological processes, construction and operation and maintenance costs for the water management system and damages due to high groundwater tables, water on the street, or even inundation under influence of rainfall and water level fluctuations in the urban canals. Optimising such a system aims at determining the main components {{in such a way that}} the annual equivalent costs will be minimal. The results of a case study for an urban polder in the area of the Principal Water-board of Delfland, the Netherlands and of another one in Bangkok, Thailand are shown. It was found that the canal water level has the largest influence on damages in these urban polders...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the initial}} {{constraints}} of any dredging project is deciding where to place dredged material. When placed upland, materials can be used beneficially, as beach nourishment or for habitat restoration, or can be placed in an upland confined disposal facility (CDF). Several times the solids volume in water is required to fluidized and hydraulically pump the materials. Once in the CDF, materials settle out of suspension, with clarified water decanted. This paper describes in general a current weir design used by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and illustrates the innovations of the new Jacksonville District standard weir. The new <b>outfall</b> <b>structure</b> is safer, easier to construct, and has inherent environmental protection features. It also has a longer life cycle and lower lifecycle cost than traditional structures. This paper also discusses a new composite weir system {{that is in the}} patent and construction phase. These new corrosion-resistant systems have the capability of revolutionizing and standardizing water control structures due to basic changes in material selection and operational controls.

40|$|In {{recent years}} growing {{attention}} has been paid to the problem of brine disposal due to the raising awareness of significant environmental issues related to the use of desalination processes for fresh water production. This is particularly relevant when desalination units are located in remote sites, characterised by major complexity in the construction and management of intake and <b>outfall</b> <b>structures.</b> In the present work a novel device, named brine evaporative cooler/concentrator (BECC, patent pending), has been developed for coupling with small-scale thermal desalination plants in order to reduce the problem of brine disposal. Such device fulfils two different functions: i) cooling of the recirculating brine (which is often mixed with cold seawater to feed the unit, acting first as a cooling medium for the condensation of the vapour) and ii) concentration of the brine to de disposed. The BECC device is based on the principle of evaporative cooling, i. e. a primary liquid stream is cooled by means of a secondary liquid stream (by-pass stream), which in turn evaporates in contact with atmospheric air, thus being cooled naturally. The two streams are separated by a heat-conductive surface, through which heat is transferred from the primary stream to the cooling-evaporating by-pass stream. A lab scale BECC pilot unit has been designed, constructed and tested. Geometrical and operating features have been studied in order to allow the operation with concentrated brines, to minimise problems of corrosion, scaling and fouling. The first results have demonstrated the feasibility of the technology and a larger scale prototype unit has been designed for the installation within a 5 m 3 /d solar membrane distillation unit to be constructed in Pantelleria Island, Italy...|$|R
40|$|The urbanisations in {{developing}} countries had happened rapidly since 20 th Century. The Coastal Cities were affected due to unplanned and uncontrolled developments which encroaching the rural and lowlands. And because of these unsustainable developments, many environmental issues happened to the cities such as floods. Floods were contributed by insufficient infrastructure for flood prevention and flood mitigation, unmanaged infrastructure and climate change. Understanding these facts, we believe that Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) is actually needed to be implemented to solve these problems. It could be defined as “A process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, {{in order to maximize}} the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. ” In this case, IWRM actually comprises the efforts of controlling the land use change and urban surface run-off; drainage planning and management; landscape design; and infrastructure provisions, which conducted simultaneously. We concluded that to conduct successful IWRM, creative collaboration among Urban Planning Authority and Drainage Management Authority is compulsory. In the urban’ low-lying lands like Jakarta, extra flood prevention and mitigation efforts are needed. A polder system is needed as is appropriate and effective for flood control. The polder is required to be managed as integrated drainage system consisting dikes, drains, retention ponds, <b>outfall</b> <b>structures</b> or pumping stations. Further, designed landscape in the polder is required to ensure its effectiveness. Polder dikes also must be planned and designed considering potential of social conflict and accessibility issue. Lastly, maintenance of infrastructures becomes a critical point for successful polder operation. The Polder system also could not be planned separately from macro spatial plan, urban design and water management of the macro (river basin) system. Understanding this, we believed that creative collaboration in the Integrated Water Management especially in Polder System should be joined by Government, the People and the Private sector. This will eventually ensure the sustainable development of urban lowland areas...|$|R
40|$|Stability of rock on {{horizontal}} bottoms {{and steep}} slopes subjected to wave attack {{has been a}} subject of investigation in the past. But the stability of rock on gentle slopes has not been investigated systematically. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the relations between the different variables involved. A possible application is the protection of <b>outfall</b> <b>structures.</b> Due to the lack of information on this subject, relations derived for stability of rock on horizontal bottoms subjected to wave attack were applied. Application of these theories imply a destabilization of the rock by orbital velocities causing shear stresses at the bottom. Orbital velocities were calculated along the profile of the structure with the linear wave theory and substituted in the stability relations for horizontal bottoms according to the theories of Ranee & Warren and Jonsson / Sleath, respectively. The results of the calculations were expressed in the stability variable H/ADn 5 0 versus the relative waterdepth, h/H. This was done for regular as well as for irregular waves. The calculations showed an increase in the stability for increasing values of the wave steepness. Also, the deeper the water the higher the stability values. Experiments were conducted in the large wave flume of the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics at the Delft University of Technology. The model consisted of an impermeable 1 : 25 slope, on which several materials were tested. Regular and irregular waves were applied and for various conditions the wave heights and bottom velocities along the test slope were measured. The experimental results were compared with the calculations. For regular waves it appeared that for h/H values larger than one the calculations describe the stability of the rock quite well. For h/H values smaller than one the calculations are not adequate to describe the stability of the rock. The location of maximum attack was around h/H = 1. For irregular waves the location of attack was not that clear. The damage was not as concentrated and more spread out. The location of maximum attack was around h/Hs = 1. For both regular as irregular waves the general tendency could be described by the calculations but the 'plunging' effect o f the more curl-shaped waves with lower values of the wave steepness resulted into a more severe attack on the structure. For irregular waves more experiments have to be conducted for the slope section where waves are not yet broken. This to confirm or reject the theories derived applied to horizontal bottoms for the stability of rock on gentle slopes attacked by irregular waves. To investigate whether the computer simulation ODIFLOCS, can be used to simulate wave motion on gentle slopes, a comparison was made with the measurements in the experimental model. ODIFLOCS proved not to be suitable for simulation of wave motion on gentle slopes, mainly due to short comings of the numerical scheme used by ODIFLOCS which was developed for 'short' steep slopes.

40|$|Joppa Preserve is a {{representative}} {{piece of a}} greater Trinity River, bottomland hardwood forest that once dominated this portion of North Texas. Located in Dallas County, the existing core (327 acres) of the project is located downstream of the Dallas Floodway, a flood damage reduction project completed in 1959. As the project sponsors, Dallas County and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initiated a feasibility study with project implementation costs estimated at $ 12, 000, 000. This study is intended to identify existing natural resources, environmental constraints, and develop a restoration plan for Joppa Preserve. Objectives of this feasibility study included identifying the environmental degradation resulting from previous construction and restoration of Joppa Preserve. Water resources within Joppa Preserve include Lemmon Lake, Little Lemmon Lake, Honey Springs, and an unnamed tributary of Five Mile Creek. This feasibility study identified measures designed to restore critical ecosystem components. Potential ecosystem restoration alternatives included restoration and expansion of wetlands and habitat improvements to existing riparian forests. The most critical hydraulic need included the repair of a large earthen embankment isolating Lemmon Lake from the Trinity River. Numerous field surveys were conducted by personnel of U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and Wendy Lopez and Associates, Inc. (WLA) to detail existing conditions and define natural resources within the project area, evaluate potential ecosystem restoration opportunities, and identify any constraints that might limit the implementation of future ecosystem restoration measures. Several coordination and workgroup meetings were undertaken with USACE, USFWS, Dallas County, City of Dallas, and WLA, to refine these critical steps in the plan formulation process. Through the use of IWR-PLAN software, WLA completed an Incremental Cost Analysis (ICA) in which multiple alternatives were evaluated in a habitat improvement process. USFWS and WLA modeled wildlife utilization by employing the Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP). Possible combinations and solutions were identified and represented the best financial investments through {{the life of the}} project. Alternatives included: lake embankment restoration, expanding the boundaries of Joppa Preserve, wetland creation, aquatic habitat improvements to Little Lemmon Lake, maintenance of water levels, restoration of a poison ivy parkland, repair of the water <b>outfall</b> control <b>structure,</b> reforestation, and a recreation plan. The plan of interest derived from this process included acquiring additional buffer areas for Joppa Preserve, improving the lakes complex, restoring 15 acres of grassland/woodland, removing existing and creating new water control structures, reforestation of 3 acres of bottomland hardwood habitat, acquiring 69. 5 acres of disclimax communities, and restoring 1500 linear feet of the lake embankment...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} drainage information, {{analysis and}} management system (DIAMS) {{was developed and}} implemented for the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). The purpose of the DIAMS {{is to provide a}} useful tool for managers to evaluate drainage infrastructure, to facilitate the determination of the present costs of preserving those infrastructures, and to make decisions regarding the optimal use of their infrastructure budgets. The impetus for DIAMS is the culvert information management system (CIMS), which is developed to manage the data for culvert pipes. DIAMS maintains and summarizes accumulated inspection data for all types of drainage infrastructure assets, including pipes, inlet/outlet <b>structures,</b> <b>outfalls</b> and manufactured treatment devices. DIAMS capabilities include identifying drainage infrastructure, maintaining inspection history, mapping locations, predicting service life based on the current condition states, and assessing present asset value. It also includes unit cost values of 72 standard items to estimate the current cost for new assets with the ability to adjust for future inflation. In addition, DIAMS contains several different repair, rehabilitation and replacement options to remedy the drainage infrastructure. DIAMS can analyze asset information and determine decisions to inspect, rehabilitate, replace or do nothing at the project and network levels by comparing costs with risks and failures. Costs may be optimized to meet annual maintenance budget allocations by prioritizing drainage infrastructure needing inspection, cleaning and repair. DIAMS functional modules include vendor data uploading, asset identification, system administration and financial analysis. Among the significant performance feature of DIAMS is its proactive nature, which affords decision makers the means of conducting a comprehensive financial analysis to determine the optimal proactive schedule for the proper maintenance actions and to prioritize them accordingly. Benefits of DIAMS include long-term savings that accrue by adopting optimized preventive maintenance strategies and facilitating compliance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and federal storm water regulations...|$|R
