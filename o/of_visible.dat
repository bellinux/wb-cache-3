5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E

5|$|Gamma ray {{astronomy}} observes astronomical objects at {{the shortest}} wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E

5|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate {{much faster than}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter {{is not enough to}} hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the galaxy is held together by huge quantities of dark matter. Similarly, clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.|$|E
5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E
5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E

5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes to increase the amount <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> sky, but doing so would limit its radar range {{in the same way as}} the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E

SRI education researchers conducted the first national evaluation of the growing U.S. charter schools movement. For the World Golf Foundation, SRI compiled the first-ever estimate of the overall scope of the U.S. golf industry's goods and services ($62 billion in 2000), providing a framework for monitoring the long-term growth of the industry. In April 2000, SRI formed Atomic Tangerine, an independent consulting firm designed to bring new technologies and services to market.|$|E

5|$|The field {{selected}} for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It {{had to be at}} a high galactic latitude, because dust and obscuring matter in the plane of the Milky Way's disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> light (such as foreground stars), and infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background infrared 'cirrus', the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas (H I regions).|$|E
5|$|The genus, {{with about}} 20 {{described}} species, has a distribution that includes to Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. About {{half of the}} species {{are found in the}} southeastern United States, including three species added to the genus in 2013–14. Several Phellodon species were placed on a preliminary Red List of threatened British fungi because of a general decline of the genus in Europe. Species grow in a symbiotic mycorrhizal association with trees from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae (pines). Accurate DNA-based methods have been developed to determine the presence of Phellodon species in the soil, even in the extended absence <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> fruitbodies. Although Phellodon fruitbodies are considered inedible due to their fibrous flesh, the type species, P.niger, is used in mushroom dyeing.|$|E
5|$|The halogens darken in colour as {{the group}} is descended: {{fluorine}} is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid. Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114°C and boils at 183°C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may not conform to it, depending on how metallic {{it turns out to}} be). Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2006 census, the country's largest {{self-reported}} {{ethnic origin}} is Canadian (accounting for 32% of the population), followed by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German (10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), First Nations (4.0%), Ukrainian (3.9%), and Dutch (3.3%). There are 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands, encompassing {{a total of}} 1,172,790 people. Canada's indigenous population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed an indigenous identity in 2006. Another 16.2 {{percent of the population}} belonged to a non-indigenous visible minority. In 2006, the largest visible minority groups were South Asian (4.0%), Chinese (3.9%) and Black (2.5%). Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population rose by 27.2 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> minority groups. By 2007, almost one in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent of new immigrants coming from Asia (including the Middle East). The leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and India. According to Statistics Canada, visible minority groups could account for a third of the Canadian population by 2031.|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As {{a result of}} the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2°C and boils at 58.8°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital. The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195°C is pale yellow.|$|E
