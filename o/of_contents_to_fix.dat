40|$|When {{addressing}} the thermodynamics of finite-sized systems, one must specify whether one wants <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> conserved charges <b>to</b> a sharp value or whether one is <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> their thermodynamic average. In other words, {{contrary to the}} thermodynamic limit, different statistical ensembles are not equivalent. When treating the plasma phases of gauge field theories perturbatively in the canonical ensemble, unexpected new difficulties arise {{in comparison with the}} usual grand canonical treatment. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to expose these difficulties and show how they can be remedied, thus recovering a well-defined description of plasmas even in a finite-size, canonical ensemble setting. For definiteness, a specific model is considered, namely QCD$_{ 1 + 1 } $ with SU(2) color; however, the treatment presented should be applicable also to higher-dimensional systems with different types of Coulomb interaction.
