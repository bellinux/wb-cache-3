Ekman claims that the face is a rich source {{of what is going on}} inside our mind and although many facial expressions can be made voluntarily, <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> are also dictated by an involuntary system that automatically expresses our emotions.|$|E

Lisa Respers France of CNN commented that she is beginning to really like Lauren, noting: [...] "for me Lauren represents how Ryan Murphy is {{able to take the}} concept of the outcast, flip it on its ear and shove it back in <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> with a side order of fabulousness."

500|$|Because of her tour of North Vietnam {{during wartime}} and the {{subsequent}} rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when U.S. Naval Academy cadets, {{who had not yet}} been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam war, shouted out [...] "Goodnight, Jane Fonda!", the company replied [...] "Goodnight, bitch!" [...] This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures. In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, My Life So Far. He told reporters that he [...] "consider it a debt of honor", adding [...] "she spit in <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did." [...] Fonda refused to press charges.|$|E

Gaga {{comes to the}} top of the pillar and sings a combination of [...] "Starstruck" [...] and [...] "LoveGame" [...] as she is joined by her dancers in tracks and jackets and hands Gaga her trademark disco stick. After [...] "LoveGame", she talks a monologue about the year [...] "3009". And says that [...] "The kids came out of New York and shot the paparazzi." [...] followed by saying [...] "It was a thousand years before when the monster first entered the city, vanished for our hearts and for our brains and for <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> (referencing to the three video interludes of the tour)" [...] and [...] "we knew we could co-exist with this monster with our MUSIC!!! With our art and with our fashion. My name is Lady Gaga." [...] and tells the crowd she feels [...] "beautiful and dirty rich" [...] and sang [...] "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich". This leads to the end of the first part wherein a video introduction called [...] "The Brain" [...] starts with Gaga appearing again as Candy Warhol and brushing her hair. After the video ends, Gaga appears on the stage in a black and white leotard with high-pointed [...] "puff" [...] shoulders and lightning shaped symbols, while riding on a similarly colored vespa. She then starts singing [...] "The Fame". This is followed by a speech. Gaga said she's been [...] "travelling the whole world, but when I get back, I can still smell the stench of greed." [...] And then she performs [...] "Money Honey" [...] with the dancers who are wearing backpacks. [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] starts immediately, accompanied by hand-waving and Gaga wore a hat made of toppled dominoes.|$|E
2500|$|Wolf posits {{the idea}} of an [...] "iron-maiden," [...] an {{intrinsically}} unattainable standard that is then used to punish women physically and psychologically for their failure to achieve and conform to it. Wolf criticized the fashion and beauty industries as exploitative of women, but added that the beauty myth extended into all areas of human functioning. Wolf writes that women should have [...] "the choice to do whatever we want with <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> and bodies without being punished by an ideology that is using attitudes, economic pressure, and even legal judgments regarding women's appearance to undermine us psychologically and politically". Wolf argues that women were under assault by the [...] "beauty myth" [...] in five areas: work, religion, sex, violence, and hunger. Ultimately, Wolf argues for a relaxation of normative standards of beauty. In her introduction, Wolf positioned her argument against the concerns of second-wave feminists and offered the following analysis: ...|$|E
2500|$|Following a Confederate {{victory at}} Richmond, Kentucky on August 30, Confederate forces {{advanced}} deeper into that state, seeking {{to drive the}} Federals across the Ohio River and thus establish the Confederacy's northern boundary on that waterway. A drought that summer had impacted both armies, with one soldier of the 33rd Alabama saying that: [...] "we obtained water under deep limesinks, some of these being partly full of water, and Federals had utilized some of the partly filled sinks {{as a place to}} butcher cattle and dumped offal into them, making the water unfit to drink." [...] Another soldier, from the 9th Tennessee, reported that the only water available was usually from ponds, and this was [...] "so muddy that we could not wash <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> in it." [...] Food supplies were also negatively impacted by the dry weather, with Federal forces reduced first to half-rations, then to quarter-rations, then to hardtack and finally to [...] "wormy flour"; the Southerners fared little better.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a face image detection method which is executed by image processing immediately. Face image detection {{is one of}} the most mature studies in computer vision and has been gradually advanced practical use. But it has been still left room for studies on detection accuracy and processing speed. In our study, we applied an improved genetic algorithm into template pattern matching which is one of pattern recognitions, and we detected a face area in static images rapidly. In comparison with the template face image and a subject image, this algorithm increase comparison pixels as the generation in genetic algorithm increase. Furthermore, we adopt YCrCb color system for <b>our</b> <b>face</b> detection system in order to detect face images with relatively accuracy. As a result, we could mplement <b>our</b> <b>face</b> detection algorithm in motion movies. Finally, this paper reports the detection rate and the detection time for <b>our</b> <b>face</b> detection system...|$|R

We didn't know what we were doing; we just wanted white faces...and the zinc oxide beating spraying ourselves with white paint. We eventually worked our way up to what's called 'clown white.' The two best brands are made by Stein's and Max Factor... At first, the black was Maybelline waterproof eyeliner, but it would crack because it's only meant to draw a line around your eye, not a whole star. Now we use black grease sticks, which are a more solid form of greasepaint. The silver that Peter and Ace use is made by Stein's, and it comes in bottles in either metallic gold or metallic silver...The only time we have problems is in situations of extreme heat. I remember doing a show when it was so hot and humid that the make-up literally ran off <b>our</b> <b>faces.</b> Between songs we'd run {{to the side of the}} stage to slap on more clown white!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{seemed to}} have won over the middle classes, but had little impact on the largely ethnic working classes and the deeply isolationist farmers. Congress still refused to budge, so Wilson {{replaced}} Garrison as Secretary of War with Newton Baker, the Democratic mayor of Cleveland and an outspoken opponent of preparedness. The upshot was a compromise passed in May 1916, as the war raged on and Berlin was debating whether America was so weak it could be ignored. The Army was to double in size to 11,300 officers and 208,000 men, with no reserves, and a National Guard that would be enlarged in five years to 440,000 men. Summer camps on the Plattsburg model were authorized for new officers, and the government was given $20 million to build a nitrate plant of its own. Preparedness supporters were downcast, the antiwar people were jubilant. The United States would now be too weak to go to war. Colonel Robert L. Bullard privately complained that [...] "Both sides [...] treat us with scorn and contempt; our fool, smug conceit of superiority has been exploded in <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> and deservedly.". The House gutted the naval plans as well, defeating a [...] "big navy" [...] plan by 189 to 183, and scuttling the battleships. The battle of Jutland (May 31/June 1, 1916) saw the main German High Seas Fleet engage in a monumental yet inconclusive clash with the far stronger Grand Fleet of the Royal Navy. Arguing this battle proved the validity of Mahanian doctrine, the navalists took control in the Senate, broke the House coalition, and authorized a rapid three-year buildup of all classes of warships. A new weapons system, naval aviation, received $3.5 million, and the government was authorized to build its own armour-plate factory. The very weakness of American military power encouraged Berlin to start its unrestricted submarine attacks in 1917. It knew this meant war with America, but it could discount the immediate risk because the US Army was negligible and the new warships would not be at sea until 1919 by which time the war would be over, Germany thought, with Germany victorious. The notion that armaments led to war was turned on its head: refusal to arm in 1916 led to war in 1917.|$|E
