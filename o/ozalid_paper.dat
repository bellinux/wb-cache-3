40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Six wheat hybrids {{from two}} sets of parents and their {{respective}} parents were grown at Hyslop Agronomy Farm near Corvallis, Oregon in the year 1965 - 66. The object of the experiment was to evaluate the influence of population densities and different planting patterns on grain yield and factors which determine grain yield. Factors studied included the leaf area index, percent light interception, plant height, and the components of grain yield which are tillers per unit area, kernel per spike {{and the weight of}} 1, 000 kernels. The design of the experiment was first order factorial randomized split plit with 12 phenotypes X two population densities X five patterns of planting. Leaf area was measured without detaching leaves from the plant at three stages of growth. These included the jointing stage, prior to flag leaf and the heading stage. Light interception in the plant canopy was obtained by exposing <b>ozalid</b> <b>paper</b> which was placed two inches above the soil surface between the plants for nine hours during the day, At maturity, data were collected on total dry matter production, kernels per spike, 1, 000 kernel weight and grain yield. Leaf area index and tillers per unit area in hybrids and parents were not significantly different at the jointing stage. However, significant differences were observed for both the characteristics in the later stages of growth due to the reduction in tiller number per unit area. The lethal effect on tillers was due to shading of upper leaves on the same plant and from surrounding plants. Significant differences among parents and hybrids for tolerance to the influence of shading was observed. Two hybrids derived from the cross Druchamp X Redmond and Druchamp X Travero were found to be more tolerant and produced significantly higher grain yield than their respective parents. Leaf area index was found to be influenced by plant density, patterns of planting, tillers per unit area and plant height. Significantly higher grain yield was produced with a 12 " solid planting than any other patterns of planting as a result of more tillers per unit area being present at harvest time. The percentage light intercepted by the plant canopy was directly associated with plant height at the jointing stage while in the latter stages of growth the leaf area index was more important in determining the amount of light intercepted. Increased population density per unit area and closer row spacing increased the percentage of light intercepted. Dry matter production was proportionately higher with increased light interception. The percentage of light intercepted at the heading stage was found to have a greater influence on grain yield than at any other stage of growth. The cross Druchamp X Travero which produced 33 percent higher grain yield than the better parent was found to exhibit hybrid vigor for all characteristics in the later stages of growth...|$|E
