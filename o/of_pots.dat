40|$|Deleting the OB folds {{encoding}} the telomeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) -binding {{activity of}} the human telomeric protein POT 1 induces significant telomere elongation, suggesting {{that at least one}} critical aspect of the regulation of telomere length is disrupted by this POT 1 ΔOB mutant protein. POT 1 is known to associate with two proteins through the protein interaction domain retained in POT 1 ΔOB—the telomeric double-stranded DNA-binding protein TRF 2 and the telomere-associated protein TPP 1. We report that introducing a mutation that reduces association <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 with TRF 2, but not a mutation that reduces the association with TPP 1, abrogates the ability <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 ΔOB to promote telomere elongation. Mechanistically, expression <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 ΔOB reduced the association of TRF 2 with POT 1, RAP 1, and TIN 2; however, of these proteins, only ectopic expression <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 suppressed the telomere elongation induced by POT 1 ΔOB. Lastly, replacing endogenous POT 1 with a full-length POT 1 mutant defective in the association with TRF 2 induced telomere elongation. Thus, we conclude that the association <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 with both ssDNA and TRF 2 is critical for telomere length homeostasis...|$|R

25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs.

The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses <b>of</b> <b>pots</b> had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages.

His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

500|$|The {{window glass}} {{manufacturing}} process used by Hartford City Glass {{was known as}} the Cylinder Method. [...] The process was labor-intensive, and required the services of a glass blower and glass cutter—who were both highly skilled and well paid. The glass blower led a small production crew that included skilled and unskilled workers. At older plants, the glass blower's workstation was adjacent to a ceramic pot located inside the furnace. Each pot contained molten glass created by melting a batch of ingredients that included sand, soda, and lime. [...] At newer plants such as the Hartford City works, tanks were used instead <b>of</b> <b>pots.</b> The tanks were essentially huge brick pots with multiple workstations. A tank furnace is more efficient than a pot furnace, but more costly to build.|$|E

40|$|The {{single-stranded}} telomeric DNA binding protein POT 1 protects mammalian chromosome ends {{from the}} ATR-dependent DNA damage response, regulates telomerase-mediated telomere extension, and limits 5 ′-end resection at telomere termini. Whereas most mammals {{have a single}} POT 1 gene, mice have two POT 1 proteins that are functionally distinct. POT 1 a represses the DNA damage response, and POT 1 b controls 5 ′-end resection. In contrast, as we report here, POT 1 a and POT 1 b do not differ {{in their ability to}} repress telomere recombination. By swapping domains, we show that the DNA binding domain <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 a specifies its ability to repress the DNA damage response. However, no differences were detected in the in vitro DNA binding features <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 a and POT 1 b. In contrast to the repression of ATR signaling by POT 1 a, the ability <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 b to control 5 ′-end resection was found to require two regions in the C terminus, one corresponding to the TPP 1 binding domain and a second representing a new domain located between amino acids (aa) 300 and 350. Interestingly, the DNA binding domain <b>of</b> human <b>POT</b> 1 can replace that <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 a to repress ATR signaling, and the POT 1 b region from aa 300 to 350 required for the regulation of the telomere terminus is functionally conserved in human POT 1.

40|$|The fission yeast <b>Pot</b> 1 (protection <b>of</b> telomeres) protein binds to the {{single-stranded}} extensions at {{the ends}} of telomeres, where its presence is critical for the maintenance of linear chromosomes. Homologs <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 have been identified {{in a wide variety of}} eukaryotes, including plants, animals, and humans. We now show that Pot 1 plays dual roles in telomere length regulation and chromosome end protection. Using a series <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 truncation mutants, we have defined distinct areas of the protein required for chromosome stability and for limiting access to telomere ends by telomerase. We provide evidence that a large portion <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> 1, including the N-terminal DNA binding domain and amino acids close to the C terminus, is essential for its protective function. C-terminal Pot 1 fragments were found to exert a dominant-negative effect by displacing endogenous Pot 1 from telomeres. Reducing telomere-bound Pot 1 in this manner resulted in dramatic lengthening of the telomere tract. Upon further reduction <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> 1 at telomeres, the opposite phenotype was observed: loss of telomeric DNA and chromosome end fusions. Our results demonstrate that cells must carefully regulate the amount <b>of</b> telomere-bound <b>Pot</b> 1 to differentiate between allowing access to telomerase and catastrophic loss of telomeres...|$|R

500|$|Chapter five, [...] "Survivals, revivals and reinterpretations", {{continues}} Merrifield's {{exploration of}} ritual practices in Christian Europe. He examines Late- and Post-Medieval items {{that have been}} deposited in rivers, including swords and pilgrimage souvenirs, speculating that their deposition might represent a survival from the pagan tradition of casting votive offerings into water. He speculates that the contemporary practice of throwing a coin into a fountain for good luck is a further survival of the custom. He then discusses the evidence for ritual foundation deposits under buildings, noting the widespread Medieval deposition of an animal's head or jaw in a construction's foundations, presumably for protective magical purposes. Proceeding {{to deal with the}} Late- and Post-Medieval deposition <b>of</b> <b>pots</b> under foundations, he looks at their place in churches, where it was believed that they aided the acoustics. Continuing with this theme, he discusses the British folk custom of burying a horse's head under the floor to improve a building's acoustics, speculating as to whether this was a survival of the pagan foundation deposit custom. Rounding off the chapter, Merrifield examines at magical items that have been intentionally placed in the walls, chimneys and roofs of buildings in Britain, in particular the widespread use of dead cats and old shoes.|$|E
