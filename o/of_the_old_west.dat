5|$|The jackalope can {{imitate the}} human voice, {{according}} to legend. During the days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>West,</b> when cowboys {{gathered by the}} campfires singing at night, jackalopes could be heard mimicking their voices or singing along, usually as a tenor. It is said that jackalopes, the rare Lepus antilocapra, only breed during lightning flashes and that their antlers make the act difficult despite the hare's reputation for fertility.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>West,</b> tales tended to grow with {{repeated}} telling, {{and a single}} fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion.

5|$|Reception for {{individual}} elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed {{sufficient for the}} needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by ANN and Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen {{just for the sake of}} coolness, while IGN liked the mixture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>west,</b> arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag, both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes.|$|E
