5|$|After the Philippines fell to Japanese {{forces in}} 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army urged farmers to grow hemp fiber and tax stamps for {{cultivation}} were issued to farmers. Without {{any change in}} the Marihuana Tax Act, over 400,000 acres of hemp were cultivated between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957. New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act, started the LaGuardia Commission that in 1944 contradicted the earlier reports <b>of</b> <b>addiction,</b> madness, and overt sexuality.|$|E
5|$|If {{the pain}} is still not managed adequately, short term use of opioids such as {{morphine}} may be useful. These medications carry a risk <b>of</b> <b>addiction,</b> may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have {{a greater risk of}} side effects, including dizziness, nausea, and constipation. The effect of long term use is unknown. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain.|$|E
40|$|The model <b>of</b> <b>addictions</b> was {{changing}} over time. Previously, addctions were understood {{according to a}} single pharmacological model based on the phenomena of tolerance and pharmaco-dependence induced by drugs like alcohol and opiates. Today, our understanding <b>of</b> <b>addictions</b> moved to a progressive dysregulation of brain regions called "reward system", inducing progressively major behavioral modifications. This concept is integrated into the bio-psycho-social model <b>of</b> <b>addictions</b> and <b>of</b> their treatment. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeDespite {{significant}} {{advances in}} our understanding of the biological bases <b>of</b> <b>addictions,</b> these disorders continue to represent a huge public health burden that is associated with substantial personal suffering. Efforts to target <b>addictions</b> require consideration <b>of</b> how the improved biological understanding <b>of</b> <b>addictions</b> may lead to improved prevention, treatment, and policy initiatives. MethodIn this article, we provide a narrative review of current biological models for addictions with a goal of placing existing data and theories within a translational and developmental framework targeting the advancement of prevention, treatment, and policy strategies. ResultsData regarding individual differences, intermediary phenotypes, and main and interactive influences of genetic and environmental contributions in the setting of developmental trajectories that may be influenced by addictive drugs or behavior indicate complex underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>addictions.</b> ConclusionsConsideration and further elucidation of the biological etiologies <b>of</b> <b>addictions</b> hold significant potential for making important gains and reducing the public health impact <b>of</b> <b>addictions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Research in {{the field}} <b>of</b> <b>addiction</b> {{medicine}} has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. Addiction is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving {{various parts of the}} brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.|$|E
5|$|In late 1996, {{after more}} than five years <b>of</b> <b>addiction</b> to heroin, Frusciante quit it cold turkey. However, months later he was still unable to break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol. In January 1998, urged by {{longtime}} friend Bob Forrest, Frusciante checked into Las Encinas, a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, to begin a full recovery. Upon arrival, he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants. He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms. About a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas and re-entered society.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk <b>of</b> <b>addiction</b> due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E

25|$|Both high RD and RI {{individuals}} {{are found to}} have difficulty in making decisions that have future consequences. Individuals high in RD experience greater reinforcement when initially engaging in the addictive behaviour, and experience stronger conditioned associations with continued use. Individuals high in RI experience greater difficulty resisting cravings {{even in the face}} of negative consequences. Some moderators of RD and RI on the severity <b>of</b> <b>addiction</b> are stress and negative affect (such as feeling depressed). That is, individuals high in RD/RI who also experience high levels of negative affect or stress, present more severe addictive behaviours. For example, if an individual is experiencing emotional distress, the distress experienced may lessen impulse control if they believe that engaging in addictive behaviour will decrease negative affect. According to this model, adolescents who are high in RI are at greater risk for developing addictions. Interestingly, low RI has been shown to moderate some of the risk <b>of</b> <b>addiction</b> due to family history. High RI for individual without a family history <b>of</b> <b>addiction</b> has been related to poor decision-making.|$|E

25|$|A general {{inability}} to control affective states may impair the conditioning of behaviour associated with rewards and punishment, may increase susceptibility to biasing by substance-related cues, and could tax self-regulatory capacity. Such conditions may render individuals unable to interrupt automatic drug-seeking behaviours. Abnormal levels {{of positive and}} negative affect can be increased by low effortful control. For example, high positive affect may interact with low effortful control in increasing risk <b>of</b> <b>addiction</b> amongst vulnerable populations.|$|E
25|$|Opioids {{are not a}} {{first-line}} {{treatments for}} neuropathic pain. Reviews have found little evidence supporting their effectiveness in chronic pain conditions (defined as pain lasting longer than 3 months). In some cases, opioids may contribute to a worsening of pain, leading to a cycle of taking more opioids to treat a condition that the medication itself has made worse. Due to the risk <b>of</b> <b>addiction</b> or diversion, opioids should be used only in appropriate individuals and under close medical supervision.|$|E
