500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he can do and what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed <b>out</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E

500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself <b>out</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series {{debuted in}} an hour-long format, but {{was put on}} hiatus {{only a few weeks}} into the season. CBS had moved the series to Saturday nights, which led to falling ratings. [...] When The Twilight Zone {{returned}} in December, the episodes were half-hour shows, and generally contained only one story. [...] The series was cancelled by February, with remaining episodes being aired over the summer as hour-long multi-story episodes. [...] Season 2 only ran for 11 episodes; several of the unproduced episodes would be filmed for season 3. In regard to writing for the episode [...] "The Girl I Married", J. M. DeMatteis commented [...] "I have a feeling that the show that appears will not bear much relation to what I wrote. What I've found <b>out</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this season—unlike last, where the script was pretty much regarded as sacrosanct—the network is really interfering a lot. [...] Regardless, I know I did a good job and it was a real satisfying experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nightingale {{suggested}} that the storyline [...] "echoed" [...] the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted {{to make her own}} decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a [...] "subtle" [...] reinforcement of an [...] "underlying implication" [...] that women should be punished for exercising their legal right. She comments, [...] "I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment – such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'. Had the Natalie presented been a confused or uncertain woman, her change of heart would have seemed infinitely more credible, but she was neither. In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point – and the only one I can dig <b>out</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure – come on, what do you know?".|$|E

50|$|The Nova was {{important}} for science because {{it was one of}} the first to be observed in multiple wavelength bands including, infrared, visible, ultra-violet, and radio.

2500|$|Other {{scenes in}} the play have also been {{identified}} as offering possible evidence of co-authorship. For example, the opening lines of Act 1, Scene 2 have been argued to show clear evidence of Nashe's hand. The scene begins with Charles proclaiming, [...] "Mars his true moving – even as in the heavens/So in the earth – to this day is not known" [...] (I.ii.1–2). Some critics believe that this statement is paraphrased in Nashe's later pamphlet Have with You to Saffron-Walden (1596), which contains the line, [...] "You are as ignorant as the astronomers are in the true movings of Mars, which to this day, they never could attain to." [...] The problem with this theory however, as Michael Hattaway has pointed <b>out,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{there is no reason}} as to why Nashe could not simply be paraphrasing a play he had no involvement in—a common practice in Elizabethan literature. Shakespeare and Marlowe, for example, often paraphrased each another's plays.|$|E
2500|$|What the {{principle}} of relativity points <b>out</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> correct mathematical calculations can be made regardless of the reference frame chosen, and these will all agree with each other as to the predictions of actual motions of bodies with respect to each other. [...] It {{is not necessary to}} choose the object in the solar system with the largest gravitational field as the center of the coordinate system in order to predict the motions of planetary bodies, though doing so may make calculations easier to perform or interpret. [...] A geocentric coordinate system can be more convenient when dealing only with bodies mostly influenced by the gravity of the Earth (such as artificial satellites and the Moon), or when calculating what the sky will look like when viewed from Earth (as opposed to an imaginary observer looking down on the entire solar system, where a different coordinate system might be more convenient).|$|E
2500|$|As the {{detention}} nears its end, the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone and John {{returns to the}} storage closet to fool Vernon into thinking he has not left. Brian writes the essay and leaves it in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. As the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and Bender. Allison rips Andrew's state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep, and Claire gives Bender one of her diamond earrings, which he attaches to his earlobe. Vernon reads the essay (read by Brian in voice-over), in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are, using simple definitions and stereotypes. One by one, the five students' voices add, [...] "But what we found <b>out</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{each one of us}} is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal." [...] Brian signs the letter as [...] "The Breakfast Club." [...] Bender raises his fist in triumph as he walks across the school football field toward home.|$|E
5000|$|After, {{teams had}} {{to search for}} their next clue.

60|$|On {{the bank}} were {{gathered}} {{a company of}} some fifty men.

60|$|The old custom (now gone <b>out)</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> farmers {{should send}} their men {{to church on}} Good Friday. They used all to appear in their rough dirty smock frocks {{and go back to}} work again. Some (of whom it would never have been expected) would fast all day.|$|R
2500|$|If a fielder {{uses the}} ball to remove the bails from either set of stumps whilst the batsmen are running between the wickets (or {{otherwise}} away from the crease {{during the course of}} play), then the batsman (striker or non-striker) is out. The batsman nearest the set of stumps from which the bails were removed, but not actually in safe territory, is given out. If the batsman has any part of his body or his bat (if he is holding it) on the ground behind the line of the crease, then he cannot be run out (except if both batsmen are {{on the same side of}} a crease) i.e. on the line is considered as out; frequently it is a close call whether or not a batsman gained his ground in this way before the bails were removed. (The difference between stumped and run <b>out</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the wicket-keeper may stump a batsman who goes too far forward to play the ball (assuming he isn't attempting a run), whilst any fielder, including the keeper, may run out a batsman who goes too far for any other purpose, including for taking a run.) [...] If the bails have already been removed, a fielder can remove a remaining stump by pulling it out or hit out the stump (ensure that the stump is fully out of ground) from the ground with the ball in their hands. [...] A fielder can also [...] "remake" [...] the stumps and remove a stump/bail to effect a run out.|$|E

60|$|The first {{facts to}} come <b>out</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> many crops <b>were</b> ruined already, but, {{owing to the}} {{increased}} acreage that year, a fair yield <b>was</b> expected; <b>that</b> wheat in the Bend would be a failure, though some farmers here and there would harvest well; that the lumber districts were not operating, {{on account of the}} I.W.W.|$|R
50|$|X-Ray Spex' {{instrumental}} lineup {{featured a}} saxophonist, {{unusual for a}} punk band. What made the woodwind player particularly stand <b>out</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> a girl, Susan Whitby, just 16 years old as of mid-1977.

5000|$|Although Sterling won, both Gabrielle and Stephen were criticised {{over their}} {{performance}} on the task; neither made any sales, while they also demonstrated rudeness during the event and failed to ask their corporate client crucial questions, particularly about their budget.
