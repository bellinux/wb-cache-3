5|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Hardcore Intergender match, as Edge and Mick Foley faced Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer. The rivalry started between Edge and Foley, when the two faced in a Hardcore match at WrestleMania 22. Edge won the match after a spear off the apron and through a flaming table on the outside. Foley was a guest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> on the May 1, 2006 episode of Raw, and the two agreed to a WrestleMania Hardcore rematch the {{following}} week. Before the match began on the May 8, 2006 edition of Raw, Foley announced that the match was now a triple threat match, with Tommy Dreamer added as the third person. During the match, however, Foley turned heel {{for the first time}} in over eight years and attacked Dreamer with a barbed wire baseball bat. Foley handed Edge the bat and Edge hit Dreamer with it, busting him open. Foley hit the Mandible claw on Dreamer and Edge simultaneously speared Dreamer, with Foley getting the pinfall. The two, along with Lita celebrated up the entrance ramp. On the May 15, 2006 episode of Raw, Foley wanted to apologize to Dreamer for what happened the previous week; however, Dreamer was not in the arena, so Foley brought out Terry Funk. Funk asked Foley to apologize for what happened to Dreamer. Instead, Foley started bashing ECW. In an attempt to get into a fight with Foley, Funk made comments about Foley's family, calling his wife a whore and his kids s. When the two exchanged punches, Edge and Lita came out, with Lita low-blowing Funk. Edge and Foley double-teamed Funk, with Edge hitting Funk with a barbed wire baseball bat. A week later, on the May 22, 2006 edition of Raw, Edge and Foley announced themselves as co-holders of the WWE Hardcore Championship. Paul Heyman came out and made a challenge to Edge and Foley to face Funk and Dreamer at One Night Stand, which Edge accepted. The two, along with Lita, went after Heyman up the ramp, before Dreamer and Funk attacked them with several weapons, sending the trio out of the arena. On the WWE vs. ECW Head to Head special that aired on June 7, 2006, Edge faced Dreamer in an Extreme Rules match. Dreamer hit Edge with a Dreamer Driver through the table. Lita interfered, and hit Dreamer repeatedly with a cane. Dreamer was not hurt by the shots, and he got Lita up for a powerbomb, before Edge speared Dreamer. Edge got the pinfall and won the match. During the match, Foley and Funk were fighting outside the ring, with Funk busting Foley open. After the match, Foley sat in the middle of the ring and stated his kayfabe thoughts on ECW.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of titanium alloys are increasingly seen at aerospace, marine, bio-medical and precision engineering {{due to its}} high strength to weight ratio and high temperature properties. However, while machining the titanium alloys using solid carbide tools, even with jet infusion of coolant lower tool life was vividly seen. The high temperatures generated at the tool–work interface causes adhesion of work-material <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> edges; hence, shorter tool life was reported. To reduce the high tool–work interface temperature positive rake angle, higher primary relief and higher secondary relief were configured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball nose end-mill <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> However, after an initial working period, the growth of flank wear facilitates higher cutting forces followed by work-material adhesion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> Therefore, {{it is important to}} blend the strength, sharpness and surface integrity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> so that <b>the</b> ball nose end mill would demonstrate an extended tool-life. Presently, validation of tool geometry is very tedious as it requires extensive machining experiments. This paper illustrates a new feature-based ball-noseend-mill–work interface model with correlations to the material removal mechanisms by which the tool geometry optimization becomes easier. The data are further deployed to develop a multi-sensory feature extraction/correlation model to predict the performance using wavelet analysis and Wagner Ville distribution. Conclusively, this method enables to evaluate the different ball nose end mill geometry and reduces the product development cycle time...|$|R

In this process, chip formation is realized by a combined rotation of the workpiece and <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> tool. Due to its special kinematics, turn milling offers potential for cutting of difficult-to-machine materials, such as particle reinforced aluminium matrix composites. The heterogeneous microstructure of these materials with comparatively soft matrix and hard ceramic particles causes high dynamic loads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> have to withstand the highly abrasive effect of the hard particles.
