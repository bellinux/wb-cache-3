5|$|There is no {{laboratory}} test for serotonin syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is by symptom observation and {{investigation of the}} patient's history. Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The first rigorously evaluated criteria were introduced in 1991 by Harvey Sternbach, a professor <b>of</b> <b>psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> UCLA. Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, which have better sensitivity and specificity, 84% and 97%, respectively, {{when compared with the}} gold standard of diagnosis by a medical toxicologist.

The study compared paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor marketed as Paxil and Seroxat, with imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant marketed as Tofranil, in teenagers aged 12–18 with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder of at least eight weeks duration.

25|$|Study 329 was a {{clinical}} trial conducted in North America from 1994 to 1998 to study the efficacy of paroxetine, an SSRI anti-depressant, in treating 12- to 18-year-olds diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Led by Martin Keller, then professor <b>of</b> <b>psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> Brown University, and funded by the British pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham—known since 2000 as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)—the study compared paroxetine with imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and placebo (an inert pill). SmithKline Beecham had released paroxetine in 1991, marketing it as Paxil in North America and Seroxat in the UK. The drug attracted sales of $11.7billion in the United States alone from 1997 to 2006, including $2.12billion in 2002, the year before it lost its patent.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, {{learning}} of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term antidepressant to describe its action. A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head <b>of</b> <b>psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his pulmonology colleagues at Cochin Hospital. In 1952 (before Lurie and Salzer), Delay, with the resident Jean-Francois Buisson, reported {{the positive effect of}} isoniazid on depressed patients. The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of diamine oxidase, coupled with a weak inhibition of monoamine oxidase A.|$|E
