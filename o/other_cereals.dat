5|$|In {{order of}} area planted, the arable crops grown in Wales were: foods for stock-feeding, spring barley, wheat, maize, winter barley, <b>other</b> <b>cereals</b> for combining, oilseed rape, {{potatoes}} and other crops. The grassland was predominantly permanent pasture, with only 10% of the grassland being under five years old. Compared with {{other parts of}} the United Kingdom, Wales has the smallest percentage of arable land (6%), and a considerably smaller area of rough grazing and hill land than Scotland (27% against 62%).|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the ruff’s diet consists almost exclusively {{of the adults}} and larva of terrestrial and aquatic insects such as beetles and flies. On migration and during the winter, the ruff eats insects (including caddis flies, water-beetles, mayflies and grasshoppers), crustaceans, spiders, molluscs, worms, frogs, small fish, and also the seeds of rice and <b>other</b> <b>cereals,</b> sedges, grasses and aquatic plants. Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site. Green aquatic plant material, spilt rice and maize, flies and beetles were found, along with varying amounts of grit. On the main wintering grounds in West Africa, rice is a favoured food during the later part of the season as the ricefields dry out.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, {{he married}} Maria Francisca Cabrera y Saavedra, his cousin. Francisca was rich, {{and it is}} likely that it was an {{arranged}} marriage. They had three sons, Diego, Mariano and Manuel. Francisca died in 1798. Saavedra began his political career in 1797, working at the Buenos Aires Cabildo, assuming various administrative roles. By then, the city had become the capital of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata. His first political appointment was as fourth alderman, and third alderman the following year. In 1801, he was appointed Mayor of First Vote. That same year he married his second wife, Doña Saturnina Otárola del Rivero. In 1805, he was appointed to the position of Grain manager, within a local governmental body that dealt with the provision of wheat and <b>other</b> <b>cereals</b> in the city. It is considered that Saavedra supported the proposals of Manuel Belgrano at the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, which promoted agriculture, education and industrialization, but there is no definitive evidence of it.|$|E

50|$|Digitaria exilis holds high {{nutritional}} value to humans. It contains methionine and cysteine, two amino acids {{that are important}} to human survival. These two amino acids, however, are lacking in wheat, rice, maize, and <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> crops. Moving from the amino acid level to the macromolecule level, D. exilis, compared to <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> crops, has greater protein, carbohydrate, and fiber content. Digitaria exilis has more protein and fiber content than rice. Additionally, D. exilis has more carbohydrate content than millet, sorghum, and maize. Therefore, the nutritional benefit from D. exilis outweighs the nutritional benefits from <b>other</b> similar <b>cereal</b> crops.|$|R

25|$|Oats {{are best}} grown in {{temperate}} regions. They {{have a lower}} summer heat requirement and greater tolerance of rain than <b>other</b> <b>cereals,</b> such as wheat, rye or barley, so are particularly important in areas with cool, wet summers, such as Northwest Europe and even Iceland. Oats are an annual plant, and can be planted either in autumn (for late summer harvest) or in the spring (for early autumn harvest).|$|E

On the Atlantic coast, where there are extensive plains, olives, citrus fruits, and wine grapes are grown, largely with water supplied by artesian wells. Morocco also produces {{a significant amount of}} illicit hashish, much of which is shipped to Western Europe. Livestock are raised and forests yield cork, cabinet wood, and building materials. Part of the maritime population fishes for its livelihood. Agadir, Essaouira, El Jadida, and Larache are among the important fishing harbors.|$|E
25|$|Phloem of {{pine trees}} {{has been used}} in Finland as a {{substitute}} food in times of famine and even in good years in the northeast. Supplies of phloem from previous years helped stave off starvation in the great famine of the 1860s. Phloem is dried and milled to flour (pettu in Finnish) and mixed with rye to form a hard dark bread, bark bread. The least appreciated was silkko, a bread made only from buttermilk and pettu without any real rye or cereal flour. Recently, pettu has again become available as a curiosity, and some have made claims of health benefits. However, its food energy content is low relative to rye or <b>other</b> <b>cereals.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first people}} in Nord-Trøndelag settled in Flatanger and Leka between 7500 and 6000BCE, and were {{migrating}} northwards along the coast. In {{about the same}} time, people moved upwards along the Trondheimsfjord. The first farmers migrated to Stjørdal before 2000BCE in the Stone Age. Early agriculture was based mostly on animals, which allowed people to remain nomads and combine stockbreeding with gathering. Around 2300 to 2000BCE, the spruce spread into the county, and by 1300 CE, the landscape was dominated by spruce like today. During the early Bronze Age, from 1800 to1000 BCE, the first large graves {{were built in the}} Trondheimsfjord area. The earliest species of cereals grown was barley around 500BCE, which was later supplemented with <b>other</b> <b>cereals.</b>|$|E

25|$|The large 9th-century fortresses {{unearthed}} at Mikulčice {{and other}} places were located in the wider region of {{the confluence of the}} rivers Morava and Danube. Two important trade routes crossed this region in this period, the Danube and the ancient Amber Road, implying that these settlements, all lying on rivers, were important centres of commerce. Finds of tools, raw materials, and semi-manufactured goods show that quarters inhabited by craftsmen also exised in these settlements. The large fortresses were surrounded by a number of small villages where the locals were engaged in agriculture. They cultivated wheat, barley, millet and <b>other</b> <b>cereals,</b> and farmed cattle, pigs, sheep, and horse. Their animals were relatively small: for instance, their horses were not larger than modern Przewalski horses.|$|E
25|$|Subsection 3 {{reveals an}} {{abandonment}} of the cleared areas, the decline of Olea, {{and the spread of}} Pistacia, Pinus brutia and Quercus coccifera (instead of deciduous oak) on formerly cleared land and in the maquis. As {{this is the time of}} the rise of Ionia, the palynological scenario suggests a movement of population from the land to the newly settled or expanded big cities of the Ionian League. Subsection 4 and Baf S6 go on to catalogue the return of the fruit trees, re-clearing the land for pasture, planting of rye and <b>other</b> <b>cereals,</b> ultimate destabilization of the soil through over-use, denudation and acceleration of sedimentation. After the sealing off of the bay to form the lake, population and land use declined to their current low levels around Latmus, but the river valley is cultivated.|$|E
500|$|Some {{species such}} as the fly agaric and {{psilocybin}} mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain. These {{are the focus of}} academic study and intense debate in the field of ethnomycology. In the 1950s, the American banker Robert Gordon Wasson participated in a Mazatec psilocybin mushroom ritual, and wrote an influential but controversial book claiming that the Soma mentioned in the Rigveda was Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric. The mycologist John Ramsbottom however confirmed one element that Allegro later wove into his theory, stating in 1953 that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil fresco in the Plaincourault Chapel depicted Amanita muscaria. The ergot fungi whose sclerotia appear as [...] "black grain" [...] in rye and <b>other</b> <b>cereals</b> are implicated in the witch trials of 17th century Norway. The hallucinations caused by ergotism, with visions of Satan as a black dog or cat, caused people to be accused of witchcraft. People in other cultures such as the Aztecs brewed drinks with ergot, which contains alkaloids based on lysergic acid.|$|E
