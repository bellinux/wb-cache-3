5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ionized in the stomach after oral administration.

The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ionised.
