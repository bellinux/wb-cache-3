40|$|Introduction by series editor]. THE ISSUE OF EQUAL RIGHTS {{between women}} and men—at least in the workplace—has long {{been one of the}} most {{prominent}} examples of "positive integration" in the European Union, and arguably the most far-reaching element of EU social policy. In recent years, the EU’s traditional emphasis on sex equality in the workplace has been supplemented by a commitment to the "mainstreaming" of gender issues, the upgrading of sexual equality as a common objective in the Treaties, and the insertion of a new Treaty provision relating to the principle of nondiscrimination more generally. These and other developments have led some authors to present the EU as a "progressive polity" in its commitment to gender equality and non-discrimination. In this Forum, four authors assess this claim of a "progressive Europe," focusing on the evolution of EU gender policy (Sonia Mazey, Jo Shaw, R. Amy Elman) and the development of a broader policy regarding non-discrimination on the basis of factors such as race, age, and sexual <b>orientation</b> (<b>Mark</b> Bell). Taken together, the essays reveal the impressive legal and constitutional foundations of EU gender and non-discrimination policies, as well as the significant weaknesses of EU policy practice, the problematic relationship between gender and other grounds for discrimination such as race and age, and the difficulty of measuring what constitutes "progress" in the first place...|$|E
40|$|Measuring the {{orientation}} of fold axes is a routine component of field-based structural analysis. Determining the real-space orientations of small-scale folds in drill cores, however, remains a time consuming and often cumbersome task unless the fold axis lies on an exposed plane. We present a method for accurately determining {{the orientation}} of fold axes that do not lie on exposed planes in drill core, provided the core is oriented or can be reoriented using the assumed orientation {{of one of the}} fabrics within it. Two angles that uniquely specify {{the orientation of}} the fold axis with respect to the core are measured. One is the angle between the fold axis and the core axis. The other, measured in a plane perpendicular to core axis, couples the orientation of the fold axis to either a core <b>orientation</b> <b>mark</b> or another fabric of known orientation. The real-space orientation of the fold axis can either be calculated from the two measured angles and the plunge and azimuth of the drill hole or determined using a simple stereonet construction. Measurements are made with respect to the two points of intersection between the fold axis and the outer surface of the core. While this means the technique is best suited for use with a whole core, it has the advantage that fold axes need not lie on exposed planes in the core...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{repeatability}} of an objective image analysis technique to determine intraocular lens (IOL) rotation and centration. SETTING: Six ophthalmology clinics across Europe. METHODS: One-hundred seven patients implanted with Akreos AO aspheric IOLs with <b>orientation</b> <b>marks</b> were imaged. Image quality was rated by a masked observer. The {{axis of rotation}} was determined from a line bisecting the IOL <b>orientation</b> <b>marks.</b> This was normalized for rotation of the eye between visits using the axis bisecting 2 consistent conjunctival vessels or iris features. The center of ovals overlaid to circumscribe the IOL optic edge and the pupil or limbus were compared to determine IOL centration. Intrasession repeatability was assessed in 40 eyes and the variability of repeated analysis examined. RESULTS: Intrasession rotational stability of the IOL was ± 0. 79 degrees (SD) and centration was ± 0. 10 mm horizontally and ± 0. 10 mm vertically. Repeated analysis variability of the same image was ± 0. 70 degrees for rotation and ± 0. 20 mm horizontally and ± 0. 31 mm vertically for centration. Eye rotation (absolute) between visits was 2. 23 ± 1. 84 degrees (10 %> 5 degrees rotation) using one set of consistent conjunctival vessels or iris features and 2. 03 ± 1. 66 degrees (7 %> 5 degrees rotation) using the average of 2 sets (P =. 13). Poorer image quality resulted in larger apparent absolute IOL rotation (r =- 0. 45,P<. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Objective analysis of digital retroillumination images allows sensitive assessment of IOL rotation and centration stability. Eye rotation between images can lead to significant errors if not taken into account. Image quality is important to analysis accuracy...|$|R
30|$|On CT scans, a {{malignant}} lesion is suspected when the margins are ill-defined {{and there is}} extra-thyroid extension, lymph node involvement, or invasion of the surrounding structures. The absence of these features does not exclude malignant tumours, especially papillary, follicular, and medullary thyroid carcinomas (Fig.  3) [1]. Therefore, ultrasound is the modality of choice for thyroid lesion evaluation, due to its superior spatial resolution compared to CT examinations. Sonographic features of malignancy are micro-calcifications, acoustic shadowing, anti-parallel <b>orientation,</b> <b>marked</b> hypoechogenicity, irregular or microlobulated margins, and increased vascularity. CT scans lack the ability to detect these reliable sonographic signs of malignancy. Therefore, further management of ITNs, if required, usually begins with thyroid ultrasound and FNA should be considered according to the ultrasound findings [4, 12 – 15].|$|R

In this paper, we present a novel method for OF estimation that uses traced ridge and valley lines. This approach provides robustness against disturbances caused, e. g. by scars, contamination, moisture or dryness of the finger.

The performance of the line-sensor method is compared with the gradients based method and a multiscale directional operator. Its robustness is tested in experiments with simulated scar noise which is drawn on top of good quality fingerprint images from the FVC 2000 and FVC 2002 databases.

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that, {{when it comes}} to foreign policy, individuals have general orientations that inform their beliefs toward more specific issues in international relations. But such studies evade an even more important question: what gives rise to such foreign-policy orientations in the first place? Combining an original survey on a nationally representative sample of Americans with Schwartz’s theory of values from political psychology, we show that people take foreign policy personally: the same basic values that people use to guide choices in their daily lives also travel to the domain of foreign affairs. Conservation values are most strongly linked to “militant internationalism,” a general hawkishness in international relations. The value of universalism is the most important value for predicting “cooperative internationalism,” the foreignpolicy <b>orientation</b> <b>marked</b> by a preference for multilateralism and cosmopolitanism in international affairs. This relatively parsimonious and elegant system of values and foreign-policy beliefs is consistent across both high- and low-knowledge respondents, offering one potential explanation for why those people who are otherwise uninformed about world politics nonetheless express coherent foreign-policy beliefs...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristic}} discriminant {{of contemporary}} societies, particularly in economically developed countries, is, {{on the one}} hand, the expansion of consumerism in various spheres {{of economic and social}} life, while on the other hand, it is the attempt to restrict excessive consumption.

In the search for answers to this question, the orientation towards excessive consumption that is stimulated by the ideology of consumerism and deconsumption as a protest against consumerism have been placed under analysis. In analysing the ideology of consumerism, the main styles of consumerism have been indicated as follows: consumption of pleasures, compulsive consumption and symbolic consumption. In contrast to the behaviour associated with over-consumption, the behaviour in pursuit of the restriction of the consumption of goods indirectly connected with actual needs has been described, namely sustainable consumption and anti-consumption, as well as the voluntary simplicity movement in consumption...|$|R
25|$|Attachment theory also postulates {{that all}} humans possess an innate {{attachment}} behavioural system that motivates them to seek proximity to a caregiver (also called an attachment figure) {{during times of}} threat or need. Caregiving behaviour is therefore complimentary to attachment behaviour. Furthermore, attachment theory argues that {{the effectiveness of the}} caregiving behaviour enacted determines the quality of the attachment bond between the caregiver and care-recipient, as well as shapes the care-recipient’s general expectations of social support. In this model, a history of receiving effective care from intimate others (whether parents in childhood or romantic partners in adulthood) promotes a sense of attachment security – an interpersonal orientation characterized by the expectation that other people may be relied on for support, and subsequent comfort with intimacy and emotional closeness. In contrast, a history of interactions with cold or rejecting caregivers promotes attachment avoidance – an interpersonal <b>orientation</b> <b>marked</b> by discomfort with intimacy, a reluctance to rely on others for support, and the tendency to suppress emotional distress. Care that is inconsistent or intrusive is believed to foster attachment anxiety, which is characterized by excessive preoccupation with intimate relationships and inability to effectively regulate one’s own emotional distress.|$|R

30|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} {{positioning of the}} vehicle along the test route is still a challenge since each of the used technologies has advantages and disadvantages. Optical positioning (cameras, stereo cameras, Lidar) requires visible <b>orientation</b> <b>marks</b> (e.g. road markers) or an optical reference map (e.g. LIDAR). In addition to the elaborate recording and maintenance of these reference data, driving environments with (partly) missing or insufficient road markings (along the test route in Koppl) and (partly) missing reference objects (e.g. along meadows or in tunnels) are problematic. Therefore, optical positioning works only for parts of the test route in Koppl (along the short route in the village centre), while {{it does not work}} reliably for the parts with missing reference objects. Multi-GNSS Real-time Kinematics (RTK) is a suitable technology to obtain centimetre-accurate positions using satellite positioning [17]. The prerequisite for centimetre-accurate GNSS-positioning is a reliable correction signal from a near GNSS reference base. This signal is transmitted either via mobile radio (3 G/ 4 G) from an Internet-based correction service (e.g. APOS service in Austria) or as in Koppl from a local reference station (e.g. via UHF frequencies) due to missing reliability of the mobile radio connection on parts of the route.|$|R

Since 1990 s the past has been radically changed, reinvented and revisioned in newly formed Balkan states in order to initiate new development towards the national capitalism. The changing of the past was rather patchy in Serbia. While the Serbian opposition in 1990 s (similarly to ruling elites in other newly founded states) has reconciled quickly its vision of the past to the new image of national capitalism, the radical changes in official statements about the past happened only after the 2000.

At 100 Å 2, the SDS surfactant forms a homogeneous monolayer because it is in the liquid-condensed region of the surface pressure phase diagram. The rotation dynamics is slower than at the neat air/water interface, where the in-plane orientational time constant is 304 (8 ps and the out-of-plane reorientational time constant is 336 (6 ps.

Methods: After implantation in 1 eye of patients, IOLs with <b>orientation</b> <b>marks</b> were imaged at 1 to 2 days, 7 to 14 days, 30 to 60 days, and 120 to 180 days. The axis of rotation and IOL centration were objectively assessed using validated image analysis. Results: The study enrolled 107 patients {{with a mean age of}} 69. 9 years ± 7. 7 (SD). The image quality was sufficient for IOL rotation analysis in 91 % of eyes. The mean rotation between the first day postoperatively and 120 to 180 days was 1. 93 ± 2. 33 degrees, with 96 % of IOLs rotating fewer than 5 degrees and 99 % rotating fewer than 10 degrees. There was no significant rotation between visits and no clear bias in the direction of rotation. In 71 % of eyes, the dilation and image quality was sufficient for image analysis of centration. The mean change in centration between 1 day and 120 to 180 days was 0. 21 ± 0. 11 mm, with all IOLs decentering less than 0. 5 mm. There was no significant decentration between visits and no clear bias in the direction of the decentration.
