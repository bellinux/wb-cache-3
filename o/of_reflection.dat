5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E
5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia.

In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination.|$|E

5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{argued that}} light is {{composed}} of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light {{to account for the}} interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons, and the idea of wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E
30|$|However, some {{participants}} were rarely {{in a negative}} mood, reducing the average number <b>of</b> <b>reflections</b> completed for the Congruent Negative group, but increasing it for the Incongruent Negative group (Incongruent Negative: M =  12.62, SD =  2.43, Congruent Negative: M =  6.97, SD =  4.48). We therefore examined whether overall differences in number <b>of</b> <b>reflections</b> affected results. To provide greater homogeneity in number <b>of</b> <b>reflections,</b> we excluded Congruent Negative participants who completed fewer reflections than one standard deviation from the mean. Incongruent Negative participants who completed more reflections than one standard deviation from the mean were also removed. An independent t test comparing Incongruent Negative to Congruent Negative on number <b>of</b> <b>reflections</b> showed {{that there were no}} differences in number <b>of</b> <b>reflections</b> after these participants were removed, t(40) =  1.62, p = . 11 (Incongruent Negative: M =  11.48, SD =  2.15, Congruent Negative: M =  10.26, SD =  2.73). As above, we ran a MANOVA on the change in survey scores after removing the atypical reflectors. We again found no significant main effects or interactions.|$|R
50|$|The {{topology}} of {{the light}} path {{was that of a}} Sagnac interferometer with an odd number <b>of</b> <b>reflections.</b> Sagnac interfometers offer excellent contrast and fringe stability, and the configuration with an odd number <b>of</b> <b>reflections</b> is only slightly less stable than the configuration with an even number <b>of</b> <b>reflections.</b> (With an odd number <b>of</b> <b>reflections,</b> the oppositely traveling beams are laterally inverted with respect to each other over most {{of the light}} path, so that the topology deviates slightly from strict common path.) The relative immunity of his apparatus to vibration, mechanical stress and temperature effects, allowed Hammar to detect fringe displacements as little as 1/10 of a fringe, despite using the interferometer outdoors in an open environment with no temperature control.|$|R

5|$|Spielberg and Williams both {{watched a}} rough cut of the film to {{determine}} what scenes would have music.

5|$|Animators created digital {{versions}} of the battle suits, at times with the soldiers inside them. On the set a 3D scanner booth digitized the actors, while hand scanners captured the textures of the practical suits. Imageworks received pieces of the suits for reference. The company's library <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> data on various materials helped enhance the armor's shading. SPI's crew created the base at Heathrow by merging the set at Leavesden with digitally altered footage from the airport; the film's drop ships, barracks and mess halls, replaced the existing aircraft. Framestore created the digital Paris and recreated it with photomodeling from three days of visits. Given {{that the city is}} a no-fly zone, Framestore's artists obtained their aerial images by climbing an 80-meter crane parked in the Louvre courtyard. The quadcopter dropships were based on the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that can tilt its rotors to fly as either planes or helicopters, while having a design closer to the Quad TiltRotor. Aside from the crashed ship on the beachhead and a gimbal set to depict the plane used by Cage's squad, the film used digital models for most ships. The computer-generated dropships had some of Imageworks' heaviest detail given the proximity of the actors to the aircraft in the camp scenes; the effects artists wanted to make sure the ships broke apart in a realistic way during the crashes.|$|E

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{imaging radar}} {{polarimeter}} data for unsupervised classification of scattering behavior is described by comparing the polarization properties of each pixel in a image to that of simple classes of scattering such as even number <b>of</b> <b>reflections,</b> odd number <b>of</b> <b>reflections,</b> and diffuse scattering. For example, when this algorithm is applied to data acquired over the San Francisco Bay area in California, it classifies scattering by the ocean as being similar to that predicted by the class of odd number <b>of</b> <b>reflections,</b> scattering by the urban area as being similar to that predicted by the class of even number <b>of</b> <b>reflections,</b> and scattering by the Golden Gate Park as being similar to that predicted by the diffuse scattering class. It also classifies the scattering by a lighthouse in the ocean and boats on the ocean surface as being similar to that predicted by the even number <b>of</b> <b>reflections</b> class, {{making it easy to}} identify these objects against the background of the surrounding ocean. The algorithm is also applied to forested areas and shows that scattering from clear-cut areas and agricultural fields is mostly similar to that predicted by the odd number <b>of</b> <b>reflections</b> class, while the scattering from tree-covered areas generally is classified as being a mixture of pixels exhibiting the characteristics of all three classes, although each pixel is identified with only a single class...|$|R

25|$|The result {{obtained}} for R depends {{only on the}} ratio E/V0. This seems superficially to violate the correspondence principle, since we obtain a finite probability <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> regardless {{of the value of}} Planck's constant or the mass of the particle. For example, we seem to predict that when a marble rolls {{to the edge of a}} table, there can be a large probability that it is reflected back rather than falling off. Consistency with classical mechanics is restored by eliminating the unphysical assumption that the step potential is discontinuous. When the step function is replaced with a ramp that spans some finite distance w, the probability <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> approaches zero in the limit , where k is the wavenumber of the particle.|$|E
