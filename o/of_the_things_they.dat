500|$|... "Homer Loves Flanders" [...] was {{the last}} episode to be pitched by Conan O'Brien before he left The Simpsons. David Richardson was {{assigned}} to write it, and Wesley Archer to direct it. Richardson wrote the episode at a Motel 6 in Hemet, California while he was dating an actress who was shooting a film there. In this season, the staff {{wanted to take a}} deeper look at the relationships of the characters. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> wanted to explore in particular was what Homer and Flanders have in common and how they could turn into friends. Former show runner David Mirkin enjoyed making Homer and Flanders get along because they do not normally act that way.|$|E
500|$|As {{the season}} progressed, the ratings declined, greatly hurting the show's {{chances of being}} renewed. Writer John McNamara {{partially}} blamed Briscos low ratings on its [...] He said not many people watch television at that time, so [...] "fighting for numbers" [...] then was [...] "like being stuck on Normandy beach". Grushaw acknowledged the high quality of the show and the vocal support from its small fan base. [...] "Obviously the viewers are very passionate about the show... and when you read some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> have to say, it gives you real pause", Grushaw told USA Today in 1994. By May of that year, Grushaw said renewing Brisco was a 50–50 call. At {{the end of its}} season, Brisco was one of the lowest rated shows of the year, and Fox confirmed its cancellation in June.|$|E

Later, Liz reveals that she has a Life Alert Emergency Response necklace; this necklace helps the elderly contact emergency services in case of an accident. Carol wonders why Geico—an auto insurance company—has multiple mascots, a reference to Geico's advertising campaigns. Jack plans to seduce the gay interior designer that Avery hired and hopes to get the designer to agree with him to leave the apartment the way it is, explaining to Liz [...] "Do you know what a prize I am in the gay community? There's a term for it. I'm a bear. And I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy bear."

500|$|The episode {{features}} former {{poet laureate}} Robert Pinsky as himself. Pinsky {{was chosen to}} guest star because the writers wanted an intellectual reference for Lisa, [...] and because they knew that Pinsky was {{a fan of the}} show, having read an article of The Time in which Pinsky stated that he [...] "admired the writing" [...] of The Simpsons. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Pinsky stated that he flew to the Simpsons recording studios in Los Angeles on September 10, 2001, and, following the September 11 attacks, was [...] "stranded" [...] there for four days, since no planes were flying following the attacks. Pinsky enjoyed his stay however; [...] "Ian [...] and The Simpsons people were very nice to me," [...] he said. [...] "...

500|$|Most nouns {{have one}} or more {{particular}} classifiers associated with them, often depending on the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> denote. For example, many nouns denoting flat objects such as tables, papers, beds, and benches use the classifier (...) zhāng, whereas many long and thin objects use (...) tiáo. The total number of classifiers in Chinese may be put at anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred, depending on how they are counted. The classifier [...] (...) , pronounced gè or ge in Mandarin, apart from being the standard classifier for many nouns, {{also serves as a}} general classifier, which may often (but not always) be used in place of other classifiers; in informal and spoken language, native speakers tend to use this classifier far more than any other, even though they know which classifier is [...] "correct" [...] when asked. Mass-classifiers might be used with all sorts of nouns with which they make sense: for example, hé ("box") may be used to denote boxes of objects, such as lightbulbs or books, even though those nouns would be used with their own appropriate count-classifiers if being counted as individual objects. Researchers have differing views as to how classifier–noun pairings arise: some regard them as being based on innate semantic features of the noun (for example, all nouns denoting [...] "long" [...] objects take a certain classifier because of their inherent longness), while others see them as motivated more by analogy to prototypical pairings (for example, [...] "dictionary" [...] comes to take the same classifier as the more common word [...] "book"). There is some variation in the pairings used, with speakers of different dialects often using different classifiers for the same item. Some linguists have proposed that the use of classifier phrases may be guided less by grammar and more by stylistic or pragmatic concerns {{on the part of a}} speaker who may be trying to foreground new or important information.|$|E

2500|$|The fifth {{step in the}} {{argument}} is that on the world's stage, the [...] "dance of masked people, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> have endowed with an independent power to act and relate" [...] leads to pervasive human alienation (the estrangement of people from themselves, and from others in contacts which have become impersonal and functional). It durably distorts human consciousness at the very least, and at worst it completely deforms human consciousness. It mystifies the real nature, and the real relationships, among people and things – even {{to the point where they}} can hardly be conceived anymore as they really are.|$|E
2500|$|Bourdieu also {{describes}} how the [...] "scholastic point of view" [...] unconsciously alters how scientists approach their objects of study. Because of the systematicity of their training and their mode of analysis, they tend to exaggerate the systematicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> study. This inclines them to see agents following clear rules where in fact they use less determinate strategies; it {{makes it hard to}} theorise the 'fuzzy' logic of the social world, its practical and therefore mutable nature, poorly described by words like 'system', 'structure' and 'logic' which imply mechanisms, rigidity and omnipresence. The scholar can too easily find themselves mistaking [...] "the things of logic for the logic of things" [...] — a phrase of Marx's which Bourdieu is fond of quoting. Again, reflexivity is recommended as the key to discovering and correcting for such errors which would otherwise remain unseen, mistakes produced by an over-application of the virtues that produced also the truths within which the errors are embedded.|$|E
2500|$|Suárez {{returned}} from his ban on 6 February against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 draw at Anfield; Dalglish reacted to his return by saying [...] "It's fantastic to have him back. He {{should never have been}} out in the first place". Ahead of the 11 February game between United and Liverpool at Old Trafford, the Premier League stated that the formal pre-match handshake would go ahead, Ferguson stated that he thought Evra should shake Suárez's hand, while Dalglish stated that Suárez would too. However, during the traditional pre-game handshakes, Suárez appeared to avoid Evra's hand, leading to Evra grabbing Suárez's arm. Suárez ignored Evra and continued down the line causing Evra to throw his arms up in protest and Rio Ferdinand to also avoid shaking Suárez's hand. Despite Liverpool ordering Suárez not to talk about the racial abuse incident, Suárez continued to discuss it. In May 2012, Suárez called his suspension [...] "strange and unbelievable" [...] and said that there was [...] "not a single convincing proof that [...] had done any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> accused [...] of doing"; he also denied that he had refused to shake Evra's hand. In 2014, Suárez released his autobiography Crossing the Line, in which he continued to deny the verdict that he had racially abused Evra, stating [...] "what some people will never want to accept is that the argument took place in Spanish. I did not use the word [...] "negro" [...] the way it can be used in English", despite admitting that the word [...] "negro" [...] means [...] "black". He also complained about the after-effects, saying the verdict that he was a racist would be [...] "a stain on my character that will probably be there forever".|$|E
