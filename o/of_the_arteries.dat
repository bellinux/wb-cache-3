5|$|First {{collected}} in 1964, it was formally described in 2009. The species {{may be most}} closely related to O.concolor and O.mamorae, which are distributed further north and south in South America. Among other characters, the three share a particular arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> of the head. Virtually nothing is known of its biology.|$|E
5|$|Celsus (25 BC– AD 14) {{described}} ligation and excision procedures, {{and discussed}} the possible complications. Galen advocated severing the connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> to veins, claiming it reduced both {{pain and the}} spread of gangrene. The Susruta Samhita (4th–5th century AD) is similar to the words of Hippocrates, but emphasizes wound cleanliness. In the 13th century, European surgeons such as Lanfranc of Milan, Guy de Chauliac, Henri de Mondeville, and John of Ardene made great progress and development of the surgical techniques.|$|E
5|$|Its closest {{relatives}} may be O.concolor {{from the}} northern Amazon rainforest, including northwestern Brazil, southern Venezuela, and eastern Colombia, and O.mamorae from Bolivia, Paraguay, nearby Brazil, and possibly northeastern Argentina. The three share a particular configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the head known as the derived carotid arterial circulatory pattern, which is unique within the genus Oecomys, and a general similarity in other traits. However, O.sydandersoni differs from the other two in characters of the fur and in metric characters. Whether the three species are truly closely related needs to be determined using molecular data.|$|E
50|$|The device {{utilizes}} a gentle, extravascular deployment method, which avoids cinching or tugging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> {{by placing}} <b>the</b> sealant on <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|R
25|$|Over time, atheromata usually {{progress}} {{in size and}} thickness and induce the surrounding muscular central region (<b>the</b> media) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> to stretch out, termed remodeling, typically just enough to compensate for their size such that <b>the</b> caliber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> opening (lumen) remains unchanged until typically over 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> wall cross-sectional area consists of atheromatous tissue.|$|R
5|$|If <b>the</b> {{dissection}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> {{extends to}} <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> that lies inside the skull, subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur (1% of cases). This arises due to rupture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> and accumulation <b>of</b> blood in <b>the</b> subarachnoid space. It may {{be characterized by}} a different, usually severe headache; it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms.|$|R
5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to {{be located in the}} circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the front}} {{part of the}} palate, do not extend between the molars. The palate ends beyond the third molars and is perforated by posterolateral palatal pits there. Behind it, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa is perforated by poorly developed sphenopalatine vacuities. The auditory bullae, which house the inner ear, are large. Usually, the mastoid bone lacks openings (fenestrae), which are present in T.talamancae. The pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the head is primitive, as indicated by the condition of various foramina (openings) and grooves in the skull.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the neck. The other type, carotid artery dissection, involves the carotid arteries. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E
40|$|Length measurements, nerve-vessel {{relationships}}, and vessel {{relationships to}} articulations and the dura mater {{were examined in}} 65 head and neck halves. <b>The</b> paramedian distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> (midpoint) is a mean of 15. 8 mm on the right, and a mean of 17. 3 mm on the left, in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intervertebral symphysis C 2 -C 3 at <b>the</b> transverse foramen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axis <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> has a paramedian mean distance of 17 mm. After <b>the</b> exit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> from <b>the</b> axis four types of loop formations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axoatlantal part and their occurrences are described. Also, <b>the</b> atlantal part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> was studied: <b>the</b> overlapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atlas was 5. 14 (0 to 13) mm. <b>The</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axoatlantal part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> was a mean of 39 mm, and <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atlantal part was a mean of 44 mm. Besides <b>the</b> measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> branches and anastomoses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> V 3 segment, nerve-vessel and nerve-joint relationships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery,</b> and some veins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> craniocervical junction are described.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>arteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart (<b>the</b> {{coronary}} <b>arteries)</b> are <b>the</b> {{most frequent}} imaging target for IVUS. IVUS {{is used in}} <b>the</b> coronary <b>arteries</b> to determine <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> atheromatous plaque built up at any particular point in <b>the</b> epicardial coronary <b>artery.</b> <b>The</b> progressive accumulation <b>of</b> plaque within <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> wall over decades is the setup for vulnerable plaque which, in turn, leads to heart attack and stenosis (narrowing) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> (known as coronary artery lesions). IVUS is of use to determine both plaque volume within <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> and/or <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> stenosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> lumen. It can be especially useful in situations in which angiographic imaging is considered unreliable; such as for <b>the</b> lumen <b>of</b> ostial lesions or where angiographic images do not visualize lumen segments adequately, such as regions with multiple overlapping arterial segments. It {{is also used to}} assess <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> treatments of stenosis such as with hydraulic angioplasty expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery,</b> with or without stents, and <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> medical therapy over time.|$|R
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E
40|$|Six {{sympathomimetic}} amines {{were used}} to investigate the postulation that the neuronal uptake process determines <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolated perfused rabbit central ear artery to extra- and intraluminally applied noradrenaline and related amines. <b>The</b> <b>artery</b> {{was found to be}} more sensitive to intra- than to extraluminal noradrenaline, but the reverse was true for metaraminol, methoxamine, metanephrine, and isoproterenol. No difference was noted between <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> to intra- and extraluminal phenylephrine. Drugs and procedures which impair the neuronal uptake process appeared to diminish the difference between <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> to extra- and intraluminal noradrenaline, but had little or no effect on <b>the</b> responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> to other amines. These results suggest that the neuronal uptake process is not the sole mechanism determining <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> to intra- and extraluminal sympathomimetic amines...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{developed}} solver <b>of</b> acoustic eld {{was used}} for simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> wall thick-ness examination. It is capable of describing spatial and time-dependent distribution of an ultrasonic beam, that is emitted by a piezoelectric ring transducer and then backscattered on cylindrical surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls in <b>artery</b> models. <b>The</b> electrical signal received corresponds closely with the actual RF signal that is obtained during measurements at <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ultrasonic VED apparatus. <b>The</b> theoretical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> for creating <b>the</b> ultrasonic re-ected echoes was used. <b>The</b> internal radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> model was equal 3 mm for the diastolic pressure and 3. 3 mm for the systolic pressure. The intima-media thickness (IMT) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> wall was changed from 0. 48 mm to 0. 44 mm respectively.

5|$|The Greek {{physician}} Galen (2nd century CE) knew {{blood vessels}} carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, {{concluded that it}} provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through 'pores' between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery {{to the left side}} of the heart and created arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, {{openings}} in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities, which are set far to the front. The condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines. Some openings occur in the mastoid bone.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E

5|$|Compared to E.nitidus and E.macconnelli, {{the skull}} is {{relatively}} small and slender. It has broad and short incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars) and lacks sphenopalatine vacuities which perforate the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate. The animal is similar to other members of the genus in the pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> of the head. The alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone which separates two foramina (openings) in the skull (the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium) is rarely present; its presence is more frequent in E.nitidus. The capsular process, a raising of the bone of the mandible (lower jaw) behind the third molar, houses the back end of the lower incisor in most Euryoryzomys, but is absent in E.emmonsae and E.macconnelli. Traits of the teeth {{are similar to those of}} E.nitidus and other Euryoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest {{to the front and}} is flanked by {{well-developed}} beads at its margins. The zygomatic plate is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the maxillary bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The auditory bullae are large. The condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the head is highly derived. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid process, a process at the back, is well developed and the capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi. The bony palate is long and extends beyond {{the end of the}} molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones. The posterolateral palatal pits, which perforate the palate near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a fossa. The sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, behind the palate) are also small, as are the auditory bullae. As in most oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and foramina (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ten {{randomly}} selected adult cadaveric specimens were dissected to analyse <b>the</b> anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> during its course from the C 3 transverse process to its {{entry into the}} spinal dural canal at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> C 1. In addition, 10 dry cadaveric C 1 -C 2 bones were studied. <b>The</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> and <b>the</b> parameters relevant during surgery {{in the region are}} evaluated. METHODS: Ten adult cadaveric specimens and 10 adult dry cadaveric C 1 and C 2 bones were studied. In five cadaveric specimens, <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins were injected with coloured silicon. <b>The</b> <b>artery</b> during its course from <b>the</b> transverse process <b>of</b> C 3 to <b>the</b> transverse process <b>of</b> C 2 was labelled as V 1 segment, <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> during its course from the C 2 transverse process to the C 1 transverse process was labelled as V 2 segment and <b>the</b> segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> after its exit from <b>the</b> transverse foramen <b>of</b> C 1 to <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> its dural entry was labelled as V 3 segment. <b>The</b> relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> to <b>the</b> C 1 - 2 joint and facets, distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> from <b>the</b> midline, from the C 2 ganglion and from the other surgery related landmarks were evaluated. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> occupancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> into <b>the</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> groove on <b>the</b> inferior surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superior facet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C 2 vertebra, and over <b>the</b> posterior arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atlas was studied. RESULTS: The V 1 segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> takes a varying degree <b>of</b> loop inside <b>the</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> foramen on <b>the</b> inferior aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superior facet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C 2 vertebra. The loop extends towards the midline and was at an average distance of 14. 6 mm from <b>the</b> midline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebral body. The V 2 segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> takes an initial lateral loop after its exit from <b>the</b> transverse process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C 2 vertebra. <b>The</b> average distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> from <b>the</b> lateral end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C 2 ganglion was 7. 2 mm and from the dural tube was 15. 3 mm. <b>The</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> groove in <b>the</b> superior facet <b>of</b> C 2 and the groove over <b>the</b> posterior arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atlas were completely occupied by <b>the</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> only in six sides and in none respectively, suggesting <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamic nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> to <b>the</b> bone. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> adopts a serpentine course in relationship to the C 2 vertebra, making it susceptible to injury during the surgical procedures in the region. <b>The</b> multiple loops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> and a buffer space within <b>the</b> vertebral <b>artery</b> groove on <b>the</b> inferior surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superior facet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C 2 vertebra and over <b>the</b> posterior arch <b>of</b> atlas provide <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> an extra length and space, probably essential to avoid any stretch during neck movements...|$|R

5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short, not extending between the first molars. The posterolateral palatal pits (small openings {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars) are poorly developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back margin of the palate, does not usually reach forward between the maxillaries. Its roof either is wholly ossified or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. Unlike in some other oryzomyines, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two foramina (openings) in the skull, are not separated by an alisphenoid strut. The pattern of grooves and foramina in the skull indicates that the circulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> of the head follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys. Usually, the mastoid bone contains small openings (fenestrations) in T.talamancae, but not in T.bolivaris. In the mandible (lower jaw), the capsular process (a process at the root of the incisor) is weak to absent and the upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and reach their front margin below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, {{openings}} in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars, the usual condition in oryzomyines. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). Sphenopalatine vacuities are usually absent, but {{have been reported in}} some populations. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present.

5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, are short {{and do not}} reach near the first molars; they are longer in T.hylophilus. They are widest where the premaxillary and maxillary bones meet. The palate itself is also short, not extending beyond the third molars, and is broad and lacks ridges or grooves. There are simple posterolateral palatal pits {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, an opening located behind the end of the palate, is broad and its roof is either fully ossified or perforated by small sphenopalatine vacuities where the presphenoid and basisphenoid bones meet. An alisphenoid strut separates two foramina (openings) at the base of the skull, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The pattern of grooves and foramina on the head indicates that the circulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the head of T.ucucha follows the primitive pattern. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, overlaps the suspensory process of the squamosal bone.
