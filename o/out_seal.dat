Initiated by the RCN after the First World War, the patrols were a response to the dangerous waters off Vancouver Island, which were considered part of the Graveyard of the Pacific. In addition to search and rescue patrols, the trawler also carried out fisheries protection work, sometimes seizing US fishing boats that had entered Canadian waters. Thiepval also carried <b>out</b> <b>seal</b> counts as part of the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911. On at least one occasion, she intercepted rum-runners near the Alaska border. In her first few years on the west coast, Thiepval struck rocks twice: in 1920, near Prince Rupert, and in 1921 in Gunboat Passage near Bella Bella, but on both occasions suffered relatively little damage.|$|E

Nothing which the hand of Joan of Arc is known to have touched now remains in existence except a few preciously guarded military and state papers which she signed, her pen being guided by a clerk or her secretary, Louis de Conte. A boulder exists from which she is known to have mounted her horse when she was once setting out upon a campaign. Up to {{a quarter of a century}} ago there was a single hair from her head still in existence. It was drawn through the wax of a seal attached to the parchment of a state document. It was surreptitiously snipped <b>out,</b> <b>seal</b> and all, by some vandal relic-hunter, and carried off. Doubtless it still exists, but only the thief knows where. -- TRANSLATOR.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the first abundance estimate for the world’s northernmost harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) population, which resides in Svalbard, Norway, based on three digital stereoscopic photographic surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010. The counts from these high resolution 3 D images were {{combined with a}} novel method for estimating correction factors for animals {{that were in the}} water {{at the time of the}} surveys, in which extensive behavioural data from radio-tagged harbour seals were used together with age distribution data to estimate the proportion of seals of various age and sex classes hauled out at the times of the surveys. To detect possible seasonal shifts in age distribution between surveys, lengths of hauled <b>out</b> <b>seals</b> were measured from the stereoscopic images. No body-length differences were detected between the surveys; but, this may be due to a high degree of sexual dimorphism exhibited in this population. Applying the modelled correction factors, a total of 1888 (95 % CI: 1660 – 3023), 1742 (1381 – 3549) and 1812 (1656 – 4418) harbour seals were estimated for the surveys flown on 01 August 2009, 01 August 2010 and 19 August 2010, respectively. The similarity between the three survey estimates (despite significant differences in the number of animals actually counted on the photos from each survey effort) suggests that the variation in numbers of hauled <b>out</b> <b>seals</b> is reasonably accurately adjusted for by the haul-out probability model. The low population size, the limited spatial distribution of the population and its reduced genetic diversity make this population vulnerable to chance events, such as disease epidemics...|$|R

It was performed stapedotomy with sudden exit of cerebrospinal fluid after platinotomia, being carried <b>out</b> <b>sealing</b> the oval window fat ear lobe.

50|$|The Citadel forced two {{turnovers}} in {{the first}} quarter, converting both fumbles into touchdowns for a quick 14-0 lead. Georgia Southern scored three touchdowns, while The Citadel kicked a pair of field goals to trail 21-20 late. Thomas Warren kicked a 37-yard field goal for a 23-21 lead with 35 seconds remaining, nearly the identical situation to the 2011 meeting when Warren missed a 37-yard attempt with 13 seconds left which would have won. Georgia Southern returned the ensuing kickoff into Bulldog territory, but missed their own 31-yard field goal attempt as time ran <b>out,</b> <b>sealing</b> The Citadel's win.

He retired Brandon Inge on a pop-up for the last <b>out,</b> <b>sealing</b> the Rangers a second consecutive trip to the World Series. In hitting a postseason record six home runs throughout the series, including two in extra-innings (one being a walk-off grand slam), Nelson Cruz earned the Series MVP award.|$|R
