The objective {{was to determine the}} prevalence of BFRBs among students attending three large medical colleges of Karachi. It is imperative to come up with frequency to design strategies to decrease the burden and adverse effects associated with BFRBs among medical students. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 210 students attending Aga Khan University, Dow Medical College and Sind Medical College, Karachi, in equal proportion. Data were collected using a pre tested tool, “Habit Questionnaire”. Diagnoses were made on the criteria that a student must be involved in an activity 5 times or more per day for 4 weeks or more. Convenience sampling was done to recruit the participants aged 18 years and above after getting written informed consent. Results The overall prevalence of BFRBs was found to be 46 (22 %). For those positive for BFRBs, gender distribution was as follows: females 29 (13. 9 %) and males 17 (8. 1 %). Among these students, 19 (9. 0 %) were engaged in dermatillomania, 28 (13. 3 %) in trichotillomania and 13 (6. 2 %) in <b>onychophagia.</b> Conclusions High proportions of BFRBs are reported among medical students of Karachi.

A previously healthy 8 -year-old male was hospitalized with tachypnea, cough, hypoxemia, and fever of one week's duration. History revealed exposure to pigs on his family's farm in southernmost Louisiana, where the patient was responsible for cleaning the farm's pigpens. His fingernails were soiled and extremely short, {{with the edge of}} the nail bed exposed secondary to <b>onychophagia.</b> Laboratory evaluation demonstrated peripheral eosinophilia (39 %), pulmonary eosinophilia (86 %), high total IgE, diffuse reticulonodular lung opacities, and mixed obstructive and restrictive pulmonary function pattern.

40|$|Nail tic {{disorders}} are classic examples of overlap between {{the domains of}} dermatology and psychiatry. They are examples of body-focused repetitive behaviors {{in which there is}} an irresistible urge or impulse to perform a certain behavior. The behavior is reinforced as it results in some degree of relief and pleasure. Nail {{tic disorders}} are common, yet poorly studied and understood. The literature on nail tic disorders is relatively scarce. Common nail tics include nail biting or <b>onychophagia,</b> onychotillomania and the habit tic deformity. Some uncommon and rare nail tic disorders are onychoteiromania, onychotemnomania, onychodaknomania and bidet nails. <b>Onychophagia</b> is chronic nail biting behavior which usually starts during childhood. It is often regarded as a tension reducing measure. Onychotillomania is recurrent picking and manicuring of the fingernails and/or toenails. In severe cases, it may lead to onychoatrophy due to irreversible scarring of the nail matrix. Very often, they occur in psychologically normal children but may sometimes be associated with anxiety. In severe cases, onychotillomania may be an expression of obsessive-compulsive disorders. Management of nail tic disorders is challenging. Frequent applications of distasteful topical preparations on the nail and periungual skin can discourage patients from biting and chewing their fingernails. Habit-tic deformity can be helped by bandaging the digit daily with permeable adhesive tape. Fluoxetine in high doses can be helpful in interrupting these compulsive disorders in adults. For a complete diagnosis and accurate management, it is imperative to assess the patient's mental health and simultaneously treat the underlying psychiatric comorbidity, if any...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Although bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) with comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is highly prevalent, few controlled studies have assessed this comorbidity. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and expression of comorbid disorders in female BD patients with OCD. Method: We assessed clinically stable female outpatients with BD: 15 with comorbid OCD (BD+OCD group) and 15 without (BD/no-OCD group). All were submitted to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, with additional modules for the diagnosis of kleptomania, trichotillomania, pathological gambling, <b>onychophagia</b> and skin picking. Results: The BD+OCD patients presented more chronic episodes, residual symptoms and previous depressive episodes than the BD/no-OCD patients. Of the BD+OCD patients, 86 % had a history of treatment-emergent mania, compared with only 40 % of the BD/no-OCD patients. The following were more prevalent in the BD+OCD patients than the BD/no-OCD patients: any anxiety disorder other than OCD; impulse control disorders; eating disorders; and tic disorders. Conclusion: Female BD patients with OCD may represent a more severe form of disorder than those without OCD, having more depressive episodes and residual symptoms, and being at a higher risk for treatment-emergent mania, as well as presenting a greater anxiety and impulse control disorder burden.

40|$|Nail {{disorders}} in {{children can be}} divided into seven categories. The first is physiologic alterations, which every physician should be aware of in order to reassure parents. These usually disappear with age and do not require any treatment. Among congenital and inherited conditions, the nail-patella syndrome, with its pathognomonic triangular lunula, should not be missed as recognition of the disease allows early diagnosis of associated pathologies. The most common infection is the periungual wart, whose treatment is delicate. Herpetic whitlow should be distinguished from bacterial whitlow as their therapeutic approaches differ. Dermatologic diseases encompass eczema, psoriasis, lichen planus, lichen striatus, trachyonychia, and parakeratosis pustulosa. Lichen planus, when it presents as in adults, is important to recognize because, if not treated, it may lead to permanent nail loss. Systemic or iatrogenic nail alterations may be severe but are usually not the first clue to the diagnosis. Beau lines on several fingernails are very common in children after temperature crest. Tumors are rare in children. Radiographic examination allows confirmation of the diagnosis of subungual exostosis. Other cases should undergo biopsy. Single-digit longitudinal melanonychia in children is mostly due to nevi. Its management should be tailored on a case-by-case basis. Acute trauma should never be underestimated in children and hand surgeons should be involved if necessary. <b>Onychophagia</b> and onychotillomania are responsible for chronic trauma.

40|$|Onychomycosis is {{a chronic}} disease caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and molds, {{which leads to}} {{destruction}} of the nail plate of the fingernails and toenails. The incidence of onychomycosis in children is considerably smaller compared with that in adults. Onychomycosis in children under 6 years of age is particularly unusual. The trauma and the hyperhidrosis after puberty are the major predisposing factor for fungal nail infection in childhood. Some systemic diseases and congenital syndromes have a crucial role {{for the development of}} onychomycosis in children. Wearing infected socks and shoes of other family members, family history for fungal infection of the nails, reduced hygiene and <b>onychophagia</b> are other important predisposing factors. Dermatophytic species Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton flocosum are the most frequent causative agents of onychomycosis in adults and much less common yeast of the genus Candida.

40|$|Introduction Dental and maxillofacial {{anomalies}} {{have multiple}} and complex causes. Most frequent {{among these are}} poor oral habits. A large number of children present with oral malocclusions, {{most of which are}} caused by deforming oral habits. It is important to learn about risk factors for this condition in order to institute preventive measures, early detection and treatment, and identification of low- and high-risk groups. Objectives To identify risk factors associated with deforming oral habits, which, if maintained over time, are responsible for occlusion defects, speech disorders, and can affect physical and emotional child development. Methods A case-control study of children presenting with deforming oral habits in the municipality of Manzanillo in Granma province was conducted between January and August 2013. 540 children aged 5 to 11 were included of which 180 had deforming oral habits and were asked to fill out a survey to identify specific type of habits leading to malocclusion. The case group was composed of children with deforming habits, and the remaining 360 children without poor oral habits were the control group. Each case was randomly matched to two control cases. The children’s mothers were also surveyed to gather supplemental information. Results Children with deforming oral habits were mostly female. At age 10, <b>onychophagia</b> was the predominant oral deforming habit. Risk factors detected for these habits were sociobiological maternal and child variables such as low and high birth weight, maternal breastfeeding inexperience, and discord in the family.

ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence of malocclusions and its association with risk factors, such as pernicious oral habits in a 2 to 15 -year-old child population who requested dental care in the Venustiano Carranza peripheral clinic of the UNAM. MethodA cross-sectional study was conducted in 147 children. Previously, the examiners who participated in the study were calibrated with a 98 % concordance for pernicious habits and 92 % for malocclusions. The epidemiologic information was recollected in one phase that comprised two stages to identify the presence of pernicious oral habits and diagnose the type of malocclusion. The statistical package SPSS 15 was used. ResultsThe prevalence of pernicious oral habits was 96. 6 %. The largest number of cases presented at age 4 and in the 6 to 11 years of age during the mixed dentition. Malocclusions were present in both genders with no significant difference. The habit with the highest prevalence was lingual interposition (66. 2 %); the second was lip suction (49. 3 %); the third was <b>onychophagia</b> (41. 9 %) and finally, mouth-breathing (31. 8 %). In regard to malocclusions, the most prevalent was open bite (35. 1 %) followed by lower anterior crowding (26. 4 %), upper anterior crowding (19. 6 %) and lastly, posterior crossbite (12. 8 %).

Instructor, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Medicine, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran Abstract Background: Childhood period {{it one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} stages of life in which individuals personality is formed. The majority of behavioral problems are due to attention deficit to the sensitive periods of childhood. This attention deficit leads to lack of agreement with environment and causes behavioural problems in children. Behavioural problem is attributed to a persons behaviour that his IQ isn	 lowered, but his or her mental and behavioural equilibrium is deviated from social norm and has severity, repetition and continuance in numerous times and places, so that his educational performance and behaviour will be frustrated and his efficiency is reduced. Such children are always rejected by others and in school there are a lot of grievances against them. Therefore, to pay attention children common behavioural problems is one of the most important topics and it prompt detection makes its treatment possible. So this study designed to determine prevalence of behavioural problems of Khorramabad pre-school children. Materials and methods: This descriptive-cross sectional study was carried out on 600 rural and urban pre-school children selected using random one stage sampling method. Data gathering tool was a two-part questionnaire including demographic and behavioural disorders signs obtained from DSM IV. Reability and validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by the university teaching members and retest method with a correlation coefficient 98 %. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (ver 11) and Ch-square test. Results: Results of the study showed that 79 % of the rural, and 68 % of the urban children were at least involved in one of the behavioural problems. Anxiety, withdrawal and social isolation, too much irrelevant peevishing and crying were higher in urban children, and behavioural problems such as, urinary incontinence, night fear, teeth gnashing, hitting the head against the wall, sleep disorders were higher in rural children. Some of the children behavioural problems such as urinary incontinence, stammering, <b>onychophagia</b> and … had a significant relation with sex, as well as between age, job, educational level of the parents, birth rank, and some behavioural problems a significant relation was observed.
