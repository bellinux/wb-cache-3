25|$|The Tour de France has {{the major}} fault of {{dividing}} the country, {{right down to}} the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grill</b> of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.|$|E

The new LS2 V8 made it the quickest Australian made production car at the time.|$|E
25|$|Although asado is eaten {{all over}} the country, its origin may {{be traced back to}} the Pampas. It entails {{manifold}} types of meat, which are generally eaten as follows: achuras (offal, or the cow's inner parts), morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes also a provoleta (a piece of provolone cheese cooked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grill</b> with oregano) are eaten first. Then comes the choripán (a kind of spiced sausage made with pork or lamb and placed between two slices of bread), and lastly meat such as asado de tira, vacío (flank steak), lomo (tenderloin), colita de cuadril (rump), matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut into slices and served cold), entraña (innards); the list is never-ending. It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as cabrito al asador (roast kid or goat) in the province of Córdoba.|$|E
50|$|By using {{a baking}} sheet pan placed above <b>the</b> <b>grill</b> surface, {{as well as a}} drip pan below the surface, it is {{possible}} to combine grilling and roasting to cook meats that are stuffed or coated with breadcrumbs or batter, and to bake breads and even casseroles and desserts. When cooking stuffed or coated meats, the foods can be baked first <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sheet pan, and then placed directly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grilling</b> surface for char marks, effectively cooking twice; the drip pan will be used to capture any crumbs that fall off from the coating or stuffing.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grill</b> before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E
500|$|After all {{the editing}} {{imposed by the}} studio, Crimewave still became a box-office flop. Campbell {{reasoned}} that [...] "cross-genre" [...] films [...] "send marketing people scurrying under a desk". According to him, the film was hard to market because it featured elements of horror films, comedies, and dramas. To make matters even more confusing, in France and Italy, the film's title was changed to Death <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grill</b> and The Two Craziest Killers in the World respectively. In the United States, the film was only released in Kansas and Alaska, to make the film eligible for HBO broadcasting. Upon release, the film [...] "went down in box-office flames", with Campbell commenting [...] "it wasn't released. It escaped!" [...] The [...] "only good" [...] screening came the Seattle International Film Festival, where the movie was promoted as a novelty film.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius sanguifluus are edible, and choice. This was noted by Paulet in his {{original}} {{description of the}} species, who wrote: [...] "This fungus is highly prized for use {{by those who are}} acquainted with it, it keeps well: I kept them for a whole year, it hardens without spoiling, then it takes on a taste of morels. The best way to eat is to cook it in the frying pan or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grill</b> with oil or butter & salt: it does not take long to cook". The mushrooms are sold in rural markets in France, Spain, Turkey, and Yunnan Province, China. They are also collected by locals in the upper valley of the Serchio River in central Italy. In Spain, where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in Catalan cuisine, it is known as níscalos (in Spanish) or rovelló (in Catalan). In Cyprus, it is known as γαιματάς (meaning [...] "the bloody one") and it is widely collected by the locals, but considered inferior to the saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus). In India, young specimens are consumed along with L.deliciosus; and some consider L.sanguifluus to have a better flavor than its more well-known relative. Its English common name is the [...] "bloody milkcap".|$|E

5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop <b>the</b> <b>grill.</b> <b>The</b> <b>grill</b> was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As <b>the</b> batter revolved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hot <b>grill,</b> <b>the</b> pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop <b>the</b> <b>grill.</b> After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.|$|R

[...] It's possible that the Hunters are running Terminus and luring travelers in, then killing and eating them—but the Hunters of the graphic novel series were lurkers and {{not strong enough to}} overcome even Rick's small band of fighters. Not that the show's writers are opposed to reinterpreting the comic books—after all, it's a gruesome theory that would play out amazingly on TV." ...|$|E
