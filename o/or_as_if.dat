5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E

25|$|On tests between November 1971 and May 1972 Curtiss {{determined}} that Genie viewed non-specific adjectives describing size, such {{as little as}} absolute rather than relative values without superlative or comparative markers. Between January and May 1972 her comprehension of noun-modifier sentences significantly increased and starting in May 1972, after Curtiss replaced the word little with tiny, Genie showed clear comprehension of them. Genie clearly understood both the word more and the suffix -er as comparatives by January 1972, but never used them in her own speech. Prior to 1972 Genie responded to the conjunctions and and <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they both meant and, but even after recognizing {{there was a difference}} never fully grasped the meaning of or. On tests she showed perfect comprehension of and while correctly responding to the word or fewer than 10% of the time, but she always understood disjunction marked by the word or in everyday conversation. She never attempted to use any other conjunctions, and with one possible highly ungrammatical exception never tried to connect two sentences.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by {{the first week of}} live shows of The X Factor (UK) where Little Mix were the favourites to be eliminated and felt disheartened by hearing the odds in the show's green room. Group member Jesy Nelson also recalled, [...] "the paps waiting outside to shoot us were all shouting 'See you on This Morning on Monday' because that's where the losers go. I was like: 'Oh, right, thanks!'" [...] Further inspiration came from Nelson who as an aspiring singer was told by her teachers that she would end up working at Tesco. Little Mix also wrote the song as an uplifting message for their fans. Nelson said, [...] "There's nothing wrong with writing songs about clubs and partying but I think it's cool to do a song with meaning." [...] Prior to [...] "Wings", the group had been vocal about standing up to bullying and wanted the song to have a similar message that listeners would be able to relate to. However, they did not want it to sound cheesy <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were preaching and instead wrote it with a theme of maternal advice.|$|E

Most structures follow the points-on-a-sphere pattern (<b>or,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the central atom {{were in the middle}} of a polyhedron where the corners of that shape are the locations of the ligands), where orbital overlap (between ligand and metal orbitals) and ligand-ligand repulsions tend to lead to certain regular geometries. The most observed geometries are listed below. [...] There are cases that deviate from a regular geometry due to the use of ligands of different types (which results in irregular bond lengths) or due to the size of ligands.|$|E

Cope disappoints her, reacting to the presence of prominent elders with [...] "a caution that almost became expressiveness."(119) Cope takes ill, nearly faints, and fears he has appeared a weakling. At Mrs. Phillips' insistence he spends the night: [...] "he felt greatly subordinated; he wished that he might have capitulated to a man."(126) When Cope and Amy walk to campus in the morning, she thinks it [...] "a privilege...curtailed much too soon,"(129) while he would rather have walked alone. Foster's reaction to Cope's fainting is [...] "as if a shaping ideal had dissipated. <b>Or</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a trace of weakness in one seemingly so young and strong was not altogether unacceptable as a source of consolation."(129) ...|$|E
2500|$|People with {{hypomania}} or mania {{may experience}} a decreased need of sleep, impaired judgment, and speak excessively and very rapidly. [...] Manic individuals {{often have a}} history of substance abuse developed over years as a form of [...] "self-medication". At the more extreme, a person in a full blown manic state can experience psychosis; a break with reality, a state in which thinking is affected along with mood. They may feel unstoppable, <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they have been [...] "chosen" [...] and are on a [...] "special mission", or have other grandiose or delusional ideas. This may lead to violent behavior and, sometimes, hospitalization in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the Young Mania Rating Scale, though questions remain about the reliability of these scales.|$|E

2500|$|Writer Gilbert Rogin {{assessed}} Liston's {{style and}} physique after his win over Zora Folley. He said that Liston was not quick with his hand- or foot work, that he relied {{too much on}} his ability to take a punch, and that he could be vulnerable to an opponent with more hand speed. [...] "But can he hit!", Rogin wrote. [...] "There is power in both his left and his right, even though the fists move with the languor of motoring royalty <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> passing through a gaseous envelope more dense than air." [...] Rogin called Liston's physique [...] "awesome—arms like fence posts, thighs like silos." [...] His defense was described as [...] "the gate-crossing of arms à la Archie Moore." [...] Future world heavyweight champion George Foreman, who sparred with Liston after his amateur career, assessed Liston's jab as the most formidable he ever faced.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly noted [...] "As on his first two efforts, he spends L.A.X. barking gleefully ignorant gangsta fantasies over hard-knocking drums. And while the 19-track disc could use a good trimming, The Game's routine is just as entertaining the third time around." [...] The Guardians Angus Batey stated [...] "LAX is an intense and remarkably focused record - almost every syllable concerns Compton, gangsta rap and (as one song title has it)." [...] Pitchfork Media stated that [...] "Relatively, he's won Round 3 by making his third straight album that's better than it has any right to be-- {{but the fact that the}} Game can make perfectly uncompelling competence sound like victory is proof that he's a master thespian of hip-hop theater." [...] Jordan Sargent of PopMatters complimented The Game stating that [...] "On LAX, Game hasn’t changed, but he’s picked a group of beats that get him closer to extricating himself from both his West Coast Messiah complex and the post-G-Unit narrative. And while Game has yet to carve out his own identity as a rap artist, LAX shows that, on his third album, he might be on the right track." ...|$|E
