5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{considered}} where firms internalize the regret costs that consumers experience {{when they see}} an unexpected price change. Regret costs {{are assumed to be}} increasing in the size <b>of</b> <b>price</b> changes and this can explain why the size <b>of</b> <b>price</b> increases is less sensitive to inflation than in models with fixed costs <b>of</b> changing <b>prices.</b> The latter predict unrealistically large responses <b>of</b> <b>price</b> changes to inflation for firms that do not frequently reduce their prices. Adjustment costs that depend on the size <b>of</b> <b>price</b> changes also raise the variability on the size <b>of</b> <b>price</b> increases. Lastly, it is argued that the common practice <b>of</b> announcing <b>price</b> increases in advance is much easier to rationalize with regret concerns by consumers than with more standard approaches to price rigidity. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{implications}} <b>of</b> <b>price</b> indexation for estimated frequency <b>of</b> <b>price</b> adjustment in sticky <b>price</b> models <b>of</b> business cycles. These models predominantly assume that non-reoptimized prices are indexed to lagged or average inflation. The assumption <b>of</b> <b>price</b> indexation adds tractability {{although it is}} not likely reflective <b>of</b> the <b>price</b> practices <b>of</b> firms at the micro level. Under indexation firms have less incentive to adjust their prices, which implies downward bias in the estimated frequency <b>of</b> <b>price</b> changes. To evaluate the bias, we generate data with Calvo-type models without indexation. The artificial data are then used to estimate the frequency <b>of</b> <b>price</b> changes with indexation. Considering different assumptions about the degree <b>of</b> <b>price</b> rigidity and the level of trend inflation in the data-generating model, we find that the estimated indexation bias can be substantial, ranging up to 12 quarters in some cases.

5|$|Mining {{generally}} {{performed well}} {{at the end of}} the medieval period, helped by buoyant demand for manufactured and luxury goods. Cornish tin production plunged during the Black Death itself, leading to a doubling <b>of</b> <b>prices.</b> Tin exports also collapsed catastrophically, but picked up again over the next few years. By the turn of the 16th century, the available alluvial tin deposits in Cornwall and Devon had begun to decline, leading to the commencement of bell and surface mining to support the tin boom that had occurred in the late 15th century. Lead mining increased, and output almost doubled between 1300 and 1500. Wood and charcoal became cheaper once again after the Black Death, and coal production declined as a result, remaining depressed for the rest of the period – nonetheless, some coal production was occurring in all the major English coalfields by the 16th century. Iron production continued to increase; the Weald in the South-East began to make increased use of water-power, and overtook the Forest of Dean in the 15th century as England's main iron-producing region. The first blast furnace in England, a major technical step forward in metal smelting, was created in 1496 in Newbridge in the Weald.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{of communism in}} Sibu relied heavily on student movements in several schools such as Chung Hua Secondary School (中华中学), Catholic High school (公教中学), and Wong Nai Siong High School (黄乃裳中学). Some of the communist strong points in Sibu were at Oya road and Queensway (now Jalan Tun Abang Haji Openg). The movement was also supported by the intelligentsia and workers in Sibu. For example, Dr Wong Soon Kai supported the movement by supplying free medication. Kampung Tanjung Kunyit villagers were among those being harassed into providing food and medical supplies to the communists. On 30 March 1971, the communists launched an anti-porn movement. In early 1973, they launched another campaign which opposed tax increase and inflation <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> while endorsing an increase in workers' wages. Some of the communist volunteers would start to distribute pamphlets at shophouses, schools, and the wharf terminal. The group also started military operation against police stations and naval bases. Communist guerillas would behead anyone who was suspected of being a government informant. The town was put under on-and-off 24-hour curfews for several months.|$|E
5|$|Under the British Mandate, Haifa {{became an}} {{industrial}} port city. The Bahá'í Faith in 1918 and today has its administrative and spiritual centre in the environs of Haifa. Many Jewish immigrants of the Fourth Aliyah and Fifth Aliyah settled in Haifa. The port {{was a major}} source of income, and the nearby towns of the Krayot were established in the 1930s. At the same time, the Arab population also swelled by an influx of migrants, coming mainly from surrounding villages as well as Syrian Hauran.

Between the censuses of 1922 and 1931, the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian populations rose by 217%, 256%, and 156%, respectively.

40|$|This paper aims {{to improve}} our {{understanding}} of the unique phenomenon of market competition, called price wars, as little is known about their nature and how they erupt.

Also, initial empirical findings on some of the effects <b>of</b> <b>price</b> wars are offered, showing that price wars inflict substantial damage on the companies involved. Implications for researchers entail that numerous research opportunities exist to better understand price wars and to eventually develop a theory <b>of</b> <b>price</b> wars that may become a vital part of a firm's portfolio <b>of</b> competitive <b>pricing</b> strategies.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a data set with price records {{collected}} for the computation of the Austrian CPI {{is used to}} estimate the average frequency <b>of</b> <b>price</b> changes and the duration <b>of</b> <b>price</b> spells to provide empirical evidence on the degree and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>price</b> rigidity in Austria. Depending on the estimation method applied, on average, prices are unchanged for 10 to 14 months. We find a strong heterogeneity across sectors and products. Price increases occur only slightly more often than price decreases. For both cases the typical size of the weighted average price change is quite large (11 and 15 percent, respectively). Like in related contributions {{we find that the}} aggregate hazard function is decreasing with time. Apart from heterogeneity across products and price setters, this is due to oversampling of products with a high frequency <b>of</b> <b>price</b> changes. Accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity in estimating the probability <b>of</b> a <b>price</b> change with a panel logit model (with fixed elementary product effects), we find a small but positive effect of the duration <b>of</b> a <b>price</b> spell on the probability <b>of</b> a <b>price</b> change.
