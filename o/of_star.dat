5|$|Following the end <b>of</b> <b>Star</b> Trek, he was {{nominated}} for Hugo Awards for two television movies, Genesis II and The Questor Tapes. In addition to awards, Roddenberry also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame following a campaign by the fan clubs <b>of</b> <b>Star</b> Trek, which sought to have each fan donate a dollar towards the overall $3500 cost of upkeep. Following these donations, the Committee {{in charge of the}} Walk of Fame voted Roddenberry in. The star was unveiled on September 4, 1985, at the 6600 block, near to the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Las Palmas. The induction ceremony was attended by all of the main cast <b>of</b> <b>Star</b> Trek, as well as Roger C. Carmel, who portrayed Harry Mudd in The Original Series. Following Roddenberry's death in 1991, he was posthumously awarded the Robert A. Heinlein Memorial Award by the National Space Society and The George Pal Memorial Award at the Saturn Awards. He was also awarded the Exceptional Public Service Medal by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{much to the}} nation's surprise, the Hanshin Tigers {{faced the}} Seibu Lions and took their first and only victory in the Japan Series, {{largely due to the}} efforts <b>of</b> <b>star</b> slugger Randy Bass (presently State Senator from Oklahoma), an American playing for the team.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his film and television work, Roddenberry wrote the novelization <b>of</b> <b>Star</b> Trek: The Motion Picture. Although it has been incorrectly attributed to several other authors (most notably Alan Dean Foster), {{it was the first}} in a series of hundreds <b>of</b> <b>Star</b> Trek-based novels to be published by the Pocket Books imprint of Simon & Schuster, whose parent company also owned Paramount Pictures Corporation. Previously, Roddenberry worked intermittently on a novel The God Thing that he had based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget ($3 to $5 million) Star Trek film preceding the development of Phase II throughout 1976. Attempts to complete the project by Walter Koenig, Susan Sackett, Fred Bronson, and Michael Jan Friedman have proven to be unfeasible for a variety of legal and structural reasons.|$|E

5|$|Such {{large-scale}} {{interactions are}} rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size become less common.

50|$|Membership in a {{star cluster}} or star system permits an {{assignment}} of rough ages {{to a large}} number <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> present within. When one can determine the age <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> through other methods, {{such as the ones}} listed above, one can identify the age of all of the bodies in a system. This is especially useful in clusters <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> which exhibit a large amount of variety in their stellar masses, evolutionary stages, and classifications. While not entirely independent of the properties <b>of</b> the <b>stars</b> in the cluster, system, or other reasonably-sized association <b>of</b> <b>stars,</b> an astronomer would only need a representative sample <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> to determine the age of the cluster, rather than painstakingly finding the age <b>of</b> every <b>star</b> in the cluster through other properties.|$|R

5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> occurred during {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study <b>of</b> <b>stars.</b> Successful models were developed to explain the interiors <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.|$|R

While in the 11th grade, he had a Star Trek short story published in the fanzine Probe, which was a yearly publication in East Meadow High School. Weinstein also wrote a script for , but the script was turned down as it was not submitted via an agent.
