5|$|The {{territory}} of Strandzha Nature Park {{falls within the}} Mediterranean soil area of Europe, characterised by wetter soils {{in comparison to the}} rest of Southern Europe. There are seven soil types in the park under the World Reference Base for Soil Resources soil classification— Fluvisols (4% of the park's area), Leptosols (10%), Cambisols (4%), Luvisols (46%), Planosols (20%), Alisols (11%) and Nitisols (5%). Strandzha is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Bulgaria where Alisoils are found and the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Europe with Nitisols.|$|E
5|$|From Trinitatis Church, {{the fire}} {{continued}} down Landemærket towards Gothersgade. Here, the fire {{met up with}} the other branch of the fire which ate its way down present day Nørre Voldgade. Around midnight, the church Reformert Kirke was ablaze. The <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the city where there was some control over the fire was around Vandkunsten.|$|E
5|$|Pocono {{sandstone}} {{can also}} be found in the watershed, and bituminous coal formations known as the Clarion Formation, the Lower Kittanning Formation and the Eagleton Coal field also exist in the creek's watershed. The valley of Tangascootack Creek is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Bald Eagle Township where there are significant deposits of minerals.|$|E

5000|$|The East London Harbour’s {{construction}} locomotives were 0-4-0 vertical boiler engines, {{similar in}} appearance to the American Grasshopper type. Four {{of them were}} acquired from Alexander Chaplin & Co. between 1873 and 1880, although {{the first one was}} <b>only</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> service in 1874.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its unique}} {{geography}} – the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> {{hundreds of miles}} from which one can easily access the Colorado River from both sides – it historically served as an important river crossing and starting in the mid-19th century was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for whom it is named. Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.|$|E
5|$|Few dinosaur remains {{have been}} found in Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} of western Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, {{have been found}} in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in Scania, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, including those of dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea was part of the same land mass as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Denmark which has yielded dinosaur remains.|$|E
5|$|Jersey is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the British Isles {{where the}} agile frog Rana dalmatina is found. The {{remaining}} population of agile frogs on Jersey {{is very small}} and is restricted to the south west of the island. The species {{is the subject of}} an ongoing programme to save it from extinction in Jersey via a collaboration between States of Jersey, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and Jersey Amphibian and Reptile Group (JARG), with support and sponsorship from several other organisations. The programme includes captive breeding and release, public awareness and habitat restoration activities.|$|E

5|$|The Pine Bush {{is home to}} bog {{bluegrass}} (Poa paludigena), {{a federal}} species of concern, {{as well as the}} rare red-rooted flatsedge (Cyperus erythrorhizos), Houghton's umbrella-sedge (Cyperus houghtonii), and Schweinitz's flatsedge (Cyperus schweinitzii). Bog bluegrass occurs {{at the bottom of a}} ravine in the Pine Bush and is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the New York Bight watershed where this plant appears. Bayard's malaxis (Malaxis bayardii) is a rare orchid that occurs in the Pine Bush as well.|$|E
5|$|The Gram-negative {{bacterial}} disease brucellosis occasionally affects elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. where {{the disease is}} still known to exist. In domesticated cattle, brucellosis causes infertility, abortions and reduced milk production. It is transmitted to humans as undulant fever, producing flu-like symptoms which may last for years. Though bison {{are more likely to}} transmit the disease to other animals, elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in Wyoming and cattle in Idaho. Researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and herd management measures, which are expected to be successful. Nevetheless, research has been ongoing since 2002, and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{returns to}} Sarawak, where {{he stays in}} the {{circular}} 'head-house' of a Dyak village, travels upriver, and describes the Durian, praising it as the king of fruits with exquisite and unsurpassed flavour, and the Dyak's slender bamboo bridges, as well as ferns and Nepenthes pitcher plants. On a mountain he finds the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> his entire journey where moths are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent {{to enable them to}} catch moths.|$|E

5|$|Many of Gibraltar's fortifications {{were already}} {{redundant}} {{well before the}} British garrison was withdrawn from the territory in the 1990s, and the rapid military rundown in the 1980s and the 1990s left the civilian authorities with {{a large amount of}} surplus military property. Many of the best-preserved fortifications are in the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, a conservation area that covers about 40% of the area of Gibraltar. A few of the Upper Rock batteries have been preserved intact; all three of the 5.25-inch guns at Princess Anne's Battery are still in place, making it the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the world where a complete 5.25-inch battery can still be seen. The 9.2 inch guns at Breakneck, Lord Airey's and O'Hara's Batteries are still in situ and can now be visited. Elsewhere, most of the ordnance has been removed. Two surviving 6-inch guns remain at Devil's Gap Battery, one of which is the gun that engaged a German U-boat in August 1917. At Napier of Magdala Battery one of the two 100-ton RML 17.72 inch guns is still in situ and has been restored, along with a 3.7 inch quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. The site is now run by the Gibraltar Tourist Board in conjunction with the Nature Reserve.|$|E
