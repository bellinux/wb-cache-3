5|$|The Volksdeutsche of the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> were an {{important}} part of the economies of the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories,</b> and by 1941, they were entirely in the thrall of the Nazi Party. Relations between the occupation authorities and the Volksdeutsche were strained by the killing of ethnic Germans during the invasion, to the extent that Adolf Hitler became aware of the issue. The Volksdeutsche were not active in the Hungarian military or civil administration, but were represented in the Hungarian Parliament, and from 1942 were permitted to conscript their members into the Wehrmacht. The official organisation of the Volksdeutsche in Hungary, the Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn (National League of Germans in Hungary), was essentially autonomous during the war, including within the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories.</b>|$|E

5|$|In March 1944, when Hungary {{realised}} {{that it was}} on {{the losing}} side in the war and began to negotiate with the Allies, Germany took control of the country, including the annexed territories, during Operation Margarethe I. This was followed by the collection and transport of the remaining Jews in the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> to extermination camps, resulting in the deaths of 85 per cent of the Jews in the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories.</b> Prior to their withdrawal from the Balkans {{in the face of the}} advance of the Soviet Red Army, the Germans evacuated 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche from Bačka and Baranja to Austria. Bačka and Baranja were restored to Yugoslav control when the Germans were pushed out of the region by the Red Army in late 1944. Međimurje and Prekmurje remained occupied until the last weeks of the war.|$|E
5|$|German {{citizens}} (despite much of {{the later}} denial) had access to information about what was happening, as soldiers returning from the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> would report on what they had seen and done. Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide. Some Polish citizens tried to rescue or hide the remaining Jews {{and members of the}} Polish underground got word to their government in exile in London as to what was happening.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, the Hungarian {{authorities}} began evacuating the Székelys {{settled in}} the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> since 1941 to Transdanubia. Several days after the Soviet Red Army entered the Banat on 1 October 1944, the Germans began the evacuation of Bačka, including the local Volksdeutsche. With the advance of the Partisans and the Red Army, some of the Volksdeutsche left the region while some others stayed, despite the situation.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1941, Hitler {{launched}} Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion}} of the Soviet Union. The expanding war and the need to control <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> provided the conditions for Himmler to further consolidate the police and military organs of the SS. Rapid acquisition of vast territories in the East placed considerable strain on the SS police organizations as they struggled to adjust to the changing security challenges.|$|E
5|$|Such was {{the extent}} of the Holocaust in the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> {{that by the end of}} the war, nearly 85 per cent of the Jews that had been living in the Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav territories in April 1941 had been killed. This figure {{comprised}} about 13,500 Jews from Bačka and Baranja, and about 1,300 from Međimurje and Prekmurje.|$|E
5|$|After being re-established in December 1940, I./JG 1's primary {{responsibility}} was the air defence of Germany and its Northern <b>occupied</b> <b>territories.</b> In this role, the unit almost exclusively {{worked in the}} Netherlands prior to its transfer to central West Germany. Its main opponents through 1940–41 were therefore lone RAF reconnaissance aircraft, the anti-shipping aircraft of RAF Coastal Command and the medium bombers of RAF Bomber Command's 2 Group, although the group would see little action compared to other theaters during 1941. During this time, this sector was considered relatively safe compared to other theaters.|$|E

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories,</b> and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Charles X Gustav {{fell ill}} in early 1660 and died on 23 February of that year. With his death, {{one of the}} major {{obstacles}} to peace was gone and the Treaty of Oliwa was signed on 23 April. Sweden was accepted as sovereign in Swedish Livonia, Brandenburg was accepted as sovereign in Ducal Prussia, and John II Casimir withdrew his claims to the Swedish throne, though he was to retain the title for life. All <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> were restored to their pre-war sovereigns.|$|E

All the operations took place between the Arctic Circle in Norway to the French border with Spain, along what was known as the Atlantic Wall.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of the invasion, {{significant}} numbers of Belgian men had attempted to flee the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> to join the Belgian army on the Yser front, via the Netherlands which were neutral. In order to stop this, the Germans began work on a barbed wire and electric fence across the length of the border. The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In a third {{trial in}} early 1946, the National Court of Hungary in Budapest found Szombathelyi, Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, Deák, and Zöldi guilty of {{involvement}} in the massacres in the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories,</b> and in carrying out the deportation of Jews to extermination camps. In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement, the Hungarian authorities then extradited them to Yugoslavia, where they underwent a fourth trial in Novi Sad in October 1946. They were all sentenced to death and executed the following month.|$|E

Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E

5|$|The Dominican Republic had {{its second}} war for {{independence}} in 1844, which {{was successful in}} obtaining independence from Haiti. Spain reannexed {{the country at the}} request of its then-dictator, Gen. Pedro Santana (who attempted to benefit personally from the event), in 1861. A third revolt, the War of Restoration, sought independence from the Spanish in 1863. Its leaders used Haiti as a guerrilla base, since the Haitian government feared a Spanish takeover and the restoration of slavery in the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories,</b> and was thus sympathetic to their cause. Their stronghold, however, was the Cibao valley in the northeastern part of Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|The Jews of the <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> were {{subjected}} to forced labour by the Hungarian authorities, with about 4,000 Bačka and Baranja Jews being sent to hard labour camps within Hungary, 1,500 Bačka Jews being among the 10,000 Hungarian Jews sent to perform labour tasks for the Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front in September 1942, and about 600 Bačka Jews sent {{to work in the}} Bor copper mine in the German-occupied territory of Serbia in July 1943. Only 2 per cent of those sent to the Eastern Front survived the war.|$|E
5|$|The Mafia only became {{credible}} {{again after}} the end of the invasion. The Allied Military Government of <b>Occupied</b> <b>Territories</b> (AMGOT), looking for anti-fascist notables to replace fascist authorities, made Don Calogero Vizzini mayor of Villalba, as well as an Honorary Colonel of the US Army. In the chaos that followed the invasion of Sicily and the collapse of Fascism, the American army often relied on senior churchmen for advice on whom to trust. Don Calò was one of those recommended. He had a long record of involvement with Catholic social funds and there were several clergymen in his family.|$|E
