5|$|Millwall's fiercest rival is West Ham United. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} passionately contested local derbies in football.

5|$|In the United States, {{the film}} sold the most tickets of any {{film in the}} {{franchise}} until 2009's Star Trek, and it remains the highest-grossing film of the franchise worldwide adjusted for inflation, but Paramount considered its gross disappointing compared to expectations and marketing. The Motion Pictures budget of $46million, including costs incurred during PhaseII production, was the largest for any film made within the United States up to that time. David Gerrold estimated before its release that the film would have to gross {{two to three times}} its budget to be profitable for Paramount. The studio faulted Roddenberry's script rewrites and creative direction for the plodding pace and disappointing gross. While the performance of The Motion Picture convinced the studio to back a (cheaper) sequel, Roddenberry was forced out of its creative control. Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer would produce and direct , which received better reviews (becoming a fan favorite) and continued the franchise. With the successful revival of the Star Trek brand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>screen</b> setting an example, Hollywood increasingly turned to 1960s television series for material.|$|E
