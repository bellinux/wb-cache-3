5|$|In 1521, the Portuguese {{allied with}} Hormuz and seized Bahrain from the Jabrid ruler Migrin ibn Zamil, {{who was killed}} during the takeover. Portuguese rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they {{depended}} mainly on Sunni Persian governors. The Portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty of Persia, which gave impetus to Shia Islam. For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the Ibadhis of Oman. During most of this period, they resorted to governing Bahrain indirectly, either through the city of Bushehr or through immigrant Sunni Arab clans. The latter were tribes returning to the Arabian side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> from Persian territories in the north who were known as Huwala (literally: those that have changed or moved). In 1753, the Huwala clan of Nasr Al-Madhkur invaded Bahrain {{on behalf of the}} Iranian Zand leader Karim Khan Zand and restored direct Iranian rule.|$|E

In view of Sirri and Abu Musa being pirate lairs themselves, Hennell's successor, Major James Morrison, in January 1836, modified the restrictive line to run from Sham on the Trucial Coast to a point ten miles south of Abu Musa to Sáir Abu Noayr island.
