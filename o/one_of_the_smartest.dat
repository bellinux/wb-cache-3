In 1867 the Wardell Family moved into a large new house known as Ardoch, at 226 Dandenong Road, St Kilda, at the time <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> and most expensive residential areas of Melbourne. The 13-roomed two-storied house in an Italianate style was built for £225 in 1864. The Wardell family purchased it in 1867 and moved from their previous home in Powlett Street, East Melbourne. Wardell designed both the Catholic churches dedicated to St Mary in St Kilda East where he personally worshipped. The first was completed in 1859 and its larger replacement completed in 1897.|$|E
25|$|Under a Charter of Incorporation 1848, A Watch Committee {{was formed}} {{and the first}} members of the Halifax Borough Police were {{appointed}} on 7 July of that year. In April 1903 Richardson took up his post as Chief Constable of Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, in the then relatively new building housing the Magistrates' Court, the Coroner's Court and Police Station. The Force size at this time was 118 men. This {{was the start of}} the time when the Halifax Police Force became known as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> in the country, reflected in the strict discipline Richardson instigated. He, with his wife and young son, moved to a large detached stone-built house in Clover Hill Road, Halifax (known as Clover Lea in 1903, but soon there were concerns by the Halifax Watch Committee about his general safety. There was a surge of threats to officials at this time, including the British Royal Family, and he had to move in closer to the town centre and live nearer the Police station at Harrison Road. The Halifax Borough Council had several houses available and he moved to Balmoral Place, Halifax.|$|E

500|$|The {{third season}} of The Office {{was met with}} {{critical}} acclaim. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the third season of the show an 85 out of 100 rating, which translates {{to the status of}} [...] "universal acclaim". Travis Fickett of IGN felt that [...] "In its third season The Office continued to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartest,</b> funniest and most likable shows on television." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Meeta Agrawal praised the show for separating the action between Jim in Stamford {{and the rest of the}} characters in Scranton, a feat that he notes [...] "could have been disastrous" [...] to other shows. Furthermore, he argued that the effort made the audience [...] "appreciate [...] even more". Ultimately, he gave the season an [...] "A–".

500|$|Early in Bure's career, he {{was noted}} for playing a strong two-way game. Having joined Pat Quinn's defensive-minded Canucks in 1991, Bure's {{transition}} to the NHL was cited as being easier than that of his countryman, Igor Larionov, due to his quick adjustment to the team's defensive demands. Regarding Bure's first NHL game against the Winnipeg Jets, reporter Mike Beamish explained that [...] "hockey fans marvelled at his offensive thrusts, but hockey people were taken by a singular display of jet-powered defensive diligence. On one play, after the Canucks were caught deep in the Winnipeg zone, the Russian winger raced back and almost single-handedly foiled a two-on-one Jets' rush, making up a half-rink disadvantage." [...] Bure was used on the team's penalty kill for his entire tenure with the Canucks, and was proficient at generating shorthanded chances, pressuring the opposition with his quickness and positioning in the defensive zone. During the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs, commentator and ex-NHL coach Harry Neale commented, [...] "I like the effort he gives it when he doesn't have the puck. We all know {{what he can do}} when he thinks he can score, but he's killing penalties, he's checking, doing a lot of things." [...] Bure tied for second-place on Bob McKenzie's 1993 coaches poll for the NHL's best penalty killer. He was also voted the league's second-best stickhandler that season and garnered recognition as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> players in the NHL.|$|E

500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E

Kerrie Mills of PopMatters rated the first three series 9/10, opining that the show [...] "does also provide evidence, edgewise between the falling bodily fluids, of a sharp comic intelligence... in fact, it might just {{be one of the}} most successful original comedy shows to appear in years." [...] Stephen Kelly of The Guardian argued that the fourth series had definitively transcended its roots to become not just [...] "the best show on children's television—it's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> comedies on TV", performed by an [...] "astonishing cast... so superb that even special guest stars such as Chris Addison can look slightly out of their depth." [...] In an article discussing the League of Gentlemen troupe's appearance in the same series, the Radio Times Gareth McLean agreed that [...] "despite nominally being a children's programme, Horrible Histories is one of the best sketch comedies on TV", adding that [...] "ultimately, comedy performers relish [...] madcap, sometimes deliciously silly exuberance, which, thanks to the show's razorsharp writing, educates as well as entertains." [...] Graeme Virtue of The Scotsman called the League's reunion a [...] "coup" [...] for the series: [...] "While Gatiss's American accent was pretty duff, the bickering spark between the three Gentlemen remained." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for 1984 were {{generally}} favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+.

[...] He also called side two [...] "consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'." [...] J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 {{four out of five}} stars. He called it [...] "the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus." [...] He stated that [...] ""Jump" [...] is not exactly the kind of song you'd expect from Van Halen", but that [...] "once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start sounding a little more familiar". Although he mentioned [...] "Jump" [...] as having [...] "suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia", he went on to state that [...] "Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined." [...] He concluded that [...] "what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself" [...] and that [...] "despite all the bluster, Van Halen is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartest,</b> toughest bands in rock & roll.
