5|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{then joined}} the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction. Zeus, however, {{weakened}} Kratos and tricked him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus {{used to kill}} Kratos. Although he overcame all obstacles, Kratos was stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swore revenge as he died. Kratos fell into the Underworld, but was rescued by the Titan Gaia. Banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War, Gaia and her brethren seek the death of Zeus. Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agreed to aid the Titans and was instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, {{who are capable of}} returning him to the moment of Zeus' treachery. Kratos became determined and utterly ruthless—in the pursuit of his goal he wounded a Titan, killed several Greek heroes without hesitation, and deliberately sacrificed two scholars. All three of the Sisters of Fate were killed when they opposed Kratos, who was prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation. Zeus was only saved when Athena intervened and sacrificed herself for him; only then does Kratos show remorse. He learned from a dying Athena that Zeus is, in fact, his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to his own father, Cronos. Kratos rejected any notion of a relationship and vowed to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus. Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos used the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War, and with their assistance, stormed Mount Olympus.|$|E

25|$|Several {{months before}} the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of {{election}} news, as his supporters began petition drives to {{get him on the}} ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United We Stand America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> call for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a gasoline tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.|$|E
25|$|Both Rice and Poindexter had alibis for {{the night}} of the bombing, who testified for the defense. Poindexter went to a movie with a girl named Linda Walker, who was the {{daughter}} of a New York City police officer. They were together when they heard the blast. Rice was at a party from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. at Rae Ann Schmitz's house. She testified as a first year law student and eventually became a member of his legal defense team. Cousins of Duane Peak, Frank and Will Peak, testified that Duane Peak's story <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> the week before the bombing was a lie. Will Peak provided Poindexter with an alibi {{for the night}} that he was accused of building the bomb in David Rice's kitchen. The jury ignored it all. Norma Aufrecht, who allegedly drove Duane Peak from NCCF headquarters to David Rice's house, did not testify. She was charged with conspiracy to commit first degree murder and accessory after the fact. She would have testified that she did not drive Duane Peak on Sunday, August 16, but she was never deposed by the defense. She fled Omaha in fear and did not return to live there for 10 years after the trial.|$|E

25|$|Before leaving China, Mosby {{had written}} Grant seeking help in finding another position. Grant responded (as he was dying) {{with a letter}} recommending Mosby to Senator Leland Stanford, a former California {{railroad}} magnate. Mosby then spent about 16 years in California, working as {{a lawyer for the}} Southern Pacific Railroad until the death of his mentor Collis Huntington. Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> remains unknown, due to a fire which destroyed the company's records of that era. Although Mosby hated the desk work, he twice returned to Washington, D.C. to argue before the United States Supreme Court—once based on the consul fees he had remitted to the Treasury (and which the claims court found him entitled to) and once for the railroad. Mosby also wrote articles for Eastern newspapers about his escapades during the Civil war, and traveled to New England on a speaking tour where he met Oliver Wendell Holmes(both father and son). He also befriended the Patton family and spent time at their ranch with their young son, George S. Patton, recreating Civil War battles, with Mosby playing himself and George playing Robert E. Lee. Also, he tried to volunteer for the Spanish–American War, but Mosby's Hussars who trained in Oakland, California never disembarked for Cuba nor the Philippines.|$|E
500|$|Manne {{is often}} {{associated}} with the once frequently criticized West Coast school of jazz. He has been considered [...] "the quintessential" [...] drummer in what was seen as a West Coast movement, though Manne himself did not care to be so pigeonholed. In the 1950s, much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> could be seen as in the West Coast style: performing in tightly arranged compositions in what was a cool style, as in his 1953 album named The West Coast Sound, for which he commissioned several original compositions. Some of West Coast jazz was experimental, avant-garde music several years before the more mainstream avant-garde playing of Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman (Manne also recorded with Coleman in 1959); a good deal of Manne's work with Jimmy Giuffre was of this kind. Critics would condemn much of this music as overly cerebral.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} other professors disliked the name and {{organisational}} structure of the university, and wanted it {{to shake off the}} association with [...] "technology" [...] and become a [...] "real university". While Baxter did not side with them, contending that the university's association with the government provided funding and facilities, most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> moved in that direction. He hired full-time staff, and broadened the scope of the subjects taught and the research carried out. A Department of Food Technology was the first, and for many years the only, one of its kind in Australia. He replaced the diploma-level with a new bachelor of science in chemical engineering degree, offering conversion courses to allow students to upgrade their diplomas to degrees. The first chemical engineering students had enrolled in [...] 1949, and nine graduated with the bachelor of science degree in 1952.

He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain, Issaquah, and other secondary crime scenes, often several times, to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their decomposing bodies until putrefaction forced him to stop. In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night. In Utah, he applied makeup to Melissa Smith's lifeless face, and he repeatedly washed Laura Aime's hair. [...] "If you've got time," [...] he told Hagmaier, [...] "they can be anything you want them to be." [...] He decapitated approximately twelve of his victims with a hacksaw, and kept at least one group of severed heads—probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball and Healy)—in his apartment {{for a period of time}} before disposing of them.|$|E

2500|$|The perimeter, {{according}} to Nansen {{based on the}} 23,800 stadia, was 2,375 miles.

2500|$|Anakin is a lead {{character}} {{in all three}} seasons of the [...] microseries, which takes place {{four months after the}} conclusion of Attack of the Clones. Anakin becomes a Jedi Knight and is quickly promoted to a General of the Republic's Clone Army, due in part to Palpatine's influence.

During the third season, Anakin frees the planet Nelvaan from Separatist control and sees a cryptic vision of his future as Darth Vader. In the season finale, Anakin and Obi-Wan go on a mission to rescue Palpatine from General Grievous, leading to the opening of Revenge of the Sith.

2500|$|Wilson avoided {{standard}} rock percussion {{because he}} wanted his productions to sound more [...] "delicate" [...] and less [...] "boomy". Van Dyke Parks said: [...] "The first thing I can remember in the studio was how Brian used tuneful percussion, like a piano or a Chinese gong. Even a triangle has pitch. Brian was very fond of pitched instruments. They {{reminded me of the}} orchestrations of the early 20th century done by people like Percy Grainger, the man who wrote 'Country Gardens', who was infatuated with tuneful percussion. He stood out in my youth as a great composer because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> with sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.' He's feeling a certain thing, but coming at it from a musical idea rather than the conventions of the instrument."
