5|$|The Great Depression had a {{comparatively}} mild effect on Argentina, {{the unemployment rate}} never went above 10%, and the country largely recovered by 1935. However, the Depression permanently halted its economic expansion. Actually, much like <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> countries, the economy was already in a downturn beginning in 1927, a result of declining prices.|$|E
5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India as well as <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> countries.|$|E

Despite issues such as domestic abuse and war affecting overseas Filipino workers, relations with Middle Eastern countries are friendly as seen in the continuous employment of more than two million overseas Filipinos living there.|$|E

5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E
25|$|China's {{economic}} {{growth has been}} compared with <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, and India. GDP growth in China outstrips all <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> countries, with only India after 1990 coming close to China's experience. Scholars believe that high rates of investments, especially increases in capital invested per worker, have contributed to China's superior economic performance.

40|$|As the United States looks {{ahead to}} the fiscal {{challenges}} of population aging, two facts stand out. First, the United States faces far smaller pension problems from population aging than do most <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> nations.

Our pension system is less generous than those of nearly all <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> nations. 1 As a result, meeting the added costs of pensions, public and private, is not technically difficult. The added costs of Social Security benefits—a bit more than 2 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (GDP) over the next 35 years—is less than past increases in pension costs, which have accrued over many fewer years.
