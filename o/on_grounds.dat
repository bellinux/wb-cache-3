5|$|Banquets {{have not}} been held at Westminster Hall since the {{coronation}} of GeorgeIV in 1821. His coronation was the most elaborate in history; his brother and successor WilliamIV eliminated the banquet <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> of economy, ending a 632-year-old tradition. Since 1901, a Coronation Fleet Review has also been held. To celebrate the coronation, a coronation honours list is also released before the coronation.|$|E

5|$|A {{full-size}} {{reproduction of}} September Morn was {{displayed in a}} window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.|$|E
5|$|Aaronson {{was married}} three times. His first wife was the actress Lydia Sherwood (1906–1989), {{whom he was}} married to between 1924 and 1931. He filed for divorce <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> of her {{adultery}} with the theatre producer Theodore Komisarjevsky, and the much publicised suit was undefended. His second marriage, which took place on 9 July 1938, to Dorothy Beatrice Lewer (1915–2005), also ended in divorce. On 14 January 1950, Aaronson married Margaret Olive Ireson (1920–1981), with whom he had one son, David, who was born in 1953.|$|E

5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters <b>on</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|E

Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E

5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Adrian Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Wilson and his first wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> of cruelty in 1931, and married Boult two years later. The enmity provoked in Wilson was to have lasting repercussions. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career: he was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival for 25 years until 1957, when he narrated Honegger's King David in Worcester, by which time his singing career had ended.|$|E
5|$|For {{several decades}} {{following}} {{the founding of}} the university, the major student societies <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> were the debating societies. Several of these societies, notably the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society and the Washington Literary Society and Debating Union, are still active today. These and other debating societies that are no longer in existence, such as the Philomathean Society and the Parthenon Society, served as the primary means of student societal activity {{in the early days of}} the University.|$|E

The following year, it received a negative review from Michael Ignatieff in the London Review of Books. Reviewers faulted the work <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> such as the questionable representativeness of its sample of homosexuals, though those who reviewed it positively praised it for reasons including the sophistication of its path analysis.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada made {{a ruling}} in R.v. Butler which {{incorporated}} {{some elements of}} Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In Butler, the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if enforced <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law could be enforced constitutionally against some pornography {{on the basis of}} the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon.|$|E

This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force {{right of access}} to private property <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> of 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003.

5|$|In November 2008, SMRT Corporation and Land Transport Authority (LTA) {{announced}} that the last ten refurbished trainsets would have one-third of their seats replaced with metal rails to create extra standing space. The move was justified <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> of allowing more standing space onboard during peak-hour services. The reduction of seats per row from nine to seven after refurbishment was already unpopular among commuters; the decision to further reduce seating capacity drew sharp criticism against the operator and LTA. As of December 2015, all 66 C151s from one-third of their seats {{have been replaced by}} metal bars to create extra standing space.|$|E
