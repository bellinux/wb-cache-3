500|$|In its {{original}} form, the qualification requirements for an FHA insured loan {{called for the}} borrower to be his/her own source of funds for the down payment. [...] In 1996, the U.S. Congress amended the statute to permit the down-payment funds {{to come from a}} family member of the borrower. [...] However, HUD subsequently issued guidelines that considerably expanded the list of exceptions beyond that which appeared in the statute. [...] The expanded list included, for example, the borrower's employer or labor union. [...] The expanded list also included [...] "charitable organizations". [...] That guideline also noted that [...] "As a rule, <b>our</b> <b>concern</b> is not with how the donor obtains the gift funds provided they are not derived in any manner from a party to the sales transaction". [...] In 1996, HUD issued Mortgagee Letter 96–18, stating [...] "a nonprofit or other organization that provides bona fide gifts to eligible participants should not compel the beneficiary to purchase only properties owned by the donor of the funds.
