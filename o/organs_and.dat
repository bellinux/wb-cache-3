5|$|Anatomy can {{be studied}} using both {{invasive}} and non-invasive methods {{with the goal of}} obtaining information about the structure and organization of <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> {{the production of}} gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at {{the same size and}} thus age.|$|E

5|$|The {{electronic}} organ developed throughout the 20th century. Some pipe organs {{were replaced by}} digital organs because of their lower purchase price, smaller physical size, and minimal maintenance requirements. In the early 1970s, Rodgers Instruments pioneered the hybrid organ, an electronic instrument that incorporates real pipes; other builders such as Allen <b>Organs</b> <b>and</b> Johannus Orgelbouw have since built hybrid organs.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} anatomy is {{characterized}} by a progressive understanding of the functions of the <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> structures of the human body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E

5|$|Among Episcopalians, Qualified Chapels {{used the}} English Book of Common Prayer.

When the two branches united in the 1790s, the non-juring branch soon absorbed the musical and liturgical traditions of the qualified churches.|$|E

5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital <b>organs,</b> <b>and</b> the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual <b>organs,</b> <b>and</b> finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E

5|$|Gastrotrichs have {{a simple}} body plan with a head region, with a brain and sensory <b>organs,</b> <b>and</b> a trunk with a simple gut and the {{reproductive}} organs. They have adhesive glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, at age 36, Kotok married Judith McCoy, a choir {{director}} and piano teacher {{on the faculty}} of the Longy School of Music. They lived in Harvard, Massachusetts, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Cape May, New Jersey. The couple shared a love of 16th and 17th-century music and pipe <b>organs,</b> <b>and</b> toured historic pipe organs in Sweden, Germany, Italy and Mexico. They had a daughter, Leah Kotok, and two stepchildren from Judith's prior marriage, Frederica and Daryl Beck.|$|E
5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E

5|$|Knowledge about dinosaurs {{is derived}} {{from a variety of}} fossil and non-fossil records, {{including}} fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> soft tissues. Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics (especially biomechanics), chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual <b>organs,</b> <b>and</b> that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
