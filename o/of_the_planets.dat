5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E
5|$|Careful {{measurement}} of the positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> {{has led to a}} solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.|$|E
5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E

5|$|The early {{astronomy}} {{of ancient}} Greece {{was influenced by}} knowledge transmitted from the Mesopotamian culture. Thus the Babylonians associated Mars with Nergal, their god of war and pestilence, and the Greeks connected the planet with their god of war, Ares. During this period, the motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> were of little interest to the Greeks; Hesiod's Works and Days (c. 650 BCE) makes no mention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{piece of music}} {{influenced}} by astrology is the orchestral suite The Planets. Written by the British composer Gustav Holst (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Planets</b> {{is based upon the}} astrological symbolism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> from the Sun. The composer Colin Matthews wrote an eighth movement entitled Pluto, the Renewer, first performed in 2000. In 1937, another British composer, Constant Lambert, wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called Horoscope. In 1974, the New Zealand composer Edwin Carr wrote The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment for orchestra without strings. Camille Paglia acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism Sexual Personae (1990).|$|E
5|$|After {{between three}} and tenmillion years, the young Sun's solar wind would have cleared away all the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disc, blowing it into {{interstellar}} space, thus ending the growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although radial {{velocity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star only gives a planet's minimum mass, if <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> spectral lines {{can be distinguished}} from the star's spectral lines then <b>the</b> {{radial velocity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> itself can be found, and this gives <b>the</b> inclination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> orbit. This enables measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> actual mass. This also rules out false positives, and also provides data about <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> <b>The</b> main issue is that such detection is possible only if <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> orbits around a relatively bright star and if <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> reflects or emits a lot of light.|$|R
5|$|In 2014, {{secondary}} transit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> {{was reported}}. Full observation <b>of</b> phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> {{was reported in}} September 2014.|$|R
25|$|Thus, it is {{sufficient}} to observe <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star (<b>planet)</b> and to estimate <b>the</b> density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> (satellite) to compute <b>the</b> Roche limit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> (satellite) in <b>the</b> stellar (planetary) system.|$|R
5|$|During the 18–19th centuries, {{the study}} of the three body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert led to more {{accurate}} predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Lagrange and Laplace, allowing the masses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.|$|E
5|$|None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> are in low-ratio orbital resonances, {{in which}} {{multiple}} planets gravitationally tug on and stabilize each other's orbits, resulting in simple ratios of their orbital periods. However, b and c {{are close to}} a 5:4 ratio.|$|E
5|$|The {{discoveries of}} HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b were {{reported}} {{together in the}} Astrophysical Journal. The paper was submitted on June 6, 2011. The authors of the discovery paper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> suggested the usage of the Spitzer Space Telescope to observe the occultation of HAT-P-33b behind its star to better define its characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Those {{relatively}} rare comets with orbits of about 10,000AU have probably gone through {{one or more}} orbits through the Solar System and have had their orbits drawn inward by the gravity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 has {{a notable}} orbital arrangement. It {{is the first}} {{planetary}} system around a normal star to have mutual inclination between planets measured without transits (previously the mutual inclination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions). Later measurements reduced {{the value of the}} mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does not result in significant improvements relative to coplanar solutions.|$|E
5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} {{probability of a}} chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios {{for the end of}} the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{duration}} <b>of</b> a trip depends only on <b>the</b> density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> and <b>the</b> gravitational constant, {{but not on}} <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the clustering of the perihelia and the orbital poles of distant objects, Planet Nine offers explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna and , for objects with orbits roughly perpendicular to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets,</b> for high inclination TNOs with semi-major axes less than 100 AU, and for the tilt of the Sun's rotation axis. The objects it dynamically controls would form a cloud centered on its semi-major axis {{with a wide range}} of inclinations.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> in the Solar System have {{secondary}} {{systems of}} their own, being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons (two of which, Titan and Ganymede, {{are larger than}} the planet Mercury), and, {{in the case of}} the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{exhibits}} in the revamped Astrocentre {{included a}} new 50-seat mini-theatre, wall murals illustrating the {{phases of the}} moon, plus {{an increasing number of}} hands-on exhibits and interactive computer-driven displays. There were also displays of astronomical globes, an orrery and pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets,</b> many taken by contemporary space probes. The Astrocentre also featured the world's first commercial Stellarium, a slowly rotating display containing a 3D representation of almost a thousand stars in our immediate stellar neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|Planets are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> are orbited {{by one or more}} natural satellites.|$|E
