25|$|In 1977, a {{graduate}} student in the computer science department named Bill Joy (MS 1982) assembled the original Berkeley Software Distribution, commonly known as BSD Unix. Joy, who went on to co-found Sun Microsystems, also developed the original version of the terminal console editor vi, while Ken Arnold (BA 1985) created Curses, a terminal control library for Unix-like systems that enables the construction of text user interface (TUI) applications. Working alongside Joy at Berkeley were undergraduates William Jolitz (BS 1997) and his future wife Lynne Jolitz (BA 1989), who together created 386BSD, a version of BSD Unix that runs on Intel CPUs and evolved into the BSD family of free operating systems and the Darwin operating system underlying Apple Mac OS X.

The Times reported, [...] "None of the Democrats interviewed {{went so far as}} to suggest that the email issue raised concerns about Mrs. Clinton's ability to serve as president, and many expressed a belief that it had been manufactured by Republicans in Congress and other adversaries." [...] At the same time, many Democratic leaders showed increasing frustration among party leaders of Clinton's handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>email</b> issue. For example, Edward G. Rendell, former governor of Pennsylvania, a Clinton supporter, said that a failure of the Clinton campaign to get ahead of the issue early on meant that the campaign was [...] "left just playing defense."

Late in the hearing, Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio accused Clinton of changing her accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>email</b> service, leading to a [...] "heated exchange" [...] in which Clinton said that she had erred in making a private email account, but denied having dealt with anything marked classified, instead seeking [...] "to be transparent by publicly releasing her emails." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Suede disbanded {{at the end}} of 2003, Anderson asked Suede's manager Charlie Charlton for Butler's phone number, who soon {{informed}} the former guitarist to expect a call. The pair, who had not spoken to one another since 1994, were spotted drinking in London just four days after Suede's final gig. In 2004, they resurfaced with a project named The Tears. The following year they released the album Here Come the Tears, which was well received by critics. Despite making the UK Top 15, it failed to generate broader interest beyond their hardcore fanbase. One review remarked that the record was not [...] "far from the records Suede made without their errant guitarist". The band has not worked since 2006. Anderson has released four solo albums: Brett Anderson (2007), Wilderness (2008), Slow Attack (2009) and Black Rainbows (2011); with the exception of his latest effort, his discography has garnered a mixed reaction. Butler has been working as a producer, collaborating with artists such as Black Kids, Sons and Daughters, Duffy and Kate Nash. Simon Gilbert played with local Bangkok band Futon, while Richard Oakes started working with Sean McGhee in a duo called Artmagic, whose debut album Become The One You Love, was released in 2012.

2500|$|In 2001 and 2002 the {{brothers}} published five papers in peer-reviewed physics journals, including Annals of Physics and Classical and Quantum Gravity. [...] The {{controversy over the}} Bogdanovs' work began on October 22, 2002, with an email sent by University of Tours physicist Max Niedermaier to University of Pittsburgh physicist Ezra T. Newman. [...] Niedermayer suggested that the Bogdanovs' Ph.D. theses and papers were [...] "spoof," [...] created by throwing together string theory and theoretical physics jargon: [...] "The abstracts are delightfully meaningless combinations of buzzwords ... which apparently have been taken seriously." [...] Copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>email</b> reached American mathematical physicist John Baez, and on October 23 he created a discussion thread about the Bogdanovs' work on the Usenet newsgroup sci.physics.research, titled [...] "Physics bitten by reverse Alan Sokal hoax?" [...] Baez was comparing the Bogdanovs' publications to the 1996 Sokal affair, in which physicist Alan Sokal successfully submitted an intentionally nonsensical paper to a cultural studies journal in order to criticize the incoherence of postmodernism. The Bogdanovs quickly became a popular discussion topic, with most respondents agreeing that the papers were flawed. [...] The Bogdanovs' background in entertainment lent some plausibility {{to the idea that}} they were attempting a deliberate hoax, but Igor Bogdanov quickly denied the accusation.

500|$|In a joint {{statement}} released on July 15, 2015, <b>the</b> inspector general <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Department and <b>the</b> inspector general <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intelligence community said that their review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emails</b> found information that was classified when sent, remained so at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> their inspection and [...] "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system." [...] They also stated unequivocally that this classified information {{should never have been}} stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emails</b> in question fell into the so-called [...] "born classified" [...] category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emails</b> [...] "contained classified State Department information when originated." [...] In May 2016, <b>the</b> inspector general <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.|$|R
