5|$|In mid-May, Operation Trio was {{followed}} by the joint Italian-Chetnik offensive against Partisan detachments within the Italian zone of <b>occupation</b> <b>in</b> eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, with similar effects: the Partisans lost almost all of the liberated territory in these areas. This offensive is also considered part of the Third Enemy Offensive in Yugoslav historiography. After Operation Trio, NDH forces remained south of the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones of <b>occupation,</b> <b>in</b> spite of protests from the Italians.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} of labour was diverse and had been evolving over the centuries. During the 8th–11th centuries, there were on average 63 unique <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> the primary {{sector of economic activity}} (extractive), 697 unique <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> the secondary sector (manufacturing), and 736 unique <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> the tertiary sector (service). By the 12th century, the number of unique <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> the primary sector and secondary sector decreased to 35 and 679 respectively, while the number of unique <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> the tertiary sector increased to 1,175. These changes in the {{division of}} labour reflect the increased mechanization and use of machinery to replace manual labour and the increased standard of living and quality of life of most citizens in the Caliphate.|$|R

30|$|The {{empirical}} results {{state that}} knowing, or if necessary estimating from past occupations, two spouses’ current occupations, helps predict whether their marriage will dissolve. Specifically more dissimilar <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> terms of activities destabilize a marriage, and more dissimilar <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> terms of knowledge stabilize a marriage. This finding is apparent among households with either one spouse or two spouses employed, {{as well as}} both groups pooled together. It is found consistently using multiple methods for estimating missing <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> single earner households.|$|R

5|$|The American <b>occupation</b> <b>in</b> 1898 {{introduced}} {{a new breed of}} architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila. Part of the Burnham's plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture. In Iloilo, a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American <b>occupation</b> <b>in</b> the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real.|$|E

Loper therefore remained at West Point as a student officer until 11 June 1919, when he again graduated, and was assigned to the US Army Corps of Engineers, as was normal for highly placed graduates. At this time, officers who had not served overseas were sent to Europe to tour the battlefields, and Loper visited battlefields in France, Belgium and Italy, as well as the Army of <b>Occupation</b> <b>in</b> Germany.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, {{largely based}} on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the main <b>occupation</b> <b>in</b> the central and western parts of the county. There are a mix of large and small farm businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the farming industry supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and value-added food products.|$|E
5|$|Air Mata Iboe was {{the last}} film {{produced}} by Majestic Film Company, which closed following the Japanese occupation. During the occupation Njoo, Fifi Young, and Fred Young established their own travelling theatrical troupe, Pantjawarna, though all returned to cinema in the 1950s. Joego likewise returned to film after spending the <b>occupation</b> <b>in</b> theater. Poniman, Sarosa, Ismail, and Soerip all returned to cinema, {{the men in the}} 1950s and Soerip in 1973. Soelami is not recorded as acting in any further productions.|$|E

30|$|The average {{hourly wage}} is {{approximately}} 9.5 euros. However, {{the distribution of}} wages is right-skewed and scattered. Astonishingly, the author finds that the average hourly wages of women in STEM are lower on average compared to other <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> the data set (see Table 2). This is surprising because <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> STEM {{are known to have}} high wage premiums. This contradiction in the sample is caused by different wage patterns in Eastern European countries. <b>Occupations</b> <b>in</b> STEM reflect lower educational levels and wages in these countries because of specifics in these countries’ histories (see OECD (2012)). If Eastern European countries are excluded, the data set shows the expected right-skewed wage distribution with higher wages, on average, for <b>occupations</b> <b>in</b> STEM. Additionally, higher levels of education show higher levels of wages than lower and middle levels of education.|$|R

5|$|Evidence {{of prehistoric}} human <b>occupation</b> <b>in</b> the parish {{exists in the}} form of 30 round barrows, about half of which are sited over chalk and half over Reading Beds. Many of the barrows have been damaged by more recent activities. The remains of strip lynchets of 'Celtic' fields have been found near a few of the barrows. One of the three 'Rainbarrows' on Duddle Heath has been excavated; bucket urns {{containing}} cremations from the site were taken to the Dorset County Museum.|$|E
5|$|Farming was {{the main}} <b>occupation</b> <b>in</b> Urmston until the early 19th century, when weaving became a {{significant}} source of employment, although this later declined due to competition from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594. By 1901, farming had virtually died out, and the town became a residence for the middle classes.|$|E

Their next production, Siti Akbari (1940), was similarly successful, although again not as profitable as Terang Boelan or Fatima. Saeroen, Joshua Wong, and Mochtar left the company in 1940: Wong and Mochtar after payment disputes, and Saeroen to return to journalism. Through 1941 Tan's Film produced fewer movies than its competitors, and was ultimately shut down following the Japanese <b>occupation</b> <b>in</b> early 1942.|$|E
