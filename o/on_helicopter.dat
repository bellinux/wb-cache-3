25|$|Following the {{decommissioning}} of Melbourne without replacement {{in the early}} 1980s, the Fleet Air Arm was reorganised to focus <b>on</b> <b>helicopter</b> operations from frigate-size ships, although fixed-wing aviation within the RAN continued with land-based aircraft used for patrols, electronic warfare training, transport, and hydrographic survey.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect is}} a {{consequence}} of sand hitting helicopter rotors in sandy environments. Abrasion strips <b>on</b> <b>helicopter</b> rotor blades are made of metal, often titanium or nickel, which are very hard, but less hard than sand. When a helicopter flies low to the ground in desert environments, sand striking the rotor blade can cause erosion. At night, sand hitting the metal abrasion strip causes a visible corona or halo around the rotor blades. The effect is caused by the pyrophoric oxidation of eroded particles and is known as the Kopp-Etchells Effect.|$|E
500|$|The {{new plan}} {{appeared}} to make everybody happy, and a $2 million joint-services contract {{managed by the}} Air Force was awarded to Avro to build and test two Avrocars, which the Army {{referred to as the}} VZ-9-AV (with AV standing for [...] "Avro," [...] an unusual departure from normal U.S. Army nomenclature), {{the latest in a series}} of [...] "VZ" [...] aircraft. Army interest in the Avrocar program was apparently very high. Bernard Lindenbaum of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory recalls a trip to Washington in the late 1950s to request additional funding for a study <b>on</b> <b>helicopter</b> drag reduction. Although the funding was approved, he overheard an Army General remark that the Huey would be the last helicopter the Army would buy since the helicopter would be replaced by the Avrocar.|$|E
500|$|While Deny Flight was {{relatively}} successful in stopping flights of fixed-wing aircraft, NATO forces {{found it very}} difficult to stop helicopter flights, which presented a more complicated challenge. All sides in the conflict used helicopters extensively for non-military purposes, and some of these flights were authorized by the UN. Under the operation's rules of engagement, NATO fighters were only authorized to shoot down helicopters that committed a hostile act. Otherwise, NATO fighters issued orders to [...] "land or exit", in other words, land the aircraft or leave the no-fly zone. Typically, helicopters in Bosnian airspace complied with these orders by landing, but then took off again after NATO forces departed. None of the parties in the conflict respected the ban <b>on</b> <b>helicopter</b> flights, as evidenced when Ratko Mladić responded to a BBC journalist's question about his violation of the ban with the statement, [...] "The commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces does not ride on a donkey." ...|$|E

50|$|Take <b>On</b> <b>Helicopters</b> {{received}} mostly positive reviews, being {{praised for}} its gameplay and scenery, but receiving criticism for its storyline.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{decommissioning}} {{of the aircraft}} carrier [...] in 1982 and the disbandment of fixed-wing aviation squadrons in 1984, the RAN Fleet Air Arm became focused <b>on</b> <b>helicopter</b> operations, but had minimal experience flying helicopters from small ships. To remedy this, a Bell Kiowa was embarked aboard Adelaide during 1984. Adelaide was awarded the Gloucester Cup for being the most efficient ship in the RAN during 1984.|$|E
2500|$|Gurney flaps {{have found}} wide {{application}} <b>on</b> <b>helicopter</b> horizontal stabilizers, because they operate over {{a very wide}} range of {{both positive and negative}} angles of attack. At one extreme, in a high-powered climb, the negative angle of attack of the horizontal stabilizer can be as high as -25°; [...] at the other extreme, in autorotation, it may be +15°. As a result, at least half of all modern helicopters built in the West have them in one form or another.|$|E
2500|$|When {{it landed}} on 30 July, the 3d South Vietnamese Marine Corps Battalion met heavy resistance. They {{immediately}} attacked the communists, {{who were in}} a wooded area north of the landing zone. More marines were airlifted into the landing zone under continuous communist fire. For five hours the marines attacked prepared Vietcong defensive positions, who fired light and heavy machine guns and mortars. In contrast, the marines relied <b>on</b> <b>helicopter</b> gunships and artillery. The 3d Marine Battalion fought the enemy throughout the afternoon, capturing some communist equipment.|$|E

The Army will deploy the Nag on ground based launchers and from helicopters, whereas the Air Force will rely <b>on</b> <b>helicopter</b> based units. The Nag has an Imaging Infrared (IIR) seeker and has a top and direct attack capability, with a tandem warhead. The Army's land missile carrier and launcher, known as the Namica, carries several ready to use Nag missiles within and four Nag missiles in an extendable launcher above the turret. The Namica has its own FLIR based sighting and fire control unit.|$|E

50|$|Much of the {{helitack}} crews' training centers <b>on</b> <b>helicopter</b> safety, as {{the crews}} typically load and unload with the rotors turning, {{and sometimes in}} very rough terrain, where only the skid on one side can be touched down.|$|E

50|$|Benefits of the NOTAR system include {{increased}} safety (the {{tail rotor}} being vulnerable), and greatly reduced external noise as tail rotors <b>on</b> <b>helicopters</b> produce {{a lot of}} noise. NOTAR-equipped helicopters are among the quietest certified helicopters.|$|R

50|$|In 1956, the Army Aviation Center began {{assembling}} {{and testing}} weapons <b>on</b> <b>helicopters.</b> These tests, conducted while the Air Force still theoretically had exclusive responsibility for aerial fire support, {{led to the}} development of armament systems for Army helicopters.|$|R
