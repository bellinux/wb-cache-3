5|$|The gorge {{has over}} 225species <b>of</b> <b>wildflowers,</b> plants and trees, with {{scattered}} stands of old growth forest {{on some of}} its steepest walls. The rest of the gorge is covered with thriving second growth forest that can be over one hundred years old. Since clearcutting, nearly 90percent of the forest land has burnt at least once. Typical south-facing slopes here have mountain laurel below oak and hickory trees, while north-facing slopes tend to have ferns below hemlocks and hardwoods. Large chestnuts and black cherry can also be found.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was a profusion <b>of</b> <b>wildflowers</b> in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species <b>of</b> <b>wildflowers.</b> Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a few places where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E

5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September {{but most are}} gone by late August. Moisture from snow-melt along with some {{rainfall}} in late spring kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number <b>of</b> <b>wildflowers</b> and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow {{in the area are}} the arrow-leaved balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, desert parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, paintbrush, scorpionweed, scabland penstemon and the wild onion.|$|E
5|$|The {{banks of}} Pine Creek and Spring Creek {{are lined with}} large rock and cliff {{formations}} that provide habitat to plants ranging from large trees to moss to hanging vines. The cliffs harbor plants rare {{in the state of}} Illinois such as Canada yew and sullivantia (family Saxifragaceae), an Illinois state-threatened species. When in season, the park's many species <b>of</b> <b>wildflowers</b> bloom, some of the flowers found in the park include: trout lily, Solomon's seal, bloodroot, blue-eyed grass, spring beauty, and hepatica. The forest undergrowth provides small mammal habitat and among the mammals that {{can be seen in the}} park are: red squirrels, raccoons, deer, and chipmunks. Birds include, the pine thrush, warblers, wild turkey, and winter-migratory birds. The creeks are populated with smallmouth bass, rock bass, channel catfish and, when they are stocked by the IDNR, rainbow trout.|$|E

The diversity of such habitats {{in such a}} concentrated area make it a natural magnet for all forms of wildlife. In addition to the above-mentioned there are {{a wide variety of}} fish species that can be found in both, Darby Creek, the lifeblood of Tinicum Marsh, as well as the 145 acre (0.6km2) impoundment and the smaller, Hoy's Pond. They include brown bullhead, channel catfish, crappie, carp and small striped bass that utilize the wider expanses of Darby Creek, just before its confluence with the Delaware River, in the earlier stages of their development.
