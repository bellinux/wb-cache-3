40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to exhibit some non-trivial {{examples}} of quadratic Lie superalgebras such that <b>the</b> <b>even</b> part is a reductive Lie algebra and <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> part on <b>the</b> odd part is not completely reducible and to give an inductive description of this class of quadratic Lie superalgebras. <b>The</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> generalized double extension of quadratic Lie superalgebras proposed by I.

Benayadi, M.  Bordemann, Generalized double extension and descriptions of quadratic Lie superalgebras, 2007, arXiv:math-ph/ 0712. 0228] is of crucial importance in this work.
