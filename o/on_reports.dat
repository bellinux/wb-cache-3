5|$|French {{casualties}} {{are hard}} to calculate, as the best available source is the vague totals submitted by Duckworth in his account to the Admiralty.

These accounts were subsequently called into question by historian William James, who considered them too high. James also criticised the assumed totals for Impérial and Diomède, which are even less certain but reportedly totalled 500 and 250 respectively. In addition to those killed and wounded, the entire surviving crews of Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave were taken prisoner, as were 150 men from Diomède and six from Impérial seized by British boarding parties on 8 February.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carol in 1953 was {{the strongest}} storm of the 1953 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season and the first Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the 1938 New England hurricane. Carol is also the first named storm to attain Category 5 status. Carol developed on August28 off {{the west coast of}} Africa, although the Weather Bureau did not initiate advisories until five days later. On September2, Carol attained hurricane status, based on a ship report. It moved northwestward, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h), based <b>on</b> <b>reports</b> from the Hurricane Hunters. After weakening, it brushed Bermuda and turned northeastward near New England, passing west of Nova Scotia before making landfall near Saint John, New Brunswick on September7. While crossing Atlantic Canada, Carol became an extratropical cyclone, which dissipated on September9 southwest of Greenland.|$|E

5|$|The {{first full}} {{description}} of diabetic ketoacidosis {{is attributed to}} Julius Dreschfeld, a German pathologist working in Manchester, United Kingdom. In his description, which he gave in an 1886 lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in London, he drew <b>on</b> <b>reports</b> by Adolph Kussmaul as well as describing the main ketones, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, and their chemical determination. The condition remained almost universally fatal until the discovery of insulin in the 1920s; by the 1930s, mortality had fallen to 29 percent, and by the 1950s it had become less than 10 percent.

5|$|The first {{tropical}} cyclone and hurricane of the 1861 season {{is believed to}} have formed on July 6, immediately east of the Leeward Islands. A 1938 publication documented the storm's effects on Guadeloupe and St. Kitts, and given a lack of prior reports on the cyclone, modern-day reassessments concluded that it was relatively weak when it affected those islands. After crossing the northern Leeward Islands, the tropical storm broadly curved toward the northwest, likely intensifying into the equivalence of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on July 9. The majority of the storm's track in the western Atlantic was unknown until it was reconstructed based <b>on</b> <b>reports</b> from, and the effects on, three ships in its vicinity.|$|E
5|$|While {{still in}} the Southern Hemisphere spring, the {{intertropical}} convergence zone (ITCZ) was active across the southern Indian Ocean {{in the middle of}} October. On October18, a low pressure area formed, based <b>on</b> <b>reports</b> from nearby ships. It moved southeastward and slowly intensified, given the name Alex. Located southwest of Sumatra, the storm curved to the south. Late on October21, Alex attained peak winds of 150km/h (90mph), or above tropical cyclone status. For several days, it maintained much of its intensity while curving to the southwest. The storm eventually weakened due to strong wind shear deteriorating the convection. On October27, Alex dissipated.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} {{system on the}} tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression on August 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward. Convection became more organized, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three on August 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on August 11, based <b>on</b> <b>reports</b> from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path. A trough of {{low pressure}} near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on August 22. Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an eye feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and on August 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on August 28 over Spain.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was first identified {{north of the}} Leeward Islands near the Virgin Islands at 0000UTC on August3. Due {{to a lack of}} conclusive weather reports from nearby areas at the time, the origins of the tropical storm were initially unknown, but listed the system as forming near Trinidad and Barbados in the HURDAT—the database listing all tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin since 1851. However, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project analyzed the storm to have formed north of the Leeward Islands based <b>on</b> <b>reports</b> from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and as such revised the storm's HURDAT listing. Moving to the west-northwest, the tropical storm maintained its intensity without any intensification early in its existence. Ships in the region reported tropical storm-force winds and low barometric pressures. The ship S.S. Sixaola sent a telegraphic report of the storm's location and existence west of Acklins Island on August5, the first ship to explicitly do so. Beginning to accelerate as it paralleled the Cuban Atlantic coast the following day, the storm intensified to reach an intensity equivalent to a modern-day Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a subtropical low, the cyclone tracked northeastward through Georgia, before turning eastward and exiting South Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean. Its track {{was influenced by}} the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, which is a large belt of high pressure. While moving over land, the cyclone had become better organized, and on August 15 it transitioned into a tropical depression about 70 miles (110 kilometres) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The depression strengthened further, and based <b>on</b> <b>reports</b> from the Hurricane Hunters, it intensified into Tropical Storm Charley late on August 15. With a weak ridge to its north, the storm initially tracked slowly eastward just off the coast of North Carolina, before turning to the north-northeast as a trough approached from the west. A broad cyclone, Charley gradually intensified, and a single ring of convection around the center developed into an eyewall. At 1200 UTC on August 17, it attained hurricane status about 13 mi (21 km) off the North Carolina coastline. About two hours later, Hurricane Charley made landfall near Cape Fear, and it subsequently moved across the eastern portion of the state.|$|E
