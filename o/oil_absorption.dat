40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out how yolk and <b>oil</b> globule <b>absorption</b> in Siganus guttatus proceed as the {{digestive}} tract develops, in order to determine the probable causes of early larval mortality. Yolk and <b>oil</b> globule <b>absorption</b> in the rabbitfish were compared with the same processes in the more sturdy seaperch larvae during the first 10 days of larval life under identical rearing conditions in 32 â€° sea water at 27 Â°â€“ 30 Â°C. The rapid decline of yolk in both species coincided with the rapid development of the digestive system within 24 h from hatching, indicating that most of the yolk was used for organogenesis. Whereas yolk was depleted in both fish in 3 days, the oil globule persisted in the rabbitfish only for 4 days and in the seaperch for 7 days. Oil globule depletion in the rabbitfish coincided with a negative mean length increment, implying an energy deficit even when the larvae had already started to feed. Ultrastructural observations of the gut epithelia of the rabbitfish revealed pinocytosis in the hindgut cells immediately after ingestion of rotifers, well in advance of complete yolk and <b>oil</b> globule <b>absorption.</b> Therefore, starvation due to exhaustion of the endogenous energy reserves in addition to the physical inability to feed were ruled out as major causes of larval mortality in rabbitfish...|$|R

The findings were applied to the for. mulation of the'steroid prednisolone, in an attempt to produce elevated more uniform plasma drug levels by enhancing lymphatic absorption. The rank order for total DOT absorption from 1 m! Volumes of different vehicles was arachis oil > Miglyol 812 = water containing 6 % Tween 80 > liquid paraffin. The concentration of DDT in lymph collected via thoracic duct cannblae in anaesthetised rats was greatest in the presence of arachis oil, there being no difference between Miglyol 812 and liquid paraffin. Using a gamma camera the gastric emptying rate and total intestinal transit of 9 ~c-sulphur colloid, an oil phase marker, was shown to be faster in the presence of 1 ml liquid paraffin than the other two <b>oils.</b> The oral <b>absorption</b> of 3 H-prednisolone was independent of the nature of the oily vehicle (30 pl volumes) and was not selectively absorbed into the lymph. Esterification to 3 H-prednisolone- 21 -palmitate increased the lipophilicity of the drug but did not stimulate selective lymphatic absorption and reduced oral absorption following administration in arachis <b>oil.</b> Lymphatic <b>absorption</b> of the ester was not promoted by administration in 1 ml arachis oil. Only the lymphatic absorption of compounds exhibiting selective uptake into the lymph may be enhanced by the presence of a suitable lipid vehicle. Altered gastro-intestinal motility in the presence of lipids may have greater potential for enhancing the absorption of a wider variety of compounds...|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of solar}} UV {{radiation}} on the biosphere {{are well known}} {{and a lot of}} studies are going on to reduce its dangerous effects on human beings. Atmospheric ozone layer is not uniform over the globe, so that less ozone over tropics makes it receive more UV insolation, than high latitude places. People in the tropics are continuously exposed to high UV dosage, leading to skin reddening and the dangerous “sun stroke. ” In southern India people use some vegetable oils to protect the skin from sun heat. Studies of “sun stroke” show that people having skin of moderate colour are the main victims. In some parts of Southern Kerala like Kottayam, Ernakulam, and Alappuzha traditional people were using oil extracted from chicken, called “chicken oil,” for the treatment of “heat burns” and other types of burns. This motivated us to study the UV absorption characteristics of chicken oil, and compare them with that of other commonly used vegetable oils. It is found that the chicken <b>oil</b> shows maximum <b>absorption</b> of UV radiation of about 85 %, and neem <b>oil</b> shows <b>absorption</b> of about 60 %. Other oils show comparatively very low absorption of UV radiation. So this property of chicken oil may be the reason for using it as remedy for heat burns...|$|R

Newly hatched larvae were transferred to 40 -L aquaria at a density of 1500 individuals/aquarium. Larvae were exposed to different levels of aeration (0 mL/min per L, 0. 62 mL/min per L, 1. 25 mL/min per L, 2. 50 mL/min per L, or 3. 75 mL/min per L); salinity (8 ppt, 16 ppt, 24 ppt, 32 ppt, or 40 ppt); and light intensity (0 lx, 120 lx, 230 lx, 500 lx, or 700 lx) for 4 â€“ 6 days. Twenty larvae were sampled daily at 11 : 00 hours to measure for total length (TL), oil globule volume, and feeding incidence. Survival rates were determined by counting the total number of larvae remaining in each aquarium at the end of the experiment. Significantly higher survival rates (P < 0. 05) were observed at aeration levels of 0. 62 mL/min per L and 1. 25 mL/min per L, at salinity levels of 16 ppt and 24 ppt, and at light intensities of 500 lx and 700 lx.
