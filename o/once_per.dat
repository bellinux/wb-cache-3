5|$|A {{royal decree}} on 26 October 1967 {{established}} an Oslo-based chief inspector {{who was to}} inspect the facility at least <b>once</b> <b>per</b> year, and a local inspector who would inspect the facility at least <b>once</b> <b>per</b> week. The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's assistant director of radio technology, Per Mortensen, was appointed chief inspector, while the manager of Ny-Ålesund's coast radio station was appointed assistant inspector. The ground station and auxiliary facilities were ready for operation in 1967. Through its history, the station had five managers: Henning Nielsen (1965–67), Roald Søfteland (1967–68), Ewald Øyen (1968–70), Einar Enderud (1970–72) and Kristian Sneltvedt (1972–74).|$|E

5|$|From {{the first}} {{announcement}} {{to the actual}} launch of the product, Microsoft made some significant changes to the console. Initially the system was {{to be able to}} play a disc-based game without the disc after the initial install; however, this came with a requirement that the users would have to connect online <b>once</b> <b>per</b> day, as well as restrictions on used games. These policies were reversed in June 2013.|$|E

30|$|In {{the current}} study, 37.7 % of epileptic {{children}} had daily or weekly seizures. This frequency {{was the most}} commonly encountered one among early and late childhood. It tends to regress slightly among adolescence where monthly seizures became the most prevailing one. This is in agreement with Hamdy [14] who found that the highest frequency of seizures was <b>once</b> or more <b>per</b> week (47.3 %), followed by seizures occurring <b>once</b> or more <b>per</b> month (24.3 %) and <b>once</b> or more <b>per</b> day (18.9 %). Salih and colleagues [32] reported that age was not a driving factor to influence the seizure frequency in the studied patients. Moreover, a study conducted in the USA demonstrated no significant correlation between {{the changes in the}} seizure frequency and age [33].|$|R
30|$|The {{future of}} Siberut macaques will unavoidably be closely {{connected}} to habitat degradation and loss. As macaques are generally omnivorous, {{they have the}} advantage of being able to adapt more easily to habitat changes than more specialized primates. However, as fruit constitutes a large percentage of their diet, they are likely to raid crops on farms if their original forest habitat does not supply enough fruit anymore, and this would increase conflicts with local people. In Siberut, local people traditionally hunt and trap primates, and Siberut macaques are caught in ground traps baited with sago, with which they can trap a whole group at <b>once</b> (<b>pers.</b> comm. by C. Abegg). Thus, Siberut macaques will become more vulnerable with increasing habitat loss and degradation.|$|R

5|$|The tuatara's greenish brown colour matches its environment, and {{can change}} over its lifetime. Tuatara shed their skin at least <b>once</b> <b>per</b> year as adults, and {{three or four}} times a year as juveniles. Tuatara sexes differ in more than size. The spiny crest on a tuatara's back, made of triangular, soft folds of skin, is larger in males, and can be {{stiffened}} for display. The male abdomen is narrower than the female's.|$|E
5|$|A Project Leader {{is elected}} <b>once</b> <b>per</b> {{year by the}} developers. The leader has special powers, {{but they are not}} absolute, and {{appoints}} delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may recall the leader, reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method is based on the Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).|$|E

This method does not promote a fine cylinder buoyancy balance across the torso.|$|R
5|$|Beginning on June 28, 2011, the PHP Group {{implemented}} a timeline {{for the release}} of new versions of PHP. Under this system, at least one release should occur every month. <b>Once</b> <b>per</b> year, a minor release should occur which may include new features. Every minor release should at least be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year release process for every minor release. No new features, unless small and self-contained, are to be introduced into a minor release during the three-year release process.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with {{statehood}} in 1859, {{the court}} had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state. The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court judges and supreme court justices. This was set to remain until {{the population of the}} state reached 100,000 people. Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least <b>once</b> <b>per</b> year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed. On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate in the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Both parents remain {{involved}} in guarding the fry from brood predators {{and engage in}} behaviors to assist feeding such as moving leaves or fin digging (digging up the substrate with their fins). Brood care of eggs, larvae and free-swimming juveniles in the wild can last 4 to 6 weeks, and occurs only <b>once</b> <b>per</b> season {{for the majority of}} females. In contrast, females in aquaria are known to breed many times per year with short intervals of 12 or 13 days between broods, as long as suitable rocks or similar surfaces are available for them to lay their eggs on.|$|E

Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only <b>once</b> <b>per</b> week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment on the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971, the NTSB {{released}} a report summarizing {{the findings of a}} study of midair collisions. The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least <b>once</b> <b>per</b> day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years.
