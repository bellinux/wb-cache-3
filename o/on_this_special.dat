Walsh described the initial stage of production as [...] "a very busy period for all of us ... We came in at about 8:30 in the morning and didn't leave until midnight some days. But it all zipped by pretty quickly." [...] He said that they [...] "felt pretty lucky because usually executives involved with productions look at the stop-motion process as annoying, but <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special,</b> they were very jazzed and gung-go about it." [...] To keep the production crew in the Christmas spirit, six months worth of Christmas music was played, which included 83 versions of [...] According to Finnegan, it took about five months to shoot.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene is}} {{the same as that of}} the opening of the opera, in the domain of the Grail, but many years later. Gurnemanz is now aged and bent. It is Good Friday. He hears moaning near his hermit's hut and discovers Kundry {{unconscious}} in the brush, as he had many years before ("Sie! Wieder da!"). He revives her using water from the Holy Spring, but she will only speak the word [...] "serve" [...] ("Dienen"). Gurnemanz wonders if there is any significance to her reappearance <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> day. Looking into the forest, he sees a figure approaching, armed and in full armour. The stranger wears a helmet and the hermit cannot see who it is. Gurnemanz queries him and chides him for being armed on sanctified ground and on a holy day, but gets no response. Finally, the apparition removes the helmet and Gurnemanz recognizes the lad who shot the swan, and joyfully sees that he bears the Holy Spear.|$|E

The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove.

2500|$|On 5 September 2006, the London show celebrated {{what would}} have been Freddie Mercury's 60th birthday. During the song [...] "Don't Stop Me Now", ordinarily sung by Killer Queen, the band [...] "McFly" [...] (who were at No. 1 with the song on the singles charts the {{previous}} week) emerged onto the stage to sing it instead. Brian May and Roger Taylor joined the encore, performing Taylor's [...] "Say It's Not True" [...] as a duo. Ben Elton also addressed the audience <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> occasion. The following week, tickets to the London show were sold from Â£19.46, Mercury's birth year.|$|E
2500|$|One of the pairings <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> program {{involved}} Wendell Niles, {{a long-time}} announcer on many radio shows, including Bob Hope's. [...] The Blue Network gave him and partner Don Prindle a comedy series, Niles and Prindle, [...] which is referenced {{in the special}} as being scheduled for a debut the following month. [...] Little can be found regarding this show, other than it involved two friends [...] "who argued about everything", and had a brief life in 1945. [...] It was certainly most unusual for the Blue to attempt to convert a long-time announcer into a featured comedy star, and in this sense, [...] "Niles and Prindle", if not unique (given that Graham McNamee was the [...] "Perfect Foil" [...] to Ed Wynn), {{it must be said}} to be at least quite singular.|$|E
2500|$|The Fireside Theater (1950) was {{his first}} {{television}} production. The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at Hal Roach Studios rather than performed live on the air. The [...] "telefilms" [...] were syndicated to individual television stations. He was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s. He was associated with ABC's The Hollywood Palace. He was the show's first and most frequent guest host and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children. In the early 1970s, he made two late appearances on the Flip Wilson Show, singing duets with the comedian. His last TV appearance was a Christmas special filmed in London in September 1977 and aired weeks after his death. It was <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> that he recorded a duet of [...] "The Little Drummer Boy" [...] and [...] "Peace on Earth" [...] with rock star David Bowie. Their duet was released in 1982 as a single 45-rpm record and reached No. 3 in the UK singles charts. It has since become a staple of holiday radio and the final popular hit of Crosby's career. At {{the end of the}} 20th century, TV Guide listed the Crosby-Bowie duet as one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.|$|E

60|$|She {{had told}} him about his cousin Owen. Indeed, the greater number of the soft musical words which she had spoken in that long three hours' {{colloquy}} had been spoken <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> point.

60|$|It {{was nearly}} five o'clock when, <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> occasion, the {{secretary}} {{returned from the}} board-room to his own office. Not for a moment had the weight been off his shoulders while Sir Raffle had been bragging or Mr Optimist making his speech. He had been thinking, not of them, but of Lily Dale; and though they had not discovered his thoughts, they had perceived that he was hardly like himself.|$|E

60|$|Alaric, {{in his own}} defence, {{was obliged}} to declare that {{the rules of the}} service {{especially}} required that he should hold no friendly communication with any one during the time that he was employed <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> service. Poor Captain Cuttwater, grieved to have his good nature checked, was obliged to put up with this excuse, and consoled himself with abusing the Government which could condescend to give so absurd an order.|$|E
60|$|But {{our friends}} were at once imbued with the {{tremendous}} {{nature of the}} task before them. A sheikh of the Arabs came forth, who communicated with them through Abdallah. The work could be done, no doubt, he said; but a great many men would be wanted to assist. Each lady must have four Arabs, and each gentlemen three; and then, seeing that the work would be peculiarly severe <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> day, each of these numerous Arabs must be remunerated by some {{very large number of}} piastres.|$|E
50|$|On 25 December 1997, Christmas Day, CBBC showed The Demon Headmaster Takes Over TV, a {{recorded}} {{version of the}} CBBC Pantomime, performed at the CBBC Big Bash in National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham that year.

60|$|<b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> Sunday {{evening she}} was disinclined {{to speak of}} him at all. Not that she loved him more than usual, but that she was {{beginning}} to think that she could not ever really love him at all. She had taught herself to think that he might probably be her husband, and had hitherto felt no such repugnance to her destiny as caused her to shun the subject. But now {{she was beginning to}} think of the matter seriously; and as she did so, she felt that life might have for her a lot more blessed than that of sharing the world with her cousin Harry.|$|E
60|$|Charley had {{not been}} so {{resolute}} with the usurer, so determined to get Â£5 from him <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> day, without a special object in view. His credit was at stake in a more than ordinary manner; he had about a week since borrowed money from the woman who kept the public-house in Norfolk Street, and having borrowed it for a week only, felt that this was a debt of honour which it was incumbent on him to pay. Therefore, when he had walked the length of one street on his road towards his lodgings, he retraced his steps and made his way back to his old haunts.|$|E
60|$|He did not {{recognize}} her, but as he passed on he did recognize Mr. Onesiphorus Dunn, and stopped to speak to him. Or {{it might have been}} that Crosbie's friend Fowler Pratt stopped with this special object,--for Siph Dunn was an intimate friend of Fowler Pratt's. Crosbie and Siph were also acquainted, but in those days Crosbie did not care much for stopping his friends in the Park or elsewhere. He had become moody and discontented, and was generally seen going about the world alone. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> occasion he was having a little special conversation about money with his very old friend Fowler Pratt.|$|E
