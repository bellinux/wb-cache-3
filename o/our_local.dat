5|$|While earlier {{findings}} {{suggested that}} the Milky Way galaxy contained more dark matter than Andromeda, {{and that it could}} be the largest in the Local Group - the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope led to the revelation that the Andromeda galaxy contains one trillion stars; at least twice the amount of the Milky Way’s stars, with the figure being estimated at 200-400 billion. It is also now evident that spanning approximately 220,000 light years across, Andromeda is the largest galaxy in <b>our</b> <b>Local</b> Group, which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and other minor galaxies. The mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5 solar masses, whereas the Milky Way's mass is estimated to be 8.5 solar masses.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two new local {{convergence}} theorems {{as well as}} a semilocal convergence theorem (under computationally verifiable initial conditions and with an a posteriori error estimate) for Ehrlich-type methods (1.18). <b>Our</b> first <b>local</b> convergence result (Theorem  4.6) generalizes Theorem  1.1 (Proinov [11]) and improves Theorem  1.4 (Kjurkchiev and Andreev [16]). <b>Our</b> second <b>local</b> convergence result (Theorem  5.4) generalizes Theorem  1.2 (Proinov [11]), but only in the case p = ∞. Furthermore, several numerical examples are provided to show some practical applications of our semilocal convergence result.|$|R

25|$|Changemaker Central is a student-run {{centralized}} resource hub {{for student}} involvement in social entrepreneurship, civic engagement, service learning {{and community service}} that catalyzes student-driven social change. Changemaker Central locations have opened on all campuses in fall 2011, providing flexible, creative workspaces {{for everyone in the}} ASU community. The project is entirely student run and advances ASU’s institutional commitments to social embeddedness and entrepreneurship. The space allows students to meet, work and join new networks and collaborative enterprises while taking advantage of ASU’s many resources and opportunities for engagement. Changemaker Central has signature programs, including Changemaker Challenge, that support students in their journey to become changemakers by creating communities of support around new solutions/ideas and increasing access to early stage seed funding. The Changemaker Challenge seeks undergraduate and graduate students from across the university who are dedicated to making a difference in <b>our</b> <b>local</b> and global communities through innovation. Students can win up to $10,000 to make their innovative project, prototype, venture or community partnership ideas happen.|$|E

500|$|Mayors from 14 NBA cities {{wrote an}} open letter to NBA {{commissioner}} David Stern and NBPA chief Billy Hunter, requesting that they end the lockout based on [...] "the perspective [...] residents and the negative impact a canceled season might have on them, our cities, and <b>our</b> <b>local</b> economies". Time noted that arena workers would be affected by the cancellation of games. However, separate studies by University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Lake Forest College found no historic significant effect to the economies of cities with sports franchises affected by work stoppages. Explanations included consumer shifting of spending on sporting events to other forms of entertainment, reduced local government spending on crowd and traffic control, and higher productivity by the general workforce without the distraction of games.|$|E

[...] It was asserted that the deal might only be legal if the affected stations were operated under shared services agreements. Sinclair restructured the deal in March 2014, choosing to sell WHP-TV, WMMP and WABM, and terminate an SSA with the Cunningham-owned Fox affiliate WTAT in Charleston to acquire the Allbritton-owned stations in those markets (WCIV, WHTM-TV and WBMA-LD, while also creating a new duopoly between the ABC and CW affiliates in Birmingham), as well as foregoing any operational or financial agreements with the buyers of the stations being sold to other parties.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study G-arc-transitive graphs Δ where the {{permutation}} group G_x^Δ(x) {{induced by the}} stabiliser G_x of the vertex x on the neighbourhood Δ(x) satisfies the two conditions given in the introduction. We show that for such a G-arc-transitive graph Δ, if (x,y) is an arc of Δ, then the subgroup G_x,y^[1] of G fixing pointwise Δ(x) and Δ(y) is a p-group for some prime p. Next we prove that every G-locally primitive (respectively quasiprimitive, semiprimitive) graph satisfies <b>our</b> two <b>local</b> hypotheses. Thus this provides a new Thompson-Wielandt-like theorem for a very large class of arc-transitive graphs. Furthermore, we give various families of G-arc-transitive graphs where <b>our</b> two <b>local</b> conditions do not apply and where G_x,y^[1] has arbitrarily large composition factors...|$|R

As Hedberg emphasized in his autobiography, [...] "to survive and thrive I was determined to get as many local people on the radio as possible, even if that resulted in some hokey stuff. We were talking about people and places and things <b>our</b> <b>locals</b> could relate to, and that WCCO in Minneapolis - our biggest competition - couldn’t duplicate. There was nothing that a big clear channel station in the Twin Cities could do to prevent us from building an audience by being intensely <b>local.</b> <b>Our</b> success wasn’t built on the records we played, but by the things we did in between the music. My hope was the locals didn’t want to miss something." ...|$|R
