40|$|Although {{the close}} {{relationship}} between {{high blood pressure and}} obesity has been pointed out in many epidemiologic or clinical studies, the underlying mechanisms of hypertension in overweight patients still remain unclear. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to clarify the role of water-sodium balance, sympathetic nerve activity, the renin-angiotensin system and renal dopaminergic activity on the hypertensive mechanisms in overweight patients with essential hypertension (EHT). In 113 inpatients with mild to moderate essential hypertension receiving a regular diet containing 200 mEq of sodium, 75 mEq of potassium, 2400 Cal/day, there were significant positive correlations between the <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> (using Minowa's index) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma volume (PV), extracellular fluid volume (ECFV), and total exchangeable sodium (Nae). MAP, PV, ECFV and Nae were greater in obese EHT than those in non-obese EHT. On the other hand, a significant negative correlation was observed between the <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> and plasma noradrenaline concentration (pNA) and plasma renin activity (PRA). The mean values of pNA and PRA in obese EHT were significantly lower than in mildly obese or non-obese EHT. In 41 EHT, following sodium restriction (35 mEq of sodium, 75 mEq of potassium, 2400 Cal/day) for one week, MAP and body weight were significantly decreased and a significant negative correlation was demonstrated between basal <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> and the changes in MAP and body weight following the procedure. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) correlated negatively with the <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> in obese EHT, unlike in mildly obese or non-obese EHT. The mean value of FENa in obese EHT was significantly lower than that in MAP- and endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) -matched mildly obese or non-obese EHT. Following intravenous infusion of dopamine (3 μg/kg/min, 60 min), urinary excretion of sodium (UNa V) and FENa significantly increased. This natriuretic response to infused dopamine was significantly greater in obese EHT than in non-obese EHT. In addition, urinary excretion of free dopamine (uDA) was correlated positively with the <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> in those EHT whose <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> was less than 15 %, but a significant negative correlation was found in patients with an <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> of 15 % or more. These findings suggest that the blunted natriuretic ability, which might be attributed to an ?attenuation of the renal dopaminergic activity, at least in part, may play an important role in the hypertensive mechanisms in obese EHT through the expansion of body fluid volume and sodium...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{levels of}} total amylase, {{pancreatic}} type (P-type) isoamylase, and salivary type (S-type) isoamylase were measured in obese children (153 subjects; mean age, 10. 1 years old; 86 boys and 67 girls) {{before and after}} weight reduction therapy. Serum amylase activities were determined using p-nitrophenylmaltoheptaoside as a substrate, with or without an antibody added to inhibit the S-type isoamylase. Serum levels of total amylase, P-type isoamylase and S-type isoamylase activities were significantly decreased in obese children with an <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> more than 50 %. S-type and P-type isoamylases showed negative correlation with the <b>obesity</b> <b>index,</b> the correlation coefficient being slightly larger in S-type than in P-type isoamylase. Analysis of the serum amylase activities in obese children who underwent weight reduction treatments showed a negative correlation only between the differences in S-type isoamylase activity and {{the differences in the}} <b>obesity</b> <b>index.</b> It may be concluded that the S-type isoamylase activity in serum of obese children is decreased and that it can be increased by reducing their body weight. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Obesity</b> and its <b>indices</b> {{including}} BMI, WHR, and fat% {{are related}} with cardiovascular diseases and {{also involved in}} endothelial dysfunction and endothelium-dependent dilation. However, the correlations of these indices with endothelial function, especially in older women remain very poorly defined. The {{aim of this study}} was investigation on the relationship between some of the <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> with vascular endothelial function after a period of combined circuit training in older women. Subjects were 24 healthy and enable to do physical activity old women from Shahrekord (Chaharmahal and Bakhtiary province, Iran) retirement home (age= 74. 22 ± 4. 46). Subjects were randomly divided to two groups including experimental (n= 12) and control (n= 12). <b>Obesity</b> <b>indices</b> (Fat%, WHR, and BMI) and endothelium-dependent dilation of brachial artery were measured in both experimental and control groups, just before the training protocol starting. Then Experimental group was participated in 12 week (three times a week) combined circuit training program. All of mentioned measurements repeated at the end of 12 th week. The obtained results showed that 12 week combined circuit training program has significant effect on reduction of old women <b>obesity</b> <b>Indices</b> (P≤ 0. 001). Also, a diverse relationship was observed between age, BMI, WHR and Fat% with FMD (flow-mediated dilation) in experimental (BMI: P= 0. 45, r=- 0. 24, WHR: p= 0. 10, r=- 0. 49, Fat%: p= 0. 69,r=- 0. 12, age= 0. 87, r=- 0. 05) and control groups (BMI: P= 0. 18, r=- 0. 41, WHR: p= 0. 62, r=- 0. 15, Fat%: p= 0. 75,r=- 0. 1, age= 0. 757, r=- 0. 1). It seems that use of 12 week combined circuit training has positive effects on <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> and improvement of endothelial function in Iranian old women. Anthropometric measures of <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> may help refine estimations of endothelial health and atherosclerotic state. BMI and WHR were most consistently associated with endothelial dysfunction. Thus, using regular training through the reduction in <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> could improve endothelial function and body composition and eventually reduce atherosclerosis and CVD occurrence in older women. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Central obesity {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a main risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) events.

HYPOTHESIS: Some <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> can be used to predict cardiovascular risk. METHODS: In total, 3199 subjects (age range, 40 - 79 years) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and Framingham risk score tools were used to estimate the 10 -year CV events.

40|$|Background: In this {{prospective}} cohort study, we {{estimated the}} risk of developing more than 1 metabolic risk factor, using different <b>obesity</b> <b>indices.</b> In addition, we investigated the relative usefulness of the <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> for predicting development of such risk factors and calculated optimal cutoffs for the <b>obesity</b> <b>indices.</b> Methods: The cohort comprised 10 038 representative residents of a small city and a rural county who were recruited in 2001 – 2002. Follow-up examinations were conducted every 2 years. Among the 3857 participants without metabolic syndrome at baseline, 1102 new cases occurred during the 6 -year follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> were plotted to compare the usefulness of the <b>obesity</b> <b>indices.</b> Results: The numbers of new cases of multiple metabolic risk factors among people in the highest quintiles of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-height ratio at the baseline examination were 2 to 3 times those in the lowest quintiles. The area under the ROC curve for WHR was significantly higher than that for BMI. The optimal BMI cutoff was 24 kg/m 2 in men and women, and the optimal WC cutoffs were 80 cm and 78 cm in men and women, respectively. Conclusions: Both overall obesity and central obesity predicted risk of developing multiple metabolic risk factors, and WHR appeared to be a better discriminator than BMI. To prevent development of metabolic diseases among Koreans, it might be useful to lower the cutoff for abdominal obesity, as defined by WC.

40|$|ABSTRACT We used {{multiple}} {{linear regression}} to study predictors of systolic blood pressure response (SBPR), i. e., the increase in pressure above baseline after 3, 6, and 9 min of treadmill exercise, in 4262 men and women. Predictors considered were usual SBP, the difference (A SBP) between resting SBP and SBP immediately before exercise, age, education, <b>obesity</b> <b>index,</b> alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, preexercise heart rate and, in women, gonadal hormone use. In men, age, <b>obesity</b> <b>index,</b> and cigarette sr oking were positively associated with SBPR and in women 20 to 49 years old, age, <b>obesity</b> <b>index,</b> an ' alcohol consumption were positively associated with SBPR. In women 50 years old or older, usual SBP was negatively associated with SBPR. In {{both men and women}} a larger A SBP was associated with a smaller SBPR. These results help explain the considerable variation in SBPR, and the A SBP results suggest that potential SBPR may, to certain extent, have a specific, finite range. The similarity of predictor variables for SBPR to predictor variables for hyperten-sion is concordant with the previous observation that a high SBPR may foreshadow subsequent hypertension...|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of females on CVDs risk factors and also the relationship between knowledge and attitude with <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> and biochemical parameters. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 89 women with the age range of 11 to 67 y old and body mass index (BMI) of 24 to 51 kg/m 2. Participants were interviewed face to face using a valid questionnaire in order to evaluate their knowledge and attitude on CVDs risk factors. Blood sampling was implemented after 12 h of overnight fasting. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and lipid profile were assessed by enzymatic methods. Anthropometric measurements were performed and <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> were calculated. Results: More than 70 % of participants had moderate or good knowledge and attitude about CVDs risk factors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{associations}} between {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS) severity and selected anthropometric and <b>obesity</b> <b>indexes.</b> DESIGN: We performed a case-control study. Clinical and electrophysiological severity of CTS was classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on validated scales. Body and hand anthropometric characteristics were measured {{at the time of}} the electrodiagnostic study. We estimated the relative risk ratios (RRRs) of CTS severity by fitting multinomial logistic regression models adjusted by age and sex. In addition, we fitted multivariable models, including age, sex, wrist ratio, hand ratio, body mass index (BMI), and waist/stature ratio. SETTING: Electromyography laboratories. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (N= 1087), those with CTS (n= 340) and those without CTS (n= 747), were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between CTS severity and selected anthropometric and <b>obesity</b> <b>indexes.</b> RESULTS: We observed associations between many anthropometric indexes and CTS severity. Among <b>obesity</b> <b>indexes,</b> the waist/stature ratio, and among hand anthropometric indexes, the wrist/palm ratio, showed the highest RRRs for the clinical and electrophysiological severity scales. The RRRs of severe CTS (adjusted for age and sex) for the wrist/palm ratio were 3. 5 for the clinical scale and 2. 4 for the electrophysiological scale. The RRRs of severe CTS for the waist/stature ratio were 2. 3 for the clinical scale and 2. 0 for the electrophysiological scale. In the multivariable models, both BMI and the waist/stature ratio were associated with the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Different configurations of the body and, in particular, the hand and wrist system may influence the occurrence and severity of CTS. Multiple <b>obesity</b> <b>indexes,</b> possibly including the waist/stature ratio, should be considered when investigating the association between body composition and CTS. Future studies should determine whether in obese subjects with CTS the weight and waist circumference loss produces an improvement in CTS symptoms and recovery of distal conduction velocity of the median nerve...|$|R

So, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate the effects of CRP on <b>obesity</b> <b>indexes,</b> lipid profiles, and functional capacity (FC) in obese men with CHD and to explore whether significant weight reduction affected these risk factors and FC or not. Materials and Methods: In an observational study, we evaluated 536 patients, including 464 non-obese men and 72 obese men. All participants completed CRP for 2 months; then, obese patients were divided into two groups: patients with weight reduction ≥ 5 % and patients who didn′t have significant weight reduction. Data were analyzed with SPSS software version 15. For comparing the mean of outcomes independent t-tests and paired t-tests were used. Results: Results showed following CRP, non-obese men had significant improvement in <b>obesity</b> <b>indexes</b> (P = 0. 00), lipid profiles (P < 0. 05), and FC (P = 0. 00) and in obese men, favorable improvement were seen in <b>obesity</b> <b>indexes</b> (P = 0. 00), FC (P = 0. 00), and total cholesterol (P = 0. 02).

The CT scans were obtained from the apex {{to the base of the}} lung with the same technique as in clinical use (contiguous- 1 -cm sections). The outlines of the lung lobes were traced with a digitizer on CT film and the area of the lung lobes in the crossectional plane was calculated using a personal computer. The lobar volume was determined by the thickness of scan space being multiplied by the total area of all slices in each lobe. We investigated the relationship between the ratios of lobar volume to the whole lung volume by CT and three parameters (age, <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> and smoking index). The ratio of the left upper lobe to the whole lung volume (LUL%) was greatest (25. 4 %), followed by those of the right lower lobe (RLL%), right upper lobe (RUL%), left lower lobe (LLL%) and right middle lobe (RML%).

Height, weight, <b>obesity</b> <b>index,</b> body mass index (BMI), and fat distribution were obtained from each group. Serum lipid, insulin, vitamine B 12, folate, renin, aldosterone, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and homocysteine levels were compared. The carotid IMT and PWV were measured. Arterial wall compliance and distensibility were calculated with the equation. High systolic blood pressure significantly correlated with height, weight, BMI, <b>obesity</b> <b>index,</b> arm circumference, fat mass, and fat distribution. Hypertensive adolescents had significantly greater cIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) and lower elastic properties such as cross-sectional compliance and distensibility of the carotid artery.

Aim. To evaluate whether body fat distribution, birth weight, and family history for diabetes (FHD) were associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children and adolescents. Methods. A total of 439 Italian obese children and adolescents (5 – 18 years) were enrolled. Subjects were divided into 2 groups: prepubertal and pubertal. MetS was diagnosed according to the adapted National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. Birth weight percentile, central <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> (measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), insulin sensitivity (ISI), and disposition index were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression models {{were used to determine}} variables associated with MetS. Results. The prevalence of MetS was 17 %, with higher percentage in adolescents than in children (21 versus 12 %). In the overall population, central <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> was a stronger predictor of MetS than insulin sensitivity and low birth weight. When the two groups were considered, central fat depot remained the strongest predictor o...|$|E
40|$|Fifty-one middle-aged male {{patients}} with {{obstructive sleep apnea}} syndrome (OSAS) were evaluated using two dimensional echocardiography, 24 hour blood pressure measurements, polysomnography, and plasma norepinephrine (NE) measurements. Among these patients, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) or interventricular septal thickness (IVST) ≥ 12 mm), and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) (right ventricular wall thickness (RVT) ≥ 5 mm) were present in 41. 2 % (21 / 51) and 11. 8 % (6 / 51). LVH was present in 50. 0 % of group II (apnea index > 20) patients and in 30. 5 % of group I patients (apnea index < 20). All {{patients with}} LVH had hypertension. RVH was present 21. 4 % in group II patients {{and none of the}} group I patients. IVST, LVPWT, LV mass and <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> were significantly higher in group II than group I. LV mass was significantly correlated with apnea index, the duration of nocturnal oxygen saturation less than 90 %, 24 -hour mean blood pressure, weight, BSA, and <b>obesity</b> <b>index.</b> Apnea index, number of apnea, duration of nocturnal oxygen desaturation less than 90 %, weight, and <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> were significantly greater in patients with both LVH and RVH than in patients without LVH or RVH, or those with only LVH. Plasma NE after waking up significantly increased compared with that before sleep (p< 0. 05). The ratio of plasma NE levels after waking up to those before sleep was significantly correlated with the duration of nocturnal oxygen desaturation less than 90 % (r= 0. 83, p< 0. 05). but not with apnea index. These results suggest that frequent episodes of oxygen desaturation and/or arousal response caused by apnea may contribute to the complication of LVH and RVH in the long term, and apnea-induced cyclical increase in blood pressure and the resulting sustained elevation in blood pressure associated with the increase in afterload sympathetic activity may playa {{role in the development of}} LVH...|$|E

40|$|Background:Obesity is a {{major risk}} factor for the {{development}} of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Although clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that OSA and obesity are strongly associated, few Asian studies have examined the associations between anthropometric <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> and OSA, especially in the Korean population. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of anthropometric <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> on OSA in a Korean population. Methods: Anthropometric indices, including neck circumference, waist circumference, and body mass index, were assessed in 383 consecutive subjects with suspected OSA. Results: Of the 383 subjects assessed, 316 (82. 5 %) were diagnosed with OSA. Neck circumference (r 50. 518), waist circumference (r 50. 570), and body mass index (r 50. 512) were correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index (p, 0. 001, for all).

40|$|Background and Objectives: Some {{studies have}} shown that body fat {{distribution}} pattern, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), which differentiate between gynoid (hip) and android (abdominal) obesity, have a more important role in identification of diseases’ risk compared to body mass index (BMI). This study was conducted aiming at determining the association between type of obesity and level of changes in <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> following weight-loss diet. Methods: This study was performed on 301 women with overweight (BMI> 25) and obesity (BMI> 30), and according to WHR criteria for measuring abdominal obesity, the subjects were divided into three groups: 1) 102 subjects with WHR 0. 85, women with severe abdominal obesity (android). Then, the effect of one month diet with a fixed ratio of macronutrients was assessed on the changes of <b>obesity</b> <b>indices,</b> including weight, BMI, waist circumference (WC), and hip circumference (HC). To investigate <b>obesity</b> <b>indices</b> in the three groups, one-way analysis of variance test was used. The level of significance was considered 0. 05. Results: By following this diet, significant decreases were seen in weight (p< 0. 007), BMI (p< 0. 005), and waist circumference (p< 0. 002) in subjects with severe abdominal boundary obesity (android), compared to those with hip obesity (gynoid). Conclusion: In this study, weight loss diet with a fixed ratio of macronutrients showed that weight loss and body size is associated with type of obesity, this means that the higher is the abdominal obesity, the greater is this difference...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the nutrition and diet related knowledge, attitude, and behavior of elementary school children in Seoul. The subjects included were 439 (male 236, female 203) elementary school children in the 4 th to the 6 th grades. The statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 12. 0 program. The average <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> (OI) was 104. 98 and 99. 82 for male and female subjects, respectively. The average percentage of underweight, normal, overweight and obese of subjects was 33. 7 %, 32. 8 %, 12. 3 %, and 19. 4 %, respectively. The percentage of the underweight group of female subjects was higher than that of the male subjects. The percentage of the obese group of male subjects was higher than that of the female subjects. The average score of nutrition knowledge, nutrition attitude and dietary behavior was 6. 8, 7. 44, and 7. 34, respectively. Dietary behavior of male subjects was positively correlated with parents' education levels, monthly household income and nutrition attitude. Dietary behavior of female subjects was positively correlated with monthly household income, nutrition knowledge and nutrition attitude. Dietary behavior of female subjects was positively correlated with <b>obesity</b> <b>index</b> (OI).

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} fatty acid {{composition}} of erythrocyte membranes, {{in relation to}} <b>obesity</b> <b>indexes</b> and breast cancer risk. Design: A nested case-control study. Setting: The Malmo Diet Cancer cohort, Sweden. Subjects: Among women 50 y or older at baseline (n= 12803), incident breast cancer cases (n= 237) were matched to controls (n= 673) on age and screening date. Methods: A diet history method, a structured questionnaire, anthropometrics and blood samples provided data. Analysis included partial correlation coefficients between dietary fatty acids (DFA) and fatty acids of erythrocyte membranes (EFA), and Spearman's rank order correlations between EFA and four <b>obesity</b> <b>indexes.</b> Conditional logistic regression examined breast cancer risks related to EFA. Results: DFA and EFA from fish and milk, and DFA and EFA linoleic acid, show significant positive associations. Relations are negative between <b>indexes</b> of <b>obesity</b> and "milk'' EFA, but positive between <b>indexes</b> of <b>obesity</b> and <b>indexes</b> of delta 9 - and delta 6 -desaturase enzyme activity. No significant relations were observed between EFA and breast cancer risk. Conclusions: Similar to other studies, dietary fish and milk fatty acids, and linoleic acid, {{are related to the}} corresponding EFA. Breast cancer risk was not significantly related to EFA in this study. However, the findings suggest positive relations between body mass index, body fat per cent and indexes of desaturase activity, and negative relations between central obesity and milk EFA...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{relations}} between health behaviours and health related fitness. METHODS: Subjects were {{a convenience sample}} of 350 healthy adults (172 men, 178 women). Covariance analysis adjusted data for significant influences of age and socioeconomic status. Obesity was assessed by anthropometry and body density. Cardiovascular fitness was assessed and various metabolic measurements were made. Questionnaires on physical activity and health related behaviours were completed. RESULTS: Cigarette abstinence was associated with a small abdominal circumference (men) and a low trunk/extremity skinfold ratio (women). <b>Obesity</b> <b>indices</b> (body mass index, total skinfolds, percent fat, and abdominal circumference) were negatively associated with perceived fitness. Leisure activity and exercise frequency were also negatively linked to some <b>obesity</b> <b>indices.</b> Blood glucose, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were favourably influenced by perceived activity, exercise frequency, and perceived fitness, but not by exercise intensity. Abstinence from coffee was associated with a low cholesterol/HDL ratio (men only). Principal component, discriminant, and multiple logistic regression analyses showed only weak clustering of habitual physical activity with other positive health behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Although multiphasic health promotion programmes are economical, favourable interactions between individual programme elements seem likely to be quite limited...|$|R
