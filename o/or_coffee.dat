5|$|Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, {{is widely}} celebrated with festive family meals and {{symbolic}} foods. Sweetness {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and drizzled with honey, and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree, such as pomegranates, carrots, leeks and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime. Honey cake (lekach) is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea <b>or</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Scuppernong had {{remained}} largely undeveloped throughout history. In 1793, {{the town of}} Columbia was built on its banks, as were several boat landings. The Scuppernong is a blackwater river: it water is colored like black tea <b>or</b> <b>coffee.</b> The Scuppernong served {{as a means of}} transportation for the early settlers in this region of North Carolina. Since 1989 the Nature Conservancy has sought to protect it in its most natural state. In 2002 the Nature Conservancy offered to donate four tracts of land that they owned along the Scuppernong if the state would purchase three more tracts that became available that same year. The state agreed and in 2004 the area along the river was officially added to the state park system.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{the rest}} of Central America, Mitch's heavy rains caused mudslides and severe {{flooding}} over Guatemala. The flooding destroyed 6,000 houses and damaged 20,000 others, displacing over 730,000 and forcing over 100,000 to evacuate. In addition, the flooding destroyed 27 schools and damaged 286 others, 175 severely. Flooding caused major damage to crops, while landslides destroyed crop land across the country. The most severely affected crops for domestic consumption were tomatoes, bananas, corn, other vegetables, and beans, with damaged totaling to $48 million (1998 USD). Export crops such as bananas <b>or</b> <b>coffee</b> were greatly damaged as well, with damage amounting to $325 million (1998 USD). Damage to plantations and soil totaled to $121 million (1998 USD). The flooding also caused severe damage to the transportation infrastructure, including the loss of 37 bridges. Across the country, flooding damaged or destroyed 840 miles (1350km) of roads, of which nearly 400 miles (640km) were sections of major highways. In all, Hurricane Mitch caused $748 million (1998 USD) and 268 deaths in Guatemala. In addition, Mitch caused 11 indirect deaths when a plane crashed during the storm.|$|E

25|$|Wide {{variability}} {{exists in}} the way the paleo diet is interpreted. Nevertheless, the diet typically includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, and meat while excluding foods such as dairy products, grains, sugar, legumes, processed oils, salt, alcohol <b>or</b> <b>coffee.</b> The diet is based on avoiding not just processed foods, but rather the foods that humans began eating after the Neolithic Revolution when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agriculture. The ideas behind the diet can be traced to Walter Voegtlin, and were popularized in the best-selling books of Loren Cordain.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective method of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean belt <b>or</b> <b>coffee</b> belt.|$|E

25|$|The {{ecological}} and financial importance of natural pollination by insects to agricultural crops, improving their quality and quantity, {{becomes more and}} more appreciated and has given rise to new financial opportunities. The vicinity of a forest or wild grasslands with native pollinators near agricultural crops, such as apples, almonds <b>or</b> <b>coffee</b> can improve their yield by about 20%. The benefits of native pollinators may result in forest owners demanding payment for their contribution in the improved crop results– a simple example of the economic value of ecological services. Farmers can also raise native crops in order to promote native bee pollinator species as shown with L. vierecki in Delaware and L. leucozonium in southwest Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Health organizations, {{including}} the World Health Organization (WHO), recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months. This means {{that no other}} foods or drinks other than possibly vitamin D are typically given.

Globally about 38% of infants are only breastfed during their first six months of life. In the United States, about 75% of women begin breastfeeding and about 13% only breastfeed until the age of six months. Medical conditions that do not allow breastfeeding are rare. Mothers who take certain recreational drugs and medications should not breastfeed. Smoking, limited amounts of alcohol, <b>or</b> <b>coffee</b> are not reasons to avoid breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Breakfast (quraac) is an {{important}} meal for Somalis, who often start the day with some style of tea (shahie) <b>or</b> <b>coffee</b> (qaxwa).

The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (canjeero or canjeelo) similar to Ethiopian injera, but smaller and thinner. It might also be eaten with a stew (maraqe) or soup. Qado or lunch is often elaborate. Varieties of bariis (rice), the most popular probably being basmati, usually serve as the main dish alongside goat or lamb. Spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and garden sage are used to aromatize these different rice delicacies. Somalis eat dinner as late as 9 pm. During Ramadan, supper is often served after Tarawih prayers; sometimes as late as 11 pm.|$|E
