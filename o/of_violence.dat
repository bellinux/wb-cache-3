40|$|Our popular {{understanding}} <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> {{has shifted}} significantly {{over the past}} forty years, and with it, our legal response. We have moved from an interpretation <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> as a private relationship problem managed through counseling techniques to an approach that configures domestic violence first and foremost as a public crime.

I argue that the move to intense criminalization has been driven by a distinctly feminist interpretation <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> what I call the feminist understanding <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> as patriarchal force.
