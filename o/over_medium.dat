It is mainly used in mining, chemical industry, road and bridge construction, building, etc. As for VSC series cone crusher, {{there are four}} crushing cavities (coarse, medium, fine and superfine) to choose. Compared with the same type, VSC series cone crusher, whose combination of crushing frequency and eccentricity is the best, can make materials have higher comminution degree and higher yield. In addition, VSC series cone crusher’s enhanced laminating crushing effect on material particles makes the cubic shape of crushed materials better, which increases the selling point.|$|E
25|$|Nitric acid, after {{distillation}} {{to increase}} the acid strength, is capable of dissolving the silver {{but it will not}} (by itself) dissolve the gold. However, nitric acid is not able to (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with a high content of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (inquarting). The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> high heat, the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K gold alloy, working its way into the gold alloy, forming a honeycomb structure as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities.|$|E

Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and kecap manis or literally [...] "sweet kecap" [...] in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> heat until rather syrupy. A third type, kecap ikan, meaning [...] "fish kecap" [...] is fish sauce similar to the Thai nam pla or the Philippine patis. It is not, however, soy-based.|$|E

60|$|We {{took the}} hounds over to See Canyon, and while Edd and Nielsen {{went down with}} them, {{the rest of us}} waited above for developments. Scarcely had they more than time enough to reach the gorge below when the pack burst into full chorus. Haught led the way then around the rough rim for better vantage points. I was mounted on one of the horses Lee had gotten for me--a fine, {{spirited}} animal named Stockings. Probably he had been a cavalry horse. He was a bay with white feet, well built and powerful, though not <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> size. One splendid feature about him was that a saddle appeared to fit him so snugly it never slipped. And another feature, infinitely the most attractive to me, was his easy gait. His trot and lope were so comfortable and swinging, like the motion of a rocking-chair, that I could ride him all day with pleasure. But when it came to chasing after hounds and bears along the rim Stockings gave me trouble. Too eager, too spirited, he would not give me time to choose the direction. He jumped ditches and gullies, plunged into bad jumbles or rock, tried to hurdle logs too high for him, carried me under low branches and through dense thickets, and in general showed he was exceedingly willing to chase after the pack, but ignorant of rough forest travel. Owing to this I fell behind, and got out of hearing of both hounds and men, and eventually found myself lost somewhere {{on the west side of}} See Canyon. To get out I had to turn my back to the sun, travel west till I came to the rim above Horton Thicket, and from there return to camp, arriving rather late in the afternoon.|$|E
60|$|The country {{cousin was}} {{impressed}} at last. With staring eyes and opened mouth, {{he watched the}} man who had been sitting only a few tables away from them push back the plate on which lay his bill and rise to his feet. One of the chief maîtres d'hôtel handed him his straw hat and cane, two waiters stood behind his chair, the manager hurried forward to see that the way was clear for him. Yet there was nothing about the appearance of the man himself which seemed to suggest his demanding any of these things. He was of little <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> height, broad-shouldered, but with a body somewhat loosely built. He wore quiet grey clothes with a black tie, a pearl pin, and a neat coloured shirt. His complexion was a little pale, his features well-defined, his eyes dark and penetrating but hidden underneath rather bushy eyebrows. His deportment was quite unassuming, and he left the place as though entirely ignorant of the impression he created. The little cluster of chorus girls looked at him almost with awe. Only one of them ventured to laugh into his face as though anxious to attract his notice. Another dropped her veil significantly as he drew near. The millionaire seemed to become a smaller man as he glanced over his shoulder. The lady who had been recently divorced bent over her plate. A group of noisy young fellows talking together about a Stock Exchange deal, suddenly ceased their clamour of voices as he passed. A man sitting alone, with a drawn face, deliberately concealed himself behind a newspaper, and an aldermanic-looking gentleman who was entertaining a fluffy-haired young lady from a well-known typewriting office, looked for a moment like an errant school-boy. Not one of these people did Sanford Quest seem to see. He passed out to the elevator, tipped the man who sycophantly took him the whole of the way down without a stop, walked through the crowded hall of the hotel and entered a closed motor-car without having exchanged greetings with a soul. Yet there was scarcely a person there who could feel absolutely sure that he had not been noticed.|$|E

40|$|Discusses {{the outlook}} for and drivers of Australian Government {{spending}} to help inform discussion about the sustainability of spending <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term. Overview Comprehensive information on trends in and key drivers of government spending is important for {{an understanding of the}} level of sustainability of government spending and the future direction of fiscal policy. This is the second PBO report on Australian Government spending. The first report examined historical trends in government spending over the decade 2002 - 03 to 2012 - 13. The real growth in Australian Government spending over the past decade (annual average 3. 6 per cent) was significantly greater than real economic growth (annual average 3. 0 per cent). The strong growth in Australia’s national income (and nominal GDP, a key driver of revenue growth) from the historic surge in Australia’s terms of trade broadly offset this spending growth, with the ratio of Australian Government spending to nominal GDP being about the same in 2012 - 13 as it was in 2002 - 03. This report discusses {{the outlook for}} and drivers of Australian Government spending <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term – the period 2012 - 13 to 2024 - 25. The projected continuing decline in the terms of trade from its historical highs, and the depressing impact this will have on nominal GDP, mean that if government spending as a share of the economy is not to rise <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term, it will require real growth in spending to be significantly slower than growth in real GDP. The Australian Government’s medium term projections are for a substantial slowing in the real growth in Australian Government spending compared with the past decade, with real spending growth (annual average growth 2. 6 per cent) significantly lower than real economic growth (annual average 3. 2 per cent) <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term. Even with this reduction in the pace of spending growth, the projected ratio of Australian Government spending to nominal GDP <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term is, on average, about the same as in the past decade. This report analyses what is driving the reduction in growth in Australian Government spending <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term by a detailed assessment of twenty-one programs that account for around three-quarters of projected government spending and nearly all (95 per cent) of the growth in total spending <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term. Sheer arithmetic dictates that {{it is very difficult to}} reduce overall growth in Australian Government spending without reducing the pace of spending in these programs. Based on current policy settings, the PBO’s medium term projections show that growth in spending on ten programs that grew rapidly over the past decade will be constrained to less than real GDP growth over the next decade. These programs are Family Tax Benefit, higher education, Medicare, public hospitals, Age Pension, Private Health Insurance Rebate, Disability Support Pension, government superannuation, public debt interest and Official Development Assistance. However, there are a number of challenges to achieving these lower growth spending outcomes. The sustained period of strong growth in Australian Government spending over the past decade can reasonably be expected to have lifted the Australian community’s expectations of continuing higher levels of government services and benefits <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term. Realising the projected slowing in the pace of growth of Australian Government spending implies successfully adjusting these expectations. The PBO’s projections are based on current government policy and assume no new policy decisions in the future to expand or enhance Australian Government payments. However, this runs counter to experience over the past decade where there were significant discretionary increases in spending on a range of programs, including Age Pension, Family Tax Benefit, Disability Support Pension, carer income support, child care, Medicare and higher education. Additionally, the projected slower spending growth <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term is dependent on 2014 - 15 Budget savings measures, most of which are yet to be legislated. Nearly all of the programs that are projected to grow at a slower pace <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term assume the implementation of savings measures that are yet to be legislated. Savings measures in these programs are projected to reduce spending <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term, with an impact of $ 19 billion or 0. 7 per cent of GDP in 2024 - 25. The slower growth in Australian Government spending <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term also reflects significantly reduced growth in Commonwealth funding for schools and hospitals from 2017 - 18. In practice, this may result in a shift in the funding responsibility for these programs from the Commonwealth to the States rather than an overall reduction in the growth of government spending in these areas. In particular, the expected growth in demand for hospital services <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term is likely to place increasing pressure on State budgets. Programs projected to grow faster <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term than <b>over</b> the past decade include defence, GST transfers to States, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the expanded Paid Parental Leave scheme. However, reducing spending in some of these programs would not result in a net saving to the budget, due to related, broadly offsetting revenue items and/or other spending offsets. In particular, the largest contribution to Australian Government spending <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term is GST transfers to the States, which in effect mirrors GST collections. While the National Disability Insurance Scheme and expanded Paid Parental Leave scheme are significant contributors to spending growth <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term, together accounting for 19 per cent of the growth in total spending, the net impact of this spending on the budget is reduced by levies, contributions from State and Territory Governments, and reductions in other Australian Government programs. The above challenges to achieving lower spending growth mean that actual spending outcomes could exceed the projections contained in this report which, given current revenue projections, could place fiscal sustainability at risk. To the extent that the projected reduction in Australian Government spending growth is not achieved <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term, an even greater share of the burden of fiscal consolidation would need to fall on the revenue side of the budget. That said, the Australian Government’s medium term budget projections already assume a significant increase in revenue with tax receipts projected to rise from 21. 4 per cent of GDP in 2012 - 13 to 23. 9 per cent of GDP in 2019 - 20, and remaining at that level <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term. Moreover, there are risks to the economic outlook <b>over</b> the <b>medium</b> term due to uncertainties in the international outlook and as the Australian economy transitions out of the resources investment boom to broader based growth in the non-resources sectors. These risks reinforce the need for fiscal consolidation in order to establish a fiscal buffer against the possibility of adverse economic shocks...|$|R
