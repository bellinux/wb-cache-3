5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> of imitatio, a general practice among composers {{of the period}} whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.|$|E
5|$|Escher worked {{primarily}} in the media of lithographs and woodcuts, though the few mezzotints he made {{are considered to be}} masterpieces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique.</b> In his graphic art, he portrayed mathematical relationships among shapes, figures and space. Integrated into his prints were mirror images of cones, spheres, cubes, rings and spirals.|$|E

5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique.</b> Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E
5|$|Zinc was {{distinctly}} {{recognized as}} a metal under the designation of Yasada or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty) and written about the year 1374. Smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India. The Chinese did not learn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> until the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|ANAK {{and three}} Georgia Tech faculty members {{appointed}} the first staff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Technique,</b> Georgia Tech's student newspaper. Eugene A.

Perry, a junior professor of English, acted as the Techniques first faculty advisor. The Technique published its first edition on November 11, 1911, {{and has been in}} continuous weekly publication since that time, with a modern circulation of 10,000.|$|E

5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique,</b> with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E
5|$|Ice {{was also}} transported by {{railroad}} from 1841 onwards, the first use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> {{being on the}} track laid down between Fresh Pond and Charleston by the Charlestown Branch Railroad Company. A special railroad car was built to insulate the ice and equipment designed to allow the cars to be loaded. In 1842 a new railroad to Fitchburg was used to access the ice at Walden Pond. Ice was not a popular cargo with railway employees, however, as {{it had to be}} moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally awkward to transport. By the 1880s ice was being shipped by rail across the North American continent.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E

5|$|Painting {{on linen}} cloth using glue size as a binder {{was at the}} time a {{relatively}} inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as matt and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work {{is one of the best}} preserved of the few surviving examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.|$|E
5|$|The Freshman Issue {{is another}} special edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Technique.</b> It {{is the first}} issue {{published}} each academic year and {{is by far the}} longest issue, with each of the sections about as long as a normal issue.

The Freshman Issue also contains a special section dedicated to helping Freshmen become more acquainted with Tech and its customs. It is generally the only issue in which content from previous issues is reprinted.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans knew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> of distillation, {{but it was}} not practiced on a major {{scale in}} Europe until some time around the 12th century, when Arabic {{innovations}} in the field combined with water-cooled glass alembics were introduced. Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term aqua vitae ("water of life") was used as a generic term for all kinds of distillates. The early use of various distillates, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed, cooked and occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.|$|E
