5|$|The Confederate {{trousers}} {{were very}} {{similar to those of the}} Union forces. Early on, the trousers were sky blue in color. They were most often made of wool, and were easily worn during long marches. If trousers did not arrive for the troops the soldiers would have to use their own pants to wear. Regimental and company officers wore the colors of their respective branch on the outer seam of their pants on one and <b>one-quarter</b> <b>inch</b> stripes. Generals wore two and five-eighths inch stripes on each pant leg. While the quartermasters, commissary, and engineer officers wore a single magenta, one and <b>one-quarter</b> <b>inch</b> outer-seam stripe. Non-commissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and <b>one-quarter</b> <b>inch</b> cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E
5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and <b>one-quarter</b> <b>inch</b> cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, he took {{a studio}} at 22 Minetta Lane, and a {{residence}} at 1 Washington Place, in Greenwich Village. [...] While in New York, he continued to innovate and developed a technique known as [...] "Beaten Lead" [...] which involved the creation of three-dimensional sculptures from <b>one-quarter</b> <b>inch</b> thick sheets of lead. His process involved suspending a lead sheet from the ceiling with clamps, and using ball peen hammers to work {{both sides of the}} sheet simultaneously. During this year he also created his first beaten lead portrait from life, Portrait of Jolas, and had solo exhibitions at the Arts Club of Chicago, and the 56th Street Gallery in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "unique" [...] {{care for}} {{precision}} and symmetry expresses French classicism and is, according to Marie-Claude Siccard, a {{paradigm of the}} care for quality in luxury products. In particular, {{a lot of attention}} is given to the regularity of stitches and the matching of patterns. On a typical striped ready-to-wear shirt and unlike most other makes, the placket is matched with the front, the face of the collar with the bottom, the collar stripes line up with the yoke stripes, the yoke stripes with the sleeve stripes, the sleeve stripes with the sleeve placket stripes, and finally the shade of yarn used for the buttonholes is matched to the stripe, the whole process creating the feeling the shirt is all one piece. [...] The yoke is one-piece and curved to follow the back. The left cuff is made <b>one-quarter</b> <b>inch</b> longer than the right to allow for the watch. The allowance is lower for made-to-order shirts. The cuff is made more or less wide, depending if the customer wants his watch to remain hidden under the cuff or to show. According to a Charvet representative, many customers have two different types of shirts: those for evening wear, intended to be worn with a flat watch, and the others for day wear, with a thicker watch. For men, shirt tails are square and vented for a clean look. For women, they are rounded, with a signature side-seam gusset. The collar is very clean-cut, made from six layers of unfused cloth for a dressy, yet not stiff, appearance. [...] Instead, a free floating stiffener aims to provide more comfort and a better shape. The stitching on a standard collar is four millimeters from the edge. The stitching of the top and the edges are precise and well-planned. The shirts are stitched with twin rows of single-needle tailoring, sewn one row at a time for minimum puckering and maximum fit. There are twenty stitches per inch. Buttons are made from Australian mother-of-pearl, cut {{from the surface of the}} oyster shell for added strength and greater color clarity. For formal shirts, bibs are hand pleated. Though its traditional ready-to-wear shirts are trim, the company has also introduced in 2009 a [...] "slim fit" [...] line.|$|E

40|$|SELTZER (1956) {{patented}} {{a method}} for controlling the sex of chicks by dipping hatching eggs in solutions of sex hormones. A procedure similar to Seltzer's has been employed by Glick and Sadler (1961) and Glick (1961, 1962, 1963 a) to introduce testosterone propionate (TP) into fertile eggs. These workers reported a significantly smaller bursa of Fabricius or no bursa in birds hatched from eggs dip-ped in 0. 67 to 3, 0 percent solutions of TP. The immunological competence of birds hatched from the TP dipped eggs was markedly reduced or eliminated.
