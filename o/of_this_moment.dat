25|$|As a group, the {{students}} were {{under the influence of}} Romanian Symbolist clubs, which were at the time the more radical expressions of artistic rejuvenation in Romania. Marcel and Jules Janco's first moment of cultural significance took place in October 1912, when they joined Tzara in editing the Symbolist venue Simbolul, which managed to receive contributions from some of Romania's leading modern poets, from Alexandru Macedonski to Ion Minulescu and Adrian Maniu. The magazine nevertheless struggled to find its voice, alternating modernism with the more conventional Symbolism. Janco was perhaps the main graphic designer of Simbolul, and he may even have persuaded his wealthy parents to support the venture (which closed down in early 1913). Unlike Tzara, who refused to look back on Simbolul with anything but embarrassment, Janco was proud <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> in life, depicting it as his first participation in artistic revolution.|$|E

500|$|After {{filming the}} {{underwater}} shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay. He wanted {{to honor the}} people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanics crew and passengers. [...] "I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life," [...] he said. [...] "And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it." [...] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californians role in Titanic demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had [...] "a very clear picture" [...] of what happened on the ship that night. [...] "I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially {{if we were going to}} dive to the ship," [...] he said. [...] "That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Zap2it wrote, [...] "Sure, Blair's (Leighton Meester) {{been dreaming}} of her fairytale wedding {{since she was}} just a little girl. But it's also true that producers of Gossip Girl have been dreaming <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> for a long time as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In {{what has come to be}} sort of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references to Gossip Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl quote ("I love you, always have, always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured the confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{some of the}} {{students}} arriving at the University matched the then-common picture of college students; wealthy, spoiled aristocrats with a sense of privilege which often led to brawling, or worse.
