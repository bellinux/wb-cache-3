40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a single inventory (newsboy) problem {{in which the}} vendor has {{a limited amount of}} funds to purchase items to sell. We assume that the manufacturer will either sell the items to the vendor outright or offer the items to the vendor <b>on</b> <b>a</b> revenue sharing (<b>consignment)</b> <b>basis.</b> In the latter case, that amount of money the vendor pays per unit is less than if the items are purchased from the vendor, but the vendor must share some of the revenue with the manufacturer. The purpose of our analysis is to investigate under what circumstances, it would pay for the vendor to only purchase the items from the manufacturer, only take the items on consignment from the manufacturer, or both purchase and take consignment shipments form the manufacturer...|$|R
40|$|Food is not {{a finite}} resource, as is the land it is {{cultivated}} on. Future generations {{will have to find}} creative ways to integrate production, marketing, distribution and technology {{in such a way that}} optimal usage of scarce food resources is achieved. Efficient fresh produce markets and specifically efficient electronic food spot markets could play a central role in stimulating, coordinating and optimizing the flow of food across multiple geographical regions. This cannot be achieved through traditional approaches to technology, as it requires systems to play a much more prominent role than just facilitating sales transactions. In order to establish electronic fresh produce spot markets of the future, we will require a deeper understanding of how broader institutional trust signals are to be facilitated through technology interfaces. This thesis explores the relationship between the use of self-service technology and the institutional environment emphasising the importance of understanding the relationship between technology s use and the specific institutional forces governing trust forming behaviour. This thesis offers a rare insight into the functioning of a network of municipal fresh produce markets in South Africa which is characterized by a unique institutionalized trading environment that functions on high levels of trust between the grower, the sales agent and market authority. These markets share the same business model, governance framework, management and operational structure that has been designed specifically to provide a low risk, low cost marketing channel for fresh produce. Product is sold <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> only <b>basis</b> with <b>an</b> ad valorem commission being paid by the grower on the gross selling price. No written contractual agreements are in place governing this arrangement between the grower and the institution and if one takes into consideration that around R 14 Billion (an estimated $ 1. 1 Billion in 2014) are transacted annually in this manner, it is a remarkable example of how various institutional technological structures combine to facilitate such a trust driven environment. The use of self-service technologies have potential to revolutionise the role South Africa s network of fresh produce markets play, not only in the economy of South Africa, but also within the broader Southern African Development Community. But our understanding of how to structure solutions using self-service technology within fresh produce spot markets are still lacking. Given the importance of food security, the establishment of centralized food markets utilizing technology in creative ways would be vital to ensure the various economic, commercial and socio-political benefits flow back to the various stakeholders. The challenge fresh produce markets face is how to port the broader institutional trust dynamics it currently enjoys to an environment facilitated purely though technology interfaces. Although trust and technology are central to the functioning of these markets little research has been conducted into its role within these markets. The study utilises a qualitative case study to document the dynamics of the social and technology environments on markets. The study reveals the importance of the alignment of technology, not only with the various business processes, but also with the formal and informal governance structures that regulate the activities internally and externally to the market environment. A conceptual framework is presented that illustrates the formation of trust within self-service environments. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. InformaticsPhDUnrestricte...|$|R

40|$|In many vendor-manufacturer partnerships, it {{is quite}} typical for the vendor to hold {{consignment}} stock {{on behalf of the}} manufacturer, usually through an ’in-plant ’ from the vendor organization who is resident at the manufacturer’s premises. However, empirical evidence suggests that where the buyer is dominant, suppliers are often forced to carry inventory either as part of the contract or to qualify for selection: "It seems that most of the costs are the suppliers ’ and most of the benefits are the customers’ " (Waters-Fuller, 1995). However, in a certain vendor-manufacturer partnership in the NZ forestry sector, we found that while the vendor had initial reservations in terms of holding stock <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> <b>basis</b> for the manufacturer, it subsequently fully supported the move; according to the vendor’s commercial manager, it was ideal for the company with chemicals that had short shelf-lives. Accordingly, with recourse to inventory modelling, we seek to better understand the benefits from the vendor’s management of consignment stocks of short-lived supplies. In particular, a simple model confirms the intuition that under positively skewed probability distributions of shelf life, the vendor stands to gain more than the manufacturer from the operation of consignment stocks through an inplant. ...|$|E
40|$|The core problem, {{leading to}} this study, is that {{inventory}} {{in general is}} pushed onto downstream supply chain links, based on forecasts. The effect is that downstream links are often overstocked and slow to react to end-user pull. This study delved into the triggers for inventory flow of medical devices used <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> <b>basis</b> at hospitals within the interventional cardiology medical device industry. There has been very little research conducted {{on the topic of}} consignment stock management and the inventory flow of these devices. The study aimed to look for answers around the questions of flow and types of waste possibly present within this industry. A qualitative research strategy was followed, where interviews were conducted with key role players within the industry. Eight case studies were designed, using interview data collected from leading supply companies and hospital staff members. In order to validate the results, a dynamic buffer management simulation was conducted, using primary data collected in the industry. The simulation followed theory of constraints thinking processes and served as a tool to strengthen the credibility of the results through a process called triangulation. It was concluded that overwhelming evidence exists, demonstrating that end-user consumption is used as the trigger for flow of interventional cardiology medical devices placed on consignment at hospitals. Replenishment of inventory on consignment was performed to daily pull. However, the core problem is that goods still flow {{as a result of a}} forecast. Considerable potential exists to improve flow through the use of a dynamic buffer management approach. Significant forms of waste were found to be present within this industry.

50|$|The game {{of table}} hockey {{was invented in}} 1932, by the Canadian Donald H. Munro Sr., in Toronto.

This {{mechanical}} game was built out of scrap wood and metal, and included used coat hanger wire, butcher's twine, clock springs, and lumber from the coal bin. Unlike current games, the game looked more like an early pinball game, with one key difference: this was a two player game. The playing surface had a peak in the middle and sloped down toward each end. The players controlled levers for the goalie and flippers for the players. The story goes that a travelling salesman noticed the game and encouraged Don to take the game down to the local Eaton's department store. Don did just that. The first game went in <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> deal. By the time Mr. Munro got home, the game was sold and more orders were placed.|$|R

This thesis contains essays addressing three different problems in supply chain finance, studying two {{important source of}} financing – trade credit and crowdfunding. In the first essay, we model a web-based retailer offering direct financing to its capital-constrained supplier who sells its products <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> <b>basis.</b> The supplier has access to bank financing and the retailer can specify debt-seniority. We show that if the retailer requires debt-seniority, then the supplier will use either bank or direct financing (but not both), and it may produce more than the first-best quantity. In contrast, if the retailer does not request seniority, the supplier may take both bank and direct financing, but it always produces less than the first-best quantity. We find that the retailer does not always prefer debt-seniority. In the second essay, we study variants of net-terms trade credit contracts in a traditional market, with market frictions of bankruptcy costs, information asymmetry and transaction costs. We provide a {{possible explanation for the}} prevalence of debt forgiveness in practice. We show that the supplier, by contracting and preannouncing forgiveness, can use one type of friction to mitigate another, and benefit both supply chain partners. The third essay studies the social proof effect in the rapidly diffused crowdfunding market. We study how prior capital accumulation and the volume of owner-issued referrals impact subsequent fundraising. By analyzing a campaign-level web traffic data set, we show that higher capital accumulation increases the probability of contribution for the owner-referrals, the volume of organic visitors and the total volume of organic contributors, although it may decrease probability of contribution from the organic visitors. To study the optimal policy for entrepreneurs to use their referrals, we build a Markov-decision-process model and calibrate its parameters using our data. Our finding indicates that entrepreneurs in general should distribute their referrals {{over the course of the}} entire campaign...|$|E

He also told them he owned the ship and was entitled to do with it as he pleased, that he was immensely wealthy, and that anyone who did not cooperate with the scheme would be shot. Under his instructions, the ship was radically changed in appearance: the yellow funnel was painted black, previously blue lifeboats were painted white, and various items identifying the ship were tossed overboard. The wheelhouse and chartroom were dismantled and rebuilt on the aft-deck, further disguising the ship's profile. The ship was renamed Bantam, taking the name of another ship of similar tonnage on the Lloyd's Register, and forged shipping documentation was created to support the false name. The crew were instructed to say the ship had sailed from Singapore if questioned. The ship next sailed to the Cape Verde Islands and then to Santos, Brazil, where it arrived on Boxing Day 1880.

40|$|Consignment {{contracts}} {{have been}} widely employed in many industries. Under such contracts, items are sold at a retailer's but the supplier retains the full ownership of the inventory until purchased by consumers; the supplier collects payment from the retailer based on actual units sold. We investigate how competition among retailers influences the supply chain decisions and profits under different <b>consignment</b> arrangements, namely <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> price contract and <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share. First, we investigate how these two <b>consignment</b> contracts and <b>a</b> price only contract compare {{from the perspective of}} each supply chain partner. We find that the retailers benefit more from <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> price contract than from <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share or a price only contract, regardless of the level of retailer differentiation. The supplier's most beneficial contact, however, critically depends upon the level of retailer differentiation: <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share is preferable for the supplier if retailer differentiation is strong; otherwise <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> price contract is preferable. Second, we study how retailer differentiation affects the profits of all supply chain partners. We find that less retailer differentiation improves the supplier's profit for both types of consignment contract. Moreover, less retailer differentiation improves profits of the retailers in <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> price contract, but not necessarily in <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share.
