40|$|We {{examined}} spindle morphology and chromosome alignment in vertebrate cells after simultaneous perturbation <b>of</b> the chromokinesin <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> either NuMA, CENP-E, or HSET. Spindle morphology and chromosome alignment after simultaneous perturbation <b>of</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> either HSET or CENP-E were {{no different}} from when either HSET or CENP-E was perturbed alone. However, short bipolar spindles with organized poles formed after perturbation <b>of</b> both <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> NuMA {{in stark contrast to}} splayed spindle poles observed after perturbation of NuMA alone. Spindles were disorganized if <b>Kid,</b> NuMA, <b>and</b> HSET were perturbed, indicating that HSET is sufficient for spindle organization in the absence <b>of</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> NuMA function. In addition, chromosomes failed to align efficiently at the spindle equator after simultaneous perturbation <b>of</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> NuMA despite appropriate kinetochore-microtubule interactions that generated chromosome movement at normal velocities. These data indicate that a functional relationship between the chromokinesin <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> the spindle pole organizing protein NuMA influences spindle morphology, and we propose that this occurs because NuMA forms functional linkages between kinetochore and nonkinetochore microtubules at spindle poles. In addition, these data show that both <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> NuMA contribute to chromosome alignment in mammalian cells...|$|R

The singer elaborated the concept behind the song during an album documentary filmed for Beyoncé, titled [...] "Honesty", saying, [...] "Now I'm in my 30s, and those children that grew up listening to me have grown up, and I always felt like it was my responsibility to be aware <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> their parents and all these generation". With that said, the singer felt [...] "stifled" [...] and unable to express every feeling she wanted to show. However, she noted that with [...] "Rocket", one of the most liberating songs on the record, she managed to express many of those feelings and show different sides of her personality. Revealing that she would not have been confident enough to record the song earlier in her career, Beyoncé noted, [...] "I kinda dropped that fourth wall and I did it". The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What I love about this song is, it takes you through this journey. You're flirting and you're talking all of your arrogant [...] Then you climax, and then you have your cigarette... This song actually is about singing from the heart, and harmonies and adlibs and arrangement". During the same video, she praised Timberlake and Miguel's work; the clip also showed footage of Beyoncé recording the song in the studio.|$|E

2500|$|The {{novel is}} {{told in the}} first-person voice by various characters, and each short chapter is told from a {{different}} character's perspective. Linguistic drift has given the people of Eden unique nouns ("police veekle", [...] "rayed yoh", and [...] "Jesus Juice" [...] instead of [...] "police vehicle", [...] "radio", and [...] "Jesus and the Jews"). The adverb [...] "very" [...] has dropped from the language, and emphasis is created by reduplication ("bad bad" [...] instead of [...] "very bad").

2500|$|Berry's love of North Staffordshire {{was deep}} and permanent; he indulged an incurable {{addiction}} to the place. He [...] "had an inexplicable attraction to the place and...was attached to the area by [...] "an invisible umbilical cord", which could never be cut." [...] He said of his childhood [...] "every house seemed to have an old woman, a drunken man, a gang <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> a snarling dog." [...] Certainly then he was, [...] "a thinker {{of the working class}} who developed a love of middle class pursuits." [...] He said he had [...] "always worked out of one world, the working class world of which I am part", while declaring, [...] "I am a man of habit and pattern." [...] He [...] "became a cult figure following many television appearances in the Midlands." [...] His attachment to the place was a legend. For example, [...] "when he obtained work as a teacher in Chelsea College of Art he commuted every day and night from Biddulph Moor." [...] And indeed [...] "propping up the bar at his local public house...is where he felt most comfortable." [...] Yet it was during the 1950s that the, [...] "crushing black agoraphobia descended on him, virtually imprisoning him in North Staffordshire {{for the rest of his}} life." [...] But as a man, poet, playwright and artist he came into his own. Peter Cheeseman (Director, for thirty five years, of the Victoria Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent and, latterly, the New Victoria Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme), recalls the many animated conversations they had enjoyed, and [...] "the swift gestures of his good left arm, banging at the elbow of his useless right...and the rich talk that pours out of him." [...] He was [...] "eloquent in every way...a vigorous and expressive poet...a writer of stories, a dramatist...grotesquely hilarious... an inspiring teacher of art, loved and admired by his students." [...] He was [...] "a large, ungainly and glum man, tall and remote, cloth cap sitting permanently over his expressionless face." [...] He seemed to have something of a love-hate relationship with his art, for [...] "he once sent a groaning van-load off to Stoke tip: a great weight lifted off me." [...] He was really [...] "a painter and poet of the cluttered and dying landscape of pits and ironworks...he writes of that world with unexpected imagery and a great roaring sense of humour, sometimes wry, often grotesque." [...] As a painter, he strained [...] "to paint a world he loved passionately for its vigour and its energy and its richness before the bulldozer scraped it away." [...] He felt his paintings to be [...] "the most eloquent utterances, portraits of a world seen from the bottom of my rut." [...] This was indeed [...] "a world filled with images of people and landscape that have been twisted and worn into strange shapes by hard work and poverty. My Parthenon is an allotment hut knocked together out of bits of rubbish. It is the richness of poor things that I am drawn to." [...] As he told Peter Cheeseman, [...] "everything I have ever drawn, every house, every man, every face has its roots in those few streets [...] All the things I have written, or hope to write, I am sure will have the same roots." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{you have}} to keep {{connection}} unbroken between a restless mother <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> a baby who is at the point of death, you suffer in all your system. But the babies were fed. Each morning and evening Scott would solemnly lift them out one by one from their nest of gunny-bags under the cart-tilts. There were always many who could do no more than breathe, and the milk was dropped into their toothless mouths drop by drop, with due pauses when they choked. Each morning, too, the goats were fed; and since they would straggle without a leader, and since the natives were hirelings, Scott was forced to give up riding, and pace slowly at the head of his flocks, accommodating his step to their weaknesses. All this was sufficiently absurd, and he felt the absurdity keenly; but at least he was saving life, and when the women saw that their children did not die, they made shift to eat a little of the strange foods, and crawled after the carts, blessing the master of the goats.|$|E
40|$|The {{proteins}} <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> Kis are {{the toxin}} and antitoxin, respectively, encoded by the parD operon of Escherichia coli plasmid R 1. Kis prevents the inhibition of E. coli cell growth {{caused by the}} RNA cleavage activity <b>of</b> <b>Kid.</b> Overproduction <b>of</b> MazE, the chromosome-encoded homologue of Kis, has been demonstrated to neutralize Kid toxicity {{to a certain extent}} in the absence of native Kis. Here, we show that a high structural similarity exists between these antitoxins, using NMR spectroscopy. We report about the interactions between <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> Kis that are responsible for neutralization <b>of</b> <b>Kid</b> toxicity <b>and</b> enhance autoregulation of parD transcription. Native macromolecular mass spectrometry data demonstrate that <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> Kis form multiple complexes. At Kis:Kid ratios equal to or exceeding 1 : 1, as found in vivo in a plasmid-containing cell, various complexes are present, ranging from Kid 2 – Kis 2 tetramer up to Kis 2 –Kid 2 –Kis 2 –Kid 2 –Kis 2 decamer. When Kid is in excess of Kis, corresponding to an in vivo situation immediately after loss of the plasmid, the Kid 2 –Kis 2 –Kid 2 heterohexamer is the most abundant species. NMR chemical shift and intensity perturbations in the 1 H 15 N HSQC spectra <b>of</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> Kis, observed when titrating the partner protein, show that the interaction sites <b>of</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> Kis resemble those within the previously reported MazF 2 –MazE 2 –MazF 2 complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Kid 2 –MazE 2 tetramers can be formed via weak interactions involving a limited part of the Kis-binding residues <b>of</b> <b>Kid.</b> The functional roles of the identified Kid–Kis and Kid–MazE interaction sites and complexes in toxin neutralization and repression of transcription are discussed...|$|R
