5|$|Enemies {{range from}} camouflaged plants to large {{vultures}} to Komodo dragon-like lizards and huge leviathan in water. Many enemies can kill the Slugcat in <b>one</b> <b>hit,</b> and some species have internal variation, {{such as the}} pink lizards that can climb.

The player does, however, need to experiment with spears to climb walls and knock fruit out of trees. The Slugcat can hold two objects at once and switch between them. It can also eat power-up plants, which grant status effects, such as slowing time.|$|E
