40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{effect of}} {{performing}} aortic valve repair {{in combination with}} valve-sparing operation {{on the length of}} time for which patients are free from reoperation is unclear. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if the performance of aortic valve repair during valve-sparing operation modified the freedom from reoperation time. METHODS: From January 2003 to July 2014, 78 patients with a mean age of 49 ± 15 years underwent valve-sparing operation. Sixty-eight percent of these patients were male. Twenty-two (28 %) aortic valve repair procedures were performed in this patient population. In the aortic valve repair + valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group,</b> 77. 3 % of patients had moderate/severe aortic insufficiency, while in the valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group,</b> 58. 6 % of patients had moderate/severe aortic insufficiency (ns = not significant). Additionally, 13. 6 % of patients in the aortic valve repair + valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group</b> had functional class III/IV, while 14. 2 % of patients in the valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group</b> had functional class III/IV (ns). RESULTS: The in-hospital and late mortality rates, for the aortic valve repair + valve-sparing operation and valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>groups</b> were similar, as they were 4. 5 % and 3. 6 %; and 0 % and 1. 8 %, respectively. In the aortic valve repair + valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group,</b> 0 % of patients presented moderate/severe aortic insufficiency during late follow-up, while in the valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group,</b> 14. 2 % of patients presented with moderate/severe aortic insufficiency during this period (ns). In the aortic valve repair + valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group,</b> 5. 3 % of patients presented with functional class III/IV, while in the valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group,</b> 4. 2 % of patients presented with functional class III/IV (ns). In the aortic valve repair + valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group,</b> 0 % of patients required reoperation, while in the valve-sparing <b>operation</b> <b>group,</b> 3. 6 % of patients required reoperation over a mean follow-up period of 1621 ± 1156 days (75 patients). CONCLUSION: Valve-sparing operation is a safe and long-lasting procedure and performance of aortic valve repair when necessary does not increase risk of reoperation on the aortic valve...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special <b>Operations</b> <b>Group</b> were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special <b>Operations</b> <b>Group,</b> was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E

5|$|Bagramyan was {{instrumental}} in the planning of two Soviet counter-offensives against the Germans, including the major push made by Soviet forces in December during the Battle of Moscow, and for this was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. In the same month, he was made the chief of staff of a military <b>operations</b> <b>group</b> that would oversee three Army Groups: the Southern, the Southwestern and Bryansk Fronts. In March 1942, he went along with Khrushchev and Timoshenko to Moscow to present the plans of a new counter-offensive in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv to Stalin. Stalin, impressed with his plan, approved the operation and on April 8, promoted Bagramyan as Chief of Staff of the Southwestern Front. On 12 May 1942, armies of the Southwestern Front attacked Kharkiv but the launch of the offensive came at an inopportune moment since they were attacking from the Barvenkovo Salient, a region that German forces were near closing.|$|E

5|$|Following his graduation, Clark {{worked in}} Washington, D.C., from July 1983 to 1984 {{in the offices}} of the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army, earning a second Legion of Merit for his work. He then served as the <b>Operations</b> <b>Group</b> {{commander}} at the Fort Irwin Military Reservation from August 1984 to June 1986. He was awarded another Legion of Merit and a Meritorious Service Medal for his work at Fort Irwin and was given a brigade command at Fort Carson in 1986. He commanded the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division there from April 1986 to March 1988. Veneta Clark, Wesley's mother, fell ill as he began this command and died on Mother's Day in 1986. After Fort Carson, Clark returned to the Command and General Staff College to direct and further develop the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) there until October 1989. The BCTP was created to teach senior officers war-fighting skills, according to the commanding general at the time. On November 1, 1989, Clark was promoted to brigadier general.|$|E

Determined the {{operation}} would remain a secret, the commandos snuck back to Core and retrieved the explosive devices. Not long afterwards, Core and its crew sailed out of Saigon, intact without any damage. Nao, on the other hand, reported the failure of his mission to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters; his superiors did not express disappointment in {{the failure of the}} operation, but instead they encouraged Nao and his men to destroy Card at all costs. Finally on May 1, 1964, Viet Cong reconnaissance teams spotted USNS Card as the ship sailed through Ganh Rai Bay and entered Long Tau River, so they immediately reported the information to the 65th Special <b>Operations</b> <b>Group</b> in Saigon. As usual, Card docked at the commercial port district in the city to unload another shipment of cargo and military helicopters, as well as upload a batch of helicopters scheduled to be returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|In March 1937, {{the then}} Director of <b>Operations</b> <b>Group</b> Captain Robert Saundby, {{complained that the}} role for Coastal Command in war, namely {{supporting}} the bomber offensive, and second, the support of naval forces along the British coastline, were too limited and {{was in danger of}} diverting the Command from its main concern: ASW. In October the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) Air Vice Marshal Richard Peirse confirmed that there was no formal role for the service or location of its units. Peirse did reverse the decision to have strategic bombing support as the primary function. This was changed to trade defence. Coastal Command was only to be used for other purposes if trade routes were suffering little interference and the intensity of air attack on Britain, or air attacks on enemy targets, required all available air units for those purposes. However, in December 1937, the Naval and Air Staffs met again and changed the priority to North Sea reconnaissance. The Naval Staff insisted that surface commerce raiders presented the greatest danger, and aircraft could prove decisive only in locating enemy warships. ASW remained in third place, after direct co-operation with surface fleets. In December 1938, this was changed again, and ASW moved up to second priority. In August 1939 it was moved to first priority. When Coastal Command went to war, its first task was to co-operate with the Navy to prevent enemy vessels from escaping into the North Sea and Atlantic Oceans. Secondly, it was to provide ASW support where and when it could. These steps are significant as the language indicates a change from passive reconnaissance of enemy warships and submarines to an active directive which involved the attack of the vessels by Coastal Command aircraft.|$|E

40|$|We {{designed}} a hypoxia-imaging modality to detect ischemia of the gastric conduit after esophagectomy. A rat esophagectomy model was created using 12 - 16 -week-old, 300 - 350 g male Sprague-Dawley rats. In the <b>operation</b> <b>group</b> (n= 6), partial gastric devascularization {{was performed by}} ligating the left gastric artery and the short gastric arteries and an esophagogastric anastomosis was performed. In the control group (n= 6), the esophageal-gastric junction was incised and suturing was performed without gastric devascularization. Positron emission tomography (PET) images were taken using a microPET rodent model scanner, 24 h after the initial operation, after injection of 200 μCi 64 Cu-diacetyl-bis (N 4 -methylsemicarbazone) (64 Cu-ATSM) and pimonidazole 120 mg/kg. After microPET imaging, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry were performed. The PET image revealed 64 Cu-ATSM uptake at the fundus in the <b>operation</b> <b>group</b> 3 h after 64 Cu-ATSM injection. The maximum percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue was higher in the <b>operation</b> <b>group</b> (0. 047 ± 0. 015 vs. 0. 026 ± 0. 006, p= 0. 021).
