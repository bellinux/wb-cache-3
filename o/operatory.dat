5000|$|Since first {{establishing}} what {{he refers}} to as his philosophical construction yard (chantier) to explore the écart between Chinese and European thought François Jullien has been organizing a vis-à-vis between cultures, rather than comparing them, so as to map out a common field for reflection. His work has led him to examine such various disciplines as ethics, aesthetics, strategy, and the systems of thought (pensées) of both History and nature. The aim of this [...] "deconstruction" [...] from without (du déhors) is to detect buried biases, in both cultures, as well as to elucidate the unthought-of (l'impensé) in our thought. It serves also to bring out the resources (ressources) or fecundities (fécondités) of languages and cultures, rather than consider them from the perspective of their [...] "difference" [...] or [...] "identity." [...] Moreover, it launches philosophy anew by extricating it from the bog of its atavisms and purging it of facile notions (évidences).The enterprise has not failed to raise hackles in both philosophical and Orientalist circles. Jullien has argued in response that the way to produce the common (produire du commun) is to put écarts to work. Because they establish distance, écarts bring out [...] "the between" [...] ("l'entre") and put our reflection into tension. [...] "The similar" [...] ("le semblable"), on the other hand, produces only what is uniform, which we then mistake for [...] "universals."Within this construction yard between the languages and systems of thought of China and Europe, Jullien has since developed a philosophy of [...] "living" [...] (philosophie du [...] "vivre"). This marks a departure from Being, the major bias of Greek philosophy. The result is a general philosophy that unfolds (se déploie) as a philosophy of existence. Some of Jullien's recent developments in this area include reflections on intimacy ("l'intime") and [...] "landscape" [...] ("paysage").For a survey of Jullien's work, see De l'Être au vivre, lexique euro-chinois de la pensée, Gallimard, 2015.The readership for Jullien's work has been expanding of late beyond the disciplines of Orientalism and philosophy.The world of management has begun to adopt such concepts as situational potential (potentiel de situation), as opposed to [...] "plans of action"; maturation (of conditions), as opposed to projected modelizations; and the initiation of silent transformations ("transformations silencieuses"), to induce change rather than impose it.Cf. A Treatise on Efficacy, 2004; Conférence sur l'efficacité, 2005.The world of psychology and analysis has begun to adopt the concept of [...] "silent transformation" [...] (cf. The Silent Transformations, 2011); the distinction between the word and speech (cf. Si parler va sans dire, 2006); and the concepts of the allusive (l'allusif), availability (la disponibilité), indirectness (le biais), and obliquity (l'obliquité) (cf. Cinq concepts proposés à la psychanalyse, 2012).The art world has begun to adopt the concepts of silent transformation; of the [...] "great image" [...] ("The great image has no form"); of soaring (l'essor) and slackness (l'étale) (slackness is what is determined, what has completely come to pass, and has therefore lost its effect; soaring is the upstream of the effect, when the effect is still occurring, still at work, and has not yet gone slack); of the frontal and the oblique (evocation, being oblique, might be preferable to representation, which is frontal: [...] "paint the clouds so as to evoke the moon"); of coherence, as opposed to sense (if a work does not deliver a [...] "sense," [...] then is it not co-herence that confers the work's con-sistency, that makes it [...] "hold together" [...] as a work?); of the evasive, as opposed to the assignable); of the allusive, as opposed to the symbolic. The art world has also begun to adopt the concepts of the écart and the between (l'entre). Because it is based on distinction, difference specifies an essence and stores it away as knowledge. An écart, however, establishes a distance and thus maintains a tension between the things it separates. Even while producing its disturbance, the écart brings forth a between, precisely because of the distance established. If the [...] "between" [...] is the thing of which ontology cannot conceive—because it has no in-itself: i.e., no essence—it is also the space through which thing passes, or occurs: the space of the <b>operatory</b> and the effective.Cf.

Many factors contribute to the dental behavior of the child. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sociodemographic factors, general anxiety, body mass index (BMI), and role of multimedia on the child behavior (CB) in the dental <b>operatory.</b> Materials and Methods: Three hundred and one children aged 3 - 14 years and their parents participated in the study. In the first visit, the questionnaire was filled by the parent and general examination was done. During the second visit, the required dental procedure was rendered, and the behavior was recorded by a single examiner. Results: Among sociodemographic factors, increasing age is directly related to child′s positive behavior, whereas other factors such as gender and socioeconomic status (SES) are not significantly related. General anxiety significantly affects the child′s behavior. BMI of the child is not related to child′s behavior in dental <b>operatory.</b> Multimedia was not found to be significantly affecting the behavior of the child in dental <b>operatory.</b> Interpretations and Conclusion: The principle conclusion of this study is that there is a significant association of age and treatment procedure rendered with the CB in the dental <b>operatory</b> whereas gender, SES, general anxiety, BMI, and multimedia do not show any significant association with the CB in the dental <b>operatory...</b>|$|E
40|$|AIM: To analyse the {{influence}} of the presence of the parent in the dental <b>operatory</b> on their child's behaviour during dental treatment. METHODS: This study was a randomised controlled trial performed in a secondary paediatric dental care clinic. The child's perception of the dental treatment and its behaviour during treatment according to the parent and dentist were compared with parental presence in the <b>operatory</b> as independent variable. Age and dental anxiety were also calculated as co-variable. The child's perception of the treatment was assessed using the Wong-Baker Faces Rating Scale. The behaviour of the child according to parent and dentist was measured using Venham`s (modified) clinical rating of anxiety and cooperative behaviour. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann Whitney U tests and Independent Samples T Test. RESULTS: 90 children participated (50 % girls, mean age 6. 21 years old, SD ± 1. 56). During the habituation session child's behaviour was better according to the dentist when the parents were not present in the <b>operatory</b> during treatment (p< 0. 01).

30|$|On {{the level}} of conceptualization, {{corresponding}} to the concrete operational stage, the interiorization movement (C) {{is characterized by a}} generalized process of grasp of consciousness of one’s own action, which is equivalent to the process of interiorizing material actions through the diverse forms of semiotized representation: language, mental images, drawings, etc. Right from the outset, this process is at one of the extremes of two possible types of abstraction: empirical abstraction and reflecting abstraction. Empirical abstraction enables a kind of description of the data of observed material characteristics of an action; whilst reflecting abstraction takes from the coordinations of the action that which is essential for building inferential coordinations which, on this level of conceptualization, enable the establishment of relationships and the interpretation of observed data, although always interchanging with those of the object. As such, on this level conceptualization, becomes <b>operatory</b> (capable of reasoning and <b>operatory</b> structuring—number, seriation, classification, etc.). But the underlying structures, as well as the very mechanism of reflective abstraction, remain unconscious. The exteriorization or physical and causal movement (C′) on the second level unfolds two analogous processes. Empirical abstraction based on objects enables the abstraction of observed data (facts, specific happenings, functions, relationships that may be repeated, and legality in general). Reflecting abstraction, in turn, which in the C sense is responsible for <b>operatory</b> structuring, enables, as a result, the formation of causal explanations (attribution of operations to objects themselves, which become operators), which involve a deductive interpretation towards objects (C′). However, not only does the attribution of operations to objects remain unconscious for the subject itself, but also the <b>operatory</b> structures as such, in their logico-mathematical inferences, and this indicates solidarity with the interiorization movement. Piaget studied above all the transition of practical success to the conceptual consciousness of the concrete operational stage (Pons et al. 2012).|$|E

None of the scavenging systems were found to be adequate to control nitrous-oxide exposures. Tests were conducted in the laboratory and the field to evaluate two new local exhaust systems intended to control patient mouth emissions of nitrous-oxide. Face mask leakage was the primary cause of emissions. The use of exhaust systems placed on the chin or chest, or in the mouth captured mouth emissions.

40|$|Introduction: Amalgam, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used restorative material, is composed of nearly 50 % mercury and 69 % silver. It cannot be disposed along with biomedical waste (BMW) because mercury-contaminated waste cannot be incinerated or autoclaved. Objectives: To assess the knowledge and observance of proper mercury hygiene and amalgam waste management among general dental practitioners (GDPs). Materials and Methods: A confidential questionnaire containing 14 questions regarding handling and disposal of amalgam was randomly distributed to 175 GDPs in Chandigarh, Panchkula, and Mohali. A response rate of 78 % was obtained, and results were statistically analyzed. Results: Out of total dentists surveyed, 71 % were found to be using amalgam as restorative material, 63 % were doing < 5 amalgam restorations per week. Only 6. 5 % of dentists placed rubber dam during removal and replacement of amalgam restorations. Fifty-five percent of dentists used high-volume evacuation. Filter was used only by 6 % dentists. For 98 %, dentists' evacuation drained into regular drain. Eighty-six percent of dentists never used amalgamator. Only 31 % of dentists stored leftover amalgam scrap in radiographic fixer. Fifty-one percent of dentists disposed the bottle of leftover amalgam scrap along with BMW. One hundred percent of dentists disposed amalgam-contaminated gloves and cotton along with BMW.

Materials and Methods: Samples of the ambient air were taken at seven locations the Dental Center of LASUTH by a trained technician between 9 : 00 and 11 : 00 a. m. This was done at a predetermined height (41 / 2 feet) above the floor for mercury vapor concentration using Lumex 915 light data logger mercury vapor analyzer manufactured by Ohio Lumex Company Incorporation, USA®. Results: The highest level of 1434 ng/m 3 of mercury vapor in the air {{was found in the}} restorative clinic while the lowest of 23 ng Hg/m 3 was found in the ambient air at the entrance of the dental Center. The Oral Surgery clinic had mercury vapor level of 318 ng/m 3 which was slightly higher than Environmental Protection Agency recommended value of 0. 3 μg/m 3. Conclusion: An unacceptably high level of mercury vapor was detected, especially in the restorative clinic.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to perform an {{estimation}} of the dental practice production process. This estimation provides information on the contributions of each input to dental production and the type of returns to scale exhibited by dental practices. Previous studies in this area have presented contradictory results and conclusions concerning input contributions and returns to scale. In addition, these studies have been based on data sets where the individual dentist, not the dental practice, is the unit of observation. The present study uses data collected on a dental practice basis and estimates a dental practice production function and the reduced form direct cost function, and indirect cost, revenue, and profit functions. ^ Estimation of the production function was performed using both patient visits and gross billings as measures of output. Dentist hours, staff hours, and <b>operatories</b> per practice were the input measures. Staff hours represents the grouping of all non-dentist labor inputs into one category. ^ The estimation results of the dental practice production function found that dental practices exhibit constant returns to scale. A test was performed to determine if there were statistically significant differences between the estimated coefficients of solo and nonsolo practices. The test found no significant differences. This study also found a systematic variation across estimated coefficients when patient visits and gross billings were used as output measures. The coefficient of dentist hours is higher with patient visits as output, while the coefficient of staff hours is always higher with gross billings. The present study presents an explanation for this variation based on the more frequent occurrence of multiple service visits as more staff are employed. These results have implications for public and private policy regarding the organization and use of inputs in the dental production process. ^ Estimation of the reduced forms presented reasonable results only for the direct cost function, which indicated that dental practices exhibit increasing returns to scale. These results are not conclusive, but demonstrate the uncertainty that exists in dental production research and the need for further investigation of alternative methods. ...|$|R
