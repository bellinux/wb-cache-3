2500|$|The Armenian side officially {{asserts that}} the killings {{occurred}} {{as a result of}} wartime military operations, and were caused by the prevention of the evacuation of town inhabitants by Azerbaijani forces, who shot those who attempted to flee. This explanation however is widely disputed, among others, the executive director of Human Rights Watch has stated that: [...] "we place direct responsibility for the civilian deaths with Karabakh Armenian forces. Indeed, neither <b>our</b> <b>report</b> nor that of Memorial includes any evidence to support the argument that Azerbaijani forces obstructed the flight of, or fired on Azeri civilians". British journalist Thomas de Waal noted that [...] "the overwhelming evidence of what happened has not stopped some Armenians, in distasteful fashion, trying to muddy the waters". However, De Waal has also stated that the tragedy in Khojaly was a result of a chaotic situation, and not a [...] "deliberately planned" [...] action by the Armenians.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Iraqi Interior Ministry's {{inspector-general}} Aqil al-Turehi, he had {{investigated the}} device in 2008 but found it [...] "inoperative" [...] and costly and recommended that Iraq should not buy it. He told Reuters: [...] "There was corruption {{associated with this}} contract and we referred to this and submitted <b>our</b> <b>report</b> to the Minister of the Interior. We said that the company which you made a contract with is not well-regarded internationally {{in the field of}} explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device." [...] Al-Turehi said that the buying process had been [...] "marred by suspicions over the equipment and the efficiency and value of the contracts. There were senior officials involved in these transactions." [...] The initial investigation found that it could detect some bombs and the ministry went ahead with the contract despite al-Turehi's concerns. An unnamed Iraqi officer told the Agence France-Presse that [...] "We know it doesn't work and that it has been banned , but we are continuing to use it. It is bullshit.

2500|$|On October 18, 2006, {{the draft}} {{report of a}} 10-member public inquiry into election-related unrests was {{released}} to Associated Press (AP). It concludes that a total of 199 people (193 civilians and six policemen) were killed and 763 were injured, a significantly higher figure than the Ethiopian government's claim that 61 civilians and seven policemen were killed. The {{vice chairman of the}} inquiry, judge Wolde-Michael Meshesha, who fled Ethiopia a month prior after he had received anonymous death threats, told AP that [...] "this was a massacre ... these demonstrators were unarmed yet the majority died from shots to the head." [...] He added that the government attempted to pressure and intimidate members of the inquiry after learning about its controversial finding. The Ethiopian government did not [...] immediately comment on the leaked report, but the next day, it told BBC that its contents were [...] "hearsay."

Jiang Xu sent a messenger to Chang'an to request for reinforcements. Xiahou Yuan and the officers in Chang'an held a meeting on whether to help Jiang Xu and his allies or not. Many of the officers thought that they should wait for orders from Cao Cao before making any move. However, Xiahou Yuan had a different opinion and he said, [...] "Our lord is 4,000 li away in Ye. By the time he receives <b>our</b> <b>report,</b> Jiang Xu and his allies are done for. Therefore, {{it is imperative that}} we send reinforcements to them immediately." [...] He appointed Zhang He to lead 5,000 infantry and cavalry as the vanguard and head towards Mount Qi via a narrow pass at Chencang (陳倉; present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi), while he supervised the supply train and followed behind with another army. When Zhang He's 5,000 strong army reached the Wei River, Ma Chao initially sent a few thousand Di and Qiang horsemen to resist the enemy, but later called for a retreat before both sides could engage in battle. Zhang He advanced further and seized the military equipment left behind by Ma Chao's forces. When Xiahou Yuan's army arrived, most the counties in Liang Province had been pacified.|$|E
