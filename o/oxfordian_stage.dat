5|$|The {{earliest}} known avialan fossils {{come from}} the Tiaojishan Formation of China, which has been dated to the late Jurassic period (<b>Oxfordian</b> <b>stage),</b> about 160 million years ago.

5|$|Limusaurus is {{the first}} {{definite}} ceratosaur from eastern Asia to be discovered. It {{is also one of}} the earliest members of the group Ceratosauria, living during the <b>Oxfordian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Jurassic period (approximately 161-157 million years ago). Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late Jurassic period than previously thought, and suggests a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E
500|$|Limusaurus (meaning [...] "mud lizard") is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur {{from the}} Jurassic (<b>Oxfordian</b> <b>stage)</b> Upper Shishugou Formation in the Junggar Basin of western China. The genus contains a single species, L. inextricabilis. Limusaurus was a small, slender animal, about [...] in length, {{that had a}} long neck and legs but also highly reduced forelimbs. It underwent a drastic morphological transformation as it aged; while juveniles were toothed, these teeth were completely lost and replaced by a beak with age, corresponding to a shift in diet from omnivory to herbivory.|$|E
50|$|The sediments {{in which}} it was found were {{originally}} thought to represent the Hauterivian to Barremian stages of the early Cretaceous Period, dating Jobaria to approximately 132 million years ago. However, re-interpretation of the sediments showed that they are more likely from the Bathonian to <b>Oxfordian</b> <b>stages</b> of the middle Jurassic in age, between 167 and 161 million years ago.|$|R
25|$|The {{remains of}} Afrovenator were {{discovered}} in 1993 in the Tiourarén Formation {{of the department of}} Agadez in Niger. The Tiourarén was originally thought to represent the Hauterivian to Barremian stages of the early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 132 to 125 million years ago (Sereno et al. 1994). However, re-interpretation of the sediments showed that they are probably mid-Jurassic in age, dating Afrovenator to the Bathonian to <b>Oxfordian</b> <b>stages,</b> between 167 and 161 mya. The sauropod Jobaria, whose remains were first mentioned in the same paper which named Afrovenator, is also known from this formation.|$|R
40|$|The Oxford Clay Formation {{is one of}} the {{classical}} units in British Jurassic tratigraphy. It crops out almost continuously in an arc running from the Dorset coast to Oxford, through the Midlands to Yorkshire. It was traditionally subdivided into Lower, Middle and Upper divisions, now formalized as the Peterborough, Stewartby and Weymouth Members, respectively (Cox et al. 1993). The Peterborough Member is organic-rich, the Stewartby and Weymouth Members more calcareous and generally organic-poor. Excellent ammonite faunas throughout the sequence are important in the international bio- and chrono-stratigraphy of the Callovian and <b>Oxfordian</b> <b>Stages,</b> and in correlation between the Tethyan and Boreal fauna 1 realms.

50|$|The Iraq Petroleum Company {{originally}} {{described the}} Jurassic sequence in Hamakhtesh Hagadol of Israel in the 1930s (Hudson, 1958). These findings were later described {{and published by}} Blake (1935). Shaw (1947) published a limited summary of the stratigraphy. Hudson (1958) later subdivided the rocks into the Callovian, Divesian, Argovian, Sequanim biostratigraphic stages. In 1963, Goldberg subdivided the section into the Zohar, Kidod and Be'er Sheva formations. Goldberg (1963) further divided the Zohar formation into the Ziyya and Madsus members. In 1966, Mayac dated the Callovian and {{what appeared to be}} the Lower <b>Oxfordian</b> <b>stages</b> with forams (Mayac, 1966, in Hirsch and Roded, 1996). Further biostratigraphic work by Hirsch et al. (1998) and Grossowicz et al. (2000) show that the Matmor Formation is entirely Upper Callovian.|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} geomagnetic polarity and geologic time-scale for the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods is presented, {{based on}} various methods {{according to the}} availability of definitive isotopic ages. An age-calibrated sea-floor-spreading model is used to interpolate {{the ages of the}} Kimmeridgian to Barremian, and the Campanian to Maestrichtian stages. Numerical age estimates for the Aptian to Santonian stage boundaries follow published isotopic age determinations. The hypothesis of equal duration of ammonite zones is employed as a vernier to apportion time for the Hettangian to <b>Oxfordian</b> <b>stages.</b> The new scale results in ages of 208 Ma for the base of the Jurassic, 144 Ma for the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary and 66. 5 Ma for the top of the Cretaceous.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Oxfordian,</b> first <b>stage</b> of {{the late}} Jurassic, is remarkably {{variable}} in terms of deposited sediments, geochemical tracers, and climate. The climate changed during the Middle Oxfordian from humid to arid with a temperature rise of more than five degrees. During this time, the 13 C reached maximum values. The positive excursion in 13 C of carbonates from the Oxfordian (with an amplitude of more than 1 ‰) was reproduced in hemipelagic sections from southeastern France. Analysis of major and trace elements of these carbonates were carried out by LA-ICP-MS in order to verify their application as palaeoproxies {{in conjunction with the}} changes mentioned in climate. As a novel approach 36 elements were measured with regard to establish a complete and comprehensive analysis of the geochemical situation. Concentration peaks of P, Sr, Mn, Fe, Ba point to a more oligotrophic setting within {{the lower part of the}} sediment profile from southeastern France. Conversely, the positive 13 C excursion with 13 C values rising from 2 to 3 ‰ within the uppermost part of the profile coincide with more elevated concentrations of V, Fe, Mn, U arguing for an ocean-wide anoxia (Oceanic Anoxic Events OAE). High detrital input during this arid period is recorded by enhanced concentrations of elements like Ti, Mn, Fe, Zr, Nb and W. This correlation of the 13 C excursion with trends in Ti, Nb, W as well as Mn and Fe contents reflects changes in the Oxfordian palaeooceanography and climate. During the late Oxfordian the environmental prerequisites were controlled by warm and arid conditions and an increased metal flux from the continent due to the intensified chemical and physical weathering, erosion of rocks, as well as aeolian and fluvial transport to the oceans...|$|R
40|$|The {{cretaceous}} successions of the Prebetic; {{deposited on}} the Southern Iberian Continental Margin, record the later {{part of a}} rifting <b>stage</b> (<b>Oxfordian</b> to early Albian). The {{northern part of the}} sierra de Segura (jaén province, SE Spain) shows a stratigraphic record of the tectonosedimentary evolution of the early cretaceous time. Four sedimentary sequences have been defined for the Barremian - Early Albian interval, which are evidence for different transgressive pulses, coinciding with the extensional phases of the north atlantic rifting. The first transgressive episode took place in the early Barremian, with deposition of several marine carbonate beds within a lacustrine succession (sequence 04). In the late Bedoulian arose the maximum transgression, with deposition of litoral calcarenites in previously emerged areas of the margin (sequence Ci 5). The concluding reactivation of the rifting phase occurred in the late Aptian, with deposition of rudist-bearing limestones in all the studied area (sequence 06). This last tectonic phase caused the migration of depocenters towards the continent. The deposition of sequence 07, with expansive continental and marine deposits marked the end of the rifting and de beginning of the post-rift phas...|$|R
