5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit the growth <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>black</b> oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical analysis of self-reported reservation wages for unemployed <b>young</b> <b>black</b> and white males. The {{results show that}} <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> seek wages which are comparable to those <b>of</b> <b>young</b> whites in absolute terms, but which are higher relative to what {{is available on the}} demand side of the market. These relatively higher reservation wages <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> contribute to their unemployment durations and somewhat to their subsequently received wages. Changes in reservation wages may thus help to explain the trends in wages and employment <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> in recent years. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} reservation {{wages and}} durations <b>of</b> nonemployment for <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites. Selfreported reservation wages are compared {{for blacks and}} whites before and after controlling for indicators of labor demand such as received wages, weeks worked, or other personal characterlstics. The effects of these reservation wages on durations of nonemployment {{as well as on}} subsequent wages are analyzed as well. The results show that <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> seek jobs and wages which are comparable to those <b>of</b> <b>young</b> whites, but which are higher relative to what <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> obtain. On the other hand, <b>young</b> <b>blacks</b> appear at least if not more likely to take specific low-skill jobs, albeit teporariiy. These reservation wages appear to have positive effects on nonemployment durations and subsequent wages for both groups, and explain up to a third of the higher nonemployment durations <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>blacks.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|The 1985 Brixton riot {{followed}} the police shooting {{of a local}} black woman, Dorothy 'Cherry' Groce, after the police had entered her house looking for her son Michael Groce. Although the Brixton area subsequently saw pioneering community policing initiatives, the continued death <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>black</b> men in police custody (and in one case {{the death of a}} man pointing a fake gun at people) coupled with general distrust of the police led to smaller scale protests through the 1990s.|$|E

Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media cited the latter point as a probable source of concern among parents having their children watch the series.

[...] As the nation grappled with a seeming epidemic of police killings <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>black</b> men like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice, Rapping urged that we not see that issue as disconnected from “routine injustice” destroying poor communities of color every day. [...] In [...] "It's Not Just the Cops" [...] and [...] "From Ferguson to Staten Island: In Case Anyone Doubted the Public Needs Defending," [...] he argues that public defenders are a necessary component to a comprehensive strategy to realize equal justice that is illusive throughout the criminal justice system. [...] In [...] "The Other Baltimore Story," [...] he makes a similar argument as the nation focused its attention on the killing of Freddy Gray by reminding us of the routine injustice in Baltimore through the story of Ronald Hammond, and the response of public defenders.|$|E

2500|$|Of all his {{research}} and experimentation, Chang's work in {{in vitro fertilisation}} was arguably his greatest achievement. [...] In 1935, Gregory Pincus had claimed to have achieved successful mammal birth from the result of in vitro fertilisation of rabbit eggs. [...] As nobody, including Chang, could repeat this feat at the time, doubts were cast over {{the authenticity of the}} claim. [...] Then finally, in 1959, Chang in vitro fertilised a black rabbit's eggs with a black rabbit's sperm, transferred them to a white rabbit, and was able to produce a litter <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>black</b> rabbits. [...] This was the sort of evidence attesting to the feasibility of in vitro fertilisation for which many scientists had been searching. [...] In the years that followed, Chang and his associates conducted further research to determine specific conditions of successful in vitro fertilisation as well as to perform the technique on other mammals such as hamsters, mice, and rats. [...] It was on the basis of Chang's findings that the first in vitro fertilisation of human eggs was performed, leading to the birth of the world's first [...] "test tube baby" [...] in 1978.|$|E

A pair of big owls lived and hunted in a swamp hard by, who hooted dismally before the storms came, and sometimes swept within the circle of my fire at night. Every morning a raccoon stopped at a little pool in the brook above my tent, to wash his food carefully ere taking it home.
