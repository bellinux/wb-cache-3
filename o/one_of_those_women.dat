2500|$|Not {{only men}} but also women had an active participation, albeit in lesser numbers. Emerlinda Duarte, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women,</b> wrote the song [...] "Somos Livres", for a 1972 theatre play called Lisboa 72, masking a deep meaning with catchy children's music. Although {{the version of}} her singing the tune is the best known it was only {{recorded}} after the carnation revolution.|$|E
60|$|DAVID [rather happily]. She's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who are {{eternally}} young.|$|E
60|$|Fantine was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who {{do wrong}} in the most virtuous and {{touching}} manner. This is a peculiarity of French grisettes.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the last}} document," [...] said Dr. Pym complacently, [...] "is from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> high-souled <b>women</b> who {{have in this}} age {{introduced}} your English girlhood to hockey, the higher mathematics, and every form of ideality.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Tommy, and {{she rose}} {{to let him}} put the elegant thing round her. She was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{dangerous}} <b>women</b> who look their best when you are helping them to put on their cloaks.|$|R
60|$|If {{there was}} one thing more than another that she could not stand it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> soft <b>women</b> with what men called 'charm' about them, and for Mrs. Soames she always had an especial dislike.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Clemens corrects me: <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> was a fraud, {{the other}} not a fraud, but only an innocent, well-meaning, driveling vacancy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Her {{roots are}} deeper,--she is in touch, though {{she may not}} realize it, with the fundamentals. She is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who are race-makers." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{truth is}} that Mameena was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who sticks in a man's mind even more closely than a [...] "Wait-a-bit" [...] thorn does in his coat.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's--awfully pretty," [...] {{she said}} with the {{glittering}} symbol in her hand, and indeed {{he had gone to}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> artistic <b>women</b> who are reviving and improving upon the rich old Roman designs. [...] "It's so beautifully made." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> young <b>women</b> {{was rather}} good-looking," [...] Rosa remarked: [...] "the {{one in the}} cap with the blue ribbons." [...] (And she cast about {{the shape of the}} cap in her mind, and {{determined}} to have exactly such another.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will those Germans on {{our left}} never stop talking?" [...] she asked, as an undying flow of Teutonic small talk rattled and jangled across the {{intervening}} stretch of carpet. [...] "Not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> three <b>women</b> has ceased talking {{for an instant}} since we've been sitting here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but she's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> {{you never}} {{can look at}} without seeing that she has a--a--body. She's too-too--d'you see what I mean? It's almost--almost like a Frenchwoman!" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Wroxham, {{the mother}} of Mountry and the {{vanishing}} Augustus, was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who take things as they come. She did not seem surprised at seeing me.|$|E
60|$|It was true. Mrs. Tallboys was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> of {{resource}} whose practical powers may well inspire {{the sense of}} superiority, and with the ease and confidence of her country.|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't {{talk about}} it," [...] she continued. [...] "We mustn't talk about it. Only {{it gave me}} foolish thoughts. From being utterly incredulous or indifferent, I went to the other extreme. I became, I suppose, {{absolutely}} foolish. I went to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> stupid <b>women</b> in Bond Street." ...|$|R

60|$|Jack's {{admiration of}} Harold was {{too great to}} admit of any {{question}} of his design. He would have said {{no one else was}} worthy to tie Mary's shoe, for he, too, worshiped her--but afar off. He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> whom <b>women</b> recognize only as gentle and useful beings, plain and unobtrusive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another strange face," [...] Sarah remarked, {{looking after}} the butler {{who had just}} brought in the coffee. [...] "I thought you were <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women,</b> Josephine, who always kept their servants." ...|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON (furiously flinging {{the packet}} on the couch). Heaven grant me patience! (He goes up determinedly and places himself before the door.) Have you {{any sense of}} {{personal}} danger? Or are you <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who like to be beaten black and blue? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--my boy!" [...] she faltered. Her lip trembled, {{her face}} broke, and, {{snatching}} up the child, she {{buried her face}} in his shoulder and cried painfully. She was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who cannot cry; whom it hurts as it hurts a man. It was like ripping something out of her, her sobbing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she {{was younger}} than he, and rather attractive. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> doll-faced <b>women.</b> You remember, he settled that life {{insurance}} policy on her and the children: she might have waited; she didn't. The other day she eloped with some fellow, I don't remember his name, with {{the children and the}} five thousand dollars." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Love! You {{talk like}} a school miss {{instead of a}} middle-aged woman. He doesn't love you. He wants a {{housekeeper}} and a governess. You don't love him. You want to be 'Mrs.'--you are <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> weak-minded <b>women</b> who think it's a disgrace to be ranked as an old maid. That's {{all there is to}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Roger {{says she}} didn't exactly ask him, but she helped the lame dog over the stile so slick that Richard {{was engaged to}} her before he knew what had {{happened}} to him," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "I know a story about Mrs. Richard Cook's grandmother. She was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who are always saying 'I told you so--'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ungrateful! I'll let {{her know}} whether I owe her any gratitude. Haven't I paid her her rent every half-year as it came due? what more would she have? Ungrateful, indeed! She is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who think {{that you ought to}} go down on your knees to them if they only speak civilly to you. I'll {{let her know}} whether I'm ungrateful." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{she found}} him in his present place--if she put her own clever {{construction}} on what she saw--her opinion would assuredly express itself in some way. She was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who can insult another woman (and safely disguise it) by an inquiring look. For the girl's sake, Ovid instantly moved away from her to the seats {{at the back of}} the hall.|$|E
6000|$|The door is opened. CLARE DEDMOND in a cream-coloured evening [...] frock {{comes in}} from the hall, {{followed}} by GEORGE. She is rather [...] pale, of middle height, with a beautiful figure, wavy brown [...] hair, full, smiling lips, and large grey mesmeric eyes, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> [...] <b>those</b> <b>women</b> all vibration, iced over with a trained stoicism of [...] voice and manner.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{has been}} {{quoted as saying}} that Hush is [...] "the kind of movie where you walk in, watch the first 10 minutes, know exactly where it's going, and hope devoutly that you're wrong. It's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Devouring <b>Woman</b> movies where the villainess never plays a scene without a drink and a cigarette, and the hero is inattentive to the victim to the point of dementia." ...|$|R
6000|$|But say, {{what was}} it? Thought of fear! [...] Well may ye tremble when ye hear! [...] --A Household Tub, like <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> [...] Which <b>women</b> use {{to wash their}} clothes, [...] This carried the blind Boy.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Ellison did {{not find}} all this so very grievous, for she was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who like a snub from the {{superior}} sex, {{if it does not}} involve a slight to their beauty or their power of pleasing. But she thought it best not to enter into the question, and merely said, [...] "But surely, Kitty, there are a great many things in Mr. Arbuton that you must respect." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{are certain}} women whose {{influence}} over men is an unfathomable mystery to observers {{of their own}} sex. The governess was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women.</b> She had inherited the charm, but not the beauty, of her unhappy mother. Judge her by the standard {{set up in the}} illustrated gift-books and the print-shop windows--and the sentence must have inevitably followed. [...] "She has not a single good feature in her face." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Leighton was not {{so easily}} quelled. She had got her mind on Mr. Beaton, {{and she could not}} detach it at once. Besides, she was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> (they are {{commoner}} than the same sort of men) whom it does not pain to take out their most intimate thoughts and examine them in the light of other people's opinions. [...] "But I don't see how he can behave so. He must know that--" ...|$|E
50|$|In 1992, women earned 9 {{percent of}} the PhDs awarded in {{engineering}}, but only <b>one</b> percent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> became professors. In 1995, 11 percent of professors {{in science and engineering}} were women. In relation, only 311 deans of engineering schools were women, which is less than 1 {{percent of the}} total. Even in psychology, a degree in which women earn the majority of PhDs, they hold a significant amount of fewer tenured positions, roughly 19 percent in 1994.|$|R
60|$|From {{that day}} dated our {{friendship}} with Miss Ponsonby, a curious friendship, only carried on from window to window. We never saw Miss Ponsonby anywhere else; we {{asked her to}} come over but she said her father didn't allow her to visit anybody. Miss Ponsonby was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> meek <b>women</b> who are ruled by whomsoever happens to be nearest them, and woe be unto them if that nearest {{happen to be a}} tyrant. Her meekness fairly infuriated Jerry.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Makely was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> fatuous <b>women</b> whose {{eagerness to}} make a point {{excludes}} the consideration even of their own advantage. [...] "I'm sure," [...] she said, as if speaking for the upper classes, [...] "we haven't got any individuality at all. We are as like as so many peas or pins. In fact, you have to be so in society. If you keep asserting your own individuality too much, people avoid you. It's very vulgar and the greatest bore." ...|$|R
