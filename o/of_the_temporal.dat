The early encounters and historic culture of familiar Star Trek franchise races, such as the Vulcans, Andorians, Klingons, Romulans, Tholians, Borg, and Tellarites, are also explored further.

5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E

40|$|Functional imaging {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex in sentence comprehension. It is unclear, however, whether <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex is essential for this function. We studied two aspects of sentence comprehension, namely syntactic and prosodic comprehension in temporal lobe epilepsy patients who were candidates for resection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> lobe. Methods: Temporal lobe epilepsy patients (n = 32) with normal (left) language dominance were tested on syntactic and prosodic comprehension before and after removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex. <b>The</b> prosodic comprehension test was also compared with performance of healthy control subjects (n = 47) before surgery. Results: Overall, temporal lobe epilepsy patients {{did not differ from}} healthy controls in syntactic and prosodic comprehension before surgery. They did perform less well on an affective prosody task. Post-operative testing revealed that syntactic and prosodic comprehension did not change after removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex. Discussion: <b>The</b> unchanged performance on syntactic and prosodic comprehension after removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex suggests that this area is not indispensable for sentence comprehension functions in temporal epilepsy patients. Potential implications for <b>the</b> postulated role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> lobe in <b>the</b> healthy brain are discussed...|$|R

5|$|He {{begins the}} section with an {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> opening {{found in the}} skull of many extant birds. After a thorough comparison, he rejects the notion, which was common at the time, that this temporal opening was homologous with the supratemporal fenestra in reptiles. Instead, he concludes {{that it is a}} recent feature. Next he makes some observations on the wing structure of modern nestling birds. He finds that some species of extant birds have claws on their first and second fingers when very young, and some, like the hoatzin, will even use these temporary claws to climb about, including in the branches of trees. He also discovers that far more nestlings have a nonfunctional claw on the first digit, and some adult birds do as well.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of the {{wildebeest}} are known to hybridise. Male black wildebeest {{have been reported to}} mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals, the tympanic part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> bone is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> peers, The 4th Earl of Kilmorey (a peer from an Ulster family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans. In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish peers to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish peers the right to stand for election to the House of Commons, and to vote at parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
