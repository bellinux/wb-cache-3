25|$|The story hinges {{upon the}} {{enactment}} and subsequent unintended consequences of several important pieces <b>of</b> U.S. <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> legislation and regulation: the National Firearms Act <b>of</b> 1934, the <b>Gun</b> <b>Control</b> Act <b>of</b> 1968, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, the Assault Weapons Importation Ban enacted by Presidential executive order in 1989 and the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.|$|R

25|$|Frank Church was {{considered}} a progressive (remarkable considering that he represented {{one of the most}} conservative states in the nation), though he was a strong opponent <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> <b>control.</b> He, in 1979, was the first in Congress to disclose and protest the presence of Soviet combat troops in Cuba. According to the Christian Science Monitor, this stance somewhat disarmed his opponent's charge in the 1980 campaign that Church's performance on the Foreign Relations Committee had helped to weaken the US militarily.|$|E
40|$|The United States has {{a history}} of mass shootings {{conducted}} with civilian firearms. This thesis answers how variations in state and federal gun legislation affect the occurrence of mass shootings to understand what the possibilities are to resolve this issue. The statistical analysis that regresses the strictness <b>of</b> state <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> against the occurrence of mass shootings per state finds that there is no correlation between the variables and that state <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> is thus ineffective. We find support for this result and the ineffectiveness <b>of</b> current federal <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> measures in the legislative framework, legal loopholes, sheer abundance <b>of</b> <b>guns,</b> and in the underlying conditions <b>of</b> American <b>gun</b> culture and the normalization of mass shootings as a byproduct <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> rights...|$|R
40|$|The most {{frequent}} policy lesson drawn following the Columbine school shootings {{was the need}} for more <b>gun</b> <b>controls.</b> Review <b>of</b> the details of both Columbine and other contemporary school shootings indicates, however, that the specific <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> mea-sures proposed in their aftermath were largely irrelevant and almost certainly could not have prevented the incidents or reduced their death tolls. These measures included restrictions on gun shows, child access prevention laws mandating locking up guns, and bans on assault weapons. Ironically, exploitation of school shootings for the advo-cacy <b>of</b> irrelevant <b>gun</b> <b>controls</b> may have obscured the genuine merits <b>of</b> various <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> measures for reducing “ordinary ” gun violence. Thus, mass school shootings provided the worst possible basis for supporting <b>gun</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

25|$|After {{one term}} as mayor, Clark {{narrowly}} defeated incumbent Republican Senator James H. Duff in the 1956 Senate election. Clark {{earned a reputation}} as a strong supporter of civil rights and worked to appoint liberal committee members from his perch on the Democratic Steering Committee. Clark narrowly won re-election in 1962 but was defeated in 1968 by Congressman Richard Schweiker. His defeat is generally credited to his support <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> and opposition to the Vietnam War. After leaving office, Clark became a professor at Temple University.|$|E
25|$|On {{social issues}} however, she was {{significantly}} {{more liberal than}} many of her fellow senators.

25|$|While {{serving in}} the House of Representatives, Schumer, along with California senator Dianne Feinstein, {{authored}} the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban which expired in 2004. The National Rifle Association and other gun groups (see gun politics) have criticized him for allegedly not knowing much about guns, alluding to various errors regarding the subject. Supporters <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> legislation, however, give him {{much of the credit}} for passage of both the Assault Weapons Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The Assault Weapons Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.|$|E

500|$|The Gun Court {{system has}} been put forth by gun {{ownership}} advocates {{as an example of}} a failed regime <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> <b>control.</b> [...] In an essay in the National Review in 2001, Dave Kopel argued that [...] "he Gun Court took guns only out of the hands of Jamaica's law-abiding, leaving them at the mercy of the criminals and the state." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul opposes {{all forms}} <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> as a {{violation}} of Second Amendment rights, including provisions of the Patriot Act.

Provisions of the bill include restricting the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies to [...] "impinge upon states' power over land and water use." [...] The bill holds requires Federal agencies to reimburse private property owners double the amount of any economic losses arising from new Federal regulations [...] "that relate to the definition of navigable waters or waters of the United States", and holds the enforcement of any such regulation in abeyance until such payments are complete.|$|E
