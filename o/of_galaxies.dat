5|$|Clusters <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{consist of}} {{hundreds}} to thousands <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> bound together by gravity.

5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> have been catalogued, {{but only a}} few have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies</b> and of Clusters <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies),</b> the MCG (Morphological Catalogue <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies)</b> and UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies).</b> All of the well-known galaxies appear in {{one or more of these}} catalogues but each time under a different number.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> can {{be significantly}} affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> were common {{during the early}} epoch, and the majority <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> were peculiar in morphology. Given the distances between the stars, {{the great majority of}} stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the interstellar gas and dust that makes up the spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies.|$|E

5|$|Galaxies have {{magnetic}} fields of their own. They {{are strong enough}} to be dynamically important: they drive mass inflow into the centers <b>of</b> <b>galaxies,</b> they modify the formation of spiral arms and they can affect the rotation of gas in the outer regions <b>of</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Magnetic fields provide the transport of angular momentum required for the collapse of gas clouds and hence the formation of new stars.|$|E
5|$|Most {{galaxies in}} the Universe are gravitationally bound {{to a number of}} other galaxies. These form a fractal-like {{hierarchical}} distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> is {{the most common type of}} galactic cluster, and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies (as well as most of the baryonic mass) in the Universe. To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> through mergers.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} mass-assembly and {{chemical}} enrichment histories <b>of</b> star forming <b>galaxies</b> by applying a population synthesis method {{to a sample}} <b>of</b> 84828 <b>galaxies</b> from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5.

A comparative study <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> evolution is presented, where galaxies are grouped onto bins of nebular abundances or mass. We find that galaxies whose warm interstellar medium is poor in heavy elements are slow in forming stars. Their stellar metallicities also rise slowly with time, reaching their current values (Z ⋆ ∼ 1 / 3 Z⊙) in the last ∼ 100 Myr of evolution. Systems with metal rich nebulae, on the other hand, assembled most of their mass and completed their chemical evolution long ago, reaching Z ⋆ ∼ Z⊙ already at lookback times of several Gyr. These same trends, which are ultimately a consequence <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> downsizing, appear when galaxies are grouped according to their stellar mass. The reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> histories to this level of detail out of integrated spectra offers promising prospects in the field <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> evolution theories...|$|R

5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A {{slightly}} more extensive description of galaxy types {{based on their}} appearance is given by the Hubble sequence.

5|$|Gravitational aggregations {{clustered}} into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, {{organizations of}} gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies.

40|$|High-redshift protoclusters {{are ideal}} places {{to study the}} {{formation}} of the largest structures in the Universe and the early environmental influences on galaxy evolution. Recent discoveries of z> 2 protoclusters with extremely rich populations <b>of</b> dusty star-forming <b>galaxies</b> (DSFGs; SFR> 100 Msun/yr) represent the most active assembly phases <b>of</b> massive <b>galaxy</b> clusters.

5|$|In {{the early}} part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Hubble and others made the first {{measurements}} of the redshifts and blueshifts <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> beyond the Milky Way. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as due to random motions, but later Hubble discovered a rough correlation between the increasing redshifts and the increasing distance <b>of</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a mechanism for producing redshifts seen in certain cosmological solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity. Hubble's law of the correlation between redshifts and distances is required by all such models that have a metric expansion of space. As a result, the wavelength of photons propagating through the expanding space is stretched, creating the cosmological redshift.|$|E
5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form <b>of</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|E
