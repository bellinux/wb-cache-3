Analysis {{of a new}} compilation of incidents of airports impacted by volcanic activity from 1944 through 2006 reveals that, at a minimum, 101 airports in 28 countries were affected on 171 occasions by eruptions at 46 volcanoes.

The main hazard to airports is ashfall, with accumulations of only a few millimeters sufficient to force temporary closures of some airports. A substantial portion of incidents has been caused by ash in airspace in the vicinity of airports, without accumu-lation of ash on the ground. On a few occasions, airports have been impacted by hazards other than ash (pyroclastic flow, lava flow, gas emission, and phreatic explosion). Several airports have been affected repeatedly by volcanic hazards.

We hypothesized that this CAR would efficiently redirect transduced T cells in an HLA-restricted, antigen-specific manner. However, we found that despite the specificity of the soluble Fab, the same antibody {{in the form of}} a CAR caused moderate lysis of HLA-A 2 expressing targets independent of antigen <b>owing</b> to <b>T</b> cell avidity.

DN CAR T cells lysed native tumor targets in vitro, and, in a xenogeneic mouse model implanted with two human melanoma lines (A 2 +/NYESO+ and A 2 +/NYESO−), DN CAR T cells specifically migrated to, and delayed progression of, only the HLA-A 2 +/NY-ESO- 1 + melanoma.

The dominant length scale is 7000 km, the same dimensions as {{the width of the}} mid-latitude ocean. The growth time scale is 1 - 2 weeks, with the duration of blocking activity rarely exceeding 2 months in any given year.

Year-to-year variability in blocking ridge activity is found to have a dominant time scale of approximately 5 years from 1950 - 70 and to be inversely correlated (- 0. 79) with the strength of the autumn/winter mean mid-latitude westerlies (the mean formed using months not containing blocking activity).

Then we analyze the redistribution of quantum correlation, and find that for the case of the Hawking temperature being infinite, corresponding to the case of the black hole evaporating completely, the quantum correlation of physically accessible state is equal to the one of the inaccessible states. Moreover, due to the Pauli exclusion principle and the differences between Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics, for the Dirac fields the accessible classical correlation decreases with increase of the Hawking temperature, which is different for the scalar fields. For Bell non-locality, we also find that the quantum non-locality is always extinct for physically inaccessible states, and the strength of the non-locality decreases with enlarging intensity of Hawking effect when the non-locality is existent in physically accessible state...|$|R

He {{returned}} against South Africa at Lord's, but after scores of 31 and a slow 28 in 105 minutes, the press began to speculate that his may lose his place in the team. In the second Test, Boycott made a duck in the first innings and later took 140 minutes to score 16 runs when England needed to score quickly; Wisden described the latter innings as a [...] "dreadful effort when courage was needed". Subsequently, Boycott was dropped and replaced by Eric Russell. Boycott returned to the team {{at the end of the}} season for the tour to Australia. In the 1965-66 Ashes series, illness dogged his performance initially. He then hit a form of [...] "brighter cricket" [...] during the First and Second Tests. Uncharacteristically, he hit a four from his very first delivery at Perth, and put on 98 in 16 overs with Bob Barber in the Second Test. In the Third Test, Boycott and Barber shared an opening partnership of 234 in four hours; Boycott hit 84, his highest score of the series. But in the Fifth Test he monopolised the strike, ran out Bob Barber and took 75 minutes to make 17 runs. His form deserted him again when the MCC went on to tour New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the quantum corrections to the conductivity of fermions interacting via a Chern-Simons gauge field, {{and concentrate on}} the Hartree-type contributions. The first-order Hartree approximation is only valid {{in the limit of}} weak coupling λ to the gauge field, and results in an antilocalizing conductivity correction, ∼λ^ 2 g ^ 2 T (g is the conductance). In the case of strong coupling, an infinite summation of higher-order terms is necessary, including both the virtual (renormalization) and real (dephasing) processes. At intermediate temperatures 1 /g^ 2 τ<<T<< 1 /gτ (τ is the transport time), the T-dependence of the conductivity is determined by the Hartree correction. At low temperatures T<< 1 /g^ 2 τ, the Hartree correction assumes a logarithmic form with a coefficient of order unity. As a result, the negative exchange contribution becomes dominant, yielding localization in the limit of zero T. We further discuss dephasing at strong coupling and show that the dephasing rates are of the order of <b>T,</b> <b>owing</b> to the interplay of inelastic scattering and renormalization. On the other hand, the dephasing length is anomalously short, L_ϕ<<L_T. For the case of composite fermions with long-range Coulomb interaction, the Hartree correction has the usual T-dependence, and for realistic g is overcompensated by the negative exchange contribution due to the gauge-boson and scalar parts of the interaction. In this case, the dephasing length L_ϕ is of the order of L_T for not too low T and exceeds L_T for T< 1 /gτ. Comment: 36 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
