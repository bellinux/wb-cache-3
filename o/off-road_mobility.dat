25|$|The Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) {{formerly}} known as the Ultra Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV), is a U.S. Army proposed air-droppable light off-road vehicle to improve the mobility of light infantry brigades. In March 2015, the Army changed the name of the ULCV to the Ground Mobility Vehicle. GMV is intended to be carried internally in a CH-47 Chinook or externally by a UH-60 Black Hawk. In order to be survivable but transportable, the GMV would be lightly armored and use speed, maneuverability, and <b>off-road</b> <b>mobility</b> to avoid major threats.|$|E
500|$|In August 1945, {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} the war in Europe, the 61st Division was reorganized as a light division. The light division concept had been undertaken during the Burma Campaign {{following the}} initial defeats. Historian F.W. Perry commented that the Indian Army concluded that [...] "existing Indian formations were over-mechanised and road-bound." [...] Therefore, the surviving 17th Indian Division was reorganised as a light division. This included being reduced to two infantry brigades, all non-cross country capable vehicles being replaced with mules, jeeps, and four-wheel drive trucks, and the field artillery either completely replaced by pack howitzers or mechanised. These changes greatly increased the <b>off-road</b> <b>mobility,</b> and the increase in pack animals allowed it to operate away from a road network {{for an extended period of}} time.|$|E

50|$|Shotton's {{research}} into the geological makeup of Normandy beaches helped allied commanders decide which were the best to use on D-Day. From May 1941 to September 1943, based in Egypt, he used hydrogeology to guide development of potable water supplies for British forces operational in the Middle East and northern Africa. From October 1943 he helped plan for the Allied liberation of Normandy by providing terrain evaluation (primarily through preparation of specialist maps and contribution of technical advice) relating to beach conditions, suitability of ground for the rapid construction of temporary airfields, and water supply. Following D-Day, 6 June 1944, he was based in northern France and later Belgium, and was involved with further water supply tasks, discussions on quarrying of aggregate, and assessment of soil conditions likely to influence <b>off-road</b> vehicle <b>mobility</b> or the siting of airfields and military depots, thus contributing to Allied victory in Europe in May 1945. He was awarded an MBE in recognition of his military geological work. Shotton’s pioneering Quaternary research resulted in his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society. Shotton was Head of the Geology Department at the University of Birmingham from 1949 {{until his retirement in}} 1974. He was also Vice-Principal of Birmingham University.|$|R
500|$|Beginning {{as early}} as 1973, only seven years after the {{beginning}} of production, the French began a research program for a future modification of the tank. The project was {{to result in a}} [...] AMX 30 Valorisé ("upgraded AMX-30"). In June 1979, the French Army decided to both build new and modernize existing AMX-30s with an improved fire control system and a new transmission, and designated them AMX-30B2s. The first new production vehicles were taken into service in January 1982. Improvements to the COTAC APX M-508 fire control system included the installation of a laser rangefinder and a low-light TV (LLTV). The main gun's lethality was improved with the introduction of a new armour piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS). The original engine was exchanged for an improved variant, known as the HS-110.2, producing [...] The poor transmission was replaced with the semi-automatic [...] transmission (now RENK France), with a torque converter. The suspension was improved by adopting new torsion bars and shocks, which increased the vertical deflection range of the road wheels, thereby improving the tank's <b>off-road</b> <b>mobility.</b> From 1998, the French army started to replace the engines of its remaining AMX-30 tanks and variants with 500 Renault Mack E9 750hp engines.|$|E
2500|$|The first 50 {{units were}} based on M4A4 hulls, had a Continental R-975 {{gasoline}} engine and VVSS suspension. However, the increased weight of the vehicle combined with narrow tracks led to poor <b>off-road</b> <b>mobility.</b> It was also putting too much strain on the engine, resulting in frequent mechanical failures. Consequently, {{for the rest of}} the conversions, hulls fitted with HVSS suspension and Cummins V-8 [...] diesel engine were adopted. These subvariants were sometimes referred to as the M-50 Continental and M-50 Cummins. Diesel engines were also preferred since diesel fuel is less flammable than gasoline, which factors into battlefield survivability. In total, about 300 M-50s were built by 1964 (though it's possible that this number includes 120 155mm self-propelled guns on Sherman chassis, also designated M-50).|$|E
2500|$|Slim quickly got on {{with the}} task of {{training}} his new army to take the fight to the enemy. His basic premise was that <b>off-road</b> <b>mobility</b> was paramount: much heavy equipment was exchanged for mule- or air-transported equipment, and motor transport was kept to a minimum and restricted to vehicles that could cope with some of the worst combat terrain on Earth. The new doctrine dictated that if the Japanese had cut the lines of communication, then they too were surrounded. All units were to form defensive 'boxes', to be resupplied by air and assisted by integrated close air support and armour. The boxes were designed as an effective response to the tactics of infiltration practised by the Japanese in the war. Slim also supported increased offensive patrolling and night training, to encourage his soldiers to lose both their fear of the jungle and their belief that Japanese soldiers were better jungle fighters. He also instructed them to hold their positions once outflanked. The Chin hills formed a natural defensive barrier into Burma, which Slim would have preferred to outflank by an amphibious operation by landing further down the coast of Burma, but demands of the war in Europe meant the necessary landing craft were not available, forcing Slim to devise plans for advancing into Burma the hard way through the Chin hills. At the same time, the Japanese 15th Army, which formed the main striking force of the Burma Area Army, had grown from four divisions at the beginning of 1943 to eight divisions by the end of 1943 as the Japanese made preparations for invading India, which increased the difficulties of an overland advance into Burma. By 1943, the Burma Death Railway which cost the lives of thousands of slaves who built it was finished, which allowed the Japanese to reinforce the Burma Area Army, and made invading India barely possible. As Slim went about training his men for the rigours of jungle warfare, he clashed with Brigadier Orde Wingate, who took away some of Slim's best Gurkha, British and African units for his Chindit raiding group. Slim argued against the loss of his better units to Wingate, and maintained that though Wingate had a successful career in Palestine and Ethiopia he would discover that the Japanese were a considerably tougher foe than the Palestinians and the Italians that Wingate had hitherto been fighting. However, Slim did approve of Wingate's plans for aid to the hill tribes of Burma. The various hill peoples of Burma such as the Kachins, Karens, Chin, Nagas and the Shan collectively amounted to about 7 million of Burma's 17 million people, and unlike the Barmars who had welcomed the Japanese as liberators, had stayed loyal to the British when the Japanese invaded. The hill peoples of Burma had suffered under Japanese rule, and were more than willing to wage guerrilla warfare against them. Slim approved of the plans of the SOE and OSS to provide arms and training to the hill tribes as a way to tie down Japanese forces that would otherwise be deployed against him.|$|E
50|$|The URO VAMTAC was {{developed}} by the Spanish company URO, Vehiculos Especiales S.A. so that it would meet the requirements of the Spanish military for a multipurpose, air-portable, high <b>mobility</b> <b>off-road</b> vehicle with good payload capacity. After the vehicle was tested by the Spanish Ministry of Defence, UROVESA received a five-year contract and the URO VAMTAC was produced from 1998 to 2003. In October 2005, the Ministry of Defence awarded a new five-year contract for the URO VAMTAC after a three-month trial period. This also introduced some changes, and the two models of the vehicle which were named T3 and T5, were re-designated as I3 and S3 respectively. The URO VAMTAC is similar in appearance and design to the U.S. Military's Humvee, because both vehicles were designed to meet similar requirements and specifications.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to integrate a continuum-based deformable tire and terrain interaction model into a general-use physics-based simulation environment capable of <b>off-road</b> vehicle <b>mobility</b> analysis and high-performance computing potential. Specifically, the physics-based deformable tire and terrain models which were recently proposed and validated by Yamashita, et al. will be implemented into the structure of the multi-physics simulation engine Chrono. In <b>off-road</b> vehicle <b>mobility</b> analysis, empirical and analytical models have been commonly used for vehicle-terrain interaction. While these models utilize experimental data or terramechanics theories to create quick predictive mobility models, they are unable to capture the highly nonlinear behavior of soft soil deformation, which can lead to inaccurate or unreliable results. In order to resolve these limitations, the use of physics-based numerical approaches have been proposed. These methods make use of finite element and discrete element simulations to describe the interaction between the vehicle and deformable terrain. Continuum-based finite element models transfer tire forces to the terrain and model the deformation with elasto-plastic constitutive models. Discrete element soil uses a large number of small rigid body particles to describe the microscale behavior of granular terrain, with the deformation of the soil represented by the motion and contact of the particles. While these physics-based models offer a more accurate vehicle-terrain interaction model, the solution procedure can become complex and computationally expensive since co-simulation techniques are often used. To address these issues, the analysis of physics-based full vehicle dynamics simulations utilizing high-fidelity deformable tire and terrain models in a multi-physics engine with high-performance computing capability is desired. To this end, a continuum mechanics based shear deformable laminated composite shell element proposed by Yamashita, et al. was integrated into the flexible body dynamics simulation framework of Chrono. This element was based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation and is defined by the global position coordinates and the transverse gradient coordinates of its four nodes. Element lockings are eliminated with the incorporation of the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) and assumed natural strain approaches (ANS). The element formulation includes an extension to model laminated composite materials. Additionally, a locking-free 9 -node brick element was integrated into the Chrono framework that makes use of the curvature coordinates at the center of the element. This element is formulated with the Hencky strain measure such that multiplicative finite strain plasticity theory can be used to incorporate soil plasticity models, such as the capped Drucker-Prager failed criterion. With the shear deformable laminated composite shell element and plastic soil brick element integrated into the Chrono multi-physics simulation engine, an off-road deformable tire and terrain interaction model was developed using the vehicle dynamics simulation module Chrono::Vehicle. An off-road deformable tire model was parameterized based on commercial tire properties and generated as an interchangeable tire model option in the full vehicle dynamics system. Benchmark verification tests were performed to ensure the accuracy of tire deformation and tire force characteristics. Further tests were performed to validate a deformable tire model with a deformable tread pattern constructed from shear deformable shell elements and co-rotational tetrahedral elements. The deformable soil model was also integrated as a terrain option in Chrono::Vehicle and numerical tests were carried out to demonstrate its interaction with rigid and deformable tire models. To make use of the computational performance enhancements available in Chrono, Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) and Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) were applied to the evaluation of the elastic force/Jacobian matrix and large matrix operations of flexible bodies, respectively, in order to reduce the computation time by nearly 60 %...|$|R
