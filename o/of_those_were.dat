5|$|About 20 {{armoured}} vehicles, including tanks, {{were destroyed}} in the fighting. Before the conflict, Georgia possessed 230–240 tanks in total. At {{the time of the}} conflict, Georgia operated 191 T-72 tanks, of which 75 were deployed into South Ossetia. Georgia lost at least 10 T-72 tanks destroyed in and near Tskhinvali. After the end of hostilities, the Russian military seized a total of 65 Georgian tanks. 20 <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> destroyed.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} {{conclusive}} {{evidence that the}} Balts were uniting {{is considered to be}} the treaty with Galicia–Volhynia signed in 1219. The treaty's signatories include 21 Lithuanian dukes; it specifies that five <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> elder and thus took precedence over the remaining sixteen. Presumably, the eldest Duke was Živinbudas, since his name was mentioned first. Mindaugas, despite his youth, and his brother Dausprungas, are listed among the elder dukes. That would imply that they inherited their titles. The remaining two elder dukes were Daujotas (mentioned second) and his brother Vilikaila (mentioned last of the five).|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Governor J. C. W. Beckham {{ascended to}} the office of governor, and he and Taylor waged a {{protracted}} court battle over the governorship.

Five went to trial; two <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> acquitted. Each of the remaining three were convicted in trials fraught with irregularities and were eventually pardoned by subsequent governors. The identity of Goebel's assassin remains a mystery.|$|E

By 1 June 1944, the Navy had transferred all its aircraft to the PVO, which reported only 17 on its own strength, and all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> gone by 1 January 1945.

5|$|Cardiff City had {{previously}} reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup twice, {{and two years}} earlier in 1925, they were defeated finalists. The 1927 final was the first for Arsenal, so as a result whoever won the match would take the trophy for the first time. Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman {{held a press conference}} prior to the final on 21 April, where he announced that Horace Cope was injured and would be unable to play at left back. He doubted whether Syd Hoar or Alf Baker would be available as both <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> still recovering, and so he was leaving the selections for both the right half and outside left positions open should they become fit before the game. He saw Bill Seddon and Sam Haden as the alternatives should his first choice players not recover. When asked about who would win the game, he promised the press an answer after the match. In the end, both Baker and Hoar were named to the Arsenal team. The Arsenal team trained in Highbury on their own pitch prior to the final.|$|E

5|$|He made 11appearances for Brentford at {{the start}} of the 2006–07 season, but on 10 October 2006, Rhodes signed for League Two side Swindon Town on a month's loan deal. He made his debut for Swindon against Grimsby Town, when he had a goal disallowed. Rhodes played just four games for Swindon all as {{substitute}} without scoring before returning to Brentford, before being immediately placed on the transfer list by Brentford manager Scott Fitzgerald. Rhodes played another three games for Brentford and had a trial with Yeovil Town in January 2007 but stayed with Brentford. In March 2007, he was loaned out again, to Conference side Grays Athletic for seven weeks. He played 12league games and twice in the FA Trophy during his spell at Grays, scoring once in each competition, before he returned to Brentford in time to play in their final game of the season. Rhodes was offered a new contract by new Brentford manager Terry Butcher but turned it down and left the club on 25 June 2007. He played 65games in all competitions for Brentford, but two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> as substitute, scoring just six goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{an initial}} attempt {{to settle the}} area, the {{government}} declared the land open for pastoral settlement by ordinary settlers, but little progress was made. By 1840, the population was just fifty-three, and most <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> in or near Bunbury (then known as Port Leschenault). The settlement of Australind by the Western Australian Land Company in 1840–41 prompted the first real need for a good quality road to Perth. Throughout much of 1842, there was much debate and discussion over providing a new route to Bunbury. A coastal route from Fremantle had been proposed, while an alternative proposal published on 11 May was a new route from Pinjarra to Bunbury, via an upstream crossing of the Harvey River, where a bridge could easily be built. The coastal route would have required a ferry to cross the Murray River's estuary, and would not go through Pinjarra, a significant settlement in the area; however, it would be shorter, had more water along the route, and would go through the village of Mandurah, which had a population of twenty-nine people from six families.|$|E

The last two sejms of the Commonwealth were the irregular four-year Great Sejm (1788–92), which passed the Constitution of the 3 May, and the infamous Grodno Sejm (1793) where deputies, bribed or coerced by the Russian Empire following the Commonwealth defeat in the War in Defense of the Constitution, annulled the short-lived Constitution and passed the act of Second Partition of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Like most European nations the Scots in {{this period}} began to covert from the bow to {{gunpowder}} firearms. Handguns were present in Scottish armies in small numbers from the fifteenth century and there are increasingly frequent references to handguns and arquebus in records. An account of the Scottish vanguard at Haddon Rig in 1542 suggests that half the troops were missile men and half <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> arquebusiers. Equal proportions of missile to melee troops {{seems to have been}} an aim of Scottish commanders for most of the century, although it was not always possible in the field. The main source of firearms were the French, who seem to have extensively rearmed the Scottish after the English invasions of the Rough Wooing.|$|E

Five players have gone on to become NBA champions for a total of nine times and eight players have become NBA All-Stars a total of 18 times. Rudy Tomjanovich coached both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals Champions.

The largest <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> Kraków (Cracow), Poznań, Lwów (Lviv), and Warszawa (Warsaw), and outside of the Crown, Breslau (Wrocław).
