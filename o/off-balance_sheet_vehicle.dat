40|$|How did {{problems}} with subprime mortgages {{result in a}} systemic crisis, a panic? The ongoing Panic of 2007 {{is due to a}} loss of information about the location and size of risks of loss due to default on a number of interlinked securities, special purpose vehicles, and derivatives, all related to subprime mortgages. Subprime mortgages are a financial innovation designed to provide home ownership opportunities to riskier borrowers. Addressing their risk required a particular design feature, linked to house price appreciation. Subprime mortgages were then financed via securitization, which in turn has a unique design reflecting the subprime mortgage design. Subprime securitization tranches were often sold to CDOs, which were, in turn, often purchased by market value <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Additional subprime risk was created (though not on net) with derivatives. When the housing price bubble burst, this chain of securities, derivatives, and <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>vehicles</b> could not be penetrated by most investors to determine the location and size of the risks. The introduction of the ABX indices, synthetics related to portfolios of subprime bonds, in 2006 created common knowledge about the effects of these risks by providing centralized prices and a mechanism for shorting. I describe the relevant securities, derivatives, and vehicles and provide some very simple, stylized, examples to show: (1) how asymmetric information between the sell-side and the buy-side was created via complexity; (2) how the chain of interlinked securities was sensitive to house prices; (3) how the risk was spread in an opaque way; and (4) how the ABX indices allowed information to be aggregated and revealed. I argue that these details {{are at the heart of}} the answer to the question of the origin of the Panic of 2007. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{catalyst}} of {{the current}} financial turmoil has been the losses on the subprime mortgage market. However, the low quality of these partly collateralised housing loans was known {{for a while and}} the default on subprime mortgages largely expected. Therefore, how to account for the fact that an expected shock on a small segment of the US mortgage market turned into a major financial crisis, causing the near-collapse of the Commercial Paper and of the interbank lending markets, that is to say of two of the most liquid financial markets? Banks have transferred risks to special entities, the so-called “conduits”, SIV (Special Investment Vehicles) and SPV (Special Purpose Vehicles). Such a practice gave the false impression that credit risk was transferred from banks outside the financial system. This was indeed not the case. The funding needs associated in particular with backup lines of credit for <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>vehicles</b> generated pressures on the the interbank markets and led central banks to massively intervene. The roots {{of the current}} turmoil are therefore of a deeper and structural nature. For that reason, it is necessary to assess, from a longer term perspective, what are the main consequences of the recent structural changes on financial markets {{in order to have a}} good grasp on the current financial market dynamics and clarify what is meant nowadays by liquidity. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in banking and corporate finance. The first essay examines how changes {{in the composition of}} the human capital of the workforce impact the CEO. Over the last fifty years, technological change has caused the tasks workers perform to shift from routine to nonroutine work. As a result, the role of the CEO has evolved to become more focused on developing the human capital within the firm. I estimate that these changes {{in the role of the}} CEO caused CEO pay to double over the last thirty years, explaining roughly one-third of the aggregate increase in CEO pay. The second essay, co-authored with Carlos Arteta, Mark Carey, and Ricardo Correa, empirically examines financial institutions' motivations to take systematic bad-tail risk in the form of sponsorship of credit-arbitrage asset-backed commercial paper vehicles. A run on debt issued by such vehicles played a key role in the crisis that began in the summer of 2007. We find evidence consistent with important roles for both owner-manager agency problems and government-induced distortions, especially government control or ownership of banks. The final essay explores the impact of capital regulation on bank risk taking. I utilize a triple difference specification to identify the effect of FIN 46 [...] which increased regulatory capital requirements for U. S. banks sponsoring <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>vehicles</b> [...] on systematic risk exposure. I find that after the regulation, banks' exposure to vehicles with high systematic risk increases relative to vehicles with low risk and relative to non-U. S. banks which are not affected by the regulation. These results suggest that capital regulation has the perverse effect of concentrating systematic risk, potentially increasing the systemic risk of the financial system...|$|R

40|$|While leases {{are widely}} used to finance {{productive}} assets in the U. S, lease accounting has been sharply criticized for providing incomplete and unreliable information to investors because many leases are arranged <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> as operating leases. As such, a higher cost of equity capital may be required by investors to compensate for unrecorded liabilities and imperfect information. In this dissertation, I provide the empirical evidence as to how equity market participants perceive the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ^ First, I investigate the firm characteristics that determine the choice on operating versus capital leases. By summarizing the results from prior literature, I identify the determinants from three areas: operating risks, financial constraints and tax-driven incentives. The results suggest that both economic and opportunistic reasons drive a firm 2 ̆ 7 s lease choice. Specifically, fast-growing, financially constrained, or low-tax firms opt for <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases. ^ Second, I {{examine the impact of}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases on the cost of equity, and whether it would be different from that of capital leases or conventional debt. The results suggest that <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases are “value relevant” as indicated by an increased cost of equity capital being associated with greater use of operating leases. However, investors also seem to suffer from the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> position of disclosed operating leases. The leverage effect of operating leases is largely attenuated relative to capital leases and conventional debt. ^ Third, I explore the role of information intermediaries in compensation for the deficiency in accounting for leases. The results indicate that the cost of equity, with respect to the use of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases, diminishes in greater analyst followings and the existence of credit ratings. Specifically, the diminishing effect of 2 ̆ 7 financial analysts is more pronounced on <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases than that on capital leases and conventional debt. Lastly, whether a firm is audited by a big 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 firm appears to have no effect on either off- or on-balance sheet leases. ^ This study contributes to the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s lease accounting project and helps investors assess the risk of firms with <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ...|$|R

These losses resulted in the failure, acquisition or bailout of some of the largest financial institutions and a near meltdown of the world’s financial and economic systems.

The study describes the particular mechanism of structuring mortgage into mortgage credit derivatives as well as <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> financing of the mortgage credit derivatives is examined. Mortgage derivatives, such as an asset-backed security (ABS) and more complex collateralized debt obligation (CDO) structures among others {{are a part of}} the structured finance and have particular features. High-risk mortgage loans are attractive assets as a part of these derivatives since the loans offer better yields than prime class mortgage. On the other hand, the risks are bigger and the risks remain through structuring and off-balance financing. The mechanism of structuring mortgage credit derivatives is described. Structuring involves many market participants and financial intermediaries. Underlying assets of these credit derivatives are certain mortgage loans. Many benefits are evolved including new sources of external finance, credit risk transfer, improved liquidity, increased trading volume, better profits and a chance to straighten the financial supply chain. The benefits of structuring mortgage credit derivatives appear similar to common benefits of structured finance and securitization. Risks and disadvantages occur as well as the mechanism of structuring mortgage credit derivatives is sub-ject to risks or disadvantages. The major risks or disadvantages are the lack of control, asymmetric information, the lack of transparency and disadvantages of credit risk transfer. <b>Off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance or financial activities outside of the balance sheet is understudied area although it has a salient role in mortgage derivatives banking. <b>Off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance creates plenty of benefits that are a new source of external finance, improved profitability, new tools to attain new lines of business in the banking industry and a possibility to leverage. However, <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance is also a subject to increased risk in banking as it increases both risk of deposit, liquidity risk as well as risk of losses, it creates a possibility to leverage and <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance also increases financial risk. In addition, the significance of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance is undisputable in the field of modern investment banking.

In particular, this work aims to examine whether and how the increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> credit exposure to credit derivatives, mainly due to loan securitisation, may have affected the growth rate of loans over the past few years, also by distinguishing different categories of loans. For this purpose, we present the results of a panel fixed-effect estimation and of a panel VAR analysis, using quarterly data from the balance sheets of 39 US commercial banks and for a period between 1998 and 2008. The results show that a rise in off-balance credit exposure may have – after some time lags - a negative impact on the growth rate of bank lending, due to the potential and actual losses related to the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> activities. However, the effects on the single categories of loans depend on their maturity: the negative effect due to an increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> exposure is stronger for long-term loans, like mortgages or real estate loans, while some positive impact on bank lending may arise for short-term loans, such as commercial and industrial loans, because of the liquidity/maturity transformation function associated with securitisation activities.
