5|$|TNA held a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match pitting {{the team}} of Alex Shelley, Christopher Daniels, Roderick Strong, and Samoa Joe against the team <b>of</b> <b>Austin</b> Aries, Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, and Sonjay Dutt. Matt Bentley was {{accompanied}} by Traci to the ring. The duration of this bout was 23 minutes and 15 seconds. Daniels took over the leadership role of his team, naming them Team Ministry. In this match, each person from each team had to be eliminated by pinfall or submission until all members of one team were gone. The wrestler(s) that remained won the bout for their team. Strong was the first eliminated after being pinned by Aries following a 450° aerial splash. Aries was eliminated soon-after by Daniels, who pinned him with a roll-up while he was distracted by Joe. The third elimination was Dutt, who submitted to Shelley's signature Border City Stretch submission hold. Not long after, Shelley was pinned by Bentley after being kicked in the face. Joe forced Bentley to submit with his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold, bringing the match down to Daniels and Joe versus Sabin. Daniels won the bout for his team by pinning Sabin after slamming Sabin face-first into the mat with his signature Angel's Wings maneuver. An argument ensued between Daniels and Joe after the contest, with Joe angry in the storyline that Daniels eliminated Sabin {{when he wanted to}} instead. This led to Joe attacking Daniels and bashing him over the head with a steal chair. Joe followed up by slamming Daniels into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then a second time on a steal chair. This left Daniels bloodied {{in the center of the}} ring with TNA's medical crew tending to his injuries.|$|E

After the contest, Joe assaulted Daniels, performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on him twice, the second time on a steel chair. Daniels suffered an injury in the storyline due to the attack, sidelining him until December11 at TNA's Turning Point PPV event. At that event, Daniels saved Styles from an assault by Joe following Joe's victory over Styles to win the TNA X Division Championship. Daniels then challenged Joe for the championship at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January15, 2006, but Joe retained the title. At TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February12, 2006, Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in another Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title.

5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Heterodontosaurus tucki (SAM-PK-K337) was discovered during the British-South African expedition to South Africa and Basutoland (former name of Lesotho) in 1961-1962. Today, it {{is housed in}} the Iziko South African Museum. It was excavated on a mountain {{at an altitude of}} about , at a locality called Tyinindini, in the district of Transkei (sometimes referred to as Herschel) in the Cape Province of South Africa. The specimen consists of a crushed but nearly complete skull; associated postcranial remains mentioned in the original description could not be located in 2011. The animal was scientifically described and named in 1962 by palaeontologists Alfred Walter Crompton from South Africa and Alan J. Charig from the United Kingdom. The genus name refers to the different-shaped teeth, and the specific name honors George C. Tuck, a director <b>of</b> <b>Austin</b> Motor Company, who supported the expedition. The specimen was not fully prepared by the time of publication, so only the front parts of the skull and lower jaw were described, and the authors conceded that their description was preliminary, serving mainly to name the animal. It was considered an important discovery, as few early ornithischians were known at the time. The preparation of the specimen, i.e. the freeing of the bones from the rock matrix, was very time consuming, since they were covered in a thin, very hard, ferruginous layer containing haematite. This could only be removed by a diamond saw, which damaged the specimen.|$|E
