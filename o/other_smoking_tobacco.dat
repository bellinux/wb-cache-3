50|$|The {{main cause}} of DH is gingival {{recession}} (receding gums) with exposure of root surfaces, loss of the cementum layer and smear layer, and tooth wear. Receding gums can {{be a sign of}} long-term trauma from excessive or forceful toothbrushing, or brushing with an abrasive toothpaste (dental abrasion), or a sign of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Other less common causes are acid erosion (e.g. related to gastroesophageal reflux disease, bulimia or excessive consumption of acidic foods and drinks), and periodontal root planing. Dental bleaching is another known cause of hypersensitivity. <b>Other</b> causes include <b>smoking</b> <b>tobacco,</b> which can wear down enamel and gum tissue, cracked teeth or grinding of teeth (bruxism).|$|R

(1) in their assessment of available information on nearly 600 flavorant, casing material, and humectant ingredients variously used as cigarette tobacco additives in the U. S. Tobacco Industry. Addition of casing materials and humectants to the cigarette tobacco blend produced no significant increase in the cigarette MSS of either the total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) or the benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) content, MSS components that have been of considerable interest for many years. Examination of the transfer of humectants from the humectant-treated tobacco to cigarette MSS indicates that the humectants act as significant diluents to the remaining MSS particulate-phase components generated from the <b>tobacco</b> during the <b>smoking</b> process. This dilution decreases the effects observed in several bioassays, e. g., mutagenicity determined in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium test...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{cigarette}} smoking is an established {{risk factor for}} oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), there is little information about the association between <b>other</b> <b>smoking</b> and smokeless <b>tobacco</b> products, including hookah and nass, and ESCC risk. We conducted a case–control study in Kashmir Valley, India, where hookah smoking, nass chewing, and ESCC are common, to investigate the association of hookah smoking, nass use, and several other habits with ESCC. METHODS: We recruited 702 histologically confirmed ESCC cases and 1663 hospital-based controls, individually matched to the cases for age, sex, and district of residence from September 2008 to January 2012. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). RESULTS: Ever-hookah smoking (OR 1. 85; 95 % CI, 1. 41 – 2. 44) and nass chewing (OR 2. 88; 95 % CI, 2. 06 – 4. 04) were associated with ESCC risk. These associations were consistent across different measures of use, including intensity, duration, and cumulative amount of use, and after excluding ever users of the other product and cigarette smokers. Our results also suggest {{an increased risk of}} ESCC associated with ever-gutka chewing and-bidi smoking. However, the latter associations were based on small number of participants...|$|R

500|$|The bong is {{typically}} used for smoking cannabis and {{is generally not}} recommended for <b>smoking</b> <b>tobacco</b> or <b>other</b> herbal substances.

Because the gravity bong does not use water to filter the cannabis, it is different than water pipes and water bongs. Vaporizers do not produce smoke, but the inhalation process is similar. A joint can contain from 0.4g to well over 1g and blunts can contain up to 3g of cannabis, while the bucket bong only uses about 0.1g to 0.3g.|$|R

In a house to house survey of oral cancer and precancerous conditions, comprising 10, 169 villagers, 43 · 8 % were reverse smokers; the female: male ratio being 1 · 7 : 1. Ten previously undiagnosed cases of oral cancer, 9 located to palate, were found. The prevalences for leukoplakia, preleukoplakia and leukokeratosis nicotina palati were 4 · 9 %, 2 · 9 % and 9 · 5 %.
