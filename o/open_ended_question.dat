However, some literary critics believe that {{the poem is}}, in fact, complete due to the overall symbolism within the poem. Scholars argued that the fragment is a symbol for the eagle due to the eagle [...] "breaking away" [...] from the mountain. They say that the fragment is vital to understanding the poem {{in the way that}} the mountain depicted is in fact the whole poem and the eagle, being a part of the mountains identity, is a loss when the eagle falls. The uncertainty of the poem being complete or incomplete reinforces the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>question</b> of what happens to the eagle at the end of the poem.|$|E
5000|$|Stellar {{chemistry}} {{is the study}} of the chemical composition of astronomical objects; stars in particular, hence the name stellar chemistry. The significance of stellar chemical composition is an <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>question</b> at this point. Some research asserts that a greater abundance of certain elements (such as carbon, sodium, silicon, and magnesium) in the stellar mass are necessary for a star's inner solar system to be habitable over long periods of time. [...] The hypothesis being that the [...] "abundance of these elements make the star cooler and cause it to evolve more slowly, thereby giving planets in its habitable zone more time to develop life as we know it." [...] Stellar abundance of oxygen also appears to be critical to the length of time newly developed planets exist in a habitable zone around their host star. [...] Researchers postulate that if our own sun had a lower abundance of oxygen, the Earth would have ceased to [...] "live" [...] in a habitable zone a billion years ago, long before complex organisms had the opportunity to evolve.|$|E

Two IBGE surveys (the 1976 PNAD and the July 1998 PME) have sought to {{understand}} the way Brazilians think of themselves in [...] "racial" [...] terms, with the explicit aim of adjusting the census classification (neither, however, resulted in actual changes in the census). Besides that, Data Folha has also conducted research on this subject. The results of these surveys are somewhat varied, but seem to coincide in some fundamental aspects.

The 1976 PNAD found 136 different answers to the question about race; the July 1998 PME found 143. However, most of these terms are used by very small minorities. Telles remarks that 95% of the population chose only six different terms (branco, moreno, pardo, moreno-claro, preto and negro); Petrucelli shows that the 7 most common responses (the above plus amarela) sum up 97%, and the 10 more common (the previous plus mulata, clara, and morena-escura) make 99%.> ...|$|E
