5|$|In the mid-1920s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) {{reached its}} peak {{membership}} in the South and Midwest after a revival beginning around 1915. Its growth was {{due in part to}} tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities; in the Midwest and West, its growth was related to the competition of waves <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> from Southern and Eastern Europe. The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tampa; Miami's chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club. The Klan also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the Reconstruction era. An editor of The Gainesville Daily Sun admitted that {{he was a member of}} the Klan in 1922, and praised the organization in print.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2006 census, the country's largest {{self-reported}} {{ethnic origin}} is Canadian (accounting for 32% of the population), followed by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German (10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), First Nations (4.0%), Ukrainian (3.9%), and Dutch (3.3%). There are 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands, encompassing {{a total of}} 1,172,790 people. Canada's indigenous population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed an indigenous identity in 2006. Another 16.2 {{percent of the population}} belonged to a non-indigenous visible minority. In 2006, the largest visible minority groups were South Asian (4.0%), Chinese (3.9%) and Black (2.5%). Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population rose by 27.2 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups. By 2007, almost one in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> coming from Asia (including the Middle East). The leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and India. According to Statistics Canada, visible minority groups could account for a third of the Canadian population by 2031.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Drawing upon {{a sample}} <b>of</b> 296 <b>new</b> <b>immigrant</b> women in Hong Kong, this study {{investigated}} how social service utilization, family functioning, and sense of community influenced the depressive symptoms <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrant</b> women. Results <b>of</b> the structural equation modeling suggested that family functioning and sense of community were both significantly and negatively associated with the depression <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrant</b> women. Utilization <b>of</b> community services also influenced the depression of immigrant women indirectly through the mediating effect of sense of community. Implications of the research findings for mental health intervention were discussed...|$|R

5|$|As the 1948 Arab-Israeli War commenced, the neighbourhood's {{location}} between Israeli and Jordanian forces made it {{a combat}} zone, leading to the flight of both Jewish and Arab residents. On May 22, 1948 the US Consul, Thomas C. Wasson, was assassinated shortly after leaving the French Consulate in the Mamilla district. After {{the signing of the}} 1949 Armistice Agreements and division of Jerusalem, the western three-quarters of Mamilla were held by Israel and the eastern quarter became a no man's land of barbed-wire and concrete barricades between Israeli and Jordanian lines. The active and hostile border subjected Mamilla to Jordanian sniper and guerilla attacks, and even stones thrown by Arab Legionnaires from the Old City walls above. The neighbourhood was one of several border areas in the city to experience a sharp decline, and subsequently became home to families <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> with many children and of weak financial abilities, as well as dirty light industry like auto repair. In Mamilla in this period, the residents were primarily Kurdish immigrants and their Israeli children.|$|E
5|$|In metapopulation terminology, {{migrating}} {{individuals are}} classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A {{site is a}} generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants.</b> A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.|$|E

50|$|The {{breakup of}} many of the close and {{extended}} families after being brought to the various integration centers in Israel, as well as the initial integration with the Israeli society was very difficult for many <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> <b>immigrants.</b> Name changing also caused a symbolic break with the new immigrants' past. The Israeli authorities originally gave many <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> Hebrew given names, Hebrew names, and required them all to have family names, which did not exist in the Ethiopian society. These name changes created a two tier system, in which old and new names were used by the <b>new</b> <b>immigrants.</b> the immersion with the Hebrew language was not easy for the <b>new</b> <b>immigrants,</b> and the majority <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> never managed to master the language, even after living many years in Israel, resulting in a strong social marginalization. Finally, the questioning of their traditional religious practices by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel led to great confusion amongst the <b>new</b> <b>immigrants.</b>|$|R

25|$|The city {{continued}} {{to develop in}} the following years as many Jewish immigrants settled in Netanya. The population reached 31,000 in 1955. To accommodate the large number <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants,</b> the Israeli Housing Ministry built large numbers of housing units with dwelling spaces of about 50 square meters. The cornerstone of the Kiryat Sanz neighborhood, which was to house religious residents, was laid in 1956. The first stock exchange built in Israel was built in Netanya.

25|$|As timber {{is a very}} bulky cargo, it {{required}} many ships to carry it from North America to Britain, {{but there was little}} demand for carrying goods on the return voyages. However, there was a market for carrying migrants, so many of the timber ships turned to the migrant trade to fill their unused capacity. Since timber exports tended to peak {{at the same time as}} conflicts in Europe, a great mass of refugees sought cheap passage across the Atlantic.

25|$|A {{consequence}} of this, {{in addition to}} assumptions that Taylor was colluding with the criminal underworld, was the maintenance of red light districts in racialized neighbourhoods, such as Chinatown, Japantown, and Hogan's Alley, which perpetuated the association of non-whites with immorality and vice crime. Taylor suffered the biggest electoral defeat the city had seen in 1934, largely on this issue. McGeer ran on a law and order platform, resulting in a crackdown on vice crimes, which, after years of Taylor’s “open town,” sought to clean up crime. Unfortunately, policing non-white communities was key to successfully executing the plan. Even the East End (today’s Strathcona) had by WWI been largely vacated by English, Scottish, and Irish residents {{who moved to the}} wealthier (and whiter) new developments of the West End and Shaughnessy. The East End, the original residential district that grew up around Hasting’s Mill, was left to successive waves <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>immigrants,</b> and became associated with poverty and vice, (as the Downtown Eastside remains today).|$|E
