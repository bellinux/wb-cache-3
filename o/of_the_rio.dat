5|$|In 1837 France began a {{blockade}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> de la Plata against Rosas. San Martín offered his military services to Rosas, which was declined because of San Martín's advanced age, and condemned {{the role of}} the unitarians in that conflict, as they had allied themselves with France against their own nation. San Martín bequeathed his curved saber to Rosas, because of his successful defense of the country. The conflict between France and Argentina renewed in the Anglo-French blockade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata, which San Martín condemned as well. During this time he met Florencio Varela and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.|$|E
5|$|After Lee's surrender, {{a public}} meeting {{was held in}} Shreveport, Louisiana, at which many {{speakers}} supported continuation of the war.

5|$|Both the British and Spanish {{settlements}} coexisted in {{the archipelago}} until 1774, when Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily {{withdraw from the}} islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III. Spain's Viceroyalty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata became the only governmental presence in the territory. West Falkland was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp. Amid the British invasions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except for gauchos and fishermen who remained voluntarily.|$|E

5|$|The {{breakup of}} the old Viceroyalty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata during the 1810s {{eventually}} resulted {{in the emergence of}} independent nations of Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay in the northern portion of the Viceroyalty, while its southern territories coalesced into the United Provinces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata. Rosas planned to restore, if not all, at least a considerable part of the former borders of the old Viceroyalty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata. He never recognized the independence of Paraguay and regarded it a rebel Argentine province that would inevitably be reconquered. He sent an army under Manuel Oribe who invaded Uruguay and conquered most of the country, except for its capital Montevideo that endured a long siege starting in 1843. When pressed by the British, Rosas declined to guarantee Uruguayan independence. In South America, all potential foreign threats to Rosas's plans of conquest collapsed, including Gran Colombia and the Peru–Bolivian Confederation, or were troubled by internal turmoil, as was the Empire of Brazil. To reinforce his claims over Uruguay and Paraguay, and maintain his dominance over the Argentine provinces, Rosas blockaded the port of Montevideo and closed the interior rivers to foreign trade.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Hypostomus johnii (Steindachner) was {{described}} from <b>the</b> <b>rio</b> Parnaíba basin in <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Piauí and <b>the</b> <b>rio</b> São Francisco basin in <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Bahia. Despite <b>the</b> good quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original description <b>of</b> H. johnii, {{it does not}} currently allow its distinction from congeners. Thus, H. johnii is redescribed based on <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> types and several recently collected specimens. Recent collecting efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rios</b> Parnaíba and São Francisco basins resulted in specimens only being found in <b>the</b> <b>rio</b> Parnaíba basin. This raises doubts about whether H. johnii occurs in <b>the</b> <b>rio</b> São Francisco basin. The species is distinguished from its congeners by having a high number <b>of</b> teeth on <b>the</b> premaxilla and dentary (between 60 - 115); small to moderate-sized dark spots with a light background; absence of keels on flanks; and abdominal plates more evident on laterals. A lectotype of H. johnii is designated herein and H. eptingi is considered a junior synonym of H. johnii...|$|R
5|$|After the British invasions {{had been}} repelled, Rosas {{and his family}} moved from Buenos Aires to their estancia (ranch). His work there further shaped his {{character}} and outlook {{as part of the}} Platine region's social establishment. In the Viceroyalty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata, owners of large landholdings (including the Rosas family) provided food, equipment and protection for families living in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Most of these peons, as such workers were called, were gauchos.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} clear that there was to be no {{reversal}} of Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized Chile, the United Provinces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata, Peru, Gran Colombia, and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and Río de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires {{and other}} nearby cities faced the British invasions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata in 1806 and 1807. In {{the absence of}} {{reinforcements}} from Spain, viceroy Santiago de Liniers arranged that everyone in Buenos Aires capable of bearing arms should join the resistance against the second invasion. Larrea established the Legion of Catalan Volunteers with Jaime Nadal y Guarda, Jaime Lavallol and José Olaguer Reynals. Larrea was appointed captain of this military unit. The defense was successful, and the British were driven away from the viceroyalty.|$|E

5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Lima was {{adversely}} affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and the important mining region of Upper Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata. This economic decline made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa.|$|E

The formation is composed of coarse and medium-grained sandstones deposited in a fluvial environment (associated with rivers and streams), and in aeolian conditions (effected by wind). Paleosols (buried soil), siltstones, and claystones are present, some of which represent swamp conditions.|$|E
