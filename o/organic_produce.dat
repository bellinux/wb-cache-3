40|$|Considering {{the risks}} {{associated}} with food consumption, several risk reduction strategies are used by consumers, all linked to brand loyalty, store image or label references that build trust in the product. A food product can be labeled organic if it complies with the principles for organic production, processing, labeling and control. Previous researchers have identified that organic certification logo have significant impact on consumption of organic products in urban markets. Organic logo increases trustworthiness of urban consumers about <b>organic</b> <b>produces.</b> Previous studies further observed that high price has deep connotation with trustworthiness about <b>organic</b> <b>produces</b> and urban buyers have ability to pay high price. The urban buyers though they have ability to pay high price for <b>organic</b> <b>produces,</b> they do not get them from trustworthy sources due to lack of believable information about <b>organic</b> <b>produces.</b> The urban <b>organic</b> consumers mostly come from affluent part of the society who have access to technology and have access to smartphone for available information about sources of <b>organic</b> <b>produces.</b> Quick response code (QR code) is a type of 2 D bar code that is used to provide easy access to information using free application with smartphone or QR scanner. The information (authentication code, grower code, name, location, contact number, Facebook URL, production date, expiry date and regulatory authority URL) about authentic organic growers can be embedded on QR code that can track easily at no cost. This paper addresses the model of adopting QR code based labeling mechanism for <b>organic</b> <b>produces</b> that dramatically will improve trustworthiness among organic consumers. This authentication process will eliminate fake organic growers also. The QR code based mechanism may increase brand loyalty, store image and {{can be used as a}} tool to replace the traditional organic labeling for urban markets...|$|R

Before the {{construction}} of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the South Lawn, which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the North Lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger greenhouses were built {{on the west side of}} the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. of the Olmsted Brothers firm, commissioned by [...] President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the White House Rose Garden was redesigned by Rachel Lambert Mellon. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which was begun by Jacqueline Kennedy but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old American Elm (Ulmus americana L.) tree on the north side of the building, came down during one of the many storms amid intense flooding.
