25|$|Corisco (Cristino Gomes da Silva Cleto) - {{feared for}} his cruelty. There was {{speculation}} {{that he would}} take control of the band after Angicos, where he had not been present. Seeking vengeance for Angicos, Corisco interrogated Joca Bernardes the informant who had betrayed Lampião, who shifted the blame <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> Domingos Ventura. Corisco then murdered this entirely innocent person and his whole family, including two women. He was killed by police in 1940.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slant Magazine, Kyle Fowle spoke favorably of {{the track}} and opined that it [...] "pulses and swirls like sweaty bodies on the dance floor." [...] However, in a more mixed review, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{acknowledged}} that its production [...] "zig-zags impressively", while also suggesting that its chorus failed to leave the impact that the refrain for [...] "Wrecking Ball" [...] did. Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised {{the production of the}} song, writing, [...] "Mike WiLL steps outside of his 'thunderous' signature all over Bangerz; <b>on</b> <b>Someone</b> <b>Else</b> and Drive, he approaches EDM on his own pop-rap terms, asking Cyrus' 'Jolene' twang and jackhammer buzz to serve his complex arrangements, rather than dropping some 808s on top of a dustep drop. 'Drive', which I favor, has no grandiose drop, just a stubborn pulse that gives the song its appealing undercurrent of ugly, tightly coiled strength." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club, a film {{adaptation}} of Chuck Palahniuk's {{novel of the}} same name, directed by David Fincher. Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling. To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended. While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> but to [...] "have an experience, take a punch more and see how you {{come out on the}} other end." [...] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival. Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film, while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be [...] "cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than... his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise". In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E
2500|$|His healing feats include {{getting rid}} of warts by wishing them <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> [...] "Someone who's already ugly with boil marks, I can fill up with warts."

He is claimed to have cured a woman of cancer by sitting with her in a hospital for three days and nights, while holding her feet and pouring healing energy into her.|$|E

2500|$|In affidavits, Fletcher {{wrote that}} she has almost no memory of her {{childhood}} up {{until the age of}} 14. [...] She explained that her writing started out just for her and was cathartic because she had been sexually abused as a child. “At first I would capture a particular feeling of dread and try to weave it into a scenario that explained the feeling", she wrote. [...] Fletcher described what she called her [...] "monsters":"I have always been afraid of monsters. The monsters in my life had always been real; for too long they were always there with unlimited access to me, and I was helpless to do anything about it. In my stories, I have created new monsters. [...] rise above the horror of the real life monsters. Somehow, making these monsters so much worse makes me feel better, and makes my life seem more bearable.

2500|$|In {{the second}} book, Rowling {{establishes}} that Voldemort hates non-pure-blood wizards, despite being a half-blood himself. In a 2000 {{interview with the}} BBC, Rowling described Voldemort as a self-hating bully: [...] "Well I think it {{is often the case}} that the biggest bullies take what they know to be their own defects, as they see it, and they put them right <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> and then they try and destroy the other and that's what Voldemort does." [...] In the same year, Rowling became more precise about Voldemort. She began to link him to real-life tyrants, describing him as [...] "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering". In 2004, though, Rowling said that she did not base Voldemort on any real person. In 2006, Rowling told an interviewer that Voldemort at his core has a human fear: the fear of death. She said: [...] "Voldemort's fear is death, ignominious death. I mean, he regards death itself as ignominious. He thinks that it's a shameful human weakness, as you know. His worst fear is death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cardozo was {{confirmed}} by a unanimous voice vote in the Senate on February 24. On a radio broadcast on March 1, 1932, the day of Cardozo's confirmation, Clarence C. Dill, Democratic Senator for Washington, called Hoover's appointment of Cardozo [...] "the finest act of his career as President". The entire faculty of the University of Chicago Law School had urged Hoover to nominate him, as did the deans of the law schools at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia. Justice Harlan Fiske Stone strongly urged Hoover to name Cardozo, even offering to resign {{to make room for}} him if Hoover had his heart set <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> (Stone had in fact suggested to Calvin Coolidge that he should nominate Cardozo rather than himself back in 1925). Hoover, however, originally demurred: there were already two justices from New York, and a Jew on the court; in addition, Justice James McReynolds was a notorious anti-Semite. When the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William E. Borah of Idaho, added his strong support for Cardozo, however, Hoover finally bowed to the pressure.|$|E

60|$|A curious heartache and listlessness, a nerveless mood came on him. What was it worth, anyhow-success? Struggle, strife, {{trampling}} <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> His play {{crowding out}} some other poor fellow's hope. The hawk eats the partridge, the partridge eats the flies and bugs, the bugs eat each other, and the hawk, when he in his turn is shot by man. So, {{in the world}} of business, the life of one man seemed to him to be drawn from the life of another man, each success to spring from other failures.|$|E

I wish you to go at once to Scindia's camp, which is now {{on the bank of the}} Godavery, and ascertain how he takes the news. Doubtless Balloba, his prime minister, will be furious at finding that, instead of Bajee becoming a mere creature of Scindia's, I have placed him on the musnud, and retain my place as his chief minister. I can employ you for this business better than most others, for the greater part of my officers are personally known to those of Scindia, while you have scarce been seen by them. I have also a high idea of your shrewdness; and I have no doubt that you will, in some way, be able to gain the information that I require--indeed, it will probably be the public talk of the camp. If you should find an opportunity of entering into negotiations, with any influential person in Scindia's court, I authorize you to do so in my name; and to agree to any reasonable demands that he may make, either for a payment in money or in estates. Scindia's character is wholly unformed and, though today he may be guided by Balloba, tomorrow he may lean <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
