Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice thing about that is we could go both ways on it. Maybe we never see him again <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> see him again and by the way he's full of Zero Matter now. The last thing you saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted. But it's still in him. Either way, we wanted to keep our options open." ...|$|E

Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> could see her in prison?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes, {{a person}} wishes {{something}} good, but God doesn’t help him — maybe because the intention {{came from the}} devil and is not for our benefit; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because it is beyond our strength as we have not attained the necessary spiritual level; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because it doesn’t correspond to our calling; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because the time is not right to initiate it; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>we</b> don’t have the necessary knowledge or strength to accomplish it; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because circumstances will not contribute to its success. Besides this, the devil contrives in every way to paint it as something good so that having inclined us toward it, he could upset our spiritual tranquility or inflict harm on us. That’s why {{it is necessary for}} us to diligently examine all our good desires. Better still, do everything after seeking counsel." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It {{got to be}} Sunday all the time. Seven Sundays in the week--to us, anyway. We hadn't {{anything}} to do, and time hung heavy. Seven Sundays, {{and all of them}} broken up at one time or another, in the day or in the night, by a few hours of the awful storm of fire and thunder and iron. At first we used to shin for the holes a good deal faster than we did afterwards. The first time, I forgot the children, and Maria fetched them both along. When she was all safe in the cave she fainted. Two or three weeks afterwards, when she was running for the holes, one morning, through a shell-shower, a big shell burst near her, and covered her all over with dirt, and a piece of the iron carried away her game-bag of false hair from the back of her head. Well, she stopped to get that game-bag before she shoved along again! Was getting used to things already, you see. We all got so that we could tell a good deal about shells; and after that we didn't always go under shelter if it was a light shower. Us men would loaf around and talk; and a man would say, 'There she goes!' and name the kind of shell it was from the sound of it, and go on talking--if there wasn't any danger from it. If a shell was bursting close over us, we stopped talking and stood still;--uncomfortable, yes, but it wasn't safe to move. When it let go, we went on talking again, if nobody hurt--maybe saying, 'That was a ripper!' or some such commonplace comment before we resumed; <b>or,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>we</b> would see a shell poising itself away high in the air overhead. In that case, every fellow just whipped out a sudden, 'See you again, gents!' and shoved. Often and often I saw gangs of ladies promenading the streets, looking as cheerful as you please, and keeping an eye canted up watching the shells; and I've seen them stop still when they were uncertain about what a shell was going to do, and wait and make certain; and after that they sa'ntered along again, or lit out for shelter, according to the verdict. Streets in some towns have a litter of pieces of paper, and odds and ends {{of one sort or another}} lying around. Ours hadn't; they had IRON litter. Sometimes a man would gather up all the iron fragments and unbursted shells in his neighborhood, and pile them into a kind of monument in his front yard--a ton of it, sometimes. No glass left; glass couldn't stand such a bombardment; it was all shivered out. Windows of the houses vacant--looked like eye-holes in a skull. WHOLE panes were as scarce as news.|$|E
6000|$|SCENE II.--A Room in SIR TUNBELLY CLUMSY'S House. Enter MISS HOYDEN, NURSE, and TOM FASHION. Fash. This quick {{despatch}} of the chaplain's I take so kindly {{it shall}} give him claim to my favour {{as long as}} I live, I assure you. Miss Hoyd. And to mine too, I promise you. Nurse. I most humbly thank your honours; and may your children swarm about you like bees about a honeycomb! Miss Hoyd. Ecod, with all my heart--the more the merrier, I say--ha, nurse? Enter LORY. Lory. One word with you, for Heaven's sake. [Taking TOM FASHION hastily aside.] Fash. What the devil's the matter? Lory. Sir, your fortune's ruined {{if you are not}} married. Yonder's your brother arrived, with two coaches and six horses, twenty footmen, and a coat worth fourscore pounds--so judge what will become of your lady's heart. Fash. Is he in the house yet? Lory. No, they are capitulating with him at the gate. Sir Tunbelly luckily takes him for an impostor; and I have told him that we have heard of this plot before. Fash. That's right.--[Turning to MISS HOYDEN.] My dear, here's a troublesome business my man tells me of, but don't be frightened; we shall be too hard for the rogue. Here's an impudent fellow at the gate (not knowing I was come hither incognito) has taken my name upon him, in hopes to run away with you. Miss Hoyd. Oh, the brazen-faced varlet! it's well we are married, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> might never have been so. Fash. [Aside.] Egad, like enough.--[Aloud.] Pr'ythee, nurse, run to Sir Tunbelly, and stop him from going to the gate before I speak to him. Nurse. An't please your honour, my lady and I had better, lock ourselves up till the danger be over. Fash. Do so, if you please. Miss Hoyd. Not so fast; I won't be locked up any more, now I'm married. Fash. Yes, pray, my dear, do, till we have seized this rascal. Miss Hoyd. Nay, if you'll pray me, I'll do anything. [Exit with NURSE.] Fash. Hark you, sirrah, things are better than you imagine. The wedding's over. Lory. The devil it is, sir! [Capers about.] Fash. Not a word--all's safe--but Sir Tunbelly don't know it, nor must not yet. So I am resolved to brazen the brunt of the business out, and have the pleasure of turning the impostor upon his lordship, which I believe may easily be done. Enter SIR TUNBELLY CLUMSY. Did you ever hear, sir, of so impudent an undertaking? Sir Tun. Never, by the mass; but we'll tickle him, I'll warrant you. Fash. They tell me, sir, he has a great many people with him, disguised like servants. Sir Tun. Ay, ay, rogues enow, but we have mastered them. We only fired a few shot over their heads, and the regiment scoured in an instant.--Here, Tummus, bring in your prisoner. Fash. If you please, Sir Tunbelly, it will be best for me not to confront this fellow yet, till you have heard how far his impudence will carry him. Sir Tun. Egad, your lordship is an ingenious person. Your lordship, then, will please to step aside. Lory. [Aside.] 'Fore heavens, I applaud my master's modesty! [Exit with TOM FASHION.] Enter SERVANTS, with LORD FOPPINGTON disarmed. Sir Tun. Come, bring him along, bring him along. Lord Fop. What the plague do you mean, gentlemen? is it fair time, that you are all drunk before supper? Sir Tun. Drunk, sirrah! here's an impudent rogue for you now. Drunk or sober, bully, I'm a justice o' the peace, and {{know how to deal with}} strollers. Lord Fop. Strollers! Sir Tun. Ay, strollers. Come, give an account of yourself. What's your name? where do you live? do you pay scot and lot? Come, are you a freeholder or a copyholder? Lord Fop. And why dost thou ask me so many impertinent questions? Sir Tun. Because I'll make you answer 'em, before I have done with you, you rascal, you! Lord Fop. Before Gad, all the answer I can make to them is, that you are a very extraordinary old fellow, stap my vitals. Sir Tun. Nay, if thou art joking deputy-lieutenants, we know how to deal with you.--Here, draw a warrant for him immediately. Lord Fop. A warrant! What the devil is't thou wouldst be at, old gentleman? Sir Tun. I would be at you, sirrah, (if my hands were not tied as a magistrate,) and with these two double fists beat your teeth down your throat, you dog, you! [Driving him.] Lord Fop. And why wouldst thou spoil my face at that rate? Sir Tun. For your design to rob me of my daughter, villain. Lord Fop. Rob thee of thy daughter! Now do I begin to believe I am in bed and asleep, and that all this is but a dream. Pr'ythee, old father, wilt thou give me leave to ask thee one question? Sir Tun. I can't tell whether I will or not, till I know what it is. Lord Fop. Why, then, it is, whether thou didst not write to my Lord Foppington, to come down and marry thy daughter? Sir Tun. Yes, marry, did I, and my Lord Foppington is come down, and shall marry my daughter before she's a day older. Lord Fop. Now give me thy hand, old dad; I thought we should understand one another at last. Sir Tun. The fellow's mad!--Here, bind him hand and foot. [They bind him.] Lord Fop. Nay, pr'ythee, knight, leave fooling; thy jest begins to grow dull. Sir Tun. Bind him, I say--he's mad: bread and water, a dark room, and a whip, may bring him to his senses again. Lord Fop. Pr'ythee, Sir Tunbelly, why should you take such an aversion to the freedom of my address as to suffer the rascals thus to skewer down my arms like a rabbit?--[Aside.] Egad, if I don't awake, by all that I can see, this is like to prove one of the most impertinent dreams that ever I dreamt in my life. Re-enter MISS HOYDEN and NURSE. Miss Hoyd. [Going up to LORD FOPPINGTON.] Is this he that would have run--Fough, how he stinks of sweets!--Pray, father, let him be dragged through the horse-pond. Lord Fop. This must be my wife, by her natural inclination to her husband. [Aside.] Miss Hoyd. Pray, father, what do you intend to do with him--hang him? Sir Tun. That, at least, child. Nurse. Ay, and it's e'en too good for him too. Lord Fop. Madame la gouvernante, I presume: hitherto this appears to me to be one of the most extraordinary families that ever man of quality matched into. [Aside.] Sir Tun. What's become of my lord, daughter? Miss Hoyd. He's just coming, sir. Lord Fop. My lord! what does he mean by that, now? [Aside.] Re-enter TOM FASHION and LORY. Stap my vitals, Tam, now the dream's out! [Runs.] Fash. Is this the fellow, sir, that designed to trick me of your daughter? Sir Tun. This is he, my lord. How do you like him? Is not he a pretty fellow to get a fortune? Fash. I find by his dress he thought your daughter might be taken with a beau. Miss Hoyd. Oh, gemini! is this a beau? let me see him again. [Surveys him.] Ha! I find a beau is no such ugly thing, neither. Fash. [Aside.] Egad, she'll be in love with him presently --I'll e'en have him sent away to jail.--[To LORD FOPPINGTON.] Sir, though your undertaking shows you a person of no extraordinary modesty, I suppose you ha'n't confidence enough to expect much favour from me? Lord Fop. Strike me dumb, Tam, thou art a very impudent fellow. Nurse. Look, if the varlet has not the effrontery to call his lordship plain Thomas! Lord Fop. My Lord Foppington, shall I beg one word with your lordship? Nurse. Ho, ho! it's my lord with him now! See how afflictions will humble folks. Miss Hoyd. Pray, my lord--[To FASHION]--don't let him whisper too close, lest he bite your ear off. Lord Fop. I am not altogether so hungry as your ladyship is pleased to imagine.--[Aside to TOM FASHION.] Look you, Tam, I am sensible I have not been so kind to you as I ought, but I hope you'll forgive what's past, and accept of the five thousand pounds I offer--thou mayst live in extreme splendour with it, stap my vitals! Fash. It's a much easier matter to prevent a disease than to cure it. A quarter of that sum would have secured your mistress, twice as much cannot redeem her. [Aside to LORD FOPPINGTON.] Sir Tun. Well, what says he? Fash. Only the rascal offered me a bribe to let him go. Sir Tun. Ay, he shall go, with a plague to him!--lead on, constable. Enter SERVANT. Ser. Sir, here is Muster Loveless, and Muster Colonel Townly, and some ladies to wait on you. [To TOM FASHION.] Lory. [Aside to TOM FASHION.] So, sir, what will you do now? Fash. [Aside to LORY.] Be quiet; they are in the plot.--[Aloud.] Only a few friends, Sir Tunbelly, whom I wish to introduce to you. Lord Fop. Thou art the most impudent fellow, Tam, that ever nature yet brought into the world.--Sir Tunbelly, strike me speechless, but these are my friends and acquaintance, and my guests, and they will soon inform thee whether I am the true Lord Foppington or not. Enter LOVELESS, COLONEL TOWNLY, AMANDA, and BERINTHIA.--LORD FOPPINGTON accosts them as they pass, but none answer him. Fash. So, gentlemen, this is friendly; I rejoice to see you. Col. Town. My lord, we are fortunate to be the witnesses of your lordship's happiness. Love. But your lordship will do us the honour to introduce us to Sir Tunbelly Clumsy? Aman. And us to your lady. Lord Fop. Gad take me, but they are all in a story! [Aside.] Sir Tun. Gentlemen, you do me much honour; my Lord Foppington's friends will ever be welcome to me and mine. Fash. My love, let me introduce you to these ladies. Miss Hoyd. By goles, they look so fine and so stiff, I am almost ashamed to come nigh 'em. Aman. A most engaging lady indeed! Miss Hoyd. Thank ye, ma'am. Ber. And I doubt not will soon distinguish herself in the beau monde. Miss Hoyd. Where is that? Fash. You'll soon learn, my dear. Love. But Lord Foppington-- Lord Fop. Sir! Love. Sir! I was not addressing myself to you, sir!--Pray who is this gentleman? He seems rather in a singular predicament-- Col. Town. For so well-dressed a person, a little oddly circumstanced, indeed. Sir Tun. Ha! ha! ha!--So, these are your friends and your guests, ha, my adventurer? Lord Fop. I am struck dumb with their impudence, and cannot positively say whether I shall ever speak again or not. Sir Tun. Why, sir, this modest gentleman wanted to pass himself upon me as Lord Foppington, and carry off my daughter. Love. A likely plot to succeed, truly, ha! ha! Lord Fop. As Gad shall judge me, Loveless, I did not expect this from thee. Come, pr'ythee confess the joke; tell Sir Tunbelly that I am the real Lord Foppington, who yesterday made love to thy wife; was honoured by her with a slap on the face, and afterwards pinked through the body by thee. Sir Tun. A likely story, truly, that a peer would behave thus. Love. A pretty fellow, indeed, that would scandalize the character he wants to assume; but what will you do with him, Sir Tunbelly? Sir Tun. Commit him, certainly, unless the bride and bridegroom choose to pardon him. Lord Fop. Bride and bridegroom! For Gad's sake, Sir Tunbelly, 'tis tarture to me to hear you call 'em so. Miss Hoyd. Why, you ugly thing, what would you have him call us--dog and cat? Lord Fop. By no means, miss; for that sounds ten times more like man and wife than t'other. Sir Tun. A precious rogue this to come a-wooing! Re-enter SERVANT. Ser. There are some gentlefolks below to wait upon Lord Foppington. [Exit.] Col. Town. 'Sdeath, Tom, what will you do now? [Aside to TOM FASHION.] Lord Fop. Now, Sir Tunbelly, here are witnesses who I believe are not corrupted. Sir Tun. Peace, fellow!--Would your lordship choose to have your guests shown here, or shall they wait till we come to 'em? Fash. I believe, Sir Tunbelly, we had better not have these visitors here yet.--[Aside.] Egad, all must out. Love. Confess, confess; we'll stand by you. [Aside to TOM FASHION.] Lord Fop. Nay, Sir Tunbelly, I insist on your calling evidence on both sides--and if I do not prove that fellow an impostor-- Fash. Brother, I will save you the trouble, by now confessing that I am not what I have passed myself for.--Sir Tunbelly, I am a gentleman, and I flatter myself a man of character; but'tis with great pride I assure you I am not Lord Foppington. Sir Tun. Ouns!--what's this?--an impostor?--a cheat?--fire and faggots, sir, if you are not Lord Foppington, who the devil are you? Fash. Sir, the best of my condition is, I am your son-in-law; and the worst of it is, I am brother to that noble peer. Lord Fop. Impudent to the last, Gad dem me! Sir Tun. My son-in-law! not yet, I hope. Fash. Pardon me, sir; thanks to the goodness of your chaplain, and the kind offices of this gentlewoman. Lory. 'Tis true indeed, sir; I gave your daughter away, and Mrs. Nurse, here, was clerk. Sir Tun. Knock that rascal down!--But speak, Jezebel, how's this? Nurse. Alas! your honour, forgive me; I have been overreached in this business as well as you. Your worship knows, if the wedding-dinner had been ready, you would have given her away with your own hands. Sir Tun. But how durst you do this without acquainting me? Nurse. Alas! if your worship had seen how the poor thing begged and prayed, and clung and twined about me like ivy round an old wall, you would say, I who had nursed it, and reared it, must have had a heart like stone to refuse it. Sir Tun. Ouns! I shall go mad! Unloose my lord there, you scoundrels! Lord Fop. Why, when these gentlemen are at leisure, I should be glad to congratulate you on your son-in-law, with a little more freedom of address. Miss Hoyd. Egad, though, I don't see which is to be my husband after all. Love. Come, come, Sir Tunbelly, a man of your understanding must perceive that an affair of this kind is not to be mended by anger and reproaches. Col. Town. Take my word for it, Sir Tunbelly, you are only tricked into a son-in-law you may be proud of: my friend Tom Fashion is as honest a fellow as ever breathed. Love. That he is, depend on't; and will hunt or drink with you most affectionately: be generous, old boy, and forgive them-- Sir Tun. Never! the hussy!--when I had set my heart on getting her a title. Lord Fop. Now, Sir Tunbelly, that I am untrussed--give me leave to thank thee for the very extraordinary reception I have met with in thy damned, execrable mansion; and at the same time to assure you, that of all the bumpkins and blockheads I have had the misfortune to meek with, thou art the most obstinate and egregious, strike me ugly! Sir Tun. What's this! I believe you are both rogues alike. Lord Fop. No, Sir Tunbelly, thou wilt find to thy unspeakable mortification, that I am the real Lord Foppington, who was to have disgraced myself by an alliance with a clod; and that thou hast matched thy girl to a beggarly younger brother of mine, whose title deeds might be contained in thy tobacco-box. Sir Tun. Puppy! puppy!--I might prevent their being beggars, if I chose it; for I could give 'em as good a rent-roll as your lordship. Lord Fop. Ay, old fellow, but you will not do that--for that would be acting like a Christian, and thou art a barbarian, stap my vitals. Sir Tun. Udzookers! now six such words more, and I'll forgive them directly. Love. 'Slife, Sir Tunbelly, you should do it, and bless yourself--Ladies, what say you? Aman. Good Sir Tunbelly, you must consent. Ber. Come, you have been young yourself, Sir Tunbelly. Sir Tun. Well then, if I must, I must; but turn--turn that sneering lord out, however, and let me be revenged on somebody. But first look whether I am a barbarian or not; there, children, I join your hands; and when I'm in a better humour, I'll give you my blessing. Love. Nobly done, Sir Tunbelly! and we shall see you dance at a grandson's christening yet. Miss Hoyd. By goles, though, I don't understand this! What! an't I to be a lady after all? only plain Mrs.--What's my husband's name, nurse? Nurse. Squire Fashion. Miss Hoyd. Squire, is he?--Well, that's better than nothing. Lord Fop. [Aside.] Now I will put on a philosophic air, and show these people, that it is not possible to put a man of my quality out of countenance.--[Aloud.] Dear Tam, since things are fallen out, pr'ythee give me leave to wish thee joy; I do it de bon coeur, strike me dumb! You have married into a family of great politeness and uncommon elegance of manners, and your bride appears to be a lady beautiful in person, modest in her deportment, refined in her sentiments, and of nice morality, split my windpipe! Miss Hoyd. By goles, husband, break his bones if he calls me names! Fash. Your lordship may keep up your spirits with your grimace, if you please; I shall support mine, by Sir Tunbelly's favour, with this lady and three thousand pounds a year. Lord Fop. Well, adieu, Tam!--Ladies, I kiss your, hands!-- Sir Tunbelly, I shall now quit this thy den; but while I retain the use of my arms, I shall ever remember thou art a demned horrid savage; Ged demn me! [Exit.] Sir Tun. By the mass, 'tis well he's gone--for I should ha' been provoked, by-and-by, to ha' dun un a mischief. Well, if this is a lord, I think Hoyden has luck on her side, in troth. Col. Town. She has, indeed, Sir Tunbelly.--But I hear the fiddles; his lordship, I know, has provided 'em. Love. Oh, a dance and a bottle, Sir Tunbelly, by all means! Sir Tun. I had forgot the company below; well--what--we must be merry, then, ha? and dance and drink, ha? Well, 'fore George, you shan't say I do these things by halves. Son-in-law there looks like a hearty rogue, so we'll have a night on't: and which of these ladies will be the old man's partner, ha?--Ecod, I don't know how I came to be in so good a humour. Ber. Well, Sir Tunbelly, my friend and I both will endeavour to keep you so: you have done a generous action, and are entitled to our attention. If you should be at a loss to divert your new guests, we will assist you to relate to them the plot of your daughter's marriage, and his lordship's deserved mortification; a subject which perhaps may afford no bad evening's entertainment. Sir Tun. Ecod, with all my heart; though I am a main bungler at a long story. Ber. Never fear; we will assist you, if the tale is judged worth being repeated; but of this you may be assured, that while the intention is evidently to please, British auditors will ever be indulgent to the errors of the performance.

Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, wouldn't do it. And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> could see her in prison?" ...|$|E

It's cool to meet different songwriters and see how it all works. Even if we’re not sitting there writing, we are a part of the writing process because we’ve thrown the idea out there in terms of what we want to sing about or know about." [...] On working with SESAC-award winning Bryan-Michael Cox, member Brave stated, [...] "With Bryan-Michael Cox in particular, and a lot of the other songwriters, we’re very involved creatively. Working with Rich, since he knows us so well, maybe we’ll inspire him with a new topic, or a more clever way of saying, ‘We’re going to the club.'" [...] RichGirl takes advantage of the fact that there are four members, allowing their music to create emotional connections through songwriting with a combination of the four women's personal experiences, as Se7en states, [...] "Because there are four of us, we have four different stories. But even if I haven’t experienced a certain scenario, it might be something in Lyndriette's past; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> have a sister who has the same story. So as long as we truly relate to the song, it's important for these messages to get out because we can relate as women." ...|$|E

This kind of mixed dune have been described elsewhere in the Iberian Peninsula (mainly in La Mancha), but while there have been dated before the mid-Holocene, the dates obtained by OSL and the archaeological record in Mengabril place them specifically during the arid periods located in the Chalcolithic, Roman times until Antonine dynasty and from early to high Middle Age...|$|E

Within this paper they will serve as a point of departure for the discussion. Can the messages found {{on the sides of the}} squares intended for an X in a questionnaire be considered non-messages? Or are these expressions indeed messages that are made silent and therefore can be considered silent messages? Then one might wonder what the meanings of the silent messages are that often occurs in questionnaires? Can, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> should, <b>we</b> take notice of these silent messages? According to Polanyi every human being has silent and unexpressed dimensions within themselves, which acknowledge situations where we recognise that we know more than we can explain. This is also stressed by Merleau-Ponty, who argued that something exists beyond what is said, and Bateson emphasised that a non-message is also a message - the silence tells us something.

More participants {{are on the}} media market and it {{is becoming more and}} more difficult to define what PR really is and what the PR agencies/departments really do. Is PR marketing, information, event marketing <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> propaganda? <b>We</b> believe that the complexity to define the term PR can lead to a loss of critical approach to the business, especially among young people. Has the PR industry managed to eliminate their negative image among students in upper secondary school and what do they associate with PR today?   The aim of this essay is to examine what a selection of students associate with the term PR and if they are critical to the PR industry or not. Method/Material: The method is a quantitative survey. The target group is senior students in upper secondary public school in central Stockholm. Theory: Social construction, PR-theory, framing and former studies about the students and general public opinion about the PR business.

It {{has been}} said (although sadly I have no source) that music {{is one of the}} most useful yet useless {{phenomena}} known to mankind. Useless in that it has, apparently, no tangible or immediately practical function in our lives, but extremely useful in that it is a truly universal language between human beings, which transcends boundaries and allows us to express ourselves and experience emotions in rather profound ways. For the majority of us, music exists to be listened to, appreciated, admired (sometimes reviled) but generally as some sort of stimulus for our auditory senses. Some of us feel the need to produce music, perhaps simply for our own creative enjoyment, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>we</b> crave the power it lends us to be able to inspire feelings in others. For those of us who love to know “the reason why” or “how things work” and wish to discover the secrets of music, arguably the greatest of all the arts, there can surely be no doubt that a fascinating world of mathematics, harmony and beauty awaits us. Perhaps the reason why music is able to convey such strong emotions in us is because we are (for whatever strange evolutionary reason or purpose) designed to be innately pattern pursuing, sequence searching and harmony hungry creatures. Music, as we shall discover in this research, is chock-a-block full of the most incredible patterns, which are just waiting to be deciphered...|$|R

Only rarely can two people communicate in depth immediately. Usually they first test each other's responses and if these are sincere and favourable, a degree of trust enters the relationship and encourages deeper communication. We communicate in endless ways and {{this results in a}} great diversity of relationships. A baby for example, even before birth has a relationship with the mother. After birth he can be pacified by a tape-recording of his mother's resting heart beat. Within a few months, mother and baby have widened their range of communication and perception.

It is not long before the baby recognises in his mother's communications or expresses in his own behaviour, happiness, love, anger, dependence, pain {{and a host of other}} emotions. Later still, mother and baby will express their feelings verbally, but by this time the relationship is already well developed, and may not be easy to change.

40|$|Miron Bialoszewski {{is known}} for his untypical and {{idiosyncratic}} language of his poetry, as well as prose and drama that he has created. However, it is possible to find many connections between those linguistic experiments and the strategies used by polish avant-garde poets during the interwar years. It makes the works of Bialoszewski both innovative and dependent on the history of literature. Through the analysis of his specific language and the content of his poetry, as well as the comparison to the works and statements of the polish avant-garde representatives, author of this paper tries to recreate the philosophical backgroud of Bialoszewski’s poems and explain how is the concept of music present in them. The article is divided into two main parts. The first main problem is a question about the philosophical condition of the language that we can encounter in this poetry — are we free in using our language <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> are limited by the word? The negative response to the first question leads to the necessity of possible solutions. Here music appears. It seems to be for Bialoszewski as the possibility of escaping from the limitations of the language. At the same time, music in his poetry is a new way of describing the world and a form of expressing ones thoughts. Publikacja dofinansowana przez Wydział Filologiczny U...|$|E
