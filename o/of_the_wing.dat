5|$|Investigators {{were able}} to {{identify}} the point of origin of the disintegration as an area immediately ahead of {{the leading edge of the}} aircraft's right wing. The material recovered from Kure Beach, including a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> fillet, was from this general area. Investigators were unable to recover material from an irregular, triangularly shaped area positioned above the leading edge and extending forward ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{upper side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is brown with <b>the</b> fore <b>wings</b> having several glassy white spots. <b>The</b> {{underside}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is brown {{with the body}} and basal area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> bright yellow-orange.|$|R
50|$|Adults are {{brownish}} orange, {{with white}} and black spots on <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> <b>The</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is 1.5 to 2 inches (38 to 51 mm).|$|R

5|$|The Jugal Region, or Neala, is {{a region}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{that is usually}} a small {{membranous}} area proximal {{to the base of}} the vannus strengthened by a few small, irregular veinlike thickenings; but when well developed it is a distinct section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> and may contain one or two jugal veins. When the jugal area of the forewing is developed as a free lobe, it projects beneath the humeral angle of the hindwing and thus serves to yoke the two wings together. In the Jugatae group of Lepidoptera it bears a long finger-like lobe. The jugal region was termed the neala ("new wing") because it is evidently a secondary and recently developed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
50|$|Mimoides pausanias {{is a large}} {{butterfly}} with iridescent brown {{color on}} <b>the</b> upper surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> <b>The</b> basal portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is metallic blue, in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewing {{there is a large}} white or yellow patch, while <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewings is pale brown. Also <b>the</b> under surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is iridescent brown with a yellow patch and a submarginal line of bright red markings on the hindwings.|$|R
50|$|The {{tropical}} least skipper {{has more}} orange on <b>the</b> upper side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> than <b>the</b> least skipper, and <b>the</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> has very small black marginal spots.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{upper side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is black with {{a row of}} red postmedian spots. <b>The</b> {{underside}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is also black with a row of pink and whitish spots.|$|R
5|$|A nodus {{is formed}} where the second main vein meets {{the leading edge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> The black pterostigma is carried near the wing tip.|$|E
5|$|Another feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> twisted slightly upward along its span, {{the angle of}} incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|At the {{posterior}} angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> base in some Diptera {{there is a}} pair of membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is well developed in the house fly. The outer squama (c) arises from the wing base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) arises from {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the alula is turned upside down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the alula.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> undersides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> are orange {{red with}} large white bands and several black or pale blue stripes. <b>The</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> undersides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> are deeply {{scalloped}} by white markings.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> upperside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is black, {{without a}} band {{and with one}} row of red crescents along the hindwing margin. <b>The</b> {{underside}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is almost <b>the</b> same as the upperside.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 25-32 mm. <b>The</b> upperside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is {{brown with}} an orange area, which is bordered by black dots. <b>The</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is bright yellow with black dots.|$|R
5|$|Civil Aeronautics Board {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} the outer portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> had detached from the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> The investigation revealed a fatigue crack 7/8inch long and 3/32inch deep {{at the point of}} detachment. Similar cracks were found on the wing root fittings of another Martin 2-0-2 aircraft that flew the same flight path through the same storm shortly after Flight 421. October inspections of three other Martin 2-0-2 aircraft revealed identical fatigue cracks in similar locations.|$|E

The colour is paler and more white postbasally. <b>The</b> posterior portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is white with greyish strigulae. The hindwings are whitish, slightly tinged with brownish and strigulated with pale brown.|$|R
50|$|Idaea flaveolaria has a {{wingspan}} of 14 - 18 mm in males, of 12 - 14 mm in females. <b>The</b> basic color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> {{is bright}} brown-orange. On the forewings and hindwings {{there are two}} brown transversal lines, often almost indistinct. These transversal lines appear more clearly on <b>the</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> together with a dark discal spots. <b>The</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> shows a blackish fringe.|$|R
50|$|Pterocarya stenoptera {{is quite}} similar to P. fraxinifolia. The major {{difference}} lies in <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> on <b>the</b> fruit: reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common fly, they are connected to <b>the</b> two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walnut shaped fruit, which is about <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> a chickpea. <b>The</b> <b>wings</b> lie in two different planes.|$|R
5|$|Radius (R2-R5) – radius divides into {{branches}} {{beyond the}} middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{up to five}} branches in Papilionidae. On forewing, the last R is stalked in all butterflies except Hesperiidae is separated.|$|E
5|$|Reconnaissance {{aircraft}} {{based on}} the M-1, the under-surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> were covered with duralumin {{and it had a}} wider engine axis and longer engine nacelles.

50|$|<b>The</b> upperside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> are {{chocolate}} brown {{with a golden}} median band on the forewing. The hindwing has a checkered fringe. <b>The</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> {{are very similar to}} the upperside. Its wingspan measures 1.25 to 1.75 in.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 120-140 mm. The male {{resembles the}} male Papilio ascalaphus, but lacks the tail at <b>the</b> bottom <b>wing</b> and has large red patches on the ventral side (underside) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> In contrast, <b>the</b> female has distinct red markings {{on both sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Board also {{recommended}} frequent inspections of wing root fittings {{for the development}} of fatigue cracks, increasing the thickness of the portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> attached to the fuselage, and reduction of operating speeds by 10%.|$|E
5|$|The {{axillary}} {{region is}} region containing the axillary sclerites has {{in general the}} form of a scalene triangle. The base of the triangle (a-b) is the hinge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> with the body; the apex (c) is the distal end of the third axillary sclerite; the longer side is anterior to the apex. The point d on the anterior side of the triangle marks the articulation of the radial vein with the second axillary sclerite. The line between d and c is the plica basalis (bf), or fold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{at the base of the}} mediocubital field.|$|E
5|$|The colour seen in {{each part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> is the {{combination}} of the colours reflected by these two effects.|$|E
50|$|Doxocopa cyane has a {{wingspan}} {{of about}} 55 mm. <b>The</b> color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> varies by sex.
