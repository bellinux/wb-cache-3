25|$|Europe is {{the leader}} in <b>{{offshore}}</b> <b>wind</b> <b>energy,</b> with the first offshore wind farm (Vindeby) being installed in Denmark in 1991. As of 2010, there are 39 offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 MW. More than 100 GW (or 100,000 MW) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe. The European Wind Energy Association has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{consolidation}} of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> technology and the progress carried out for wave energy technology, the option of combine both technologies has arisen. This combination rest mainly in two main reasons: in one hand, to increase the sustainability of both energies {{by means of a}} more rational harnessing of the natural resources; in the other hand, to reduce the costs of both technologies by sharing {{some of the most important}} costs of an offshore project. In addition to these two powerful reasons there are a number of technology synergies between wave and wind systems which makes their combination even more suitable. Co-located projects are one of the alternatives to combine wave-wind systems, and it is specially for these project were so-called shadow effect synergy becomes meaningful. In particular, this paper deals with the co-location of Wave Energy Conversion (WEC) technologies into a conventional <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm. More specifically, an overtopping type of WEC technology was considered in this work to study the effects of its co-location with a conventional <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> park. This study aims to give a preliminary approach to the shadow effect and its implications for both wave and <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>energies.</b> 2...|$|R
25|$|Offshore {{wind power}} or <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> {{is the use}} of wind farms {{constructed}} offshore, usually on the continental shelf, to harvest wind energy to generate electricity. Higher wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher, and NIMBY opposition to construction is usually much weaker. The cost of offshore wind power has historically been higher than that of onshore wind generation, but in 2016 had decreased to €54.5/MWh the 700 MW Borssele 3&4 due to government tender and size. Similarly, €49.90/MWh ($55.34, without transmission) was achieved at the 600 MW Kriegers Flak.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the strong}} {{prevailing}} winds, and shallow water, countries on the North Sea, particularly Germany and Denmark, have used the shore for wind power since the 1990s. The North Sea {{is the home of}} one of the first large-scale offshore wind farms in the world, Horns Rev 1, completed in 2002. Since then many other wind farms have been commissioned in the North Sea (and elsewhere). As of 2013 the 630megawatt (MW) London Array is the largest offshore wind farm in the world, with the 504 (MW) Greater Gabbard wind farm the second largest, followed by the 367MW Walney Wind Farm. All are off the coast of the UK. These projects will be dwarfed by subsequent wind farms that are in the pipeline, including Dogger Bank at 4,800MW, Norfolk Bank (7,200MW), and Irish Sea (4,200MW). At the end of June 2013 total European combined <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> capacity was 6,040MW. UK installed 513.5MW offshore windpower in the first half year of 2013.|$|E
25|$|The main {{environmental}} concern with tidal energy {{is associated with}} blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water {{increases the risk of}} organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of EMF and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. It should be noted that because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>energy.</b> Depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment, such as dolphins and whales). Tidal energy removal can also cause {{environmental concern}}s such as degrading farfield water quality and disrupting sediment processes. Depending {{on the size of the}} project, these effects can range from small traces of sediment building up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore ecosystems and processes.|$|E
40|$|Wind {{farms are}} often planned <b>offshore</b> where <b>wind</b> {{conditions}} are favourable {{and the visual}} impact is less important. Wind farms have {{both positive and negative}} effects on the marine environment. Negative effects include bird collisions, underwater sounds and electromagnetic fields, whilst positive effects constitute functioning as artificial reef and acting as no-take zones for fish, with possible spill-over effects. This paper presents a spatially explicit framework to analyze effects of wind farms on the marine environment and aims to evaluate how wind farms can contribute to protection of the marine environment through strategic and economically viable location choices. The functioning and the applicability of the model are demonstrated in a numerical example for the Dutch exclusive economic zone. We find that the careful spatial planning of wind farms is a key factor for profitability and environmental protection, and that, if carefully planned, the environment can benefit from <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. <b>Wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms Marine environmental protection...|$|R
