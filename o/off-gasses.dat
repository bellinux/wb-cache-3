40|$|Abstract: In smelters, {{metal ores}} or {{concentrates}} are smelted to reduce a metal oxide to a metal {{through a series}} of reactions and processes. In a smelting process, a large amount of <b>off-gas</b> emissions are often generated, which can cause serious environmental and plant hygiene problems if not properly treated. <b>Off-gas</b> systems extract and treat the <b>off-gas</b> emissions, and ensure that the smelter operation is in accordance with environmental and industrial hygiene regulations. In this paper, the dynamic models for an industrial smelter furnace and converter <b>off-gas</b> system, tackling hazardous sulfur dioxide (SO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), are developed using mass continuity, momentum and energy conservation laws. Based on the developed dynamic models, the effects of important variables on the system’s dynamics are studied via simulations.

This handicap creates an incentive for the investigation of alternative olefin/paraffin separation technologies. In this regard, membrane technology supposes a potential solution for process intensification. Previous works of our research group reported the use of facilitated transport composite membranes integrating the use of PVDF-HFP polymer, BMImBF 4 ionic liquid and AgBF 4 silver salt. In this type of membranes, the silver cations react selectively and reversibly with the olefin, allowing the separation via mobile and fixed carrier mechanisms.

Smoke from vegetation {{as well as}} <b>off-gasses</b> from equipment such as chain saws, pumps, and drip torches are accounted for. Section II {{provides an overview of}} industrial hygiene science and techniques. Section III is a discussion and literature review of the components in wildland smoke, and section IV identifies the health concerns associated with smoke inhalation and a review of the current literature on exposure to inhalation irritants. Section V covers research that has been done on wildland firefighter smoke exposure. Section VI is an overview of the Wildland Firefighter Smoke Exposure Study, a project I have managed since 2009. This final section describes the objectives, methods, data collection, and analysis of the study. In its entirety, this report can be used to identify locations, times, and firefighter activities that have a high probability of causing high exposures as well as to identify management actions that can mitigate these exposures. Wildland firefighters work in a dynamic environment and are often faced with a variety of hazards from fire to fire and shift to shift. One of the most common, but often overlooked, hazards is exposure to potentially harmful levels of contaminants in wildland smoke. This may also be one of the least understood risks of wildland firefighting (Reisen et al., 2009). With a growing body of information regarding the potential health effects of vegetative smoke to respiratory and cardiovascular systems, it became apparent to United States Forest Service (USFS) fire management officials that more research needed to be done. The USFS realized the need for current, valid data to accurately assess the exposure wildland firefighters and personnel at fire camps experience during their work shift. Unlike municipal firefighters, wildland firefighters do not wear respiratory protection equipment such as a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Without SCBA, wildland firefighters are subject to exposure from a variety of inhalation irritants ranging from carbon monoxide, aldehydes, particulate matter, crystalline silica, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Some of the compounds in wildland fire smoke are known or suspected carcinogens. Health effects include short-term conditions such as headaches, fatigue, and nausea, while long-term health effects may include an increased risk of cardio-vascular disease. In order to assess the long-term risks associated with wildland firefighting, a comprehensive study of exposure was necessary. By identifying the conditions and activities that lead to high exposure, firefighters and fire managers can be better prepared to reduce these exposures. This study focused on wildland firefighters engaged in the suppression of wildland fires and working on prescribed fires primarily on federally-managed lands (forests and rangelands) throughout the United States. Study subjects included any firefighter employed by the following federal land management agencies: US Forest Service, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Bureau of Land Management, as well as employees contracted by these federal agencies. Firefighters employed by various states are also included in the study, as well as those engaged in initial attack and project fires. Study subjects also included fire support personnel who work at incident command posts (ICPs) and spike camps. Fire suppression and management of prescribed fires involves many different activities. In order to successfully account for differences in exposure among firefighters, these activities were monitored and recorded during the data collection phase...|$|E

40|$|<b>Off-gassing</b> of {{hazardous}} compounds is, together with self-heating and dust explosions, the main safety hazards within large-scale biomass storage and handling. Formation of CO, CO 2, and VOCs with concurrent O 2 depletion can occur to hazardous levels in enclosed stored forest products. Several incidents of CO poisoning and suffocation of oxygen depletion {{have resulted in}} fatalities and injuries during cargo vessel discharge of forest products and in conjunction with wood pellet storage rooms and silos. Technologies for torrefaction and steam explosion for thermal treatment of biomass are under development and approaching commercialization, but their <b>off-gassing</b> behavior is essentially unknown. The overall objective of this thesis was to provide answers to one main question: “What is the <b>off-gassing</b> behaviour of thermally treated lignocellulosic biomass during storage?”. This was achieved by experimental studies and detailed analysis of <b>off-gassing</b> compounds sampled under realistic conditions, with special emphasis on the VOCs. Presented results show that <b>off-gassing</b> behavior is influenced by numerous factors, in the following ways. CO, CO 2 and CH 4 <b>off-gassing</b> levels from torrefied and stream-exploded biomass and pellets, and accompanying O 2 depletion, are comparable to or lower than corresponding from untreated biomass. The treatments also cause major compositional shifts in VOCs; emissions of terpenes and native aldehydes decline, but levels of volatile cell wall degradation products (notably furans and aromatics) increase. The severity of the thermal treatment is also important; increases in torrefaction severity increase CO <b>off-gassing</b> from torrefied pine to levels comparable to emissions from conventional pellets, and increase O 2 depletion for both torrefied chips and pellets. Both treatment temperature and duration also influence degradation rates and VOC composition. The product cooling technique is influential too; water spraying in addition to heat exchange increased CO 2 and VOCs <b>off-gassing</b> from torrefied pine chips, as well as O 2 depletion. Moreover, the composition of emitted gases co-varied with pellets’ moisture content; pellets of more severely treated material retained less moisture, regardless of their pre-conditioning moisture content. However, no co-variance was found between <b>off-gassing</b> and pelletization settings, the resulting pellet quality, or storage time of torrefied chips before pelletization. Pelletization of steam-exploded bark increased subsequent VOC <b>off-gassing,</b> and induced compositional shifts relative to emissions from unpelletized steam-exploded material. In addition, CO, CO 2 and CH 4 <b>off-gassing,</b> and O 2 depletion, were positively correlated with the storage temperature of torrefied softwood. Similarly, CO and CH 4 emissions from steam-exploded softwood increased with increases in storage temperature, and VOC <b>off-gassing</b> from both torrefied and steam-exploded softwood was more affected by storage temperature than by treatment severity. Levels of CO, CO 2 and CH 4 increased, while levels of O 2 and most VOCs decreased, during storage of both torrefied and steam-exploded softwood. CO, CO 2 and O 2 levels were more affected by storage time than by treatment severity. Levels of VOCs were not significantly decreased or altered by nitrogen purging of storage spaces of steam-exploded or torrefied softwood, or controlled headspace gas exchange (intermittent ventilation) during storage of steam-exploded bark. In conclusion, rates of <b>off-gassing</b> of CO and CO 2 from thermally treated biomass, and associated O 2 depletion, are comparable to or lower than corresponding rates for untreated biomass. Thermal treatment induces shifts in both concentrations and profiles of VOCs. It is believed that the knowledge and insights gained provide refined foundations for future research and safe implementation of thermally treated fuels as energy carriers in renewable energy process chains...|$|R

To improve the level of recycling converter <b>off-gas</b> in steel plants, a novel approach to the recycle of CO 2 separated from converter <b>off-gas</b> or other <b>off-gas</b> for the green slag splashing technique was developed, and the CO 2 equilibrium conversion ratio of the green CO 2 slag splashing under different technological conditions was calculated by the program of enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and heat capacity (C), i. e. HSC software. Furthermore, the experiments of CO 2 injected into molten converter slag were curried out, and the influencing factors of the green slag splashing technique using CO 2 were analyzed. The experimental results showed that the carbon content for smooth slag splashing using CO 2 was about 4. 0 %...|$|R

40|$|Electric energy furnace <b>off-gases</b> have a {{high energy}} {{recovery}} potential, but it is limited by high variability of their temperature and the high dust concentration. An apparatus is proposed in order to smoothing temperatures by adopting Phase Change Materials. By exploiting their latent heat for melting and solidification, heat flows can be deferred, thus smoothing <b>off-gas</b> temperatures. The choice of the Phase Change Material and the geometrical characteristics of the apparatus are related both to analytical evaluations and to thermo-fluid dynamic simulations. The apparatus performance is assessed as reduced standard deviation of the <b>off-gas</b> temperatures from the mean value. Finally, technologies for energy recovery and conversion are identified and sized...|$|R
40|$|Big process {{industries}} like PREEM AB, Sweden refining 16 million tonnes {{of crude oil}} annually are investigating the black boxes at their site to cut down unnecessary power consumption. This project study initiated by PREEM Lysekil Refinery is an example, to investigate the output i. e., recovery of LPG (propane and butane) {{in comparison to the}} power input to the refrigeration section. In oil refineries, it is always interesting to recover valuable products like liquefied petroleum gas – LPG from the refinery streams. An analysis has been conducted at the refrigerated LPG Recovery Unit by modelling and simulating the unit in an advanced process engineering tools, ASPEN HYSYS assisted by ASPEN HTFS+ an energy equipment calculation tool, to investigate the performance and possibilities in the current system. Despite the engineering challenges to model the unique refrigerated LPG recovery system in HYSYS, the system was simulated to analyse the current operation. The simulation concluded that the lean <b>off-gas</b> stream, one out of three, was only cooled but not condensed. This imposed an extra load in the refrigeration cycle only used to extract specific heat from the <b>off-gas</b> stream instead of recovering LPG. Such findings led to investigation of the refrigeration load and LPG recovery only for <b>off-gas</b> streams, rich in propane and butane. 657 kg/h of LPG was recovered from 1078 kg/h of incoming <b>off-gas</b> stream with 25 % reduction in refrigeration power consumption. A minor retrofit for exchanging heat between recovered LPG and incoming rich <b>off-gas</b> stream proved to save comparatively more power, i. e., 37 %, with the same LPG recovery in the refrigerated LPG recovery system in the HYSYS model. The simulated model predicts that the present unit is capable of handling another rich <b>off-gas</b> stream of a size similar to the lean <b>off-gas</b> stream (2814 kg/h), which is proposed to be removed. The introduction of the new rich <b>off-gas</b> stream will lead to more LPG recovery, in an efficient way, at the expense of slightly increased power consumption, due to high dew. Recovering more LPG leads to fuel gas deficiency and that would be compensated by introducing cheaper fuels like natural gas from Norway, included in the strategic planning of the refinery. Another project could be conducted to thoroughly analyse the impact of more LPG recovery, from new rich <b>off-gas</b> stream, on the refrigeration load...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the burden of {{electric}} arc furnace dust on steel recycling plants, a new technology called in-process separation (IPS) was proposed. By separating Zn vapor from the solid particles in the electric arc furnace <b>off-gas,</b> production of Zn-containing electric arc furnace dust may be prevented. However, the spinel formation reaction at high temperatures {{and its impact on the}} technology’s feasibility still require better understanding. This paper demonstrates a model that was developed to provide this insight, based on the results of our previous work on the kinetics of the spinel formation. This model evaluates the performance of IPS based on four key process parameters: the position of the separation unit, the time–temperature profile inside the <b>off-gas</b> duct, the solid particle size distribution, and the initial Zn and Fe content of the <b>off-gas.</b> The impact on the efficiency of each parameter was demonstrated using the results of the model for a specific <b>off-gas</b> treatment setup. status: publishe...|$|R
