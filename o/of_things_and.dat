5|$|The sixth book, Darke (published in America in June 2011 and England in October 2011), sees Septimus and {{his friends}} battling the Darke which has engulfed the Castle and {{everything}} and everyone in it. The only thing that is standing in between is Merrin Meredith and his gang <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> <b>and</b> his Darke Dragon. Alther Mella has been Banished (together with Tertius Fume) and Septimus wants to release him from the Darke Halls thinking he could help in undoing the Darke. When Marcia Overstrand, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard undoes the Darke spell {{with the help of}} the Paired Codes, all is well. Beetle becomes Chief Hermetic Scribe; Simon is reunited with his family after leaving his past behind and Princess Jenna is happy that the Palace and Castle are back to normal.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E
5|$|When Sodh was {{twenty-two years}} old, he was ordained at Wat Songpinong in his {{hometown}} and was given the Pāli language monastic name Candasaro. Phra (phra meaning 'monk, venerable') Candasaro studied both under masters of the oral meditation tradition as well as experts in scriptural analysis, which was uncommon during that period. In his autobiographical notes, he wrote that he practiced meditation every day, {{from the first day}} following his ordination. In his first years as a monk, he had difficulty obtaining food on traditional alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for laypeople to offer them food. This hardship led him to resolve that he would one day built a kitchen for monastics, who would then enjoy convenience in the spiritual life. After his third rainy season (third year after monk's ordination), Phra Candasaro traveled far and wide in Thailand to study scriptures and meditation practice with teachers from established traditions. He learnt about a broad range <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> was in the habit of respecting all spiritual things. He studied scriptures at Wat Pho and learnt about meditation at eight centers, among which Wat Ratchasittharam. At Wat Ratchasittharam he studied a visualization meditation method with Luang Por Aium, and experienced a development in meditation regarded as important, when he perceived a sphere of light. Buddhist Studies scholars Kate Crosby and Catherine Newell believe Wat Ratchasittharam to be crucial in Luang Pu Sodh's development of Dhammakaya meditation.|$|E

25|$|The West Riding dialect of Hughes's {{childhood}} {{remained a}} staple of his poetry, his lexicon lending a texture that is concrete, terse, emphatic, economical yet powerful. The manner of speech renders the hard facts <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> wards off self-indulgence.|$|E
25|$|Also in February 2017, analyst firm 451 Research {{released}} a report on BlackBerry's improved financial position and product focus.

The BBM Enterprise SDK was also highlighted, alongside several challenges still facing the company.|$|E

25|$|Ambient {{intelligence}} and autonomous control {{are not part}} of the original concept of the Internet of things. Ambient {{intelligence and}} autonomous control do not necessarily require Internet structures, either. However, there is a shift in research to integrate the concepts of the Internet <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> autonomous control, with initial outcomes towards this direction considering objects as the driving force for autonomous IoT.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{about privacy}} have led many to {{consider}} the possibility that big data infrastructures such as the Internet <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> data mining are inherently incompatible with privacy. Writer Adam Greenfield claims that these technologies are not only an invasion of public space but are also being used to perpetuate normative behavior, citing an instance of billboards with hidden cameras that tracked the demographics of passersby who stopped to read the advertisement.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte Doyle – Charlotte is the thirteen-year-old upper-class {{girl with}} a proper {{education}} and proper manners. As such, she has grown accustomed to a refined style of living. Sheltered from the harsher sides of life, she has a narrow-minded view <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> places great value in propriety. She is returning to her family from a private girls' school in England. In the end, she decides {{to run away from}} home and become a true sailor, even though she is inexperienced.|$|E

25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in the very nature <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>And</b> I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific {{context in which they}} were first enunciated.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greeks {{perceived}} {{order in}} the universe, and in turn, applied order and reason to their creations. Their humanist philosophy put mankind at the centre <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> promoted well-ordered societies {{and the development of}} democracy. At the same time, the respect for human intellect demanded reason, and promoted a passion for enquiry, logic, challenge, and problem solving. The architecture of the ancient Greeks, and in particular, temple architecture, responds to these challenges with a passion for beauty, and for order and symmetry which {{is the product of a}} continual search for perfection, rather than a simple application of a set of working rules.|$|E
25|$|The Scientific Revolution was {{a period}} when European ideas in {{classical}} physics, astronomy, biology, human anatomy, chemistry, and other classical sciences were rejected and led to doctrines supplanting those that had prevailed from Ancient Greece to the Middle Ages which {{would lead to a}} transition to modern science. This period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across physics, astronomy, and biology, in institutions supporting scientific investigation, and in the more widely held picture of the universe. Individuals started to question all manners <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> it was this questioning that led to the Scientific Revolution, which in turn formed the foundations of contemporary sciences and the establishment of several modern scientific fields.|$|E

25|$|Anderson's father {{wrestled}} professionally in {{the early}} 1980s. Growing up she became a fan of her father's work and began showing an aptitude for sports, particularly soccer, as well as joining Palmdale High School's athletics and amateur wrestling team as one of only four girls. When only 15, she had already {{become involved in the}} wrestling business, traveling to San Bernardino frequently to train in and work for the wrestling school of Billy Anderson, her father's former tag team partner, as well as involving herself in the running <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> before long she made her debut front of stage. Despite touring so young, Anderson still studied and gained her high school diploma largely through the help of e-mailing teachers; she also credits the internet for helping her become famous while only wrestling in front of small crowds.|$|E
25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>And</b> then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E
25|$|Now without {{income and}} any {{prospect}} {{of returning to}} Yugoslavia, Peter II and Alexandra resolved to leave Claridge's Hotel {{and moved to a}} mansion in the Borough of Runnymede. Abandoned by the British government, they settled for a time in France, between Paris and Monte Carlo, then in Switzerland at St. Moritz. Increasingly penniless, they ended up leaving Europe and in 1949, they settled in New York City, where the former King hoped to complete a financial project. Still penniless, the couple was forced to sell Alexandra's necklace of emeralds and others pieces of her jewelry to pay their accumulated debts. In addition to these difficulties was {{the fact that they were}} unable to manage a budget. As she herself wrote in her autobiography, Alexandra had no idea of the value <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> she quickly proved incapable of maintaining a home.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] she said, [...] "you {{ought to be}} rushing about amongst your supporters, keeping {{them up to the}} mark, and all that sort <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>And</b> in the second--" ...|$|R

25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E
500|$|Cropper's {{recollection}} {{is supported}} by a 1968 Rolling Stone interview with Hendrix: [...] "He [...] showed me how to play lots <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>and</b> I showed him how I played 'Have Mercy' or something like that".
