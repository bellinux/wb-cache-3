Mayor Jonathan Hornik estimates it could cost more than $11 million to clean up. Mayor Jonathan Hornik stated that the state clearly has the responsibility for cleaning up the site. He however, stated that in the interest <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> done, the township may have to show some flexibility in helping the state defray the costs. In addition to the contamination on the site, the old buildings from the hospital {{are now in a}} state of decay and are being demolished.|$|E
25|$|Henry Ford's ideological {{approach}} to Model T design was one <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> right and then keeping it the same; {{he believed the}} Model T was all the car a person would, or could, ever need. As other companies offered comfort and styling advantages, at competitive prices, the Model T lost market share. Design changes were not as few as the public perceived, {{but the idea of}} an unchanging model was kept intact. Eventually, on May 26, 1927, Ford Motor Company ceased US production and began the changeovers required to produce the Model A. Some of the other Model T factories in the world continued a short while.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of the}} {{expected}} value originated {{in the middle of}} the 17th century from the study of the so-called problem of points, which seeks to divide the stakes in a fair way between two players who have to end their game before it's properly finished. This problem had been debated for centuries, and many conflicting proposals and solutions had been suggested over the years, when it was posed in 1654 to Blaise Pascal by French writer and amateur mathematician Chevalier de Méré. de Méré claimed that this problem couldn't be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world. Pascal, being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and for all. He began to discuss the problem in a now famous series of letters to Pierre de Fermat. Soon enough they both independently came up with a solution. They solved the problem in different computational ways but their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle. The principle is that the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it.</b> This principle seemed to have come naturally to both of them. They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution and this in turn made them absolutely convinced they had solved the problem conclusively. However, they did not publish their findings. They only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it.|$|E

500|$|In 1929, Wade Dean {{formed the}} Glacier Mining Company and filed mining {{claims to the}} sulfur on Adams' [...] summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first {{assessment}} work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to drill through the up to [...] thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, {{it could not be}} carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made {{over the course of the}} mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned Forest Service lookout, a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed [...] lean-to was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above [...] could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of [...] recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of [...] This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit ice cap. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean’s desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959. [...] Adams is the only large Cascade volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24, Strahorn sought {{adventure}} and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876 as a war correspondent for the New York Times, Chicago Tribune and the Rocky Mountain News. Strahorn was embedded with General George Crook’s Big Horn and Yellowstone Expedition {{for over a year}} and reported the people and events of the Great Sioux War to the public. [...] “I insisted that I was going in to fight. It was my business as a correspondent to get the news, and I couldn’t think <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> from the rear.” At the time, war correspondents rode into battle with the troops. [...] General Cook said, “Strahorn worked as well with his rifle as with his pen.” [...] Strahorn was commended by Secretary of War for distinguished bravery and gallantry in action against hostile Indians during the Great Sioux War. Strahorn fought and reported the Horsemeat March, Battle of Powder River, Battle of the Rosebud, Battle of Slim Buttes, Dull Knife Fight and Battle of Wolf Mountain. [...] Strahorn also reported the Battle of the Little Big Horn and witnessed the surrender of Crazy Horse at Fort Robinson on May 6, 1877.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experiments}} of William Fairbairn, and {{the mathematical}} analysis of Eaton Hodgkinson had shown {{by a series}} of experiments that an enclosed box girder, made of riveted wrought iron, combined relative lightness with great strength. The tubular wrought-iron girder – be the cross-section rectangular, triangular or circular – formed a most efficient truss component. If the cross-section was large enough it could be self-supporting. It was Fairbairn's experiments that led to the design of the Menai and Conwy bridges. Stephenson had originally proposed using a box-girder section suspended from chains. The box section would, he argued, be stiff enough to overcome the conventional problems of the bridge-decks of suspension bridges. In the event, Fairbairn showed that a properly constructed box girder would be strong enough so that the chains could be dispensed with. Nevertheless, the decision (not to use chains) was taken late in the project, so the Britannia bridge support towers were still built with holes for the chains. Stephenson's box-girders were a great innovation, and using steel or pre-stressed concrete instead of wrought iron, box-girder construction is the standard today for large bridges. But as Berridge has observed, [...] "Brunel was never one to follow fashion for fashion's sake... (at Chepstow)... Here was the real engineer at work, designing the bridge to suit the site and the best way <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> into position".|$|E
