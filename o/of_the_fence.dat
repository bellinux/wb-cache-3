5|$|The border clearers' {{task was}} aided unofficially by German civilians {{from both sides}} of the former border, who {{scavenged}} the installations for fencing, wire and blocks of concrete to use in home improvements. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> was sold to a West German scrap-metal company. Environmental groups undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing grass seed to fill in the clear-cut area along the line.|$|E
5|$|The work of {{the guards}} {{involved}} carrying out repair work on the defences, monitoring the zone from watchtowers and bunkers and patrolling the line several times a day. Border Reconnaissance (Grenzaufklärungszug or GAK) soldiers, an elite reconnaissance force, carried out patrols and intelligence-gathering {{on the western side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Western visitors to the border were routinely photographed by the GAKs, who also oversaw work detachments maintaining the fence. The workers would be covered by machine guns to discourage them from attempting to escape.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little remains}} of the {{installations}} along the former inner German border. At least 30public, private and municipal museums along the old line present displays of equipment and other artifacts relating to the border. Among the preserved sites are several dozen watchtowers, short stretches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> and associated installations (some {{of which have been}} reconstructed), sections of the wall still in situ at Hötensleben and Mödlareuth, and a number of buildings related to the border, such as the GDR crossing point at Marienborn.|$|E

5|$|Monti {{was born}} in Abington, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1975, to Paul, a school teacher, and Janet Monti. He grew up in Raynham, Massachusetts and, even as a child, he {{demonstrated}} the adventurous character that would later earn him the Medal of Honor. As a four-year-old, he disappeared from the backyard one day, and his mother found him later on hanging by the hood of his sweatshirt {{on the other side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> On another occasion, a migraine headache kept him home from school, but he left the house and was later found climbing a tree. In 1994 he graduated from Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School at the age of 18. Monti had two siblings, a sister, Nicole and a brother, Timothy.|$|E
5|$|On April 28, 2014, {{pedestrian}} {{access to}} the station was partially cut off when the abutting landowner erected a fence on the station's primary access point, forcing riders to walk a short distance along the tracks to a different business lot, {{in an effort to}} stop commuters from parking on his business lots. He removed a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> for platform access after meeting with the MBTA, but disputed whether he was required to provide access and station facilities according to the terms of the 1960 land sale. Despite intervention by state legislators and a postcard campaign by residents, an agreement was not reached in 2014. In December 2014, the MBTA rejected a plan that would have created a pedestrian access path and a vehicle dropoff lane, alleging that the landowner had unfairly shifted property lines.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> the North Vietnamese transported and/or stored 70,000 tons of {{supplies}} in 3,000 trucks with {{a net loss of}} 13.5 percent during the year. During the same period about 80,000 PAVN troops made the trip south. A new North Vietnamese logistical effort, discovered by U.S. intelligence in late 1968, was a petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) pipeline running southwest from the North Vietnamese city of Vinh. By early the following year the pipeline had crossed the Laotian frontier and by summer it had reached Muong Nong and the approaches to the A Sầu Valley. The plastic line, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, could transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all in the same pipe.|$|E

25|$|Security {{precautions}} {{included a}} $17 million, 8-foot-high, 7.5-mile-long fence topped with barbed and razor wire, which encompassed the landward {{access to the}} resort; but no protests were reported from <b>the</b> suppliers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fencing</b> materials.|$|R

5|$|Leslie quickly seeks revenge against Lindsay {{by getting}} her parks {{employees}} to throw garbage over the Eagleton side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> When Lindsay arrives to stop it, the two {{get into a}} fight amid the garbage bags. The police arrive and arrest both women: Lindsay is jailed in Pawnee, while Leslie is jailed in Eagleton's pristine and hotel-like holding cell. After Ann bails Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built the fence because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a rise out of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with the fence serving as the outfield wall. Lindsay is impressed by how fast Leslie turned the fence into something positive, and remembers why she and Leslie joined the parks department in the first place. With their relationship on the mend, the two agree {{to get a drink}} together. Later, Leslie returns to the office to throw Ron's party: she takes him to an empty room with steak, whiskey and his favorite movies waiting for him, and reveals that April and Andy's duties were false leads to trick him. Leslie explains she made a party that he would want and leaves a content Ron alone to enjoy his birthday.|$|E
5|$|Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was {{introduced}} from 1962–1964, {{and a plan}} to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who {{said that they would}} damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978).|$|E
25|$|During the funeral, {{flowers were}} {{laid on the}} {{hillside}} above the grave. After the erection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> flowers were placed inside the enclosure, leaning against the uphill side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> A canvas-covered circular wooden walkway was built from Sheridan Drive to the grave site to give {{members of the public}} access to the grave.|$|E
50|$|Birmingham City Councillor Martin Mullaney later stated it was {{a failure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fencing</b> at Millennium Point which was the main problem, since the wind broke <b>the</b> solid-steel <b>fencing</b> down during <b>the</b> night, {{and it was then}} {{replaced}} with Heras fencing, as used on building sites, and extra security personnel.|$|R

25|$|Rapid {{access to}} {{all parts of the}} border line was {{required}} to ensure a quick response to escape attempts. This was initially a problem for the East Germans, as few patrol roads existed along the border in its early years. Patrols typically used a footpath that ran inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> alongside the control strip.|$|E

25|$|To be successful, a beaver dam pipe must {{eliminate}} {{the sound and}} feel of water flowing into the pipe. Successful pipe designs (e.g. Flexible Pond Leveler, Castor Master, Clemson Pond Leveler) achieve this by protecting the intake end of the pipe with a cylindrical fence enclosure. A beaver swimming along the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> enclosure is unable to hear or feel {{the flow of water}} into the pipe and cannot reach it to block it.|$|E
25|$|In {{complete}} {{contrast to}} the suspended phase of a gallop, when a horse jumps over a fence, the legs are stretched out while in the air, and the front legs hit the ground before the hind legs. Essentially, the horse takes the first two steps of a galloping stride on the take-off side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> {{and the other two}} steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its hindquarters after a jump to strike off into the next stride.|$|E
