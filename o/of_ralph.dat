5|$|Alice {{returned}} to the Holy Land in 1233. She allegedly renounced the County of Jaffa in favor of her son-in-law, Walter IV of Brienne, who married her daughter, Mary, in the same year, because Walter was styled Count of Jaffa from there on. Alice (who was about forty six) married Ralph of Nesle, a younger son <b>of</b> <b>Ralph,</b> Count of Soissons, who was less than thirty {{at the time of}} the marriage in 1240.|$|E
5|$|Chesney {{was the son}} of Robert fitzWalter and Sybil de Chesney, and {{a younger}} brother of John de Chesney. Sybil was the {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> de Chesney.

5|$|Dirty Duck {{received}} mostly negative reviews, {{with many}} criticizing it for its crude humor and others seeing {{the film as}} an attempt {{to cash in on the}} success <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> Bakshi's Fritz the Cat. The film fared better on home video and is now considered a cult film.|$|E
5|$|Historians differ {{over whether}} Walter ever married, but agree {{that he died}} childless. Michael Altschul lists no wife in {{his work on the}} Clares, and C. Warren Hollister, {{revising}} J. Horace Rounds entry in the Dictionary of National Biography for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, states that it is unclear if Walter married. Jennifer Ward, however, states that Walter married Isabella, a daughter <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> de Tosny. Katharine Keats-Rohan states that Walter married Isabel, a daughter <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> de Tosny, and states that his widow gave an endowment to the cathedral chapter of Salisbury Cathedral for the sake of Walter's soul. Walter was alive at Easter in 1136, but died after that date. The obituary for Walter from Tintern gives his death date as 10 March, but does not state a year. A date of 1138 is usually given for his death; though this has not been proven, it is likely. His estates passed to his nephew Gilbert de Clare, son of his brother Gilbert, who had died around 1115.|$|E
5|$|Neville's first wife, Joan de Cornhill, {{died after}} December 1224. Some time before April 1230 he married {{secondly}} Beatrice, the widow <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> de Fay {{and one of}} the five daughters of Stephen of Turnham. Joan and Neville had at least three sons– John, Henry, and Herbert. Neville also had a daughter named Joan.|$|E

Both were closely associated with Mathew Cradock's nephew, Samuel Cradock (a pupil of Whichcote's), whose brother Zachary was Provost of Eton College. Cudworth, Whichcote and Samuel Cradock had all been students at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} {{continued through}} the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> Vaughan Williams in 1952–61. In 1975 Marcel Broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.|$|E
5|$|Time {{magazine}} named Chastain {{one of the}} 100 {{most influential}} {{people in the world}} in 2012. That same year, she was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and she endorsed an Yves Saint Laurent fragrance called Manifesto. In 2015, she became the global ambassador for the Swiss jewelry and watchmaking company Piaget SA, and in 2017, she was made the face <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> Lauren's fragrance campaign, named Woman.|$|E

5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, {{then as a}} student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted that he was the Second Coming of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880.|$|E
5|$|During Princess Elizabeth's 1950 tour of Canada, she {{was promised}} a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, the {{arrangements}} {{to be made}} by Peter Scott. Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in British Columbia as they had been fed for decades by conservationist Ralph Edwards. In 1952, with the help <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos). One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Jim Henson's {{work was}} aimed at mature audiences. His {{television}} program Sam and Friends was designed for young adults. During this period, his characters often appeared on late-night, comedy television programs The Jimmy Dean Show and The Ed Sullivan Show. Throughout the 1960s, Jim Henson used his puppets for profane, irreverent comedy. These early Henson creations made references to substance abuse and sexual intercourse; The A.V. Club said Henson was probably influenced by the work <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> Bakshi, who was also active during the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|In the 1993 provincial election, Stelmach {{was elected}} as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vegreville-Viking (later Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville). A Progressive Conservative, {{he served in}} the {{cabinets}} <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> Klein—at various times holding the portfolios of Intergovernmental Relations, Transportation, Infrastructure, and Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development—where he developed a reputation as a low-key politician who avoided the limelight. When Klein resigned the party's leadership in 2006, Stelmach {{was among the first to}} present his candidature to replace him. After a third-place finish on the first ballot of the leadership race, he won an upset second ballot victory over former provincial treasurer Jim Dinning.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{was the son}} <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> de Neville, a son of Alan de Neville, who {{was also}} Chief Forester. Hugh had a brother, Roger de Neville, {{who was part of}} Hugh's {{household}} from 1202 to 1213, when Roger was given custody of Rockingham Castle by King John. Another brother was William, who was given some of Hugh's lands in 1217. Hugh, Roger, and William were related to a number of other royal officials and churchmen, most notable among them Geoffrey de Neville, who was a royal chamberlain, and Ralph Neville, who became Bishop of Chichester. Hugh de Neville employed Ralph de Neville at the start of Ralph's career, and the two appear to have remained on good terms throughout the rest of Hugh's life.|$|E
5|$|Pain was a son, {{probably}} the eldest, of John fitzRichard, a tenant-in-chief listed in Domesday Book. John {{may have had}} two wives, therefore the identity of Pain's mother is uncertain. On the basis of landholding, it has been speculated that Pain's mother was a daughter <b>of</b> <b>Ralph</b> Mortimer, who held Wigmore in Domesday Book. As well as being a moneyer, Pain's paternal grandfather, who came from near Avranches in Normandy, owned a mill. Pain's brother, Eustace fitzJohn, became a royal official who owned lands {{in the north of}} England. His other siblings included William, Alice and Agnes. William was {{probably the}} same William who later held Harptree in Somerset, and in 1130 was a royal justice in western England. Alice was the abbess of Barking Abbey and Agnes became the wife of Roger de Valognes.|$|E
