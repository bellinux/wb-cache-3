5|$|Estimates {{for total}} death toll range from 55 to 153. Death toll {{estimates}} for Texas range from 17 to 38, though official records {{indicate that the}} 38 deaths occurred in Mexico rather than Texas. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> in Mexico, where records are less complete, vary more widely. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> in Texas were homeless people attempting to enter the United States, {{and as a result}} their deaths were not counted. Monetary damage figures are not available, but it is known that flooding from Alice caused considerable damage to crops, primarily cotton.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, many {{questions}} have been raised concerning the application and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty. Ironically, <b>the</b> Catholic Church, a long-time supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty, has become one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most vocal critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty. In this Essay, Father Robert F.

A small number of Saeghe-2s (Iranian-made version of M47 Dragon) were also used in the war.|$|E

Its PAGASA name, Milenyo, was also retired by PAGASA. In December 2007, the {{committee}} selected the name Leepi to replace Xangsane on the Western Pacific basin name lists beginning in 2008. In 2010 the name selected by PAGASA to replace Milenyo was Mario, but the name itself was retired and was replaced with Maymay after devastating Metro Manila and Northern Luzon.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E

The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> were the results of landslides and flooding in various areas in the country. Across the country, 243houses were destroyed, and 191 more were damaged.|$|E

5|$|High {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} recorded in the Serengeti. In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths.</b> The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of those}} who died (comprising 78% of the {{fugitive}} victims) were young men aged between 16 and 30.
