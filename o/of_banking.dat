5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} the debt crisis varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt as a result <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as a currency union (i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of European leaders to respond. European banks own {{a significant amount of}} sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Bank</b> erosion {{consists}} <b>of</b> two processes: basal erosion due to fluvial {{hydraulic force}} and bank failure {{under the influence}} <b>of</b> gravity. Because <b>bank</b> resistance force varies with the degree <b>of</b> saturation <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> material, the probability <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure is the probability of the driving force <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure being greater than the bank resistance force. The degree <b>of</b> saturation <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> material increases with river stage; therefore, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure is correlated to the frequency of flooding. Consequently, the rate <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> erosion is due to both basal erosion and bank failure, and bank failure is a probabilistic phenomenon. In this paper, for cohesive bank material experiencing planar bank failure, a deterministic approach was adopted for basal erosion analysis, whereas the probability <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure {{was included in the}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure. A method for calculating the rate <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> erosion was derived that integrates both basal erosion and bank failure processes, and accounts for the effects <b>of</b> hydraulic force, <b>bank</b> geometry, bank material properties, and probability <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure...|$|R

5|$|The daric also {{improved}} {{government revenues}} as {{the introduction of}} the daric made it easier to collect new taxes on land, livestock and marketplaces.

One of the most famous banking firms was Murashu Sons, based in the Babylonian city of Nippur. These banking firms provided loans and credit to clients.|$|E

5|$|In January 1837, Smith {{and other}} church leaders created a joint stock company, called the Kirtland Safety Society, {{to act as}} a quasi-bank; the company issued bank notes {{capitalized}} in part by real estate. Smith encouraged the Latter Day Saints to buy the notes, and he invested heavily in them himself, but the bank failed within a month. As a result, the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility. Smith was held responsible for the failure, and there were widespread defections from the church, including many of Smith's closest advisers. After a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest on a charge <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> fraud, Smith and Rigdon fled Kirtland for Missouri in January 1838.|$|E

The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed {{as chairman of the}} House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion <b>of</b> <b>banking,</b> protect the state militia, and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.|$|E

5|$|The British colonial {{government}} did not support industrialisation in the region, and local capital remained invested mostly in land and money lending, {{which led to the}} later development <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> in the region. With the arrival of European missionaries in the early 19th century, the region saw the development of educational institutions and a modern industrial base, modelled on European industries. The opening of the Lutheran Swiss Basel Mission in 1834 was central to the industrialisation process. Printing press, cloth-weaving mills and factories manufacturing Mangalore tiles were set up by the missionaries. When Canara (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was bifurcated into North Canara and South Canara in 1859, Mangalore was transferred into South Canara and became its headquarters. South Canara remained under Madras Presidency, while North Canara was detached from Madras Presidency and transferred to Bombay Presidency in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E

5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E
