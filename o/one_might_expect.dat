5|$|The {{synaptic}} tag hypothesis {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone {{is insufficient to}} induce LTP at either synapse), both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> that {{inertial}} motions, once {{identified by}} observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used}} to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E

25|$|A verse {{narrative}}, as <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect,</b> {{is simply}} a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to {{its place in the}} flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to Gilgamesh, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.|$|E

25|$|One {{feature of}} a plant is its phyllotaxy.

The abphyl gene was later on shown to encode a cytokinin response regulator protein.|$|E

25|$|Two years later, in 1562, another {{writer from}} the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, {{published}} the Cudesch da Psalms, {{a collection of}} church songs in the Vallader dialect.

Because of this, the linguist Ricarda Liver assumes that these written works built on an earlier, pre-literature tradition of using Romansh in administrative and legal situations, of which no evidence survives.
