5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum {{produced by a}} prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> debt to corpuscular alchemy.|$|E
5|$|Once Nate {{emerges from}} the vessel, he and Sully are confronted by another {{treasure}} hunter named Gabriel Roman (Simon Templeman), to whom Sully <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> great deal of money. Backed by his partner, archaeologist Atoq Navarro (Robin Atkin Downes), Roman forces Nate {{to hand over the}} page and shoots Sully dead when he tries to intervene. Before he can kill Nate, a loose torpedo charge previously accidentally triggered by Nate causes the U-boat to explode, distracting the gang long enough for Drake to escape. He runs into Elena, who agrees to help him find the statue, and together they use Sully's plane to travel to the old colony.|$|E
5|$|According to Keisuke Iwata, {{the global}} spread of Japanese {{animation}} dramatically expanded {{due to the}} popularity of Evangelion. After {{the success of the}} show, otaku culture gained wide attention. In Japan, Evangelion prompted a review of the cultural value of anime, and with its success, anime reached a new point of maturity. With the interest in the series, otaku culture became a mass social phenomenon. The show's regular reruns increased the number of otaku, which John Lynden links to a boom in interest in literature on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Kabbalah and Christianity. Anime director Makoto Shinkai declared that the genre of anime <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> cinematographic debt to Evangelion. In the aftermath of Evangelion, Anno reused many of its stylistic conceits in the live-action Love & Pop and the anime romance Kare Kano. Neon Genesis Evangelion also influenced some music artists, such as the UK band Fightstar and its debut album, Grand Unification, and the Japanese band Rey, which derived its name from the character of Rei Ayanami.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the frieze may be sought in the Attic relief {{sculpture}} of the late fifth century; this resonance also may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> debt to the Parthenon. There also are traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the “cat stele” from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135–6. As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy. Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and many pieces of the Hadrianic generation.|$|E
5|$|Yogesh is {{successful}} {{and living in}} Chicago. He gets a text message from Jitu that his father (Anjan Srivastav) had a heart attack, and rushes to Mumbai. When he arrives, Yogesh learns that Jitu had lied to him about their father, but that Jitu <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> rich man 25 million rupees for gambling debts; if Yogesh does not marry on the 20th of the month, Jitu will go to jail. At first Yogesh is adamant he will not marry, but Jitu tells him that he also borrowed 15 million rupees from a mob boss; his parents are unaware of this. Yogesh is annoyed, but agrees to marry after the gangster threatens them. When Uncle Devu (Darshan Jariwala) posts an ad with Yogesh's photo, 176 girls reply. Yogesh decides that he will meet one girl from each zodiac sign. Meanwhile, Devu's wife asks Yogesh's father to hire a detective – she suspects that Devu is cheating on her. When Yogesh's father learns that the astrologer is also a detective, he hires him. The detective identifies Devu's mistress as a woman named Anila Kamdar.|$|E

25|$|An iconostasis, {{also called}} the templon, is a wall of icons and {{religious}} paintings, separating the nave from the sanctuary in a church. Iconostasis also refers to a portable icon stand that can be placed anywhere within a church. The modern iconostasis evolved from the Byzantine templon in the 11th century. The evolution of the iconostasis probably <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> great deal to 14th-century Hesychast mysticism and the wood-carving genius of the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there were}} several grounds in the appeal, the main {{proposition}} for which the judgment is traditionally cited is that directors do not <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> general duty to shareholders, although they may <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> specific duty to a shareholder {{if there has been}} an assumption of responsibility. In this case there was no suggestion of such an assumption of responsibility, and so the claims were struck out.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{appearance}} {{of an action}} film, Blade Runner operates on an unusually rich number of dramatic levels.

25|$|There {{is nothing}} to prevent a debtor from having his estate sequestrated by an amicable creditor. The debtor may, for instance, arrange with a friend to whom he <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> debt, and whom {{he is unable to}} pay, that he (the debtor) will commit an act of insolvency. (He will, for instance, write a letter saying that he cannot meet the debt.) The friend will then apply for {{compulsory}} sequestration on the strength of this act of insolvency. An application for compulsory sequestration brought by a creditor who is not at arm’s length is generally referred to as “friendly” sequestration.|$|E

50|$|The {{duty of care}} <b>owed</b> to <b>a</b> rescuer is {{separate}} from that owed to those he is rescuing.

25|$|The {{controversy}} over Article 23 began in mid-2002 when Qian Qichen, Vice Premier of the State Council, expressed Beijing's desire for Hong Kong {{to pass the}} required legislation quickly. This prompted the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee Hwa {{to begin the process}} of drafting the said legislation. Many in Hong Kong believe that Tung's responsiveness to this request, in contrast to what is commonly perceived to be his lack of desire, was due in part to the fact that Tung himself <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> personal debt to the PRC government: his family's shipping conglomerate Orient Overseas was bailed out for the sum of US $110 million by Chinese government-owned companies in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|In the 1580s, Pilon {{began work}} on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb of Catherine de' Medici and Henry II at the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis. Among these, the fragmentary Resurrection, now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel. This work <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> clear debt to Michelangelo, who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the Medici chapels in Florence. Pilon openly depicted extreme emotion in his work, sometimes {{to the point of}} the grotesque. His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the French wars of religion.|$|E
25|$|Torquay's initial {{development}} <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal}} {{to the efforts of}} Sir Lawrence Palk, 2nd Baronet, owner of the manor of Tormohun. It was on his initiative that the first real development in the town commenced taking the form of the erection of a new harbour to replace the dilapidated old harbour, for which an Act of Parliament was required. The work commenced in 1803, was completed in 1807, and was designed by John Rennie who later designed London Bridge. Proposals were also put forth {{for the construction of a}} canal to Newton Abbot at the same time as the harbour development, but nothing came of this. The entire cost of the work was estimated at roughly £27,000, a costly sum in the mid nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Enrico Fermi High School was {{considered}} for {{the location of the}} consolidated high school. However, the facility's location on a corner lot prevented further expansion without expanding onto the newly renovated fields. Furthermore, the school's contaminated soils were capped in 2007. If expansion were to occur, the town would have to incur millions of dollars in expense for the remediation of the contaminated soils on the Enrico Fermi High School location. Enfield High School's campus allowed for a sizable expansion of the building. Additionally, the town still <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> bond for the 2005 library expansion.

25|$|High Tech {{architecture}} also <b>owes</b> <b>a</b> debt to Constructivism, {{most obviously}} in Richard Rogers' Lloyd's building. Zaha Hadid's early projects were adaptations of Malevich's Architektons, {{and the influence}} of Chernikhov is clear on her drawings. Deconstructivism evokes the dynamism of Constructivism, though without the social aspect, as in the work of Coop Himmelb(l)au. In the late 1970s Rem Koolhaas wrote a parable on the political trajectory of Constructivism called The Story of the Pool, in which Constructivists escape from the USSR in a self-powering Modernist swimming pool, only to die, after being criticised for much the same reasons as they were under Stalinism, soon after their arrival in the USA. Meanwhile, many of the original Constructivist buildings are poorly preserved or in danger of imminent demolition.|$|E
