40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{reports on}} the results of recent {{research}} and development efforts to study and assess various impacts of ferroresonance phenomenon on operating performance of power transformers and to investigate ways to mitigate the effects of such phenomenon. Three-phase core-type transformers are used in the study. The results of the technical investigation and the associated ferroresonance experimental work performed showed that ferroresonance can cause dangerous overvoltages and <b>overcurrents</b> in three-phase core-type transformers. Sensitivity analysis results are also presented to determine the impact of various design and operating parameters on the resulting overvoltages and <b>overcurrents</b> caused by ferroresonance...|$|R
25|$|The various {{protective}} functions {{available on}} a given relay are denoted by standard ANSI device numbers. For example, a relay including function 51 would be a timed <b>overcurrent</b> protective relay.|$|E
25|$|Some {{manufacturers}} of medium-voltage distribution fuses combine the <b>overcurrent</b> protection {{characteristics of the}} fusible element with the flexibility of relay protection by adding a pyrotechnic device to the fuse operated by external protective relays.|$|E
25|$|An RCD {{does not}} provide {{protection}} against unexpected or dangerously high current (called spikes or surges) when current is in the usual wires in the circuit, therefore it cannot replace a fuse or protect against overheating or fire risk due to <b>overcurrent</b> (overload) or short circuits if the fault {{does not lead to}} current leakage. Therefore, RCDs are often used or integrated as a single product along with some kind of circuit breaker, such as a fuse or miniature circuit breaker (MCB), which adds protection in the event of excessive current in the circuit (the resulting RCD with <b>overcurrent</b> protection called an RCBO). RCDs also cannot detect the situation where a human accidentally touches both conductors at the same time, since the current through an expected device, an unexpected route, or a human, are indistinguishable if the current returns through the expected conductor.|$|E
2500|$|Current {{transformers}} in a differential scheme must {{be chosen}} to have near-identical response to high <b>overcurrents.</b> If a [...] "through fault" [...] results in {{one set of}} current transformers saturating before another, the zone differential protection will see a false [...] "operate" [...] current and may false trip.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} control {{electric}} kart DC motor and protect power converter from dangerous <b>overcurrents,</b> a regulator is needed. MSP 430 series microcontroller {{was used to}} develop a closed loop current regulator. The implemented control method is PI regulator. Step-response experiments were carried out to evaluate regulator performance...|$|R

25|$|In a {{multi-phase}} power circuit, if {{only one}} fuse opens, the remaining phases will have higher than normal currents, and unbalanced voltages, with possible damage to motors. Fuses only sense <b>overcurrent,</b> or to a degree, over-temperature, and cannot usually be used independently with protective relaying to provide more advanced protective functions, for example, ground fault detection.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiter, temperature sensors (Negative Temperature Coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting <b>overcurrent</b> protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (Positive Temperature Coefficient or PTC type typically).|$|E
25|$|Residual-current and <b>overcurrent</b> {{protection}} may {{be combined}} in one device for installation into the service panel; this device {{is known as a}} GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) breaker in the USA and Canada, and as an RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overload protection) in Europe. In the US, GFCI breakers are more expensive than GFCI outlets.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{penetration}} of solar photovoltaic (PV) can cause significant overvoltages during faults and back-fed fault current into grid while causing miss-operation of protective relaying. Transient data from four single-phase PV inverters was collected during both open-circuit and short circuit transient events. Each inverter was tested at four different output power levels and multiple tests were run for each case {{to account for}} point-on-wave effects on the transient magnitudes. Test program designs are presented to cover a range of inverter operating conditions and grid configurations. The data was used to plot the overvoltages and <b>overcurrents</b> associated with the transient events. In some cases, the inverters can produce transient overvoltages > 1. 6 p. u. and transient <b>overcurrents</b> > 14 p. u. In addition, theoretical magnitudes of transient overvoltages can {{be compared with the}} laboratory result. ...|$|R
5000|$|Ferroresonance or {{nonlinear}} resonance {{is a type}} of resonance in electric circuits {{which occurs}} when a circuit containing a nonlinear inductance is fed from a source that has series capacitance, and the circuit is subjected to a disturbance such as opening of a switch. [...] It can cause overvoltages and <b>overcurrents</b> in an electrical power system and can pose a risk to transmission and distribution equipment and to operational personnel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{there are}} {{evaluated}} the power systems transients phenomena which {{appear at the}} 380 kV no-loaded line switching. In point of news, the paper presents the modelling and simulation of a no-load three-phase line switching effect in Power System, using PSCAD Program and MathCAD Program. There were obtained the transient recovery voltages (TRV) and the <b>overcurrents</b> (OC) in the 380 kV network and the electrical field (EF), according with the overvoltages (OV) at 380 kV. After that, a comparatively analyze of results is made. The paper presents the Electrical Field values, according to modelled and simulated disturbances. The simulation was performed using the EMTDC/PSCAD software package, {{in order to obtain}} the transient overvoltages, the <b>overcurrents</b> and the electrical fields in the transmission line and in the busbars. Also in the paper are presented experiments performed for determination of switching overvoltages at the 400 kV no-load lines switching in a Romanian network. After that, a comparative analysis of results regarding switching overvoltages determined through modelling and experiments is made and conclusions about admissible limits recommended by the CIGRE and IEEE international norms are established...|$|R
25|$|While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be {{shielded}} from ambient light {{to prevent their}} destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. Another option is to add <b>overcurrent</b> protection in the external circuit, {{so that when the}} measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Some {{companies}} manufacture resettable miniature thermal circuit breakers, which screw into a fuse socket. Some installations {{use these}} Edison-base circuit breakers. However, any such breaker sold today does have one flaw. It may {{be installed in}} a circuit-breaker box with a door. If so, if the door is closed, the door may hold down the breaker's reset button. While in this state, the breaker is effectively useless: it does not provide any <b>overcurrent</b> protection.|$|E
25|$|So-called self-resetting fuses use a {{thermoplastic}} conductive element {{known as}} a Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient (or PPTC) thermistor that impedes the circuit during an <b>overcurrent</b> condition (by increasing device resistance). The PPTC thermistor is self-resetting in that when current is removed, the device will cool and revert to low resistance. These devices are often used in aerospace/nuclear applications where replacement is difficult, or on a computer motherboard so that a shorted mouse or keyboard does not cause motherboard damage.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{application}} of Symmetrical Components to time-dependent variables was introduced by Lyon in 1954, for many years its application was essentially restricted to electric machines. Recently, thanks to its advantages, the Lyon transformation is also applied to power network calculation. In this paper, time-dependent symmetrical components are used to study the dynamic analysis of asymmetrical faults in a power system. The Lyon approach allows the calculation of the maximum values of overvoltages and <b>overcurrents</b> under transient conditions and to study network under non-sinusoidal conditions. Finally, some examples with longitudinal asymmetrical faults are illustrated...|$|R
40|$|An {{additional}} {{control scheme}} {{has been proposed}} in this paper for a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), to protect it against load short circuit conditions. When <b>overcurrents</b> occur in the distribution system, under the proposed scheme the DVR reverses its injected voltage polarity so as to minimise the current flow. The detection method is based on impedance measurement feedback. The advantage of the scheme is that no additional over current device or protection {{is required for the}} DVR and it is easy to implement. The proposed control scheme has been validated through simulation...|$|R
25|$|Thermal {{magnetic}} circuit breakers, {{which are the}} type found in most distribution boards, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger <b>overcurrents</b> but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no intentional additional delay.|$|R
25|$|A residual-current {{circuit breaker}} cannot remove all risk of {{electric}} shock or fire. In particular, an RCD alone will not detect overload conditions, phase-to-neutral short circuits or phase-to-phase short circuits (see three-phase electric power). Over-current protection (fuses or circuit breakers) must be provided. Circuit breakers that combine the functions of an RCD with <b>overcurrent</b> protection respond to both types of fault. These are known as RCBOs and are available in 2-, 3- and 4-pole configurations. RCBOs will typically have separate circuits for detecting current imbalance and for overload current but use a common interrupting mechanism.|$|E
25|$|A {{varistor}} {{provides no}} equipment protection from inrush current surges (during equipment startup), from <b>overcurrent</b> (created {{by a short}} circuit), or from voltage sags (also known as a brownout); it neither senses nor affects such events. Susceptibility of electronic equipment to these other power disturbances is defined by {{other aspects of the}} system design, either inside the equipment itself or externally by means such as a UPS, a voltage regulator or a surge protector with built-in overvoltage protection (which typically consists of a voltage-sensing circuit and a relay for disconnecting the AC input when the voltage reaches a danger threshold).|$|E
25|$|In an <b>overcurrent</b> condition, a {{value of}} current will be reached that overcomes the control spring {{pressure}} on the spindle and the braking magnet, causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact. This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut {{into the side of}} the disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.|$|E
30|$|Microgrids {{consist of}} {{distributed}} generators (DG), storage devices, controllable loads and protection units, {{and they usually}} operate in low or medium voltage networks. Microgrids can operate interconnected to the power grid, or islanded, offering considerable control capabilities over the network operation [1, 2]. The transition between two modes may give rise to harmful transient <b>overcurrents.</b> In general, a smooth connection is achieved when the voltages of the systems to be connected coincide in magnitude, phase and the frequency. In microgrid applications, synchronization before reconnection is usually accomplished by detecting the voltage magnitude, phase and frequency difference between the main grid and the microgrid [3, 4].|$|R
40|$|A {{protection}} engineer must {{anticipate a}} variety of situations that might interfere with normal operation of a power system. Among the most commonly encountered abnormal conditions are line faults and their resultant <b>overcurrents,</b> transient overvoltages, and system overloads. "Power system protection" is the composite of all the measures [...] taken on a given system to minimize {{the effects of the}} abnormal conditions. All of the conditions cannot be prevented from occurring at all times, but they can be controlled and contained-by protecting equipment and lines from damage to the fullest extent that technology and economics permit, and by limiting any service interrupts to consumers...|$|R
40|$|A {{precision}} analog {{electronic circuit}} that {{is capable of}} sending accurate signals to an external device that has hostile electric characteristics, including the presence of very large common mode voltages. The circuit is also capable of surviving applications of normal mode overvoltages of up to 120 VAC/VDC for unlimited periods of time without damage or degradation. First, the circuit isolates the DC signal output from the computer. Means are then provided for amplifying the isolated DC signal. Further means are provided for stabilizing and protecting the isolating and amplifying means, and the isolated and amplified DC signal which is output to the external device, against overvoltages and <b>overcurrents...</b>|$|R
25|$|Medium-voltage circuit {{breakers}} rated between 1 and 72 kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, {{or may be}} individual components installed outdoors in a substation. Air-break {{circuit breakers}} replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5 kV). Like the high voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current sensors and protective relays, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic <b>overcurrent</b> sensors.|$|E
25|$|Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, {{but this}} can be {{hazardous}} as {{it is easy to}} put a higher-rated or double fuse element (link or wire) into the holder (overfusing), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even a totally different type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, paper clips, nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated <b>overcurrent</b> protection and resulted in a dangerous condition. Such tampering will not be visible without full inspection of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.|$|E
25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the <b>overcurrent</b> protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E
40|$|Ferroresonance is {{a complex}} {{non-linear}} electrical phenomenon that can make thermal and dielectric problems to the electric power equipment. Ferroresonance causes <b>overcurrents</b> and overvoltages which is dangerous for electrical equipment. In this paper, ferroresonance investigation {{will be carried out}} for the 33 kV/ 110 V VT at PMU Kota Kemuning, Malaysia using ATP-EMTP simulation. Different preconditions of ferroresonance modes were simulated to ascertain possible ferroresonance conditions in reality compare with simulated values. The effect of changing the values of series capacitor is considered. The purpose of this series of simulations is to determine the range of the series capacitance value within which the ferroresonance is likely to occur...|$|R

For this reason, it is important to put great emphases on their quality and user safety. This thesis deals with principle of the circuit breaker, its function, construction requirements and requirements for the type test, which the manufacturer needs to pass before release the device on market. These requrements are listed in Czech Technical Standard ČSN EN 60898 - 1. In this thesis, specific type of circuit breaker will be also described. Some sequences of tests described in the standard will be performed on that breaker...|$|R
