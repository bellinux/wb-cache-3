40|$|Consumption <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> {{beverages}} is a world-wide phenomenon. The use <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages {{in different}} parts of the world is influenced by economic, social, religious, and traditional forces, therefore countries differ significantly in the amount and type of alcohol consumed and in the temporal trends <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages. Italy and the United States are two examples of these differences: Italy is among the world's top producers and consumers of wine, while, in the USA, beer and spirits are more frequently consumed. In addition to differences in the amount and type <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages, Italians and Americans differ significantly in the way the alcoholic beverages are consumed, in particular in relation to the consumption of wine in relation to meals. These differences in the consumption <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages between countries can be used to analyze and better understand the health effects <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages on both individuals and populations...|$|R
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent <b>of</b> <b>alcoholics</b> will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3â€“6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter <b>of</b> <b>alcoholics</b> experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E
