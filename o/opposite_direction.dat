5|$|The term Cyclone {{was coined}} by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to {{describe}} the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the term {{for the kind of}} weather around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> of a cyclone. In British English, the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E
5|$|In November 1999, a bus {{travelling}} on {{the route}} from Manchester to Barnoldswick {{was involved in a}} crash with a car travelling in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> in Earby. Four passengers and the car driver suffered minor injuries.|$|E
50|$|Mirror pairs {{are rare}} teams that perform {{side-by-side}} elements in <b>opposite</b> rotational <b>directions.</b> One such pair was Kristi Yamaguchi (counterclockwise) and Rudy Galindo (clockwise). Jill Watson (counter-clockwise) and Peter Oppegard (clockwise) also jumped in <b>opposite</b> <b>directions.</b> More recently, Tiffany Vise (clockwise) and Derek Trent (counter-clockwise) also rotate in <b>opposite</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Contrary {{motion is}} motion in <b>opposite</b> <b>directions.</b> That is, {{when one of}} the lines moves up, the other line moves down (that is, in inversion). If the voices always move by the same {{intervals}} (in <b>opposite</b> <b>directions)</b> they are said to be in strict contrary motion.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} signings {{were made by}} Arsenal in the summer {{transfer}} window, namely defenders Sylvinho and Oleh Luzhny, and striker Thierry Henry, who joined from Juventus on a club record fee. Davor Šuker departed Real Madrid to sign for Arsenal, following Nicolas Anelka's move in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction.</b> Steve Bould left Arsenal to play for Sunderland, while Stephen Hughes signed for Everton in the spring.|$|E
5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of}} the line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E

5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> to {{the rotation of the}} rest of the galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E
5|$|Austria and {{the states}} of the Habsburg monarchy officially had a {{different}} standard since 1761, and Prussia, followed by its neighbours Anhalt, Lippe and Mecklenburg, would diverge in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> with a reform in 1816. But in both cases apothecaries continued to use the Nuremberg standard unofficially {{for a long time after}} it became illegal.|$|E
5|$|If k is close, but not equal, to one, {{the second}} orbit resembles the first, but {{revolves}} gradually about {{the center of}} force; {{this is known as}} orbital precession (Figure3). If k is greater than one, the orbit precesses {{in the same direction as}} the orbit (Figure3); if k is less than one, the orbit precesses in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

5|$|Notts County's fate {{went in the}} <b>opposite</b> <b>direction.</b> They were relegated in bottom {{place the}} season after the 1996 {{play-off}} final defeat, only to win the 1997–98 Third Division title and gain instant promotion. However, they have spent every season since in the bottom two divisions. The two clubs did not meet again in league football until January 2008 after City's fall back down the league structure.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while {{a thick layer of}} fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Schaffer in Social Development (1996) {{suggests}} that the father–child relationship is primarily a cultural construction shaped by the requirements of each society. In societies where the care of infants has been assigned to boys rather than girls, no difference in nurturing capacity was found. Other studies, however, point in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap {{may be involved in}} the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> in the fall. Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.|$|E

5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E
5|$|Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet (13 October 1877– 12 October 1936) was an English cricketer {{best known}} for inventing the googly, a {{delivery}} designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, {{it appears to be}} a leg break, but after pitching the ball turns in the <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> to that which is expected, behaving as an off break instead. Bosanquet, who played first-class cricket for Middlesex between 1898 and 1919, appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all-rounder. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1905.|$|E
