5|$|Pichilemu was {{inhabited}} by Promaucaes, a pre-Columbian tribal group, until the Spanish conquest <b>of</b> <b>Chile.</b> They were hunter-gatherers and fishermen who lived primarily along the Cachapoal and Maule rivers.

5|$|Aureliano Oyarzún, {{professor}} of pathology at University <b>of</b> <b>Chile,</b> investigated pre-Ceramic middens from Pichilemu and Cahuil. His book Crónicas de Pichilemu–Cáhuil (Chronicles of Pichilemu–Cáhuil) was published posthumously, in 1957. Tomás Guevara published two volumes of Historia de Chile, Chile Prehispánico (History <b>of</b> <b>Chile,</b> Pre-Hispanic Chile) in 1929, which discusses the indigenous centre of Apalta, the Pichilemu middens, the Malloa petroglyphs, a stone cup from Nancagua, and pottery finds in Peralillo.|$|E

5|$|The Captaincy General <b>of</b> <b>Chile</b> {{followed}} a process analogous {{to that of}} the May Revolution, and elected a Government Junta that inaugurated the brief period known as Patria Vieja. The Junta was defeated in 1814 at the Battle of Rancagua, and the subsequent Reconquista <b>of</b> <b>Chile</b> would make it a royalist stronghold once more. The Andes provided an effective natural barrier between the Argentine revolutionaries and Chile, so there was no military confrontation between them until the Crossing of the Andes, led by José de San Martín in 1817, a campaign that resulted in the defeat of the Chilean royalists.|$|E
5|$|The Chilean Civil War (1891), {{rather than}} calming the naval ambitions <b>of</b> <b>Chile,</b> {{escalated}} them. In that conflict, the Chilean Navy {{played a significant}} role on the congressional side against the president and the army. The resulting victory of the congressional side and subsequent presidency of Admiral Jorge Montt led to a large increase in prestige and consequent funding for the navy. Argentine naval units assisted failed revolts in Argentina, but the continuing acrimony with and naval acquisitions <b>of</b> <b>Chile</b> meant this had little effect.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} {{territory}} <b>of</b> <b>Chile</b> is subject to earthquakes, arising from strains in the subducting Nazca and South American Plates or shallow strike-slip faults.

Some earthquakes which occurred near the epicentre of the 11 March 2010 event are the 1985 Algarrobo and Rapel Lake earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|The Pichilemu {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by the change in regional stress from the 27February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University <b>of</b> <b>Chile</b> Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University <b>of</b> <b>Chile</b> also reached.|$|E
