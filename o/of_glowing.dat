In the discharge channel the electric field driven by space charges is solved by PIC method, and various collisions between particles are described with MCC method.

25|$|The massive flow of {{electric}} current occurring during the return stroke {{combined with the}} rate at which it occurs (measured in microseconds) rapidly superheats the completed leader channel, forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel. The core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 K, causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches <b>of</b> <b>glowing</b> gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful shock wave which is heard as thunder.|$|E

500|$|Almost all magma {{created by}} the hotspot is igneous [...] basalt; the volcanoes are {{constructed}} almost entirely of this or the similar in composition but coarser-grained gabbro and diabase. Other igneous rocks such as nephelinite are present in small quantities; these occur often on the older volcanoes, most prominently Detroit Seamount. Most eruptions are runny because basaltic magma is less viscous than magmas characteristic of more explosive eruptions such as the andesitic magmas that produce spectacular and dangerous eruptions around Pacific Basin margins. Volcanoes fall into several eruptive categories. Hawaiian volcanoes are called [...] "Hawaiian-type".

500|$|As the {{avalanche}} and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to {{a height of}} [...] above the expanding crater in less than 10minutes and spread tephra into the stratosphere for 10 straight hours. Near the volcano, the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated lightning, which in turn started many forest fires. During this time, parts of the mushroom-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens' flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted <b>of</b> <b>glowing</b> pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash.

500|$|The [...] are a {{small group}} of immortal beings, often called (by both {{themselves}} and others) [...] Referred to as gods by some, but unknown to the major religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a vital role in the history of Ivalice such as the creation of the Espers and granting power to King Raithwall to conquer the countries of Ivalice with the Dawn, Dusk, and Midlight shards of nethicite. The Occuria were first designed to be a race of Mindflayers, a type of enemy monster in the game. Earlier concept artwork portrayed these [...] "Mindflayers" [...] as wearing luxurious robes and turbans and lounging in a bar and smoking pipes. The design was changed during development and the Mindflayer was placed as a special monster, retaining the initial design; the Occuria were then given a different design <b>of</b> <b>glowing</b> eyes in a mist-like form.|$|E
500|$|The {{player is}} awarded points for {{correctly}} hitting notes, chords and sustains. The player can also increase a score multiplier by playing {{a series of}} consecutive notes successfully. A [...] "Rock Meter" [...] tracks the player's performance based on {{success or failure of}} hitting notes, and if the meter drops too low the song will prematurely end in failure for the player. The player can also earn [...] "Star Power" [...] by playing a series <b>of</b> <b>glowing</b> notes perfectly and using the whammy bar during sustains. Once the Star Power meter is filled at least halfway, Star Power can then be activated by briefly tilting the guitar controller vertically, or by pressing a specific button on a standard controller. Activating Star Power will double the scoring multiplier and makes it easier to increase the Rock Meter by playing correct notes. Thus, players can strategically use Star Power to play through difficult sections of a song they might have otherwise failed.|$|E
