5|$|Around 1170, Keynsham Abbey {{was founded}} by the Victorine {{congregation}} <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> regulars.

He attended all four sessions. Keeler worked for the Council Digest, a communications service used to bring people in the United States day-to day news of the Council.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the account's {{authenticity}} has been questioned {{is the fact that it}} claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law. Offler doubted that canon law had penetrated to England to any great degree in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law, the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> construction, <b>canons</b> give common sense {{guidance}} to courts {{in interpreting the}} meaning <b>of</b> statutes. Most <b>canons</b> emerge from the common law process through the choices of judges. Proponents of the use <b>of</b> <b>canons</b> argue that the canons constrain judges and limit {{the ability of the}} courts to legislate from the bench. Critics argue that a judge always has a choice between competing canons that lead to different results, so judicial discretion is only hidden through the use <b>of</b> <b>canons,</b> not reduced.|$|R
5|$|Richard (died 1184) was {{a medieval}} Benedictine monk and Archbishop of Canterbury. Employed by Thomas Becket {{immediately}} before Becket's death, Richard arranged for Becket {{to be buried}} in Canterbury Cathedral and eventually succeeded Becket at Canterbury in a contentious election. Much of Richard's time as archbishop was spent in a dispute with Roger de Pont L'Evêque, the Archbishop of York over the primacy of England, and with St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury over the archbishop's jurisdiction over the abbey. Richard had better relations with King Henry II of England than Becket had, and was employed by the king on diplomatic affairs. Richard also had the trust of the papacy, and served as a judge for the papacy. Several of his questions to Pope Alexander III were collected into the Decretals, a collection of ecclesiastical laws, and his patronage <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> lawyers did much to advance the study <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law in England.|$|E

5|$|As bishop, de Gray {{settled a}} long-running {{dispute between the}} monks of his cathedral chapter and his {{predecessors}} as bishop. He also allowed the monks of his cathedral chapter the right to appoint and replace the clergy of the dependent churches of the cathedral. De Gray received a 1203 missive from Innocent III decrying the marriages of some secular clergy, in contravention <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law. In more secular matters, he granted the town of Bishop's Lynn (now King's Lynn) the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs per year. He also built a palace at Gaywood.|$|E

5|$|Canon law {{concerns}} the Catholic Church's life and organisation and {{is distinct from}} civil law. In its own field it gives force to civil law only by specific enactment in matters such as the guardianship of minors. Similarly, civil law may give force in its field to canon law, but only by specific enactment, as with regard to canonical marriages. Currently, the 1983 Code <b>of</b> <b>Canon</b> Law is in effect primarily for the Latin Church. The distinct 1990 Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's role in {{politics}} was diminishing when on 16 October 1551 Seymour {{was arrested on}} charges of treason. In December he was put on trial and although acquitted of treason, he was judged guilty of felony and put to death on 22 January 1552. This {{was the beginning of}} the breach between Cranmer and Dudley. It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency. However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law, the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E

5|$|In 1203, Thomas of Marlborough, {{who was a}} monk of Evesham Abbey, pleaded a {{case for}} Evesham before Archbishop Walter, and later, in his chronicle, he noted that Simon, John of Tynemouth, and Honorius, all canon lawyers from the archbishop's household, sided with the abbey. He also {{described}} the three men as magistri mei in scholis. Surviving evidence shows that Simon and John frequently found themselves on opposing sides of cases, which suggests a rivalry between the two over their expositions <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law. Thomas appears to have studied under Simon, John and Honorius at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|John of Tynemouth (died 1221) was {{a medieval}} English clergyman and canon lawyer. He {{was among the}} first {{teachers}} <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law at what later became Oxford University, where he was by 1188. By the late 1190s John had joined the household of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter. Besides his position in the household, he also held a number of ecclesiastical positions, which earned him a substantial income. After Walter's death, John continued to serve as a lawyer as well as hold clerical offices. He died in 1221 and a number of his writings survive.|$|E
5|$|Legal studies {{advanced}} {{during the}} 12th century. Both secular law and canon law, or ecclesiastical law, were {{studied in the}} High Middle Ages. Secular law, or Roman law, was advanced greatly by {{the discovery of the}} Corpus Juris Civilis in the 11th century, and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at Bologna. This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. Canon law was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named Gratian (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law—the Decretum.|$|E

At the Council of Westminster that Richard convened in May 1175, nineteen canons were put forth, dealing with clerical marriage, the oversupply of ordained clergy, the behaviour of the clergy and their dress and tonsure, and simony. Another canon dealt with clandestine marriages and regulated child marriages. He was also heavily involved with trying judicial cases, both in the actual judgment {{as well as in}} the execution of judgments made by others. Four of his questions to Alexander III entered the Decretals and the other collections <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais studied under Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, the {{half-brother}} of {{the future}} William I of England, who was then Duke of Normandy. Other bishops educated at Bayeux around this time included Archbishop Thomas of York and Samson, Bishop of Worcester. Symeon of Durham considered St-Calais to be well-educated in classical literature and the scriptures; at some point St-Calais also acquired a knowledge <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law. He became a Benedictine monk at Saint-Calais in Maine, where his father had become a monk, and soon became the prior of that house. He became abbot of St Vincent-des-Prés near Le Mans in Maine, sometime around 1078. As abbot, his only appearance in historical records is his upholding of the monasteries' right to some property, and his acceptance of a gift of property in the town.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester {{and one of}} the king's main supporters, had {{recently}} been appointed papal legate. Henry objected to Stephen's actions in arresting the bishops and confiscating their property, as they were in contravention <b>of</b> <b>canon</b> law. Henry called a legatine council, a church council convened by a papal legate, at Winchester to discuss the issue, which ended in nothing being done, although both sides threatened excommunication and stated they would appeal to Rome and the papacy for support. Alexander did not attend the council of Winchester, but his uncle did. He seems to have borne Stephen no ill will over the arrest, and worked with the king during Stephen's later reign.|$|E
