He {{was said to have}} been a quiet person, and unlike other athletes of his era was not <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his exploits, except with close friends. Loughlin, his wife, came from Quebec; around 1903 they were married and had two {{children}} together.|$|E
25|$|Other sources {{the paper}} {{consulted}} found more flaws with the story. A {{spokesman for the}} Coast Guard, which operates all American lighthouses, {{said that they had}} all long since been automated, so {{there would have been no}} one in <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to a ship, if the incident had taken place in U.S. waters. He speculated that it had been circulated by members of the Coast Guard to make fun of the Navy.|$|E
25|$|Geera, {{who was now}} {{the only}} child left on their {{escarpment}} home, {{had no one to}} play with and no <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to as her father was often away. Geera spent all day sitting, hunched over and watching the camps of the local Aboriginals and looking out to sea to her five sisters. Eventually she turned to stone, dust and leaves building up around her until she became a part of the escarpment. She is known today as Mount Keira.|$|E

500|$|Convergence {{questions}} are treated by considering vector spaces V carrying a compatible topology, {{a structure that}} allows <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about elements being close to each other. Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be continuous maps. [...] Roughly, if x and y in V, and a in F vary by a bounded amount, then so do [...] and [...] To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field F also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice are the reals or the complex numbers.|$|E
500|$|Having no <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E
500|$|Marc-Antoine Audette {{said that}} it took the duo {{about four or five}} days of calls to Palin's staff to finally {{be able to talk to}} her. They claimed that they started by talking to {{low-level}} people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a [...] "mission impossible". He claimed that [...] "after about a dozen calls", the duo [...] "started to realize it [...] might work, because her [...] staff didn't know the name of the French President. They asked us to spell it." [...] Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls needed to talk to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel {{said that it}} took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.|$|E

500|$|Best {{was sacked}} from the Beatles on 16 August 1962, by manager Brian Epstein acting {{on behalf of}} Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Accounts vary of Aspinall during this event. According to MerseyBeat editor Bill Harry, Aspinall was waiting downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop, and was the first <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the by then ex-Beatle in the Grapes pub, across from the Cavern. Aspinall was furious and said that he would stop working for the band as well, but Best {{strongly}} advised him not to. Aspinall asked McCartney and Lennon at the next concert why they had fired Best and was told, [...] "It’s {{got nothing to do with}} you. You’re only the driver." [...] However, in a 2007 interview, Aspinall provided Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn with a distinctly different version of events, saying that he was physically present when Epstein sacked Best, that he told Best unprompted that he planned to continue working for the band, and that on his first subsequent encounter with the other band members, their first question to him was how Best had taken being sacked. At any rate, Aspinall stayed with the band, but he ended his affair with Best's mother, a relationship that had led to the birth of baby Vincent [...] "Roag" [...] Best. Aspinall denied the story for years before publicly acknowledging that he was indeed Roag's father.|$|E
2500|$|He {{constantly}} avoids {{talking to}} his mother (Clare Coulter) who keeps calling him at work. Telling people to tell her {{he is in a}} meeting or on vacation, he {{even went so far as}} to have an intern get the telephone number to the show changed. When asked why he refused to talk to her he replies, [...] "Talk to her? You're missing the point. The point is, this place is too cheap to get me an assistant. If I had an assistant, she could talk to my mother. But because this place is so goddamn cheap, my mother has no <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to." [...] Findlay does, however, have a close relationship with his BMW dealer, often calling him about small problems with his [...] "$40,000 German car." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} edition {{did not experience}} the same draw as Fielding's Tom Thumb. However, {{none of the other}} plays at the Little Theatre were able to compete with its success. The revised edition was not a success and made very little. There are few surviving mentions of the play which include Arthur Murphy's comment in the Gray's-Inn Journall (1754) that scenes can be stolen from Rape upon Rape because no one would notice the similarity since the play was no longer performed. In Murphy's 1762 edition of Fielding's Works, he praises the play. However, he is the only <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the play until the 19th century. John Genest praised it but adds, [...] "the humour is low and [...] not very decent". Lawrence also praised aspects of the play but believed that no one could have liked the play because it was [...] "too gross and too indelicate for the audiences even of that tolerant age". E. P. Whipple, in an 1849 review of Roscoe's biography of Fielding, declared that Murphy would have to be drunk to have actually appreciated the play. During the 20th-century, Dobson found little to praise within the play and Cross followed in suit. F. Homes Dudden characterised the play as [...] "a coarse play, modelled on the lines of the Jonsonian 'comedy of humours'. Its chief interest lies in the portrayal of two characters, both rather heavily exaggerated.|$|E
