40|$|This paper {{demonstrated}} how a modeling {{approach can be}} used to find the optimal mix of farmers' water management practices to improve irrigation efficiency at the tertiary level in collective canal schemes. The approach is developed for the case of the <b>Office</b> <b>du</b> Niger and based on a field study of 3 years. First, a simulation model is presented in which all relevant physical and social aspects of water management at the farmers' level are considered. Next, simulations are performed to evaluate the impact on performance of different combinations of management practices and different external conditions. Finally, the combinations are selected that succeed in limiting seasonal water consumption to 1, 400 mm and avoiding irrigation problems, but which are also realistic from a farmer's point of view. Results demonstrate that in the <b>Office</b> <b>du</b> Niger, where seasonal water consumption per hectare should be reduced by about 30 %, a tight control of the tertiary intake in combination with a good maintenance of the tertiary canal should be proposed. Although the model software is built especially for the case of the <b>Office</b> <b>du</b> Niger, the concept of the model can be transferred to other irrigation schemes, as it uses only simple hydraulic principles and limited data input. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{field study}} {{was carried out}} in the rice {{irrigation}} scheme <b>Office</b> <b>du</b> Niger, Mali, to observe malaria mosquito larval development as related to differences in field irrigation practices, such as water level, irrigation application and irrigation frequency. The main aim was to find out to what extent field water management can be considered as a tool for vector control for this irrigation system. The results show that minor differences in water management do result in small differences in mosquito development, with respect to larval densities and species composition. The main malaria vector for the area, An. gambiae s. l., developed predominantly in the first six weeks after transplanting. Due to improper drainage after harvest An. gambiae s. l. breeding quickly re-established on fields where small water pools remained. Although further research is needed, suggestions for mosquito control in the <b>Office</b> <b>du</b> Niger would be a strict performance of the agricultural calendar in combination with a rotation of transplanting in large blocks...|$|R
