40|$|Leakage {{inductance}} in the transformers specially {{power transformer}} {{is important and}} has considerable effects on transformer operation which should be limited in acceptable range. The leakage inductance is created due to flux leakage that is inevitable. By considering the <b>transformer</b> <b>type,</b> the leakage inductance can be different. In this study, the leakage inductance for two <b>type</b> <b>transformer</b> Shell <b>Type</b> <b>Transformers</b> (STT) and Core <b>Type</b> <b>Transformer</b> (CTT) are studied. In STT, much magnetic fields created by windings are entered to core that leads to significant reduction of magnetic fluxes. However in CTT, core is located in {{only one part of}} windings and as a result leakage flux is more in these areas. In this <b>type</b> of <b>transformer,</b> leakage flux and inductance are different because magnetic fields in two close legs differ from each other. In this paper, to obtain leakage inductance, two samples of these transformers of STT and CTT are modeled by ANSYS and then they are simulated by FEM. Leakage inductance value for each transformer is obtained and compared...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the time}} {{transformers}} work under balanced supplying conditions. However, after some fault conditions or anomalous switching operations, zero sequence component in excitation may be expectable. Transformers behavior under zero sequence excitation may {{be very different from}} usual behavior and might become dangerous. Some simulations are performed with the Alternative Transients Program (ATP), representing a three-legged core <b>type</b> three-phase <b>transformer</b> with a model available in the ATP library. Results show overvoltages and high saturated currents on the unloaded transformer. The proper use of the three-legged core <b>type</b> <b>transformer</b> model, enables to evidence the influence of the characteristics of zero sequence transformer on the development of such overvoltages and high transformer currents. Besides, regardless load conditions, important homopolar currents are observed flowing to ground from the transformer high voltage neutral. The resultant homopolar fluxes could cause heating and damage in a three-legged core <b>type</b> <b>transformer...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} de ning {{iteration}} for higher-order nested datatypes of arbitrary (nite) rank is solved {{within the framework}} of System F of higher-order parametric polymorphism. The proposed solution heavily relies on a general notion of monotonicity as opposed to a syntactic criterion on the shape of the type constructors such as positivity or even being polynomial. Its use is demonstrated for some rank- 2 heterogeneous/nested datatypes such as powerlists and de Bruijn terms with explicit substitutions. An important feature is the availability of an iterative de nition of the mapping operation (the functoriality) for those rank- 1 <b>type</b> <b>transformers</b> (i. e., functions from types to types) arising as least xed-points of monotone rank- 2 <b>type</b> <b>transformers.</b> Strong normalization is shown by an embedding into F.

40|$|Abstract Transformer fault {{diagnosis}} and repair {{is a complex}} task that includes many possible types of faults and demands special trained personnel. Moreover, the minimization of the time needed for transformer {{fault diagnosis}} and repair is an important task for electric utilities, especially {{in cases where the}} continuity of supply is crucial. In this paper, Stochastic Petri Nets are used for the simulation of the fault diagnosis process of oil-immersed transformers and the definition of the actions followed to repair the transformer. Transformer fault detection is realized using an integrated safety detector, in case of sealed <b>type</b> <b>transformer</b> that is completely filled with oil, while a Buchholz relay and an oil thermometer are used, in case of transformer with conservator tank. Simulation results for the most common <b>types</b> of <b>transformer</b> faults (overloading, oil leakage, short-circuit and insulation failure) are presented. The proposed Stochastic Petri Net based methodology provides a systematical determination of the sequence of fault diagnosis and repair actions and aims at identifying the transformer fault and estimating the duration for transformer repair...|$|R
