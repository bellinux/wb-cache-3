5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E

[...] "I had occasion to see your brother not long since," [...] he answered slowly, [...] "and his features and expression fastened themselves indelibly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind's</b> eye. I should know you from him at a glance. This case, as you say, is one of mistaken identity. That's just why I'm so anxious to help you well through it." ...|$|R

500|$|His {{following}} {{release was}} Band of Brothers, in 2014, the first Nelson album to feature the most newly self-penned songs since 1996's Spirit.

500|$|On Duchovny's request, Spotnitz and Carter wrote {{a larger}} role for Skinner than usual, giving him the moral dilemma {{of whether or not}} to kill Scully's unborn child or Mulder. In the end, Spotnitz called the effects of his actions, {{particularly}} the aftermath of taking Mulder off life support, a [...] "nice sort of unexpected turn". Scully's role in [...] "Deadalive" [...] was partly based on the 1954 film Magnificent Obsession, in which a young man accidentally blinds a woman and subsequently becomes a doctor to cure her. Spotnitz noted, [...] "that movie was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and not in a good way when we were imagining Scully in this operating room where Mulder was being worked on." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna also {{understood}} that {{as she was}} growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to attempt something different, she wanted {{the sound of her}} new album to dictate what could be popular in the music world. The singer had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. For the title track, Madonna chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public. She perused of her personal journals and diaries, and began considering options. She recalled, [...] "What was it I wanted to say? I wanted the album to speak to things <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> It was a complex time in my life." ...|$|E

Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it with my left. I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E
