5|$|Car/SUV – Used {{either as}} a fly-car for rapid {{response}} or for patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted {{to the requirements of}} the service using them. Some cars are capable <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E
5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, {{of which}} Britain was a signatory, did not ban {{submarines}} {{but it did}} ban their use against merchant ships, which was X1s unacknowledged purpose; its armament had been designed to successfully engage the classes of vessels likely to be escorting convoys, such as destroyers and frigates. Therefore, {{a certain amount of}} secrecy surrounded X1, the government even going to the lengths <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> national newspaper to court over its pictures of the new submarine following her launch, all copies of the paper being seized.|$|E

5|$|The {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its quasi-disinterest in pillage and treasure hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues with the intent <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> piece separated {{from the rest of}} the statue without regard. It is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments undoubtedly represented an epistemological progress.|$|E
5|$|Trumble was {{the first}} player to take two hat-tricks in Test cricket. Both hat-tricks were taken against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Trumble played his club cricket. Hat-tricks are {{extremely}} rare; in over 131years of Test cricket to March 2008, there had only been 37 Test hat-tricks and only Jimmy Matthews and Wasim Akram been able to repeat Trumble's feat <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> second.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E

5|$|Charles VI's uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, {{thought the}} {{proposed}} marriage ideal {{to build an}} alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and against the English. Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> pilgrimage to Amiens. He was adamant {{that she was not}} to know she was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to be examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004–05 season, Humphreys helped Hartlepool {{once again}} make the {{play-off}}s. During the play-off semi-final against Tranmere, Humphreys had the task <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> penalty for Hartlepool in sudden death. This {{was the first}} time Humphreys had taken a penalty since his crucial miss at Cheltenham. This time he scored and sent Hartlepool through to the play-off final against his old club Sheffield Wednesday at the Millennium Stadium. This helped to erase the memories of Cheltenham. However, Hartlepool lost the play-off final to Sheffield Wednesday. Humphreys believes that of all the play-off defeats he has suffered that the controversial loss to Wednesday was the hardest to take. Before {{the end of the season}} Humphreys extended his contract by a further two years.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), {{are searching}} for {{kindling}} while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from The Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares the oven to roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E

5|$|The {{heavy losses}} {{sustained}} by the Heer (army) since the opening of Operation Barbarossa had resulted in a shortage in infantry and artillery. Units were in total 470,000 men understrength. For the Wehrmacht to undertake an offensive in 1943 {{the burden of the}} offensive, in both attacking the Soviet defenses and holding ground on the flanks of the advance, would have to be carried primarily by the panzer divisions. In view of the exposed position of Army Group South, Manstein proposed that his forces should take the strategic defensive. He anticipated that a Soviet offensive would attempt to cut off and destroy Army Group South by a move across the Donets River toward the Dnieper. In February, he proposed waiting for this offensive to develop and then delivering a series of counterattacks into the exposed Soviet flanks. Hitler, concerned about the political implications <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> defensive stance, and preoccupied with holding the Donbass, rejected this plan. On 10 March, Manstein presented an alternative plan whereby the German forces would pinch off the Kursk salient with a rapid offensive commencing as soon as the spring rasputitsa had subsided.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{campaign}} over Romania {{and against}} the synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr—in which most oilfields had been destroyed, captured or damaged by 1945—triggered a critical fuel shortage from the autumn of 1944 onwards which denied the Luftwaffe the resources to capitalise on its numerical strength. Paradoxically, production was able to replace the relatively small losses and operational serviceability reached an all-time high since ground crews had more opportunity to work on machines. The Luftwaffe was still capable <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> toll on Bomber Command on occasion, but unless more powerful radars and communications could be introduced in time it was doubtful British air superiority at night could be challenged. The impotence of the night fighter force as an organisation was demonstrated during the attack on Dresden when the second wave of Allied bombers was hardly opposed. Operation Clarion, launched later that month, was not adequately opposed either.|$|E
