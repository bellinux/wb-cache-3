5|$|Hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> (HBO) {{has been}} {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI.

5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy.</b> This is due {{to an increase in}} the refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which the body is normally exposed.

In each case, the risk factors are markedly different.|$|E
5|$|The medical {{aspects of}} diving and {{hyperbaric}} exposure include examination of divers to establish medical fitness to dive, {{diagnosis and treatment}} of diving disorders, treatment by recompression and hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy,</b> toxic effects of gases in a hyperbaric environment, and treatment of injuries incurred while diving which are not directly associated with depth or pressure.|$|E

In this project, we {{simulate}} different ways of minimizing the time of therapy using exponential functions. The analysis in this research project focuses on treating chronic wounds using both mathematical and biological models. These models primarily focus on the amount of oxygen supplied to the wound using both hyperbaric and topical <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapies.</b> This amount should be optimal since too much oxygen is toxic to the body, and can potentially lead to death. The goal is to minimize the time spent in therapies since longer periods make treatments costlier.

They may provide emergency cover when other units are not available, or when accompanied by a fully qualified technician or paramedic.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa.

5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness, and {{is of concern}} to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to the lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of the retina. Pulmonary and ocular damage {{are most likely to}} occur when supplemental oxygen is administered as part of a treatment, particularly to newborn infants, but are also a concern during hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{medicine}} is the diagnosis, treatment {{and prevention of}} conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects {{on the body of}} pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. Hyperbaric {{medicine is}} another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.|$|E
50|$|Many {{of these}} lower {{extremity}} amputations {{can be prevented}} through an interdisciplinary approach to treatment involving a variety of advanced therapies and techniques, such as debridement, hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> treatment <b>therapy,</b> dressing selection, special shoes, and patient education.

5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should generally {{be carried out}} until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there is no cure. COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{decompression}} sickness after diving {{can be managed}} through effective decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon, though it remains to some degree unpredictable. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use decompression tables or dive computers to limit or monitor their exposure and to control their ascent speed and decompression procedures. If DCS is contracted, it is usually treated by hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> in a recompression chamber. If treated early, there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.|$|E
30|$|Hypercapnic {{respiratory}} failure (type II) {{is a consequence}} of ventilatory failure and can occur in conditions that affect the respiratory pump, such as depressed neural ventilatory drive, acute or chronic upper airway obstruction, neuromuscular weakness, marked obesity, and rib-cage abnormalities. Alveolar hypoventilation is characterized by a PaCO 2 > 50 mmHg [7]. The onset of type II failure may be insidious and may develop when respiratory muscle fatigue complicates preexisting disorders, such as pneumonia or status asthmaticus, which present initially with hypoxemia without hypoventilation. Aministration of oxygen alone is not an appropriate treatment for hypercapnic {{respiratory failure}} and can result in the patient retaining even more carbon dioxide, especially in situations where the child has adapted to chronic hypercapnia and is relatively dependent on oxygen-sensitive peripheral chemoreceptors to maintain ventilatory drive. In addition to supplemental <b>oxygen,</b> <b>therapies</b> to reduce the load on the respiratory muscles and increase the level of alveolar ventilation should be instituted in children with type II respiratory failure.|$|R

5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} among patients undergoing hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> is rare, and {{is influenced by}} a number of a factors: individual sensitivity and treatment protocol; and probably therapy indication and equipment used. A study by Welslau in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107,264 patients (0.015%), while Hampson and Atik in 2003 found a rate of 0.03%. Yildiz, Ay and Qyrdedi, in a summary of 36,500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003, reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents, giving a rate of 0.008%. A later review of over 80,000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate: 0.0024%. The reduction in incidence may be partly due to use of a mask (rather than a hood) to deliver oxygen.|$|E
5|$|M.P. Spencer {{showed that}} Doppler {{ultrasonic}} methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and Dr Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed. The pathophysiology of DCS {{is not yet}} fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy.</b> Mixed breathing gases are used to reduce {{the effects of the}} hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers.|$|E
