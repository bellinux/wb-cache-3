5|$|On July 11, 1969, Kouandété accused Alley of {{plotting}} to kidnap and murder him. Facing the death penalty, Alley {{was sentenced to}} ten years of hard labor at an <b>open</b> <b>trial</b> held on October 4. Zinsou had intervened for Alley, and it strained relations {{between the president and}} Kouandété. The latter decided to lead another coup on December 10. In the aftermath, Alley was released from incarceration and reinstated in the army. In July 1968, he was named Secretary General of National Defence. Kouandété ended up becoming Alley's adjutant.|$|E

In recent years, four or five students have left each year. Students found guilty in a closed hearing may appeal the verdict to an open hearing before the entire student body, although this option is rarely exercised.

2500|$|Fujimori {{has been}} {{credited}} by many Peruvians with ending the fifteen-year {{reign of terror}} of Shining Path. As part of his anti-insurgency efforts, Fujimori granted the military broad powers to arrest suspected insurgents and try them in secret military courts with few legal rights. This measure has often been criticized for compromising the fundamental democratic and human right to an <b>open</b> <b>trial</b> wherein the accused faces the accuser. Fujimori contended that these measures were both justified and also necessary. Members of the judiciary were too afraid to charge the alleged insurgents, and judges and prosecutors had very legitimate fears of reprisals against them or their families. At the same time, Fujimori's government armed rural Peruvians, organizing them into groups known as [...] "rondas campesinas" [...] ("peasant patrols").|$|E
2500|$|Chikatilo {{withdrew his}} confessions to {{six of the}} killings {{for which he had}} been charged on 13 May, and also claimed he had killed four further victims who were not {{included}} upon the indictment. The same day, Chikatilo's defence lawyer again submitted a request that his client be subjected to a second psychiatric evaluation. This motion was dismissed by the judge as being groundless. In response, Khabibulin rose from his seat, condemning the composition of the court, and arguing that the judge was unfit to continue presiding over the case. Chikatilo himself repeated his earlier remarks as to the judge making numerous rash remarks prejudging his guilt. The prosecutor, Nikolai Gerasimenko, vocally supported the defence's claim, stating that the judge had indeed made too many such comments and had committed numerous procedural violations in his lecturing and insulting the defendant. Gerasimenko further contended that in his conducting an <b>open</b> <b>trial,</b> Chikatilo had already been effectively prejudged as being guilty by the press, before also requesting that the judge be replaced. (Judge Akubzhanov would later rule that the prosecutor be replaced instead, briefly conducting the trial {{in the absence of a}} prosecutor until a replacement prosecutor, Anatoly Zadorozhny, could be found.) ...|$|E

Therefore the Council of the Nation and the doctors--I was not among them, King--moved the spirit of Chaka the Lion into the body of Sompseu and made him as Chaka was and gave him power to name you to rule over the Zulus.
