5|$|Short-period comets have orbits lasting {{less than}} two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting {{thousands}} of years. Short-period comets are thought to <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as Hale–Bopp, are thought to <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> the Oort cloud. Many comet groups, such as the Kreutz Sungrazers, formed from the breakup of a single parent. Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult. Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous cyst is a {{term used}} to refer to both an epidermoid cyst and a pilar cyst, though neither of these contain sebum, only keratin and do not <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> the sebaceous gland and so are not true sebaceous cysts.

When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the open sea, with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Comparing the {{epidemiology}} of fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical and apical regions {{may help}} to understand the causes and risk of a vertical root fracture. We aimed to determine the frequency of vertical root fractures in different fracture sites and how the fracture site relates to fracture direction and post length. Methods: Teeth diagnosed with a vertical root fracture were retrospectively surveyed for age and sex of the patient, type of tooth, a fracture region in the longitudinal axial direction, site of the fracture, and presence of a post The fracture region in the longitudinal axial direction was classified as an incomplete fracture, complete fracture, and uncertain. Incomplete fractures were further classified into a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region, a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the midregion, and a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the apical region. Posts were evaluated by loss of post and length of post. Results: Fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical and apical region occurred around the same frequency, whereas fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the midregion were extremely scarce. Of the fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region, 36. 2 % were in a mesial and/or distal site and 57. 4 % in a buccal and/or lingual site. Of the fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the apical region, 90. 8 % were in the buccal and/ or lingual site. The {{number of cases of}} fractures <b>Originating</b> <b>in</b> the apical region decreased with increased post length. Conclusions: Sites of fracture and post length differed greatly between fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region and the apical region, suggesting that risk factors for fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical and apical regions are different...|$|R
5|$|Numerous deities {{have been}} {{considered}} patrons of third-sex or homoerotically-inclined people. This patronage can <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> mythological stories about the deity, or from religious practices and rituals. For example, Conner and Sparks argue that the goddess of fire, love and sexuality, Arani, {{has been linked to}} lesbian eroticism via rituals in her honor: for example two pieces of wood perceived as feminine, called the adhararani and utararani, are rubbed together, simulating a spiritual lesbian interaction.|$|E

40|$|Coliphage T 4 {{was used}} as a model system to study the {{mechanism}} of biological inactivation produced by tritium decay. Experimentally, tritiated precursors were incorporated into phage DNA (thymidine- 3 H) or into phage protein (3 H-amino acids). The ratio of killing efficiencies for decays <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> phage DNA to those <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> phage protein was 2. 6. Inactivation by decays from labeled amino acids was assumed to occur exclusively from β-particle irradiation of phage DNA. If decays <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> DNA are due solely to irradiation of DNA, then the killing efficiencies reflect the energy transfer paths in phage DNA for decays <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> phage DNA and in the protein coat. The energy transfer paths were determined for the two cases {{with the help of a}} computer and found to be very nearly equal to the experimentally determined ratio (2. 6).

5|$|The {{most popular}} kind of coral kept is soft coral, {{especially}} zoanthids and mushroom corals, which are especially {{easy to grow}} and propagate {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, because they <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> enclosed parts of reefs where water conditions vary and lighting may be less reliable and direct. More serious fishkeepers may keep small polyp stony coral, which is from open, brightly lit reef conditions and therefore much more demanding, while large polyp stony coral is a sort of compromise between the two.|$|E
