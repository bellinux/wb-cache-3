500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E
2500|$|Albany was in {{operation}} by August 1868, running from Oregon City to Salem, Oregon. [...] During one trip in August, the low water period on the Willamette, a reporter on board wrote {{later that the}} steamer “actually navigated some parts like wet gravel. [...] We have specimen stones thrown <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of the river by her wheel, in our office.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{arriving}} at the scene, police and paramedics took Knight and a wounded Shakur to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. Chris Carroll, the first Las Vegas police officer to arrive on the scene, heard Shakur's last words, [...] "fuck you". Carroll reports that he refused to say another word to him or another officer. According to {{an interview with the}} music video director Gobi, while at the hospital, Shakur received news from a Death Row marketing employee that the shooters had called the record company and threatened Shakur. Gobi informed the Las Vegas police but said that the police claimed to be understaffed. No attackers came. At the hospital, Shakur was heavily sedated, was placed on life-support machines, and was ultimately put under a barbiturate-induced coma after repeatedly trying to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, Stitch {{disrupts}} the song by sticking his arms <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flower <b>beds</b> and sounding various air horns. Waha Nui tries {{to stop him}} by shouting at him whenever he reaches <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flower <b>beds,</b> but Stitch gets the upper hand by sounding a large foghorn blast at the end.|$|R

"You {{know you}} took the last rap from his breeches-pocket not an hour ago," [...] expostulated the poor convalescent--"But help me to take the body <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and I will not tell the jigger-dubber {{that you have been}} {{beforehand}} with him." ...|$|E
50|$|The convicts hastily {{assembled}} a crude ladder from wooden poles to scale the wall. Once on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall, {{they used a}} rope fashioned <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knotted <b>bed</b> sheets and clothes to abseil down to the ground.|$|R

50|$|Another form of {{anchor ice}} may be {{observed}} at <b>the</b> mouths <b>of</b> Arctic rivers where fresh water seeps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed</b> into <b>the</b> ocean {{up through the}} sediment. Anchor ice forms if the seawater is below <b>the</b> freezing point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river water.|$|R

6000|$|At {{that very}} moment a cock crowed, and the weird {{procession}} vanished and left not a shred or a bone behind. I awoke, and found myself lying with my head <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and [...] "sagging" [...] downward considerably--a position favorable to dreaming dreams with morals in them, maybe, but not poetry.|$|E
6000|$|With {{the little}} {{strength}} he had, {{he made an}} attempt to turn over on his wretched face to hide it. His arm dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and his head with it, and there he lay before me crushed in body and in mind. Surely the miserablest sight under the summer sun! ...|$|E
60|$|General Westmacott, however, {{defended his}} right with energy; the rear-guard regiments {{supporting}} each other, while the batteries were in continual action. The Borderers, Sikhs, and Ghoorkhas stood well to their task, till <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baggage animals were got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the {{filtering}} {{process is}} complete, the remaining slag granules, which now give <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> coarse beach sand, can be scooped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filter <b>bed</b> and transferred to the grinding facility where they are ground into particles that are finer than Portland cement.|$|R
60|$|The next ford was Barkhe. The {{advance guard}} was well {{up in the}} hills by midday, when it met the Oxfordshire Regiment, which had come out seven miles to meet the force; but <b>the</b> baggage <b>of</b> a division, filing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed</b> in pairs, is a serious matter, and there was {{necessarily}} a block in the rear.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I had {{had time}} to note these little particulars, and to mark the heavy {{breathing}} and feverish startings of the sick man, before {{he was aware of}} my presence. In the restless attempts to procure some easy resting-place for his head, he tossed his hand <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and it fell on mine. He started up, and stared eagerly in my face.|$|E
6000|$|May 8. Great Scott! I never mailed this letter! I {{addressed}} it, put [...] "Registered" [...] on it--then left it lying unsealed {{on the arm}} of my chair, {{and rushed}} up to my bed quaking with a chill. I've never been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> since--oh, bronchitis, rheumatism, two sets of teeth aching, land, I've had a dandy time for 4 weeks. And to-day--great guns, one of the very worst!...|$|E
6000|$|... "Danger?" [...] he scoffed. [...] "Not on your life. It's got to go. Them islands"--waving {{his hand}} indefinitely down river--"can't hold up under more pressure. If they don't let go the ice, the ice'll scour them clean <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of the Yukon. Sure! But I've {{got to be}} chasin' back. Lower ground down our way. Fifteen inches on the cabin floor, and McPherson and Corliss hustlin' {{perishables}} into the bunks." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 293. II. Formation.--Mountains {{are to be}} arranged, {{with respect}} to their structure, under two great classes--those which are cut <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> which they are composed, and those which are formed by the {{convolution}} or contortion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> themselves. <b>The</b> Savoy mountains are chiefly of this latter class. When stratified formations are contorted, it is usually either by pressure from below, which raises one part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation above the rest, or by lateral pressure, which reduces the whole formation into a series <b>of</b> waves. <b>The</b> ascending pressure may be limited in its sphere <b>of</b> operation; <b>the</b> lateral one necessarily affects extensive tracts <b>of</b> country, and <b>the</b> eminences it produces vanish only by degrees, like the waves left in <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> a ship. <b>The</b> Savoy mountains have undergone both these kinds of violence in very complex modes and at different periods, so that it becomes almost impossible to trace separately and completely <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> any given force at a given point.|$|R
6000|$|Rats were an {{absolute}} plague {{at that time}} at Raratonga. Mr Williams tells us, in his interesting [...] "Narrative," [...] {{that he and his}} family never sat down to a meal without having two or more persons stationed to keep them off the table. When kneeling at family prayer, they would run over them in all directions, and it was found difficult to keep them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds.</b> On one occasion, when the servant was making one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds,</b> she uttered a scream, and, on rushing into the room, Mr Williams found that four rats had crept under the pillow and made themselves snug there. They paid for their impudence, however, with their lives. On another occasion, a pair of English shoes, which had not been put in <b>the</b> usual place <b>of</b> safety, were totally devoured in a night, and the same fate befell <b>the</b> covering <b>of</b> a hair-trunk. No wonder, then, that they did not spare the bellows! ...|$|R
60|$|The second notable {{thing was}} that the {{right-hand}} groove, where first we saw it {{at the point of}} separation, was not polished like the left-hand groove, although at some time or other it seemed to have been subjected to the pressure of the same terrific weight which cut its fellow <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of rock or iron, as the sharp wheels of a heavily laden wagon sink ruts into a roadway.|$|E
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} {{she heard his}} voice in the kitchen. She leaned <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and pulled open her door. She heard voices below, but could not {{distinguish}} the words, so she rose and went noiselessly out into the hall, knelt down by the stair railing and listened. The door of the kitchen was open below her and a narrow shaft of light struck on her white, intent face. She looked like a woman waiting for the decree of doom.|$|E
60|$|Jims did his errand. Uncle Walter and {{the nurse}} carried Miss Avery {{into the house and}} then Jims went back to the blue room. He was so unhappy he didn't care where he went. He wished {{something}} would jump at him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> {{and put an end to}} him. Everything was discovered now and he would never see Miss Avery again. Jims lay very still on the window seat. He did not even cry. He had come to one of the griefs that lie too deep for tears.|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind, {{and they got}} along better. Soon they rolled <b>the</b> Lion <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poppy <b>bed</b> to <b>the</b> green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{poisonous}} scent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "To use {{a phrase}} common with us down in Yorkshire," [...] said Aylmer, [...] "I {{should say that}} Mr. Belton had got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>the</b> wrong side this morning." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{cataracts}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nile are shallow lengths (or {{white water}} rapids) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nile River, between Aswan and Khartoum, where <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water is broken by many small boulders and stones jutting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed,</b> {{as well as}} many rocky islets. In some places, these stretches are punctuated by whitewater, while at others the water flow is smoother, but still shallow.|$|R
60|$|A {{favourite}} at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver {{had begun}} cautiously to hew away the lower staves {{of the ladder}} on which he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.|$|E
60|$|The Curruckpore hills, the {{northern}} {{boundary of the}} gneiss and granite range of Paras-nath, are seen first in the distance, and then throwing out low loosely timbered spurs towards the river; but no rock or hill comes close to the banks till near Monghyr, where two islets of rock rise <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of the river. They are of stratified quartz, dipping, at a high angle, to the south-east; and, as far as I could observe, quite barren, each crowned with a little temple. The swarm of boats from below Patna to this place was quite incredible.|$|E
6000|$|Besides blind Raerik, Olaf {{had in his}} {{household}} one Thorarin, an Icelander; {{a remarkably}} ugly man, says Snorro, but a far-travelled, shrewdly observant, loyal-minded, and good-humored person, whom Olaf liked to talk with. [...] "Remarkably ugly," [...] says Snorro, [...] "especially {{in his hands and}} feet, which were large and ill-shaped to a degree." [...] One morning Thorarin, who, with other trusted ones, slept in Olaf's apartment, was lazily dozing and yawning, and had stretched one of his feet <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> before the king awoke. The foot was still there when Olaf did open his bright eyes, which instantly lighted on this foot.|$|E
500|$|The dark plate's {{perennials}} include ferns, angelicas {{and other}} broad-leaved species, with a scattering <b>of</b> trees sprouting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flower <b>beds.</b> [...] These plants thrive with shade from trees. <b>The</b> lush plants <b>of</b> this plate were selected by Oudolf {{as a tribute}} to Chicago's marshy beginnings. [...] It is described as a thick wetland whose designers have described as [...] "wild, naughty and hidden." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} Will was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>the</b> instant he was called, excited {{at the thought}} that he was going really to sea. The skipper's wife had tea made, and the table laid.|$|R
60|$|Yes. But {{not that}} kind; {{a better one}} still. The {{superphosphate}} from the Copiolites is good; but the superphosphate from fresh bones is better still, and therefore dearer, because it has in it <b>the</b> fibrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bones, which is full of nitrogen, like gristle or meat; and all that has been washed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bone-earth <b>bed</b> ages and ages ago. But you must learn some chemistry to understand that.|$|R
