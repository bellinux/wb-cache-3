40|$|With the {{introduction}} of fiber-guided radiation at 1 µ wavelength emitting in the milti-kW range at better beam quality than CO 2 -lasers the most established application in laser processing, namely laser fusion cutting, {{came back into the}} industrial and scientific focus. Laser sources with extraordinary optical and economical properties - disk and fiber lasers - in a stormy way enter the market <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> so far reserved for the 10 µ radiation source and led to a volatile situation. The new laser sources can already address a market-relevant class of applications, namely, fusion cutting of steel up to a sheet thickness of 2 mm with pronounced advantages in productivity. However, there is a significant lack of cut quality for larger sheet thickness. The main reason for the drawback and its physical background are given. With the availability <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> with 1 µ fiber-guided radiation the race for the worldwide market regarding the larger sheet thickness is opened and the priority issues to improve the cut quality are related to the three levels: wavelength, beam delivery and the application stage of the machine. The stability model called QuCut is presented which for the first time allows to analyze stability of cutting with fiber-guided radiation. Experimental ripple patterns and ripple spectra resolved with respect to the cutting depth are well reproduced by the new stability model. A number of different experimental methods towards an improved understanding of the dynamics in laser drilling are developed, however, there are gaps related to in-situ observation which is obscured by the hole walls. There are four novel experimental methods resolving the dynamics from a µms-down to a ns-time scale having a spatial resolution with respect to transient drilling depth on the µm scale. As result, the different mechanisms contributing to recast formation and dynamical features of drilling are revealed in more detail. In particular, the action of double pulses and its changes depending on the evolving drill are investigated...|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this work}} is the control of flexible mechanical systems, specifically the position control of the shifting parts without the residual vibrations. These systems are for example long robot arms, gantry cranes, some parts <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> etc. The actuators are coupled to the continuum close to one point. The other boundaries are “free”. The actuators are attempting to position the “important point” {{at the far end}} through the flexible system and eliminate the vibrations during the motion also {{at the end of the}} motion. The wave-based control method was developed. This paper shows how to apply this published 1 D method [1] to 2 D continuum. The paper shows how to compute and use the “launch” and “reflected” waves for control. If some strategy is used, the flexible system will be transposed to the required position with no residual vibrations. Some ambiguities still exist. If the superposition principle is valid, many motions will be able to control simultaneously...|$|E

We propose a new configuration <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> to achieve higher production efficiency, namely the open-ended configuration {{as opposed to the}} traditional closed-ended configuration, thereby two variants of the problem are defined. We propose linear formulations for both problems using binary expansion of the number of pieces of different types in a pattern. Furthermore, we define the time for pattern change as a linear function of the number of knives used in the pattern to be more realistic. Computational studies suggest that the open-ended cutting machine may improve the production time by up to 44 % and that our linear formulations are more efficient than the existing ones...|$|E

40|$|During the interwar period {{artificial}} {{materials were}} often preferred, but many Antwerp architects {{relied on the}} application of wood {{for most of the}} interior finishing works and furnishings. Archival, literature and on site research of interwar suburban townhouses and the Belgian wood and furniture industry gave a new insight to the application of wood in the interwar interior. Many interwar designers favored the decorative values in all treatments of wood because of its warmth, comfort, good-wearing, and therefore, economic qualities. For the creation of a successful modern interior the texture and surface of the wood becomes as important as the color itself. This aesthetics valuation {{was the result of the}} modernization of the wood industry. The development of veneer and plywood gave the possibility to create strong, flat, long and plain wooden surfaces which are capable of retaining their shape. Also the modernization <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> resulted in high quality and diversity in texture of veneer. The flat and plain plywood surfaces were modern decorated with all kinds of veneer-sliced options. In addition, wood species from the former Belgian Colony Congo were imported. Limba (Terminalia superba), kambala (Chlorophora excelsa), mubala (Pentaclethra macrophylla) and sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum) were used in the interior of many Antwerp interwar suburban town houses. From the thirties onwards Belgian wood firms established modern manufactures in Congo. There the local wood was dried, cut and prepared for exportation to the harbor of Antwerp. The presence of all kinds of strong and decorative Congolese wood products supported its application in the interwar interior design. The Antwerp architects combined them in their designs for doors, floors, stairs, built-in-furniture, wall paneling and movable furniture...|$|E

40|$|The quality <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> is {{affected}} by several factors that can be directly or indirectly influenced by manufacturers, technicians and users of machine tools. The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the cutting machine will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the cutting machine was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the cutting machine, and also an innovative solution for beam mounting. The second step was to integrate two types of drives into the design of the cutting machine. The first drive is a classic rack and pinion drive for cutting machines. To increase (improve) the working speed of the machine, linear motors were designed as an alternative drive. The portal of the cutting machine was designed for a working speed of 260 mmin− 1 and acceleration of 25 m. s− 2. The third step was {{based on the results of}} the analysis. In collaboration with Microstep, an experimental cutting machine in a portal version was produced using linear synchronous motors driving the portal on both sides, and with direct linear metering of its position. In the fourth step, an experiment was designed and conducted to explore the positioning accuracy and the repeatable positioning accuracy...|$|E

After summarizing the achieved experimental results, the authors conclude that cooling lubricants extensively influence the cutting temperature, cutting forces and energy consumption. Also, it is recognizable that cooling lubricants affect the cutting tools lifetime and the workpiece surface quality as well. Furthermore, costs of these cooling lubricants and the related environmental burden need to be considered. A current trend {{is to reduce the}} amount of lubricants that are used, e. g., when the Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) technique is applied. The lubricant or process liquid is thereby transported by the compressed air in the form of an aerosol to the contact area between the tool and workpiece.
