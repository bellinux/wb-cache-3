(iii) Employ both an agar medium incubated in 5 % CO 2, for the early detection <b>of</b> <b>positives</b> as well as positives in the presence of contaminants, and an egg medium, preferably with CO 2, to increase the yield <b>of</b> <b>positives...</b>|$|R

MethodsThis {{study investigated the}} detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpes virus 6 (HHV- 6), HHV- 7, HHV- 8, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), enterovirus (EV), human adenovirus (HAdV), human parechoviruses (HPeVs), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) through real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in patients > 65 years old who had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tested for a suspected central nervous system infection. ResultsA total of 2868 RT-PCRs were performed on 502 CSF samples. Overall, 65 positive RT-PCRs were found: 23 for HSV (35. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>positives),</b> 15 for EV (23. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>positives),</b> 14 for EBV (21. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>positives),</b> 12 for VZV (18. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>positives),</b> and one for CMV (1. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>positives).</b> A positive RT-PCR in CSF was detected in 24 (17. 4 %) patients aged ≥ 80 years and in 35 (9. 6 %) patients aged 65 – 79 years (p= 0. 02). VZV was more frequently detected in the oldest subjects (5. 9 % vs. 1. 6 %, p= 0. 03). ConclusionsHSV {{was the most common}} viral aetiology identified in the study, with VZV infection being recognized more frequently in those patients aged ≥ 80 years...|$|R
