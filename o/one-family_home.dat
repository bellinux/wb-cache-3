50|$|Stegmann's {{first major}} {{assignment}} was the Aarhus housing development in Stadion Allé (1930). The same year a competition was launched for {{a university in}} Aarhus. Stegmann, who had studied contemporary university architecture while travelling in Europe, submitted a proposal together with Kay Fisker and his younger colleague C. F. Møller. Inspired by Hannes Meyer's trades union college in Bernau near Berlin, it consisted of a structure divided into several small departments, carefully adapted to the building site {{with the assistance of}} the landscape architect C.Th. Sørensen. The proposal won first prize but when Stegmann became head of the Technical School in Aalborg, he withdrew from the consortium. Stegmann is also remembered for his analysis of the detached <b>one-family</b> <b>home</b> (1933) which became compulsory reading for practicing architects.|$|E
50|$|In August 2005, {{the median}} price {{of an average}} <b>one-family</b> <b>home</b> in the San Fernando Valley reached $600,000. In 1997, it was only $155,000. In the summer of 2003, it reached $400,000 and by July 2005, it had reached $578,500. From July to August (one month) 2005, it rose by $100,000. A cooling off was noted in 2006, when between November 2005 and November 2006, median prices rose by the {{smallest}} amount of any 12-month period since mid-1997. Indeed, November prices were lower than October prices, and sales for November had fallen 19.1% compared to a year earlier. The United States housing market correction affected the San Fernando Valley in 2007-2009, making housing significantly more affordable in the area: the median sales price fell from $660,000 at the peak in May 2007, to $500,000 by March 2008, stabilizing in 2009 at around $330,000 - $340,000.

[...] The exhibit was a tremendous success and received considerable publicity, including praise from Eleanor Roosevelt, who commented, [...] "I particularly like the children's playroom with nothing but those hollow blocks which could be made into furniture and still remain toys." [...] An article in The New Yorker also praised Creative Playthings' designs for their innovative and unconventional approach: [...] "If the present kindergarten generation develops, when it has grown up, some rather horrid mass psychosis, I shall certainly be the first to blame it on the general vulgarity of the nursery decoration that our young exposed to. Parents who share my mistrust of cloying pink or blue color schemes, of the ubiquitous Donald Duck motif, and of the sort of furniture that looks like stunted examples of humdrum pieces should by all means investigate the nursery paraphernalia to be found at Creative Playthings." ...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{electrically}} driven compression {{heat pumps}} {{have come to}} be widely used for the heating of buildings. Their efficiency strongly depends on the temperature lift which is influenced by the supply temperature of the heat sink. When used with radiator heating systems it is challenging to operate heat pumps efficiently because high supply temperatures are required. Therefore, in order to efficiently operate heat pumps, this work analyses advanced control concepts for heatpump heating systems that adapt the supply temperature according to the demand. The heat output of radiators is influenced by the mass flow rate and the supply temperature. Today, usually only the outdoor air temperature is used for controlling the supply temperature. However, control strategies exist that consider additional disturbances. In this work, heat pumps in existing buildings are analyzed on the basis of field test data. The temperature of heat source and heat sink influence the efficiency of the heat pump. But additional influences such as the usage of additional appliances can be found which were studied and documented comprehensively. However, without data on user influences, room temperature and control settings, the potential of the field test cannot be fully realized. Field test data are used to evaluate models of the heat pump and the buffer storage of the heating system. The heat pump is implemented as a table-based model, the buffer storage is modeled as a stratified fluid volume. The validated models and existing model components make up a model of the overall system. It includes a model of a <b>one-family</b> <b>home</b> with nine heated zones. User influences implemented as different user schedules, the building physics, dimensioning of components and control are analyzed in simulations of heating periods. The usage and insulation standard of the building have a strong influence on the energy demand and thermal comfort. The system model is also used to analyze different supply temperature control strategies. Three control concepts are modeled: A rule-based one which adapts the set temperature step-wise, a model predictive one which calculates the optimal supply temperature for each heated zone, and a continuously operating controller which uses an integral element controlling the supply temperature according to the room air temperature. The advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are evaluated {{on the basis of the}} simulation results. A decrease of the mean supply temperature leads to considerable savings in energy demand. However, an increased thermal discomfort cannot be fully avoided. Attained energy savings crucially depend on the type of building physics and the user influences. Energy savings in real buildings can exceed the ones simulated using ideally parametrized systems...|$|E

5000|$|Stapleton Heights (or Stapleton Hill) is a {{neighborhood}} in northeastern Staten Island, New York, part of New York City in the United States. It {{stands on the}} second {{of a series of}} hills that form a [...] "backbone" [...] which runs diagonally across the island from northeast to southwest, between Ward Hill (the first of the hills as they rise from Tompkinsville) and Grymes Hill; to the east is Stapleton, which is along the waterfront. It is an upper-middle-class enclave noted for its large older <b>one-family</b> <b>homes,</b> and for its view of Upper New York Bay and the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. Many of the grander homes of the neighborhood were constructed in the late 19th century by the families who controlled the industries along the waterfront, including the breweries that operated there until the last one closed in 1963. One such home, on Louis Street, is allegedly [...] "haunted," [...] according to local residents.|$|R
2500|$|One team {{of writers}} have {{analyzed}} {{the building of}} the Interstate Highway System, and have concluded that it [...] and other policies of the Federal government {{played a significant role in}} American suburbanization. The building of an efficient network of roads, highways and superhighways, and the underwriting of mortgages for suburban <b>one-family</b> <b>homes,</b> had an enormous influence on the pace of suburbanization. In effect, the government was encouraging the transfer of the middle-class population out of the inner cities and into the suburbs, sometimes with devastating effects on the viability of the city centers. However, some argue that the effect of Interstate Highway Systems on suburbanization is overstated. Researchers holding this view believe city center populations would have declined even in the absence of highway systems, contending that suburbanization is a long-standing and almost universal process. They primarily argue that as incomes rise, most people want the range and choice offered by automobiles. In addition, there is no significant evidence directly linking the development of highway systems to declining urban populations.|$|R
50|$|Like all of Staten Island {{except for}} the North Shore, the East Shore was mostly {{farmland}} until residential home construction burgeoned after World War II. Many small, <b>one-family</b> <b>homes</b> sprung up on the East Shore in the 1950s, with the rate of new home construction accelerating rapidly after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which links Staten Island with Brooklyn, opened in November 1964. The opening of the bridge brought a wave of transplants from Brooklyn, especially from neighborhoods such as Flatbush, which many white (especially Italian-American) families sought to leave because African-Americans were relocating there from the Southern States. This factor {{has contributed to the}} East Shore becoming the most politically conservative locality on Staten Island, and for that matter, in all of New York City. Since the early 2000s the trend has been for white Americans of Eastern European ancestry to immigrate to the community. Today, thriving communities of Russians, Poles, and Albanians exist on the East Shore. The area is currently not only Italian-American and Irish-American, but Russian-American, Polish-American, and Albanian-American. There is also an emerging Chinese-American population, centered in Arrochar.|$|R
50|$|Kew Gardens {{remains a}} densely {{populated}} residential community, but Kew Gardens is increasingly becoming a upper-class residential area, {{with a mix}} of <b>one-family</b> <b>homes</b> above the million-dollar range, complex apartments, co-ops and others converted and on the way or being converted as condominiums. A major five-star hotel is under development on 82nd Avenue, reflecting a modernization of the area. However, it is filled mainly with apartment buildings between four and ten stories high; while many are rentals, some are Housing cooperatives (co-ops). Although there are no New York City Housing Authority complexes in Kew Gardens, Mitchell-Lama buildings provide stabilized rental prices for families or individuals who may need help paying rent. On 83rd Avenue there is a 32-story Mitchell-Lama building. Along the borders of Richmond Hill, Briarwood, and Jamaica, smaller attached houses exist. Many of these are two or three family homes. Expensive single family homes are located around the Forest Park area. Due to constant development, however, many owners are selling out their detached homes to developers who teardown and convert them into apartment housing. This has brought demographic change.|$|R
50|$|Operating {{expenses}} {{had to be}} met (repairs to rail sidings, taxes, insurance, road repairs, maintenance, etc.) {{but there}} was enough surpluses to allow the trustees to make loans to worthy under-capitalized new firms that were attracted to the area. In 1949 there were 10 new industries at Reynolds. During 1950 a total of 61 <b>one-family</b> <b>homes</b> were built and sold {{within the limits of}} the area. All homes were prefabricated in the industrial area.By that time the Reynolds community was well on its way. The following year the size of the project and the volume of transactions made it impossible for committee members to handle the project on their own. At that time they hired Robert B. Parker, Jr., a graduate engineer who had previously represented an engineering consulting firm not only in the building of Camp Reynolds but as a professional consultant to the committee.In addition to serving as managing engineer for Reynolds Development, Parker became general manager of the water company, the sewage disposal company and the Pymatuning Independent Telephone Company.|$|R

50|$|The Empire State Plaza, a {{collection}} of state agency office buildings, dominates almost any view of Albany. Built between 1965 and 1978 at the hand of Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller and architect Wallace Harrison, the complex is a powerful example of late American modern architecture and remains a controversial building project both for displacing city residents and for its architectural style. The most recognizable aspect of the complex is the Erastus Corning Tower, the tallest building in New York outside of New York City. Juxtaposed {{at the north end}} of the Plaza is the 19th-century New York State Capitol, the seat of the New York State Legislature and the home of the Governor's office.Albany's initial architecture incorporated many Dutch influences, followed soon after by those of the English. Quackenbush House, a Dutch Colonial brick mansion, was built c. 1736; Schuyler Mansion, a Georgian-style mansion, was built in 1765; and the oldest building in Albany is the 1728 Van Ostrande-Radliff House at 48 Hudson Avenue. Albany's housing varies greatly, with mostly row houses in the older sections of town, closer to the river.

50|$|Other {{writers and}} {{academics}} have {{written on the}} subject of the increasing suburbanization of the U.S. For instance, some social scientists point out the role played by racism. During World War I, the massive migration of African Americans from the South resulted in an even greater residential shift toward suburban areas. The cities became seen as dangerous, crime-infested areas, while the suburbs were seen as safe places to live and raise a family, leading to a social trend known in some parts of the world as white flight. This phenomenon runs counter to much of the rest of the world, where slums mostly exist outside the city, rather than within them. With the increasing population of the older, more established suburban areas, many of the problems which were once seen as purely urban ones have manifested themselves there as well. These social scientists suggest that the historical processes of suburbanization and decentralization are instances of white privilege that have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism. One team of writers have analyzed the building of the Interstate Highway System, and have concluded that it and other policies of the Federal government played a significant role in American suburbanization. The building of an efficient network of roads, highways and superhighways, and the underwriting of mortgages for suburban <b>one-family</b> <b>homes,</b> had an enormous influence on the pace of suburbanization.
