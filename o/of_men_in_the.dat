5|$|Altogether, Diocletian {{effected}} a large {{increase in}} the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it. The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civil service doubled from 15,000 to 30,000. The classicist Roger Bagnall estimated that there was one bureaucrat for every 5–10,000 people in Egypt based on 400 or 800 bureaucrats for 4 million inhabitants (no one knows the population of the province in 300 AD; Strabo 300 years earlier put it at 7.5 million, excluding Alexandria). (By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century Song dynasty China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.) Jones estimated 30,000 bureaucrats for an empire of 50–65 million inhabitants, which works out to approximately 1,667 or 2,167 inhabitants per imperial official as averages empire-wide. The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per diocese depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13–15,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their comitatus, with the praetorian prefects, with the grain supply officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.|$|E

25|$|A {{different}} view, supported {{with evidence}} from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt.

25|$|Two of {{the most}} famous studies of the {{demographics}} of human sexual orientation were Dr. Alfred Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953). These studies used a seven-point spectrum to define sexual behavior, from 0 for completely heterosexual to 6 for completely homosexual. Kinsey concluded that {{a small percentage of the}} population were to one degree or another bisexual (falling on the scale from 1 to 6). He also reported that 37% <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. had achieved orgasm through contact with another male after adolescence and 13% of women had achieved orgasm through contact with another woman.|$|E

25|$|Sometime after dark, {{reinforcements}} {{began to}} arrive at the fort. The gunboat CSS Warren Winslow brought in some of the garrison from Fort Ocracoke, and some of the sailors also stayed to help man the guns.

Accompanying the additional troops was Flag Officer Samuel Barron, commanding the coast defenses of North Carolina and Virginia.

25|$|On Wednesday, 24 April, the Spanish troops led by Don Luis de Velasco {{stormed the}} citadel.

Into the citadel, the Spaniards took a valuable treasure, composed, among other things, by a large amount of gold and silver coins, horses, and a great quantities of gunpowder and supplies. With the capture of the citadel the whole city was under Spanish control, and the hopes of Henry IV to retain the city under his control vanished.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, Rhodes sent a {{group of}} settlers, known as the Pioneer Column, into Mashonaland. The 400+ man Pioneer Column was guided by the {{explorer}} and big game hunter Frederick Selous and was officially designated the British South Africa Company Police (BSACP) accompanied by about 100 Bechuanaland Border Police (BBP). When they reached Harari Hill, they founded Fort Salisbury (now Harare). Rhodes had been distributing land to the settlers even before the royal charter, but the charter legitimized his further actions with the British government. By 1891 an Order-in-Council declared Matabeleland, Mashonaland, and Bechuanaland a British protectorate. By 1892, the number <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> force had decreased and the BSACP {{was replaced by a}} number of volunteer forces - the Mashonaland Horse, the Mashonaland Mounted Police and the Mashonaland Constabulary, and later additions of Salisbury Horse, Victoria Rangers, and Raaf's Rangers.
