40|$|Under the {{intrinsic}} variability {{of the wind}} speed and its exponential relationship with the rotor torque, the power control systems play an increasingly important role in terms of efficiency {{and stability in the}} modern and large wind turbines. The paper describes a power control system based on swept band area dimensional regulation (DBB) that it is particularly well suited for off-shore wind turbines. After an introduction of the modern power control strategies and revised their current limitations, the theoretical fundamentals of the new approach are formulated. The system operates jointly with pitch or active stall controls but dedicated to the low wind speed range. In this range, the dynamic pair of <b>overlapping</b> <b>blade</b> segments may increase or decrease their swept band areas aiming to reach a constant rated power output. With maximum total swept area larger and with minimum swept area lesser than the current wind turbines of the same class, the proposed control system may provide the rated power of the wind turbine in a broader wind speed range. Preliminary simulation results in the experimental offshore wind site of “Mar de Canarias ” are presented. These results show an augmented annual energy yield that remarkably compensates the added complexity due to the incorporation of the new control system. ...|$|E

50|$|Most {{scissors}} are best-suited for {{use with}} the right hand, but left-handed scissors are designed {{for use with}} the left hand. Because scissors have <b>overlapping</b> <b>blades,</b> they are not symmetric. This asymmetry is true regardless of the orientation {{and shape of the}} handles: the blade that is on top always forms the same diagonal regardless of orientation. Human hands are also asymmetric, and when closing, the thumb and fingers do not close vertically, but have a lateral component to the motion. Specifically, the thumb pushes out from the palm and the fingers pull inwards. For right-handed scissors held in the right hand, the thumb blade is closer to the user's body, so that the natural tendency of the right hand is to force the cutting blades together. Conversely, if right-handed scissors are held in the left hand, the natural tendency of the left hand would be to force the cutting blades laterally apart. Furthermore, with right-handed scissors held by the right hand, the shearing edge is visible, but when they are used with the left hand, the cutting edge of the scissors is behind the top blade, and one cannot see what is being cut.|$|R

40|$|Small grazing motile epifaunal {{invertebrates}} play {{an important}} ecosystem role on coral reefs, influencing both the abundance and composition of macroalgal communities and acting as a key food source {{for a range of}} predatory fishes. The first aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the associations between motile epifaunal communities and four common macroalgal species (Lobophora variegata, Dictyota divaricata, Microdictyon marinum and Halimeda opuntia) on fore-reef environments in the Exuma Cays (Bahamas, wider Caribbean). Secondly, we investigated the implications of the well documented rise of Caribbean macroalgal cover on invertebrate densities by surveying sites inside and outside the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP), where increases in parrotfish grazing intensity inside the marine reserves have led to reductions in macroalgal cover. Therefore, surveys compared similar reefs with significantly different macrolagal cover. Comparisons between macroalgal species revealed a four to fivefold difference in motile epifaunal densities per unit volume of macroalgae. Post-hoc tests revealed that this difference was significant only for Lobophora, with no difference observed among the other species. As macroalgae provide both a refuge from predation and a food source for grazing epifauna, the higher densities of epifauna observed in Lobophora may be attributed to either refuge from visual predators through morphological features (high cover of <b>overlapping</b> <b>blades</b> close to the substrate) or lack of palatability for parrotfish grazing, providing a more stable refuge. Our results revealed no significant differences in diversity, density or community structure of motile epifauna per unit volume of macroalgae between sites inside and outside the ECLSP. Since canopy height and invertivore biomass did not vary systematically across reserve boundaries, this suggests that algal cover does not affect the density of epifaunal invertebrates. However, areal cover was consistently higher for all macroalgal species at sites outside the ECLSP than those inside the reserve. Therefore, when scaled by aerial cover of macroalgae, total abundance of epifauna was twofold higher outside the ECLSP. We suggest that the increasing abundance of macroalgae on Caribbean reefs may be having dramatic effects on epifaunal invertebrate populations and potentially their ecological functions...|$|R

The variables tested were blade aspect ratio, <b>blade</b> <b>overlap</b> and gap and the effects of adding end extensions, end plates and shielding. For low aspect ratios (~ 1) with no additions the efficiency was low (- 0. 065) but for higher aspect ratios (- 5) with optimum blade configuration and shielding a maximum value of efficiency of 0. 25 was obtained.

40|$|Conventional Savonius or {{modified}} {{forms of the}} conventional Savonius rotors are being investigated {{in an effort to}} improve the coefficient of power and to obtain uniform coefficient of static torque. To achieve these objectives, the rotors are being studied with and without central shaft between the end plates. Tests in a closed jet wind tunnel on modified form of the conventional Savonius rotor with the central shaft is reported to have a coefficient of power of 0. 32. In this study, modified Savonius rotor without central shaft between the two end plates is tested in an open jet wind tunnel. Investigation is undertaken to study the effect of geometrical parameters on the performance of the rotors in terms of coefficient of static torque, coefficient of torque and coefficient of power. The parameters studied are <b>overlap</b> ratio, <b>blade</b> arc angle, aspect ratio and Reynolds number. The modified Savonius rotor with an overlap ratio of 0. 0, blade arc angle of 124 ° and an aspect ratio of 0. 7 has a maximum coefficient of power of 0. 21 at a Reynolds number of 1, 50, 000, which is higher than that of conventional Savonius rotor (0. 19).

40|$|The figure shows {{parts of}} a shutter {{mechanism}} designed to satisfy a number of requirements specific to its original intended application {{as a component of}} an atomic clock to be flown in outer space. The mechanism may also be suitable for use in laboratory and industrial vacuum systems on Earth for which there are similar requirements. The requirements include the following: a) To alternately close, then open, a 1. 5 -cm-diameter optical aperture twice per second, with a stroke time of no more than 15 ms, during a total operational lifetime of at least a year; b) To attenuate light by a factor of at least 1012 when in the closed position; c) To generate little or no magnetic field; d) To be capable of withstanding bakeout at a temperature of 200 C to minimize outgassing during subsequent operation in an ultrahigh vacuum; and e) To fit within a diameter of 12 in. (= 305 mm) a size limit dictated by the size of an associated magnetic shield. The light-attenuation requirement is satisfied by use of <b>overlapping</b> shutter <b>blades.</b> The closure of the aperture involves, among other things, insertion of a single shutter blade between a pair of shutter blades. The requirement to minimize the magnetic field is satisfied by use of piezoelectric actuators. Because piezoelectric actuators cannot withstand bakeout, they must be mounted outside the vacuum chamber, and, hence, motion must be transmitted from the actuators to the shutter levers via a vacuum-chamber-wall diaphragm...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Technological Evaluator of CleanSky, which {{presents}} {{the context for}} this study, aims at estimating {{the environmental impact of}} several new concepts developed in CleanSky, including turbopropellers. Over the last years a propeller noise model has been developed and implemented in CARMEN, the acoustic module of the IESTA platform, an ONERA tool making it possible to calculate acoustic footprints around airports. This model is based on semi-empirical formula and ATR data. It is assessed against measurement data, provided by the ANIBAL (Abaissement du Niveau de Bruit des Avions Légers) measurement campaign performed in 2008, during which an innovative 5 -blade propeller was tested on a small commercial aircraft. Comparisons between calculation and measurement are shown for the ANIBAL propeller as well as the reference 2 -blade propeller, which is originally mounted on the aircraft. At the same time the problem of emission noise tones is addressed, since the engine frequencies partially <b>overlap</b> with the <b>blade</b> passing frequencies. The accuracy of the prediction is evaluated and ideas for improvement are discussed. This work was financed by The Technological Evaluator of CleanSky...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that waste heats or naturally available heat sources can be utilized to produce swirling flow by a design similar to that of split channels which is currently used to initiate fire whirls in laboratories. The new design combines the conventional Savonius wind turbine and split channel mechanisms. Previous computational and preliminary experimental works indicate a performance improvement in the new design (named as swirling Savonius turbine) compared to the conventional Savonius design. In this study, wind tunnel experiments have been carried out to optimize the swirling Savonius turbine geometry in terms of maximum power coefficient by considering several design parameters. The results indicate that the <b>blade</b> <b>overlap</b> ratio, hot air inlet diameter and the condition of the top end plate have significant influence on power and torque coefficients, while a larger aspect ratio and closed top end plate have some favourable effects on the performance. The optimum configuration has been tested in four different wind velocities to determine its influence on the performance, and power coefficients were found to be higher in high wind velocities. The performance comparison of optimum configuration with conventional Savonius rotor showed an increase of 24. 12 % in the coefficient of power...|$|R

Spherical PVC particles (which fall under type D in Geldarts classification) with two different sizes (5. 75 and 9. 84 mm) {{were used as}} bed material to study different bed configurations, {{taking into account the}} variation of fraction of open area (12. 9 and 17. 2 %), <b>blade</b> <b>overlapping</b> angles (9 and 12) and bed weight (500 to 2000 g) for superficial velocities is from 1 to 7 m sec - 1.

The most significant finding is that the pressure drop of the bed increased with superficial velocity after minimum fluidization, in contrast with a conventional fluidized bed. It was also found that the blade geometry has less effect on bed performance, compared to fraction of open area and particle size. New regimes of operation were discovered, and designated as wave regime and two-layer bed regime.

The next step is to analyze a periodic steady-state flight condition such as forward flight. In this paper, HART II blade flapping motion in a forward flight acted upon by periodic airloads and collective pitch angle is predicted by using a similar procedure as is used in hover. But the response phase is obtained to be different from that observed in the experiment. Thus, a further consideration upon the periodic excitation forces and the blade response will be required in the foregoing CFD and CSD computation for forward flight.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the mosaic, rather than the monolithic, nature of culture contact by integrating historical and archaeological sources relating {{to the concept of}} gender roles, as they influence response within a contact situation. Specifically, I examine how the Inuit gender system structured artifact patterning in Inuit-European contact situations through the investigation of three Inuit sites in Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island. These date from the 16 th, 19 th and early 20 th centuries and represent a variety of seasonal occupations and dwelling forms. The ethnographic data suggest that Inuit gender relations were egalitarian and complementary. On this basis I hypothesize that European goods and materials were used equally by men and women. Within each gendered set of tasks, European goods and materials were differently used, according to empirically functional criteria such as the nature of the tasks. Opportunities for and responses to European contact differed depending on the types of tasks in which Inuit women and men engaged and the social roles they played. Seasonality of occupation bears upon the archaeological visibility of gender activities. Sixteenth-century Elizabethan contact did not alter Nugumiut gender roles, tasks, authority or status but served primarily as a source of raw material, namely wood and iron. Based on the analysis of slotted tools I suggest a refinement to take account of the <b>overlap</b> in <b>blade</b> thickness that occurs for metal and slate, and which depends on the function of the tool. I conclude that there was much more metal use by Thule Inuit than previously believed. However, during Elizabethan contact and shortly afterwards there was actually less metal use by the Nugumiut than in the prehistoric era. Little archaeological evidence was recovered for 19 th-century commercial whaling contact, (suggesting geographic marginality to European influence), or for 19 th century Inuit occupation in the area. This is partly because of immigration to Cumberland Sound and because of subsequent structural remodelling of the dwellings by later occupants. By the early 20 th century, the archaeological record showed not only equal use of European material across gender but a near-ubiquitous distribution across most activity classes, even though commercial trapping never replaced traditional subsistence pursuits but only supplemented them...|$|R
40|$|The leaf {{shape is}} an {{important}} taxonomic character. Compared to the classic morphological leaf features such as veins, margin indentations, sinuses, etc., the shape is simpler to obtain by using the 'magic wand' or other contouring tools that are available in most of imaging applications. The only exception is when leaves develop large lobes that get in touch or overlap each other, {{as the presence of}} hidden or closed portions of the leaf border precludes the application of automatic methods and forces the leaf contour to be traced manually. This is a time consuming and relatively accurate operation that, nevertheless, can not be avoided, as overlapping lobes are characteristic features of the leaves of several plant species and varieties. The method described in the paper overcomes this problem as it allows the leaf contour to be achieved even in the presence of touching or overlapping lobes. The method involves three steps: (1) the acquisition of leaf images using a transilluminator, (2) a two-level image segmentation that allows all leaf components (<b>blade,</b> <b>overlapping</b> lobes and closed sinuses) to be represented in a single binary image, and (3) the contouring and concatenation of all binary outlines in a single, self-intersecting closed contour that reproduces accurately the leaf shape. The method can be extended to acquire the shape of leaves of herbarium specimens, that are often overlapped but can not be easily handled and repositioned because of their extreme fragility and relevant taxonomic value...|$|R
