The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the relation between type of brain injury and the presence or absence of frontal lobe damage based on brain CT-scan with BIS monitoring in intubated acute head trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Participants of this cross-sectional study consisted of 30 intubated head trauma patients over the age of 15 years old, without any known history of visual or hearing impairments, neurologic disorders, mental retardation, or frontal skin laceration, who were admitted to the ICU in Rasool Akram University Hospital, Tehran. Patients who needed muscle relaxant administration, or those who showed instability of vital signs, hypoxemia, disorders of the blood biochemistry, or blood gases, liver or kidney failure, convulsion or hypoxic encephalopathy during the study were excluded. In the first three days of admission, each patient underwent monitoring of BIS every sixty minutes for just six hours a day. All the hypnotic drugs were discontinued six hours prior to the start of monitoring and fentanyl was the only opioid, which was administered if an analgesic was required. Statistical analysis were used to evaluate the data and p-value less than 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Mean age of all patients was 43. 6 years with a Standard Deviation (SD) of 18. 96. Presence or absence of frontal lobe injury, had no statistically significant correlations with mean BIS in each three days of study and the mean BIS total. However, mean BIS in the second and third days had statistically significant differences in different types of <b>cranial</b> <b>lesions</b> (contusion, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, etc) which usually have different prognoses.

The majority of the injuries listed were <b>cranial</b> <b>lesions.</b> These were categorized into two groups: those caused by sharp force trauma (henceforth referred to SFT) which left small focused circles or lines and those caused by blunt force trauma (BFT,) resulting in round depressions in the scalp. SFT lesions are generally caused by sharp edged weapons, such as knives, swords and axes. Projectiles, such as arrows or those used by a slingshot should also be considered as SFT objects or items. BFT lesions result from clubs, cudgels and hammers. Perimortem injuries were identified as separate from healed injuries because they often had bone flakes adhered {{to the edges of}} the fractures. Researchers were careful to distinguish between lesions caused by violence and those caused by infectious disease.|$|R

Case Report. We report {{a case of a}} 28 -year-old patient who initially presented with hypesthesia of the fifth cranial nerve and pain of the left ear. Diagnosis showed a tumour localised in the cranial base with a maximum diameter of 4. 1 [*]cm. The diagnosis of LCH was confirmed histologically by biopsy. Diagnostic workup verified the <b>cranial</b> <b>lesion</b> as the sole manifestation of LCH. A total dose of 9 [*]Gy (single dose 1. 8 [*]Gy) was delivered.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{skeletal}} remains {{of an adult}} Sadlermiut woman with obvious trauma to her cranial and post-cranial skeleton were excavated from Native Point (KkHh- 1), Southampton Island, Nunavut, in 1954. In {{order to determine the}} possible cause of this damage, we first documented the skeletal injuries using traditional bioarchaeological techniques. We then created a three-dimensional model of the cranium and mandible to permit better visualization and analysis of the <b>cranial</b> <b>lesions,</b> some of which were obscured by post-depositional weathering. This model was imported into a virtual environment in order to compare the lesions with the craniodental structure of four Arctic carnivore species available as digital models through the Virtual Zooarchaeology of the Arctic Project (VZAP), an online comparative faunal collection. We eliminated all but the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) using this process, which suggested that an individual of this species was responsible for the skeletal trauma. We further identified a minimum number of “bites ” on the cranium, some with overlapping lesions, which suggested a possible attack sequence. Use of a virtual environment and an online comparative collection were critical to this process and represent a new technique for evaluating past skeletal trauma and its causes...|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} showed {{complete}} concordance between the interpretations of PMCT–H and the autopsy findings. One {{of the reasons}} for this result is that CT excels in detection of hemorrhage: two of the three cases with head lesions had intracranial hemorrhage. Furthermore, the number of patients {{in the present study was}} only 13 due to the decreased rate of autopsies with head dissection in our hospital. Thus, the result is seemingly of limited value. However, we would like to emphasize that PMCT-H interpreted by non-radiologists proved to be accurate not only for hemorrhagic and neoplastic lesions, but also for no <b>cranial</b> <b>lesions.</b> Ideally, PMCT should be interpreted by radiologists, especially by those who are familiar with postmortem phenomena. Recently, more sophisticated methods like PMCTA and postmortem MRI have been in use. However, they are not always available in practical settings. Clinicians often have no choice but to assess the presence or absence of lesions employing PMCT without the aid of radiologists when the cause of death is unclear, unless autopsy including head dissection is done. This is not uncommon, at least in Japan, when clinicians are required to write a certificate of death. Furthermore, head dissection is frequently omitted in autopsy practices, as it is difficult to get consent from families.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{treatment}} planning for cancer radiotherapy is to adequately treat the patient's tumor volume while minimizing dose to healthy peritumoral tissue. Most often this planning is accomplished {{with the use}} of computer models that calculate dose distributions within a patient based upon the characteristics of the prescribed external beam(s). At the Ball Memorial Hospital (BMH) Cancer Center, such a system is currently employed for planning conventional teletherapy treatments. Recently, however, the Cancer Center adopted a specialized teletherapy technique that demands a targeting accuracy one order of magnitude greater than conventional radiotherapy. This procedure, called stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), is used to treat <b>cranial</b> <b>lesions</b> with a single, high dose of radiation. For planning such treatments, specialized systems are available for purchase, but at a significant price. Outsourcing the task of SRS planning is also a viable option. However, in-house planning is preferable for the sake of convenience and flexibility in the treatment planning process. At the BMH Cancer Center, an inexpensive in-house modality for SRS treatment planning is currently sought.

5000|$|Feilding {{learned about}} the ancient {{practice}} of trepanation from Bart Huges, whom she met in 1966, and who published a scroll on the topic. The hypothesis that she investigated proposes that trepanation improves cerebral circulation by allowing the [...] "full heartbeat" [...] to express itself inside the cranial cavity, which Feilding hypothesises cannot fully occur after {{the closing of the}} cranial bones in adulthood. To compensate for the relative loss of blood in the brain, she hypothesised that humans developed an internal system of control of blood flow in the brain, which Feilding identifies with the development of the “ego” and the origins of language. Trepanation, Feilding hypothesises, allows increased blood circulation, allowing people to achieve and sustain a slightly higher state of consciousness that she theorises children experience before their cranial bones fuse. Recent research on patients with <b>cranial</b> <b>lesions</b> in collaboration with Prof. Yuri Moskalenko has provided evidence of blood flow changes. This is part of an investigation on the change of intracranial dynamics with age, and ways to increase cranial compliance (which, they theorize, might to help limit the detrimental changes associated with aging).

Material and Methods: This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on NTD diagnosed over the last 8 years and recent fetal surgery referrals. Results: A total of 167 patients were referred for assessment at a median of 19 weeks. <b>Cranial</b> <b>lesions</b> were diagnosed significantly earlier than spinal lesions. Of the open spinal lesions, 77 % were isolated. Of these, 22 % were managed expectantly and 1 (1 %) had fetal surgery. There was no correlation between parental decisions on prenatal management with disease-specific severity markers. We had 14 fetal surgery referrals, all but 1 from beyond our typical referral area; 6 of the assessed patients were operated on, 4 were expectantly managed and 4 requested termination of pregnancy (TOP).
