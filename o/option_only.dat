25|$|While {{reliability}} {{problems were}} {{not uncommon for}} Rolls-Royce's new engine designs of the era, the company's testing department was told to spend all of their time on developing the more powerful Merlin to maturity. As {{a result of the}} Merlin's priority, the unreliable Peregrine was eventually abandoned with production ending in 1942. Other cannon-armed fighters such as the Hawker Typhoon and the Bristol Beaufighter were becoming available and as the Whirlwind had been tightly designed around the Peregrine, changing to a different engine at this stage was not a feasible <b>option.</b> <b>Only</b> 116 Whirlwinds and a corresponding number of Peregrines (301) were built.|$|E
25|$|According to the Ahmadiyya {{understanding}} of Islam, pacifism {{is a strong}} current, and jihad is one's personal inner struggle {{and should not be}} used violently for political motives. Violence is the last <b>option</b> <b>only</b> to be used to protect religion and one's own life in extreme situations of persecution. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, said that in contrary to the current views, Islam does not allow the use of sword in religion, except in the case of defensive wars, wars waged to punish a tyrant, or those meant to uphold freedom.|$|E
25|$|In France, until 1 January 2005, {{children}} were {{required by law}} to take the surname of their father. Article 311-21 of the French Civil code now permits parents to give their children the family name of either their father, mother, or a hyphenation of both – although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, the father's name applies. This brought France into line with a 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requiring member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was echoed by the United Nations in 1979. Similar measures were adopted by Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983) and Spain (1999). The European Community has been active in eliminating gender discrimination. Several cases concerning discrimination in family names have reached the courts. Burghartz v. Switzerland challenged the lack of an option for husbands to add the wife's surname to his surname, which they had chosen as the family name, when this option was available for women. Losonci Rose and Rose v. Switzerland challenged a prohibition on foreign men married to Swiss women keeping their surname if this option was provided in their national law, an option available to women. Unal Tekeli v. Turkey challenged prohibitions on women using their surname as the family name, an <b>option</b> <b>only</b> available to men. The Court found all these laws to be in violation of the Convention.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} engine on both models was AMC's 3.8L inline-6, {{with the}} 2.5L I4, and 4.2L I6 optional, while the 5.0L AMC V8 engine was offered as an <b>option</b> <b>only</b> on the liftback.

The four, sixes, and V8 could be mated to either a standard 4-speed manual transmission or an optional 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission with floor shift, depending on trim and options. A 3-speed manual transmission was only available as a delete option on the sixes.|$|E
2500|$|Many have {{blamed the}} Cross Bronx Expressway for {{worsening}} {{the decay of}} neighborhoods in the South Bronx, with the prominent example being the neighborhood of Tremont. In Robert Caro's The Power Broker, the author argues that Moses intentionally directed the expressway through this neighborhood, {{even though there was}} a more viable <b>option</b> <b>only</b> one block south. Many of the neighborhoods it runs through have been continually poor since before its construction, partly due to the lowered property value caused by the Expressway. This is partially responsible for the public opposition to many other planned expressways in New York City that were later cancelled– in particular, the Lower Manhattan Expressway, [...] and may have provided impetus to expatriate Jane Jacobs in her opposition to the Scarborough Expressway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Architect, Ronald Shiffman, argues that the Cross Bronx Expressway [...] "ripped through the heart of the Bronx, creating what was a wall between what eventually was known as the Northern and Southern part of the Bronx." ...|$|E
