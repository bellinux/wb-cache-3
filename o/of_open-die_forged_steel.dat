40|$|A {{trajectory}} optimization {{approach is}} applied to the design of a sequence <b>of</b> <b>open-die</b> <b>forging</b> operations in order to control the transient thermal response of a large titanium alloy billet. The amount of time tire billet is soaked in furnace prior to each successive forging operation is optimized to minimize the total process time while simultaneously satisfying constraints on the maximum and minimum values of the billet's temperature distribution to avoid microstructural defects during forging. The results indicate that a "differential" heating profile is the most effective at meeting these design goals...|$|R

The device is installed on a tool table <b>of</b> an <b>open-die</b> <b>forging</b> press as easy as ordinary dies. Thereat, the lower case of the device is fixed to the tool table and always remains stationary while the upper case {{is attached to the}} press ram and always travels along with it. When the press ram goes up the upper die also goes up and the side dies are retracted opening the device working space whereto a work piece is fed by a manipulator. When the press ram goes down the work piece is reduced simultaneously by four dies. Then the cycle repeats.|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{maximize}} grain growth <b>of</b> <b>open-die</b> <b>forged</b> 6061 aluminum alloy parts, samples from three of Weber Metals’s suppliers (Hidal Co-Almex USA Inc., TST Inc., and Vista Metals Corp.; to be called Supplier H, Supplier T, Supplier V respectively) were cut into cylinders with diameters of 0. 75 ˝ and heights of 2 ˝, and put through a simulated forging process and heat treatment. It is possible that additional alloying elements may be promoting or inhibiting grain growth in the final part. Maximizing grain growth for aluminum alloy parts results in improved resistance to intergranular corrosion. Samples from each vendor had grain size analysis performed prior to running the experiment. Samples were heated to just over 650 ºF so that when placed in the Instron compression machine for simulated forging they would be between the usual forging temperatures for aluminum of 550 to 650 ºF. Samples were compressed {{at a rate of}} 50 mils/second to final strain values of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 50 %. The samples were then heat treated at 1050 ºF for a soak of 4 hours. This allows for maximum grain growth to occur before being removed and quenched in water to room temperature. A sectioning, sanding to 600 grit sandpaper, etching with 10 % NaOH, and desmut with 33. 33 % nitric acid allows for grain size analysis to determine which vendor had the largest grain size at each strain value. Grain size measurements were made according to the Heyn Lineal Intercept Procedure from ASTM E 0112 - 12. 1 Supplier H’s alloy with 0 % forging strain applied provided the largest average grain size at 1754 µm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the past, {{different}} {{methods have been}} investigated regarding the production of curved workpieces by <b>open-die</b> <b>forging</b> as a significant demand for <b>open-die</b> <b>forged</b> parts with excellent mechanical properties exists. Current ways to produce curved workpieces by <b>open-die</b> <b>forging</b> have the disadvantages of complex preforms and inflexibility. One alternative approach to realize the production of curved workpieces by <b>open-die</b> <b>forging</b> is to actively control the material flow in <b>open-die</b> <b>forging</b> by superimposed manipulator movements during a forging stroke. Since the currently formed material between the forging dies is in a plastic state during the deformation, the required bending forces can be reduced significantly. This concept is investigated in a first study for the cold-forging of an aluminum alloy by numerical simulation and experiments on laboratory scale. For the process, the bite ratio, height reduction and the intended bending angle were identified as most important process parameters. Both numerical and experimental investigation proved the feasibility of the process principle since the bending forces, moments and the bending work can be reduced significantly...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{drive toward}} higher operating efficiency, greater reliability and longer life of steam turbines {{has introduced a}} need for higher integrity components to operate at higher temperatures and pressures. This poses several material and processing challenges {{to ensure that the}} components have metallurgical stability and the required mechanical properties in the high temperature environment. Modelling the <b>open-die</b> press <b>forging</b> process, used to manufacture steam turbine discs from cast ingots, is complex due to the variation of strain, strain rate and temperature within the ingot. These variations mean that recrystallisation and grain growth do not occur uniformly throughout the ingot. Severe plastic deformation is used to promote recrystallisation in order to refine the grain size and improve strength and toughness properties. A major part of the modelling described in this paper involves prediction and validation of strain, strain rate and temperature distributions during <b>open-die</b> <b>forging.</b> A sensitivity study has confirmed the requirement for accurate thermal and physical data such as Interfacial Heat Transfer Coefficient (IHTC), work-piece emissivity, specific heat and friction coefficient. In this paper experimental determination of these data for the grade of heat resistant steel being modelled, over process parameter ranges appropriate to <b>open-die</b> <b>forging</b> operations, is described. Incorporation of these data into a finite element-based model for strain variation within an ingot is reported with consideration and measurement of dead zone for thermo-mechanical simulation trials...|$|R
