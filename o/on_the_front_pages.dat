5|$|In his 1998 {{autobiography}} For the Love of the Game, Jordan {{wrote that}} he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992. The added exhaustion due to the Dream Team run in the 1992 Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers around the world.|$|E
5|$|Altgens recovered, and {{his next}} {{photograph}} showed the First Lady {{with her hand}} on the vehicle's trunk lid and Secret Service agent Clint Hill standing on the bumper behind her as the driver had begun to accelerate. This photograph was quickly reproduced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E

5|$|Altgens was on {{assignment}} for the AP when he captured two historic images on November 22, 1963. The second photograph, showing First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy {{toward the rear}} of the presidential limousine and Secret Service agent Clint Hill on its bumper, was reproduced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers around the world. Within days, Altgens' preceding photograph became controversial after people began to question whether accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was visible in the main doorway of the Texas School Book Depository as the gunshots were fired at JFK.|$|E
5|$|The NBC radio crew {{aboard the}} lead bomber made its live {{broadcast}} coast-to-coast as the bombers flew by the Rex. The Army's low-altitude photographs were featured {{the next day}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of hundreds of newspapers. Eaker exploited a trust of Americans in radio broadcasts and in photography, particular to that era, to bolster the credibility of Air Corps claims that air power was essential in defending the western hemisphere. In addition to the Rex episode, the May 1938 maneuvers conducted a well-publicized mock attack on New York City, and arranged the first voluntary blackout in the United States, also planned by Eaker, during a mock raid on Farmingdale, New York, on 16 May.|$|E

25|$|Dealing {{with the}} Prize, Bunin donated 100,000 francs to a {{literary}} charity fund, {{but the process}} of money distribution caused controversy among his fellow Russian émigré writers. It was during this time that Bunin's relationship deteriorated with Zinaida Gippius and Dmitry Merezhkovsky (a fellow Nobel Prize nominee who once suggested that they divide the Prize between the two, should one of them get it, and had been refused). Although reluctant {{to become involved in}} politics, Bunin was now feted as both a writer and the embodiment of non-Bolshevik Russian values and traditions. His travels throughout Europe featured prominently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of the Russian emigre press {{for the remainder of the}} decade.|$|E
25|$|During the Iraq War, Staff Sergeant Popaditch was {{assigned}} as a tank commander and platoon sergeant. Participating in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, his unit gained fame when it helped topple {{the statue of}} Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square on April 9, 2003. Associated Press photographer Laurent Rebours photographed Popaditch in his tank’s cupola, smoking a cigar with the statue of Saddam looming in the background. The image, which earned him the nickname “The Cigar Marine,” appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers {{around the world to}} describe the Battle of Baghdad. He would later reveal that his smoking was a celebration of his and his wife's twelfth wedding anniversary as well as victory. Following his return to the United States, he was promoted to gunnery sergeant and volunteered to return to Iraq in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The Antonescus were ktitors {{of three}} Romanian Orthodox churches in {{separate}} Bucharest areas: Mărgeanului Church in Rahova, one in Dămăroaia, and the Saints Constantine and Helena Church in Muncii, {{where they are}} depicted in a mural. In 1941, after floods took a toll on Argeș County, the two founded Antonești, a model village in Corbeni (partly built by Ukrainian prisoners of war, and later passed into state property). Although her picture was a regular presence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers and magazines, Maria Antonescu was nevertheless perceived by some of her contemporaries as a withdrawn and secondary figure. Accounts of her life were provided by various public figures, including Princess Ileana (who met her shortly before leaving the country in 1947) and anti-communist members of the Romanian diaspora. Some mentions of her were made in Bénie sois-tu, prison ("Bless You, Prison"), a best-selling book of memoirs by Nicole Valéry Grossu, a former Mislea inmate and defector to France.|$|E

25|$|Laurents {{was soon}} hired {{to write the}} {{screenplay}} for a remake of the 1934 Greta Garbo film The Painted Veil for Ava Gardner. While in Hollywood, he contacted Bernstein, who was in town conducting at the Hollywood Bowl. The two met at The Beverly Hills Hotel, and the conversation turned to juvenile delinquent gangs, a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of the morning newspapers due to a Chicano turf war. Bernstein suggested they rework East Side Story and set it in Los Angeles, but Laurents felt he was more familiar with Puerto Rican immigrants and Harlem than he was with Mexican Americans and Olvera Street. The two contacted Robbins, who was enthusiastic about a musical with a Latin beat. He arrived in Hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for The King and I, and he and Laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects, keeping in touch with Bernstein, who had returned to New York. When the producer of The Painted Veil replaced Gardner with Eleanor Parker and asked Laurents to revise his script with her in mind, he {{backed out of the}} film, freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} printed {{editions of}} Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies appeared after Christmas 1756. [...] Published by [...] "H.

[...] Each edition comprises an attractive pocketbook, [...] "beautifully packaged... in the modish style of the twelves". They usually contain no more than 150pages of relatively thin paper, on which are printed the details of between 120 and 190prostitutes then working in Covent Garden. [...] Priced in 1788 at two shillings and sixpence, Harris's List was affordable for the middle classes but expensive for a working class man.|$|E
500|$|In October 1955, the Jackson Daily News {{reported}} {{facts about}} Till's father {{that had been}} suppressed by the U.S. military. While serving in Italy, Louis Till raped two women and killed a third. He was court-martialed and executed by hanging by the Army near Pisa in July 1945. Mamie Till Bradley and her family knew none of this, having been told only that Louis had been killed for [...] "willful misconduct." [...] Mississippi senators James Eastland and John C. Stennis probed Army records and revealed Louis Till's crimes. Although Emmett Till's murder trial was over, news about his father was carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of Mississippi newspapers for weeks in October and November 1955. This renewed debate about Emmett Till's actions and Carolyn Bryant's integrity. Stephen Whitfield writes {{that the lack of}} attention paid to identifying or finding Till is [...] "strange" [...] compared to the amount of published discourse about his father. According to historians Davis Houck and Matthew Grindy, [...] "Louis Till became a most important rhetorical pawn in the high-stakes game of north versus south, black versus white, NAACP versus White Citizens' Councils".|$|E
