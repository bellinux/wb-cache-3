40|$|A {{new type}} of thermal barrier coating (TBC) based on metal-glass {{composite}} (MGC) consisting of an <b>ordinary</b> <b>container</b> glass and a NiCoCrAIY-alloy has been recently presented. This TBC material provides the possibility to easily adjust its thermal expansion coefficient to match the substrate by changing the metal to glass ratio of the composite. Vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) has been applied as a possible technologies for deposition of MGC coatings. Isothermal oxidation tests were carried out in air at temperatures of 950, 1000, and 1050 degrees C, respectively. Thermal cycling tests were carried out by applying a temperature gradient across the sample thickness by heating with an open flame of natural gas followed by removal of the burner and air cooling. Changes in the microstructure were examined by means of microscopy, microanalysis, and x-ray powder diffraction. For long-time annealing at high temperatures, a progressive degradation of the glass matrix as well as oxidation of the metal phases cannot be fully suppressed up to now. By lowering the effective temperature at the MGC layer when used as an intermediate layer, the degradation of the MGC can be reduced without losing its advanced features with respect to creeping and gas-tightness. Additional concepts for improved oxidation resistance of the MGC based on suitable heat treatments and on alternative glass compositions have been developed, and primary results are shown. Evaluation of results from isothermal oxidation experiments and from thermal cycling in burner-rig facilities validates a clear improvement of the lifetime of the coatings compared with earlier results...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that 92 per cent of the total radiation emitted by radium in equilibrium with its subsequent products is given off in the form of α-rays. This, however, cannot be utilized when the source is enclosed in an <b>ordinary</b> <b>container,</b> because the α-rays are absorbed completely by even a small thickness of glass. About 3. 2 per cent of the total radiation is emitted in the form of β-rays, and 4. 8 per cent as gamma radiation. The effects produced on the radiated mice of these experiments were due mainly to the β-rays, which are easily absorbed by tissue. The γ-rays, being only slightly absorbed by organic matter, probably contributed very little to the observed effects. It is interesting to correlate the different effects produced by the same dose of radiation. The mice which received a dose of 1. 9 millicurie hours showed no local effects on the skin or hair. Neither females nor males were sterilized, and the time at which they opened their eyes or reached sexual maturity was not affected, as far as we could tell. The only difference noted between the radiated animals and the controls was in the body weight. This dose accelerated the growth of the young mice, that is, while initially of the same weight, soon after irradiation they became distinctly bigger than the controls, but finally the animals of each group had substantially the same average weight. That this variation in body weight should be accidental is unlikely, since it was observed also in the animals treated by a slightly larger dose (2. 4 millicurie hours). The number of animals (seven) which showed this effect is too small to prove conclusively the accelerating effect of small doses of radiation on the body growth of mice. But considering that similar results have been. obtained by radiating plants and beetles, it is reasonable that the observed increase in weight might be attributed, at least in part, to the effects of radiation. Since this paper was first written Russ, Chambers, and Scott have shown that small doses of x-rays accelerate the body growth of rats. In view of this additional evidence {{there can be little doubt}} that the increase in weight observed in our experiments was due to the radiation. A dose of 2. 4 millicurie hours applied over the backs of the animals produced no local skin effects, but it accelerated the growth of the mice as in the previous case. In addition it caused permanent sterilization of all the females. A similar result was obtained with 4. 9 millicurie hours, except that the effect on the rate of growth was uncertain. A dose of 6. 8 millicurie hours produced a definite but mild skin erythema and retarded the development of lanugo hair. But since in this instance the emanation was applied over the heads of the animals, the dose reaching the ovaries was not sufficient to cause sterilization, as already explained. No other definite effect was noted. In connection with the sterilization of the females it should be noted that a dose of radiation which produced no visible skin changes was sufficient to cause permanent sterility. On account of the greater distance of the ovaries from the source of radiation as compared with that of the skin directly below the tube, and the depth of tissue which the rays had to traverse to reach the ovaries, the amount of radiation acting on the latter was much smaller than the amount falling on the skin. The radiation emitted by the emanation tube is reduced to about 50 per cent of its initial value after traversing 1 mm. of tissue. Still, while the skin was not visibly affected, the mice were sterilized. This shows that the ovaries are influenced very easily by radiation of this type. We can estimate the amount of radiation reaching the ovaries which is sufficient to cause sterility to be less than 25 per cent of the amount necessary to produce visible skin changes in the mice. It should be noted also that whenever sterility of the female mice was induced, it was permanent. Furthermore, those mice which were not rendered sterile by radiation were, as far as the experiments enable us to say, as prolific as the controls. Remembering that a dose of 1. 9 millicurie hours had no apparent effect on the ovaries, while a slightly larger dose, 2. 4 millicurie hours, caused permanent sterility, it might be concluded that it is not possible to produce temporary sterility by radiation. We know, however, that temporary sterility can be produced, at least when the animals are radiated at a later stage in their development. The mice in our experiments were radiated for the first time soon after birth, and it is not improbable that under these conditions temporary sterility cannot be obtained. Large sublethal doses produced severe skin burns, retarded the body growth of the animals, but failed to sterilize the males. About one-third of the total skin area of the mice showed marked effects from the radiation. The animals were very sick for a time, and their growth was temporarily stunted. But nevertheless they recovered and finally became apparently normal except for the narrow hairless strip of skin which had been closest to the emanation tube. Only the females were rendered permanently sterile. The males did not show even temporary sterility when the doses of radiation were close to the lethal dose. While the testes of mammals are known to be very easily affected by radiation, still they are more resistant than the ovaries. In addition, in these experiments they were at a greater distance from the source of radiation than the ovaries, and they were better protected by the thicker layer of tissue in the path of the rays. The fact that no sublethal dose in these experiments sterilized the males shows that under the conditions of irradiation adopted the amount of radiation reaching the testes was not sufficient to affect them noticeably. If the source of radiation had been applied closer to the reproductive organs of the males, they would have been sterilized by millicurie hour doses much smaller than the lethal dose. Some of the radiated animals were killed with ether, and macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the reproductive organs were made. The ovaries of the sterile females were generally atrophied and colored yellow. The normal histological structure was altered. The characteristic findings were the destruction of the Graafian follicles, with absence of ovum cells. The testes and the epididymis of the radiated mice of the present experiment appeared macroscopically and histologically normal, with the presence of abundant spermatozoa. Owing to the method adopted for the irradiation of the mice, the testes were too far from the source of radiation, and too well protected by the intervening tissue to be definitely affected by the rays...|$|E

The density and shielding performance of the mortar prepared with ordinary crushed (lead-free) glass was similar to the control mortar. However, a significant enhancement of radiation-shielding was achieved when the CRT glasses were used due to the presence of lead in the glass. In addition, the radiation shielding contribution of CRT glasses was more pronounced when the mortar was subject to a higher level of X-ray energy.

40|$|Abstract—Arguably, an {{important}} amount of scientific software development time {{is likely to}} be employed on user interfaces. In particular, science gateways have gained increasing interest from the e-Science community because of their convenience to hide the complexity of the underlying resources that give support to the management of scientific data and to the execution of scientific applications. Based on our previous experience with the development of science gateways for diverse application domains in the Brazilian National HPC Network (SINAPAD), we have devised a rapid prototyping strategy to lower the barrier for scientific application developers to launch new science gateways. In this paper we present such strategy, which is based on two main tools. The first tool implements a gateway engine that can be configured by a small set of XML files. Such files completely define the desired functionality of an specific science gateway in such an engine. The gateway engine also offers other features not commonly found in related technologies, such as file sharing, data provenance tracking, and restricted anonymous access to underlying computational resources. The second tool implements both an editor and a packager for the aforementioned engine, allowing the developer to rapidly deploy and launch a new science gateway in <b>ordinary</b> Web application <b>containers.</b> In this paper we present our results with the use of both tools in the SINAPAD network. We also discuss about the current limitations of such tools, as well as how we have been dealing with such limitations to provide a more comprehensive toolset to developers. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the model ASAM is enriched with new eddy {{viscosity}} based dynamic Smagorinsky subgrid-scale models. Therefore {{the model is}} more physically based to study atmospheric flow configurations at several atmospheric scales with main focus to urban scale flow with building-resolved resolution. The implemented dynamic procedures work well and showed good agreement to literature data. In a convective atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) the dynamic Smagorinsky coefficient reaches maximum values of 0. 15 and decreases towards the surface or in stable stratified flow regimes. Vertical profiles of the Smagorinsky coefficient in a diurnal cycle of ABL depict typical behaviour of the dynamic Smagorinsky coefficient in near surface flow, free-stream, or stable stratified flow. Furthermore a modified inflow generation approach is proposed to produce fully turbulent flow fields. To modify a mean flow turbulent fluctuations are generated by superposition of sinusoidal and cosinesoidal modes. Due {{to the implementation of}} this inflow method the model ASAM has the ability to reproduce a given wind field with information from its mean wind speed and their fluctuation energy spectrum. The model configuration developed in this work is able to reproduce flow structure in a complex urban geometry. The Mock Urban Setting Test (MUST) experiment represent an urban roughness geometry by placing 120 shipping <b>containers</b> <b>ordinary</b> arranged in an array. The used building-resolved resolution is able to capture dynamic flow structures like specific wake flow, recirculation regions or eddy detachment.
