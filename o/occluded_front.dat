5|$|An <b>occluded</b> <b>front</b> {{is formed}} {{during the process}} of {{cyclogenesis}} when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an <b>occluded</b> <b>front,</b> with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an <b>occluded</b> <b>front,</b> with {{thunderstorms}} possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Grace {{originated}} {{from a large}} extratropical cyclone that formed along a cold front on September27, roughly 470mi (755km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Initially attached to an <b>occluded</b> <b>front,</b> the low detached from the system and gradually acquired tropical characteristics. By October1, shower and thunderstorm activity began to develop {{near the center of}} the system as it tracked through the central Azores. However, the following day, convection began to decrease with the system, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) ceased monitoring it. Over the following two days, the system executed a counter-clockwise loop near the Azores. During the afternoon of October4, convection redeveloped around the center of the low and was classified as a tropical storm near São Miguel Island. Although the storm was tropical at this time, the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours.|$|E

A 2 -year climatology of 296 cold, warm, and <b>occluded</b> <b>fronts</b> from a mesosphere–stratosphere–troposphere radar near Aberystwyth, Wales, reveals that 74 % of warm fronts were associated with multiple linear bands representing maxima of vertical wind shear, radar return signal power, or both. In contrast, 51 % of cold fronts lacked any such maxima. Similarly, the warm frontal segments of <b>occluded</b> <b>fronts</b> exhibited more banding than the cold frontal segments.

25|$|Later that week, a {{slow moving}} area of low {{pressure}} from the west of Biscay moved east across the British Isles. At the same time, an associated <b>occluded</b> <b>front</b> moved into Northern England, becoming very active as it did so with the peak rainfall on 15 June. Rainfall records were broken across the region, leading to localised flooding. As it weakened, the front moved north into Scotland on 16 June and left England and Wales with a very unstable airmass, frequent heavy showers, thunderstorms and cloudy conditions. This led to localised flash flooding and prevented significant drying where earlier rains had fallen.|$|E
500|$|In the {{northern}} hemisphere, once a cyclone occludes, a trough of warm air aloft—or [...] "trowal" [...] for short—will {{be caused by}} strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately into its northwestern periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the <b>occluded</b> <b>front.</b> The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the comma-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature.

5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of warm <b>occluded</b> <b>fronts</b> and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.|$|R
500|$|A surface low {{can form}} {{in a variety}} of ways. Topography can create a surface low. Mesoscale {{convective}} systems can spawn surface lows that are initially warm core. The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the front and the low is positioned at the crest. Around the low, the flow becomes cyclonic. This rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator {{on the west side of}} the low, while warm air move towards the pole on the east side. A cold front appears on the west side, while a warm front forms on the east side. Usually, the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and [...] "catches up" [...] with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass out ahead of the cyclone. In addition, the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure, denser cold air mass. The cold front over takes the warm front, and reduces the length of the warm front. At this point an <b>occluded</b> <b>front</b> forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a trowal.|$|E
500|$|Once a cyclone occludes, a trough of {{warm air}} aloft, or [...] "trowal" [...] for short, will {{be caused by}} strong southerly winds on its eastern {{periphery}} rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately northwestern, periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the <b>occluded</b> <b>front.</b> The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the comma-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature. It can also {{be the focus of}} locally heavy precipitation, with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection. Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain. Behind extratropical cyclones during fall and winter, rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. Downwind of islands, bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges. Offshore California, this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.|$|E
500|$|Stratiform (a broad {{shield of}} {{precipitation}} {{with a relatively}} similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur {{as a consequence of}} slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones. A wide variety of weather can be found along an <b>occluded</b> <b>front,</b> with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as ice pellets and snow, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result. Hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds [...] above ground level.|$|E
50|$|As in {{synoptic}} frontal analysis, mesoscale analysis uses cold, warm, and <b>occluded</b> <b>fronts</b> on the mesoscale to help describe phenomena. On weather maps mesoscale fronts {{are depicted}} as smaller and with {{twice as many}} bumps or spikes as the synoptic variety. In the United States, opposition {{to the use of}} the mesoscale versions of fronts on weather analyses, has led to the use of an overarching symbol (a trough symbol) with a label of outflow boundary as the frontal notation.|$|R
500|$|Cold <b>fronts</b> and <b>occluded</b> <b>fronts</b> {{generally}} {{move from}} west to east, while warm fronts move poleward. Because {{of the greater}} density of air in their wake, cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than warm fronts and warm occlusions. Mountains and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts. [...] When a front becomes [...] stationary, and the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes, the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity, known as a shearline. [...] This is most common over the open ocean.|$|R

This work is an extension of a similar study (Mudrick, 1982); emphasis is placed here on adding a frontal zone and other more diverse features to the basic states used.

5|$|Weather fronts {{mark the}} {{boundary}} between two masses of air of different temperature, humidity, and densities, and {{are associated with the}} most prominent meteorological phenomena. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east; warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. Warm fronts move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. <b>Occluded</b> <b>fronts</b> form late in the cyclone life cycle {{near the center of the}} cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.|$|R

50|$|An <b>occluded</b> <b>front</b> {{is formed}} {{during the process}} of {{cyclogenesis}} when a cold front overtakes a warm front.

Nesta investigação foram encontrados como sistemas sinóticos, as zonas frontais (fria, quente, oclusa, secundária e estacionária) e o processo de ciclogênese. Além disso, as precipitações dentro de uma massa de ar foram associadas a nuvens Cb e St e a complexos convectivos de mesoescala (CCM). Foram calculados os valores de precipitação (total-PTM e média-PM, por mês) gerados pelos diferentes sistemas sinóticos e as variações mensais destes valores foram analisadas. As maiores freqüências de precipitação em frentes frias, quentes, em ondas em frentes frias e em nebulosidades ciclogenéticas ocorreram no ano de El Niño. As precipitações nas frentes oclusas e secundárias foram mais freqüentes no ano de La Niña. As precipitações muita intensas em frentes frias, oclusas, em ondas e em extremidades de frentes frias foram mais freqüentes no ano de El Niño. Os valores máximos de PTM foram produzidos por frentes oclusas e ciclones jovens no ano de El Niño. This {{paper is}} an {{observational}} {{study of the}} precipitation events in Pelotas city, associated with synoptic systems and processes during nine months {{of each of the}} following years: La Niña, El Niño and Normal. The synoptic systems found in this study are: the frontal zones (cold, warm, occluded, secondary and stationary fronts) and the cyclogenesis processes. The precipitations inside the air masses were associated with Cb and St clouds and with mesoscale convective complexes (MCC). The precipitation values (total-TMP and average-AP, per month) produced by the different synoptic systems were calculated and the mensal variations of these values were analysed. The highest precipitations frequencies associated with cold and warm fronts, waves and cyclogenetic cloudiness were detected in the El Niño year. The precipitations caused by <b>occluded</b> and secondary <b>fronts</b> were more frequent in the La Niña year. Very heavy precipitations associated with cold and <b>occluded</b> <b>fronts,</b> waves and cold front extremities were found more frequently during the El Niño year.
