40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general {{overview of the}} coin production and circulation in Cyprus during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The paper discusses the coin types and weight standards and tackles questions regarding attribution and circulation. Coin evidence suggests that during the Ptolemaic period the mints in Cyprus contributed actively to the royal production, from the third century onwards. The Ptolemies probably appreciated and exploited the past minting experience of the local kings. During the roman period the relationship between Cyprus and Rome in terms of coin production seems less favorable, compared to that <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>mints</b> in the east. Markou Évangéline.

50|$|To redeem the zerocoin into bitcoin (preferably to a {{new public}} address) {{the owner of the}} coin needs to prove two things by way of a {{zero-knowledge}} proof. (A zero-knowledge proof is a method by which one party can prove to another that a given statement is true, without conveying any additional information apart {{from the fact that the}} statement is indeed true.) The first is that they know a coin C that belongs to the set <b>of</b> all <b>other</b> <b>minted</b> zerocoins (C1, C2,... Cn), without revealing which coin it is. In practice, this is done quickly by use of a one-way accumulator that does not reveal the members of the set. The second is that the person knows a number r, that along with the serial number S corresponds to a zerocoin. The proof and serial number S are posted as a zerocoin spend transaction, where miners verify the proof and that the serial number S has not been spent previously. After verification, the transaction is posted to the blockchain, and the amount of bitcoin equal to the zerocoin denomination is transferred from the zerocoin escrow pool. Anonymity in the transaction is assured because the minted coin C is not linked to the serial number S used to redeem the coin.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the multiple-input/output inverse theorem (MINT) to realize exact inverse {{filtering}} {{has led to the}} proposal of new solution types. Digital processing functions <b>of</b> <b>MINT</b> <b>other</b> than the exact inverse filtering are explored. One such realization of MINT is the selective reception, filtering and distribution of signals in a multichannel system. This is demonstrated with the design of equalizers for a speakerphone system. Practical implementation problems associated with common zeros or close zeros in the channels are discussed and different solutions are proposed to address these issues. One of them is the use of the Minimum Norm Solution with system delay. Finally a novel equalizer structure, based on MINT, is proposed for realizing inverse filtering of a single analog transmission channel. Simulations show that its performance is comparable to that of the conventional equalizer based on the Least Square Error criterion...|$|R
