25|$|A {{large portion}} of the soil has been {{affected}} by over salinity and it has been known to limit the growth of many plants. Globally, the total area of saline soil was 397,000,000 ha and in continents like Africa, it makes up 2 percent of the soil. The amount of soil salinization has reached 19.5% of the irrigated land and 2.1% of the dry-land agriculture around the world. Soil salinization affects the plants using <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential</b> by net solute accumulation. The osmotic pressure in the plant is what maintains water uptake and cell turgor to help with stomatal function and other cellular mechanisms. Over generations, many plant genes have adapted, allowing plants’ phenotypes to change and built different mechanisms to counter salinity effects.|$|E
50|$|Since {{regions of}} soil {{are usually not}} divided by a {{semipermeable}} membrane, the <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential</b> typically has a negligible influence on the mass movement of water in soils. On the other hand, <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential</b> has an extreme influence on the rate of water uptake by plants. If soils are high in soluble salts, the <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential</b> {{is likely to be}} lower in the soil solution than in the plant root cells. In such cases, the soil solution would severely restrict the rate of water uptake by plants. In salty soils, the <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential</b> of soil water may be so low that the cells in young seedlings start to collapse (plasmolyze).|$|E
50|$|A soil {{solution}} also experiences <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential.</b> The <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential</b> {{is made possible}} due {{to the presence of}} both inorganic and organic solutes in the {{soil solution}}. As water molecules increasingly clump around solute ions or molecules, the freedom of movement, and thus the potential energy, of the water is lowered. As the concentration of solutes is increased, the <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential</b> of the soil solution is reduced. Since water has a tendency to move toward lower energy levels, water will want to travel toward the zone of higher solute concentrations. Although, liquid water will only move in response to such differences in <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential</b> if a semipermeable membrane exists between the zones of high and low <b>osmotic</b> <b>potential.</b> A semipermeable membrane is necessary because it allows water through its membrane while preventing solutes from moving through its membrane. If no membrane is present, movement of the solute, rather than of the water, largely equalizes concentrations.|$|E

Tall wheatgrass had higher emergence and establishment on a nonsaline and a saline soil (electrical conductivity of the saturation extract of 7 dS·m- 1) over a range of spring precipitation as simulated by sprinkler irrigation. Basin wildrye will require supplemental irrigation to establish on soils of similar salinity. In the absence of precipitation, soil salinity increases and matric and <b>osmotic</b> <b>potentials</b> rapidly decrease as the surface soil dries in late spring. Germination and growth responses in relation to salinity and drought in laboratory experiments were consistent with emergence and establishment results in the field experiments.

Tall wheatgrass had greater root and shoot yield than basin wildrye when <b>osmotic</b> <b>potentials</b> in sand cultures were decreased by solutions of NaCl, Na 2 SO 4 and CaCl 2. Tall wheatgrass is more tolerant of salt and boron than basin wildrye, but basin wildrye is highly salt tolerant compared to most forage species.
