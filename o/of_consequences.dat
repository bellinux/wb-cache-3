In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number <b>of</b> <b>consequences.</b> First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted {{less than a quarter of}} a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Tommy Vercetti (Ray Liotta), a loyal {{former member}} of the Forelli Family, is {{released}} from prison after serving a fifteen-year sentence. His former boss, Sonny Forelli (Tom Sizemore), ostensibly promotes Tommy to a caporegime and sends him to Vice City to act as the Forelli's buyer in a cocaine deal and to also do other ground work for the Forellis. When Tommy and his bodyguards arrive in Vice City crooked lawyer Ken Rosenberg (William Fichtner) takes them in his car to the docks; the site of the deal. They are ambushed by several masked men, who kill their bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, losing the Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. After Ken returns to his office, Tommy drives back to his hotel and informs Sonny, promising him under the threat <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> to get back the drugs and money and kill whoever was responsible for the ambush.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the egoistic, altruistic and biospheric {{awareness}} <b>of</b> the <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> high school students regarding the loss of bio-diversity, then comparing the results on the basis of some independent variables (gender, class and family income). The research data were collected from 884 ninth and tenth grade high school students through the survey on the <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> awareness of the loss of bio-diversity. According to the outcome of the research, students believed in biospheric, egoistic and altruistic results at the similar levels. While the impact of gender and family income on biospheric, altruistic and egoistic awareness <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> is not so significant, the impact of class is significant on biospheric and altruistic awareness <b>of</b> <b>consequence.</b> Finally, class level and school variables may lead to the prediction <b>of</b> awareness <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> on loss <b>of</b> bio-diversity; school type-family income, parent education levels not. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{two main}} {{philosophical}} approaches to animal rights are utilitarian and rights-based. The former is exemplified by Peter Singer, {{and the latter}} by Tom Regan and Gary Francione. Their differences reflect a distinction philosophers draw between ethical theories that judge the rightness of an act by its consequences (consequentialism/teleological ethics, or utilitarianism), and those {{that focus on the}} principle behind the act, almost regardless <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> (deontological ethics). Deontologists argue that there are acts we should never perform, even if failing to do so entails a worse outcome.|$|E

It led to a steady emigration, particularly of the young and ambitious, to the new Greek empires in the east. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch and the many other new Hellenistic cities founded in Alexander's wake, {{as far away as}} what are now Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom survived {{until the end of the}} 1st century BC.|$|E

25|$|Special {{relativity}} {{implies a}} wide range <b>of</b> <b>consequences,</b> which have been experimentally verified, including length contraction, time dilation, relativistic mass, mass–energy equivalence, a universal speed limit and relativity of simultaneity. It has replaced the conventional notion of an absolute universal time {{with the notion of}} a time that is dependent on reference frame and spatial position. Rather than an invariant time interval between two events, there is an invariant spacetime interval. Combined with other laws of physics, the two postulates of special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy, as expressed in the mass–energy equivalence formula E=mc2, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} when the Sramanic {{movements}} {{shared the same}} philosophical concepts, the details varied. In Jainism, for example, Karma is based on materialist element philosophy, where Karma is the fruit of one's action conceived as material particles which stick to a soul and keep it away from natural omniscience. The Buddha conceived Karma as a chain of causality leading to attachment of the material world and hence to rebirth. The Ajivikas were fatalists and elevated Karma as inescapable fate, where a person's life goes through a chain <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> and rebirths until it reaches its end. Other śramaṇa movements such as those led by Pakkudha Kaccayana and Purana Kashyapa, denied the existence of Karma.|$|E

25|$|If {{a single}} person makes and sells donuts and decides to try jalapeño flavoring, they would likely know {{on the same day}} whether their {{decision}} was good or not, based on the reaction of customers. A decision-maker at a huge company that makes donuts may not know for many months if such a decision worked out or not, especially if their research or marketing team fails to respond in a timely manner. By that time, the decision-makers may very well have moved on to another division or company and thus see no consequence from their decision. This lack <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> can lead to poor decisions and cause an upward-sloping average cost curve.|$|E
25|$|While {{the most}} recent RCMP {{operational}} manual, completed in 2007, correctly refers to the CEW as a prohibited firearm, a number <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> of this error in classification remain to be dealt with, by both the RCMP and other Canadian police services. Consequently, {{it could be argued}} the police in Canada may not have had the proper authority under their provincial policing Acts and Regulation to use the CEW in the first place. The point of unauthorized use by the police was also raised by Dirk Ryneveld, British Columbia's Police Complaint Commissioner at the Braidwood inquiry on June 25, 2008. Taser safety and issues have been extensively rehearsed and investigated after the Robert Dziekański Taser incident at Vancouver International Airport.|$|E
25|$|Even if karma is denied, God still {{cannot be}} the {{enforcer}} <b>of</b> <b>consequences.</b> Because {{the motives of}} an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives {{are assumed to be}} egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of prakriti and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the Vedas, according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the algebras <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> operators and finite consequence operators {{on a fixed}} language. Significant new collections <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> operators are defined and shown to be complete and distributive sublattices. Further, the collection <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> operators is shown to be almost atomic. Other lattice theoretic properties are investigated and useful chain properties are obtained. In the last section, natural languages, and associated consequence operators, are encoded and embedded into a nonstandard structure. The entire basic theory <b>of</b> nonstandard <b>consequence</b> operators is developed in this last section. Comment: Plain Tex, 11 pages. In this version, an important clarification is made in Remark 4. 6 and one significant statement that applies more directly to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem is added. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:astro-ph/ 990311...|$|R

25|$|Several factors destabilized the {{situation}} {{at the outset of}} the Iron Age. Climate cooling caused a degradation of the Asian steppes which forced the nomadic people who lived there to move out and started a chain <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> – horsemen from the steppe armed with iron weapons were able to penetrate large areas of Europe. The Europeans responded by building large fortified settlements, adopting the warring methods of the Asian invaders, developing a specialized military caste and a strong power system based on a prince-ruler. The Hallstatt culture, which developed west and south of Poland, itself imitating the Mediterranean civilizations and cultivating close contacts with them, turned out to be a major influence on the Lusatian people on Polish lands, whose culture reached its peak during the 750–550 BC period.|$|E
