5|$|Allan Ramsay (1713–84) {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. He undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors, but also more intimate works like that of Queen Charlotte and her Children (c. 1755). His work has been seen as anticipating the Grand Manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> <b>are</b> less formal and more intimate studies.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{declaration}} of the year 1975 as the year <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and that decade as women's decade, several issues related to women came into focus of scholars.

5|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{estimates}} that 35% {{of women in}} the world have experienced physical or sexual violence over their lifetime and that the commonest situation is intimate partner violence. 30% of women in relationships report such experience, and 38% of murders <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> due to intimate partners. These figures may be as high as 70% in some regions. Risk factors include low educational achievement, a parental experience of violence, childhood abuse, gender inequality and cultural attitudes that allow violence to be considered more acceptable.|$|E

50|$|Marriage in Hong Kong is {{becoming}} {{based on personal}} happiness and romantic satisfaction, {{as opposed to the}} traditional marriage based on duty and the expectation to stay with one's spouse, regardless <b>of</b> the situation. <b>Women</b> now have more of a say in who they wish to marry, and if the marriage does not work out according to planned, are able to openly consider divorce. Traditional marriage values are becoming less important. In general, divorce has become more common and socially acceptable. Consequently, more individuals in Hong Kong than ever before are single. However, {{it is important to note}} that in China marriage is based on strong family ties and relationships, despite any lack of romance. Therefore, if one were to propose divorce, he or she would risk losing all contact with family. As of 2011, 49.0% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> married, 8.7% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> widowed, 4.4% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> divorced, 0.6% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> separated, and 37.3% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> had never <b>been</b> married.|$|R

5|$|The Egyptians also {{interacted with}} deities through the {{donation}} of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae. Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving {{portions of the}} temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, {{so many of these}} statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor. Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.|$|E
5|$|The first {{significant}} Scottish portrait artist was George Jameson, who {{became one of}} the most successful painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright. In this period the full-length portrait in Highland dress became a common form of painting. William Aikman emerged as the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation. He, like most Scottish painters of note before the late eighteenth century, migrated to London. John Alexander and William Mossman painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Allan Ramsay established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. He later focused on royal portraits, anticipating the grand manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> <b>are</b> less formal and more intimate. The leading portrait painter of the second half of the century was Henry Raeburn, the {{first significant}} artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland, his subjects went beyond the nobility to the middle classes. His pupils included the brothers William (Alexander), Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The former two brothers founded the Columbian Academy of Painting in New York, and Andrew was the leading Scottish miniaturist of his day.|$|E
