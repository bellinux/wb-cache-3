25|$|Prokaryotic {{chromosomes}} {{have less}} sequence-based structure than eukaryotes. Bacteria typically have a one-point (the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication)</b> from which replication starts, whereas some archaea contain multiple replication origins.

40|$|AbstractEukaryotic DNA is {{organized}} into domains or loops {{generated by the}} attachment of chromatin fibers to the nuclear matrix via specific regions called scaffold or matrix attachment regions. The role of these regions in DNA replication is currently under investigation since they {{have been found in}} close association with <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> Also, viral DNA sequences, containing the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication,</b> have been found attached to the nuclear matrix. To investigate the functional role of this binding we have studied, in Raji cells, the interaction between Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> and the nuclear matrix in relation to the viral cycle of infection. We report here that both the latent (ori P) and the lytic (ori Lyt) EBV <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> are attached to the nuclear matrix, the first during the latent cycle of infection and the second after induction of the lytic cycle. These findings suggest that the binding <b>of</b> the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> with the nuclear matrix modulates viral replication and expression in the two different phases of infection...|$|R

25|$|At {{the onset}} of S phase, the pre-replicative complex must be {{activated}} by two S phase-specific kinases in order to form an initiation complex at an <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> One kinase is the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase called Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) {{and the other is}} cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Chromatin-binding assays of Cdc45 in yeast and Xenopus have shown that a downstream event of CDK action is loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin. Cdc6 has been speculated to be a target of CDK action, because of the association between Cdc6 and CDK, and the CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6. The CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6 has been considered to be required for entry into the S phase.|$|E
25|$|Minichromosome {{maintenance}} proteins {{have been}} found to be required for DNA helicase activity and inactivation of any of the six Mcm proteins prevents further progression of the replication fork. This is consistent with the requirement of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 function to assemble the Mcm proteins at the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> The complex containing all six Mcm proteins creates a hexameric, doughnut like structure with a central cavity. The helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex raises the question of how the ring-like complex is loaded onto the single-stranded DNA. One possibility is that the helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex can oscillate between an open and a closed ring formation to allow single-stranded DNA loading.|$|E

25|$|When {{compared}} to prokaryotic DNA <b>replication,</b> the completion <b>of</b> eukaryotic DNA <b>replication</b> {{is more complex}} and involves multiple <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> and replicative proteins to accomplish. Prokaryotic DNA is arranged in a circular shape, and has only one replication origin when replication starts. By contrast, eukaryotic DNA is linear.

5000|$|Eukaryotes {{often have}} {{multiple}} <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> on each linear chromosome that initiate {{at different times}} (replication timing), with up to 100,000 present in a single human cell.

25|$|The genome sizes {{range from}} 4.5–6kb and is circular. It encodes 11 genes (in order: A, A*, B, C, K, D, E, J, F, G, and H), nine {{of which are}} essential. The nonessential genes are E and K. Several of the genes have {{overlapping}} reading frames. Protein A* is encoded within protein A. It lacks ~1/3 of the amino acids from the N terminal of the A protein and is encoded in the same frame as the A protein. It is translated from an internal start site within the messenger RNA. Gene E is encoded with gene D with a +1 frameshift. Gene K overlaps genes A, B, and C. The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> lies within a 30 base sequence.

25|$|The E2 protein {{serves as}} a master {{transcriptional}} regulator for viral promoters located primarily in the long control region. The protein has a transactivation domain linked by a relatively unstructured hinge region to a well-characterized DNA binding domain. E2 facilitates the binding of E1 to the viral <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> E2 also utilizes a cellular protein known as Bromodomain-4 (Brd4) to tether the viral genome to cellular chromosomes. This tethering to the cell's nuclear matrix ensures faithful distribution of viral genomes to each daughter cell after cell division. It is thought that E2 {{serves as a}} negative regulator of expression for the oncogenes E6 and E7 in latently HPV-infected basal layer keratinocytes. Genetic changes, such as integration of the viral DNA into a host cell chromosome, that inactivate E2 expression tend to increase {{the expression of the}} E6 and E7 oncogenes, resulting in cellular transformation and possibly further genetic destabilization.|$|E
25|$|The end {{replication}} {{problem is}} handled in eukaryotic cells by telomere regions and telomerase. Telomeres extend the 3' {{end of the}} parental chromosome beyond the 5' end of the daughter strand. This single-stranded DNA structure can act as an <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> that recruits telomerase. Telomerase is a specialized DNA polymerase that consists of multiple protein subunits and an RNA component. The RNA component of telomerase anneals to the single stranded 3' end of the template DNA and contains 1.5 copies of the telomeric sequence. Telomerase contains a protein subunit that is a reverse transcriptase called telomerase reverse transcriptase or TERT. TERT synthesizes DNA {{until the end of}} the template telomerase RNA and then disengages. This process can be repeated as many times as needed with the extension of the 3' end of the parental DNA molecule. This 3' addition provides a template for extension of the 5' end of the daughter strand by lagging strand DNA synthesis. Regulation of telomerase activity is handled by telomere-binding proteins.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAssessment of {{the impact}} <b>of</b> DNA <b>replication</b> on genome {{architecture}} in Eukaryotes has long been hampered by the scarcity of experimental data. Recent work, relying on computational predictions <b>of</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication,</b> suggested that replication might be {{a major determinant of}} gene organization in human (Huvet et al., 2007). Here, we address this question by analyzing the first large-scale dataset <b>of</b> experimentally determined <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> in human: 283 origins identified in HeLa cells, in 1 % of the genome covered by ENCODE regions (Cadoret et al., 2008). We show that <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> are not randomly distributed, as they display significant overlap with promoter regions and CpG islands. The hypothesis of a selective pressure to avoid frontal collisions between replication and transcription polymerases is not supported by experimental data, as we find no evidence for gene orientation bias in the proximity <b>of</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> The lack <b>of</b> a significant orientation bias remains manifest even when considering only genes expressed at a high rate, or in a wide number of tissues, and is not affected by the regional replication timing. Gene expression breadth {{does not appear to be}} correlated with the distance from the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> We conclude that the impact <b>of</b> DNA <b>replication</b> on human genome organization is considerably weaker than previously proposed...|$|R

25|$|During the G1 {{stage of}} the cell cycle, the {{replication}} initiation factors, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) protein complex, bind sequentially to DNA to form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). At the transition of the G1 stage to the S phase of the cell cycle, S phase–specific cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase (DDK) transform the pre-RC into an active replication fork. During this transformation, the pre-RC is disassembled {{with the loss of}} Cdc6, creating the initiation complex. In addition to the binding of the Mcm proteins, cell division cycle 45 (Cdc45) protein is also essential for initiating DNA replication. Studies have shown that Mcm is critical for the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin and this complex containing both Mcm and Cdc45 is formed {{at the onset of the}} S phase of the cell cycle. Cdc45 targets the Mcm protein complex, which has been loaded onto the chromatin, as a component of the pre-RC at the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> during the G1 {{stage of the}} cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|The Mitochondrial DNA Polymerase (Pol gamma, encoded by the POLG gene) {{is used in}} the copying of mtDNA during replication. Because the two (heavy and light) strands on the {{circular}} mtDNA molecule have different origins of replication, it replicates in a D-loop mode. One strand begins to replicate first, displacing the other strand. This continues until replication reaches the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> on the other strand, at which point the other strand begins replicating in the opposite direction. This results in two new mtDNA molecules. Each mitochondrion has several copies of the mtDNA molecule and the number of mtDNA molecules is a limiting factor in mitochondrial fission. After the mitochondrion has enough mtDNA, membrane area, and membrane proteins, it can undergo fission (very similar to that which bacteria use) to become two mitochondria. Evidence suggests that mitochondria can also undergo fusion and exchange (in a form of crossover) genetic material among each other. Mitochondria sometimes form large matrices in which fusion, fission, and protein exchanges are constantly occurring. mtDNA shared among mitochondria (despite the fact that they can undergo fusion).|$|E
25|$|Molecular cloning {{refers to}} the process of making {{multiple}} molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole genes, {{but it can also be}} used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters, non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from genetic fingerprinting to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in positional cloning. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication,</b> which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised cloning vectors (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow protein production, affinity tagging, single stranded RNA or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.|$|E

25|$|Following {{successful}} recombination of {{the linear}} DNA {{to the target}} genome, plasmid origins and markers can be re-used {{as a result of}} the plasmid curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37oC, denatures the plasmid. This allows for easy plasmid curing that does not include any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX plasmid, another pKDsg-XXX plasmid with a different sgRNA can subsequently be transfected into the E. coli cells to introduce further mutations to the target cellular sequences. After all mutations are introduced, both plasmids should be cured. Unfortunately, the pCas9cr4 plasmid lacks an inherent curing mechanism, so Reisch and Prather pioneered a plasmid curing mechanism by introducing a pKDsgRNA whose sgRNA is complement to the pCas9cr4 plasmid. Specifically, they constructed a pKDsg-p15A which targeted the p15A <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> of the pCas9cr4 plasmid. After recombinants were selected for, expression of Cas9 and sgRNA was induced with the addition of aTc. After plating on selective plates and growing at 37oC, they observed no colony formation on the LB plates containing chloramphenicol indicating loss of the pCas9cr4 plasmid due to a Cas9-mediated double strand break in the plasmid. Additional plasmid mini-preps demonstrated that neither plasmid was retained in the cells, therefore indicating plasmid curing. This technique can easily be applied to curing other plasmids as well.|$|E
