25|$|In {{his first}} term, Bush {{appointed}} Colin Powell as Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State.</b> <b>Powell</b> {{was the first}} African-American man to serve in that position, and was succeeded by Condoleezza Rice: Rice became the first African-American woman to hold the post. In 2005, he appointed Alberto Gonzales as the United States Attorney General, the first Hispanic to hold that position.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} from the role of Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> <b>Powell</b> returned to private life. In April 2005, he was privately telephoned by Republican senators Lincoln Chafee and Chuck Hagel, at which time Powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations, but refrained from advising the senators to oppose Bolton (Powell had clashed with Bolton during Bush's first term). The decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to Bolton's chances of confirmation. Bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{military}} retirement, Powell wrote his best-selling autobiography, My American Journey. In addition, he pursued {{a career as}} a public speaker, addressing audiences across the country and abroad. Prior to his appointment as Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> <b>Powell</b> was the chairman of America's Promise - The Alliance for Youth, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to mobilizing people from every sector of American life to build the character and competence of young people. He was nominated by President Bush on December 16, 2000 as Secretary of State. After being unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate, he was sworn in as the 65th Secretary of State on January 20, 2001.|$|E

Though Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Powell</b> urged the continuation of the rapprochement, other administration officials, including Vice President Cheney, were more skeptical of the good faith of the North Koreans.

5000|$|Hans Blix {{reports to}} the UN Security Council. Blix says, [...] "No {{evidence}} of proscribed activities have so far been found," [...] saying that progress was made in inspections which would continue. Blix files a 173-page document with the Security Council which says that inspectors discovered an undeclared Iraqi drone, with a wingspan of 7.45 m (24 ft 5 in), suggesting an illegal range beyond 150 km. US satellites tracked test flights of these drones, which were mentioned by Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Powell</b> on 5 March. Powell claimed that the test flight far exceeded the legal range agreed to by Iraq under UN resolutions. The Iraqis showed journalists this 'drone'. It was primitive, and could only be flown within [...] "line of sight". Blix was strongly criticized in some UK and US press for not having found and declared this large model aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|As Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Powell</b> {{summarized}} in his February 5, 2003 {{presentation to the}} U.N. Security Council, [...] "the facts and Iraq's behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction." [...] On April 10, 2003, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer reiterated that, [...] "But make no mistake—as I said earlier—we have high confidence that they have weapons of mass destruction. That is what this war was about and it is about. And we have high confidence it will be found." [...] Despite the Bush Administration's consistent assertion that Iraqi weapons programs justified an invasion, former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz later {{cast doubt on the}} Administration's conviction behind this rationale by saying in a May 2003 interview: [...] "For bureaucratic reasons, we settled on one issue—weapons of mass destruction—because it was the one reason everyone could agree on." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{legal right}} to {{determine}} how to enforce its own resolutions lies with the Security Council alone (UN Charter Articles 39-42), not with individual nations. On 8 November 2002, immediately after the adoption of Security Council resolution 1441, Russia, the People's Republic of China, and France issued a joint statement declaring that Council Resolution 1441 did not authorize any [...] "automaticity" [...] in {{the use of force against}} Iraq, and that a further Council resolution was needed were force to be used. Critics have also pointed out that the statements of US officials leading up to the war indicated their belief that a new Security Council resolution was required to make an invasion legal, but the UN Security Council has not made such a determination, despite serious debate over this issue. To secure Syria's vote in favor of Council Resolution 1441, Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Powell</b> reportedly advised Syrian officials that [...] "there is nothing in the resolution to allow it to be used as a pretext to launch a war on Iraq." ...|$|E

5000|$|In asserting a {{link between}} Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda, the Bush Administration focused special {{attention}} on alleged ties between Hussein and Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whom Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Powell</b> called a [...] "collaborator of Osama bin Laden." [...] Soon {{after the start of}} the war, however, evidence of such ties was discredited by multiple U.S. intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office. A CIA report in early October 2004 [...] "found no clear evidence of Iraq harboring Abu Musab al-Zarqawi." [...] More broadly, the CIA's Kerr Group summarized in 2004 that despite [...] "a 'purposely aggressive approach' in conducting exhaustive and repetitive searches for such links... U.S. Intelligence Community remained firm in its assessment that no operational or collaborative relationship existed." [...] Despite these findings, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney has continued to assert that a link existed between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which has drawn criticism from members of the intelligence community and leading Democrats. As of the invasion, the State Department listed 45 countries, including the United States where Al Qaeda was active. Iraq was not one of them.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. {{provided}} critical battle planning assistance at a {{time when}} U.S. intelligence agencies knew that Iraqi commanders would employ chemical weapons in waging the war, according to senior military officers with direct knowledge of the program. The U.S. carried out this covert program {{at a time}} when Secretary of State George P. Shultz, United States Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci and National Security Adviser General Colin L. Powell were publicly condemning Iraq for its use of poison gas, especially after Iraq attacked Kurdish villagers in Halabja in March 1988. U.S. officials publicly condemned Iraq's employment of mustard gas, sarin, VX and other poisonous agents, but sixty Defense Intelligence Agency officers were secretly providing detailed information on Iranian deployments, tactical planning for battles, plans for airstrikes and bomb-damage assessments for Iraq. It has long been known that the U.S. provided intelligence assistance, such as satellite photography, to Saddam's regime. Carlucci said: [...] "My understanding is that what was provided" [...] to Iraq [...] "was general order of battle information, not operational intelligence." [...] "I certainly have no knowledge of U.S. participation in preparing battle and strike packages," [...] he said, [...] "and doubt strongly that that occurred." [...] "I did agree that Iraq should not lose the war, but I certainly had no foreknowledge of their use of chemical weapons." [...] Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Powell,</b> through a spokesman, said the officers' description of the program was [...] "dead wrong," [...] but declined to discuss it. His deputy, Richard L. Armitage, a senior defense official at the time, used an expletive relayed through a spokesman to indicate his denial that the United States acquiesced in the use of chemical weapons.|$|E
