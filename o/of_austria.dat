5|$|In 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte {{declared}} the First French Empire. In response to this, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II of the Habsburg dynasty declared his personal domain {{to be the}} Austrian Empire and became Francis I <b>of</b> <b>Austria.</b> Taking the colours of the banner of the Holy Roman Emperor, {{the flag of the}} Austrian Empire was black and gold. Francis II was the last Holy Roman Emperor, with Napoleon forcing the empire's dissolution in 1806. After this point, these colours continued to be used as the flag <b>of</b> <b>Austria</b> until 1918.|$|E
5|$|Matthew III Csák, whom Andrew {{had made}} palatine in 1296, turned against Andrew {{at the end}} of 1297. Andrew's staunch supporter, Archbishop Lodomer, died around the same time.

5000|$|Potentially {{the most}} {{damaging}} element of the backlash, however, was the response <b>of</b> <b>Austria's</b> largely Liberal German population. While the unification of Germany and opposition to Austria's many pro-unification Germans had been a reason to support the Hohenwart-Schäffle program, it quickly became a reason to oppose it. Franz Josef's Foreign Minister Beust, feared the power <b>of</b> <b>Austria's</b> new German neighbor, having witnessed its crushing defeat of France. Beust cooperated with Andrássy, and advised the Emperor against accepting the Articles. In addition, Bismarck and [...] Wilhelm I of Germany themselves made clear to Franz Josef their displeasure over the marginalization <b>of</b> <b>Austria's</b> Germans.|$|R
5|$|The FPÖ is a {{descendant}} of the pan-German and national liberal camp (Lager) {{dating back to the}} Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas. During the interwar era, the national liberal camp (gathered in the Greater German People's Party) fought against the mutually-hostile Christian Social and Marxist camps in their struggles to structure the new republic according to their respective ideologies. After a short civil war, the Federal State <b>of</b> <b>Austria,</b> an authoritarian Christian Social dictatorship, was established in 1934. By 1938, with the Anschluss <b>of</b> <b>Austria</b> into Nazi Germany, the national liberal camp (which had always striven for an inclusion <b>of</b> <b>Austria</b> into a Greater Germany) had been swallowed whole by Austrian National Socialism and all other parties were eventually absorbed into Nazi totalitarianism. Both Socialists and Christian Socials were persecuted under the Nazi regime, and the national liberal camp was scarred after the war due to guilt by association with National Socialism.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evacuation}} of the 20th century occurred in 1915 when {{the horses were}} evacuated from Lipica due to World War I and placed at Laxenburg and Kladrub. Following the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, with Lipica becoming part of Italy. Thus, the animals were divided between several different studs in the new postwar nations <b>of</b> <b>Austria,</b> Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. The nation <b>of</b> <b>Austria</b> kept the stallions of the Spanish Riding School and some breeding stock. By 1920, the Austrian breeding stock was consolidated at Piber.|$|E

5|$|Before the First World War, most of Europe {{was ruled}} by monarchs related to George, but {{during and after}} the war, the monarchies <b>of</b> <b>Austria,</b> Germany, Greece, and Spain, like Russia, fell to {{revolution}} and war. In March 1919, Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Lisle Strutt was dispatched on the personal authority of the King to escort the former Emperor Charles I <b>of</b> <b>Austria</b> and his family to safety in Switzerland. In 1922, a Royal Navy ship was sent to Greece to rescue his cousins, Prince and Princess Andrew. Prince Andrew was a nephew of Queen Alexandra through her brother King George I of Greece, and Princess Andrew was a daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg, one of the German princes granted a British peerage in 1917. Their children included Prince Philip, who would later marry George's granddaughter, Elizabeth II. The Greek monarchy was restored again shortly before George's death.|$|E

5|$|Being {{the last}} male {{member of the}} House of Árpád, Andrew was elected king {{after the death of}} King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a {{coronation}} diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders—Albert <b>of</b> <b>Austria,</b> Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert <b>of</b> <b>Austria</b> to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.|$|E
