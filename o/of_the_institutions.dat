5|$|On 21 June 1958, the Parliamentary Assembly {{recommended}} to the Council that the Assembly should have its {{seat in the}} same place where the other organisations are based, although it accepted that plenary sessions could be held elsewhere. The Assembly also nominated three cities to be the seat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> (Brussels, Strasbourg and Milan), however no permanent agreement was reached.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty {{stated that}} the {{location}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> would be decided by common accord of the members, yet the issue was hotly contested.

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was a petty sheikhdom, and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During {{the first half of}} the first century AD, Palmyra incorporated some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> of a Greek city (polis); the concept of citizenship (demos) appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, describing the Palmyrenes as a community. In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's boule (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during the first century, four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power rested in the hands of the council.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Saint Anselm {{became one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> {{selected}} by the War Department for training of Army Aviation cadets.
