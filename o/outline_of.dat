5|$|A broad <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> the Norte Chico diet {{has been}} suggested. At Caral, the edible domesticated plants noted by Shady are squash, beans, lúcuma, guava, pacay (Inga feuillei), and sweet potato. Haas et al. noted the same foods in their survey further north, while adding avocado and achira. In 2013, good {{evidence}} for maize was also documented by Haas et al. (see below).|$|E
5|$|An <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> {{the origins}} of the {{parasitic}} life style has been proposed. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.|$|E

5|$|I {{sent the}} {{libretto}} of Suor Angelica to Maestro Puccini some days ago. He has declared himself– kind as he is– very satisfied... I have also finished a brief <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> a plot based on Gianni Schicchi.

5|$|In 1978, the {{archaeologist}} {{and historian}} Patrick Healy discovered {{the remains of}} a prehistoric wedge tomb in the woods. All the survives is the skeletal <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> the main chamber and the outer double walls. Most of the stones were removed to build the low stone wall that runs across the front of the tomb.|$|E

5|$|The {{final report}} of the committee, which became {{the first draft of}} the Constitution, was the first {{workable}} constitutional plan, as Madison's Virginia Plan had simply been an <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> goals and a broad structure.

Within this conventional outline, Mozart engages in extensive structural innovation.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and almost nothing {{with any degree of}} certainty; the {{earliest}} literary reference to him is by Rhygyfarch in about 1097.

5|$|Whatever its origin, {{the giant}} {{has become an}} {{important}} part of the culture and folklore of Dorset.
