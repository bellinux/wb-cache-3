40|$|Statutory {{party wall}} {{procedures}} are now an almost inevitable feature of city centre construction projects. They involve {{the service of}} notices and the appointment of surveyors who publish awards to resolve a variety of construction-related issues affecting structures in boundary locations. They {{are part of a}} statutory code which has operated under the London Building Acts since 1855 and which was extended to the whole of England and Wales by the Party Wall etc Act 1996. The statutory procedures apply to construction operations in three different situations. They are most frequently encountered where works ('party wall works') are carried out to a party wall or other shared boundary structure. They also apply to the erection of a new boundary structure ('line of junction works') and to excavations which have the potential to interfere with the stability of an adjacent building or structure ('adjacent excavations'). There are minor differences between the procedures in each of these three situations. However, they all commence with the service, by a property owner wishing to undertake the work (the 'building owner'), of an <b>originating</b> <b>notice</b> on an adjoining owner whose property will be affected by it. The adjoining owner can respond {{in a number of different}} ways but in most cases a dispute will arise between the parties within the meaning of the legislation. Although there is then scope for this to be resolved by a single agreed surveyor the parties will usually each appoint a surveyor and the two surveyors will publish a joint award which will regulate the conduct of the works. Despite the existence of this procedural framework it is common for the parties, or their surveyors, to depart from it by agreement. This may sometimes involve reaching an agreement to undertake the works entirely outside the statutory framework. More frequently, it will involve an agreement, or series of agreements, about the future conduct of the statutory procedures which may be at variance with the strict wording of the legislation. The motivation for the agreement may lie in a wish to avoid the delays and costs associated with the statutory framework. Alternatively, it may arise from a reluctance to institute a formal dispute resolution procedure in situations where, in reality, a situation of amity exists between the parties. Agreements typically arise in four different contexts. Firstly, as stated above, the parties may seek to exclude the Act entirely by concluding an agreement which pre-empts the service of an <b>originating</b> <b>notice.</b> Secondly, in circumstances where an <b>originating</b> <b>notice</b> has already been served, they may seek to avoid the need for surveyors to produce an award by themselves reaching agreement about the nature and conduct of the works. Thirdly, where works have commenced in breach of the Act, the parties sometimes seek to regularise the situation by agreeing on the retrospective operation of the statutory machinery. Finally, and most frequently, the parties or their surveyors may agree that variations can be made to the nature of the proposed work. Although these practices have become commonplace it is unclear whether the Act anticipates that the parties and their surveyors should be free to contract in and out of its provisions at will. This article therefore explores the extent to which they are free to do so. It examines each of the four practices in turn and considers the validity of the agreements reached in each case...|$|E
5000|$|Scholars came {{to agree}} that The Devil's Dictionary is “of primary {{importance}} to any study, understanding, or appreciation of Ambrose Bierce.” Critics noted that the Dictionary 's definitions are frequently quoted, both with and without attribution, so several of Bierce's observations have been absorbed into American culture, familiar to and repeated {{by people who have}} no idea where the witticisms <b>originated.</b> Critics also <b>noticed</b> that Bierce used his humorous dictionary as a vehicle for moral instruction, as “… he often induced the readers to reexamine the validity of their own thinking.” A critical consensus has evolved that considers The Devil's Dictionary as “An American masterpiece of cynical wit” and [...] "… probably the most brilliant work of satire written in America. And maybe one of the greatest in all of world literature." ...|$|R
40|$|E-mail spam has {{remained}} a scourge and menacing nuisance for users, internet and network service operators and providers, {{in spite of the}} anti-spam techniques available; and spammers are relentlessly circumventing these anti-spam techniques embedded or installed in form of software products on both client and server sides of both fixed and mobile devices to their advantage. This continuous evasion degrades the capabilities of these anti-spam techniques as none of them provides a comprehensive reliable solution to the problem posed by spam and spammers. Major problem for instance arises when these anti-spam techniques misjudge or misclassify legitimate emails as spam (false positive); or fail to deliver or block spam on the SMTP server (false negative); and the spam passes-on to the receiver, and yet this server from where it <b>originates</b> does not <b>notice</b> or even have an auto alert service to indicate that the spam it was designed to prevent has slipped and moved on to the receiver’s SMTP server; and the receiver’s SMTP server still fail to stop the spam from reaching user’s device and with no auto alert mechanism to inform itself of this inability; thus causing a staggering cost in loss of time, effort and finance. This paper takes a comparative literature overview of some of these anti-spam techniques, especially the filtering technological endorsements designed to prevent spam, their merits and demerits to entrench their capability enhancements, as well as evaluative analytical recommendations that will be subject to further research. 5 page(s...|$|R
60|$|The Christmas family-party that we mean, {{is not a}} mere {{assemblage}} of relations, got up at a week or two’s <b>notice,</b> <b>originating</b> this year, having no family precedent in the last, and {{not likely to be}} repeated in the next. No. It is an annual gathering of all the accessible members of the family, young or old, rich or poor; and all the children look forward to it, for two months beforehand, in a fever of anticipation. Formerly, it was held at grandpapa’s; but grandpapa getting old, and grandmamma getting old too, and rather infirm, they have given up house-keeping, and domesticated themselves with uncle George; so, the party always takes place at uncle George’s house, but grandmamma sends in most of the good things, and grandpapa always will toddle down, all the way to Newgate-market, to buy the turkey, which he engages a porter to bring home behind him in triumph, always insisting on the man’s being rewarded with a glass of spirits, over and above his hire, to drink ‘a merry Christmas and a happy new year’ to aunt George. As to grandmamma, she is very secret and mysterious {{for two or three days}} beforehand, but not sufficiently so, to prevent rumours getting afloat that she has purchased a beautiful new cap with pink ribbons for each of the servants, together with sundry books, and pen-knives, and pencil-cases, for the younger branches; to say nothing of divers secret additions to the order originally given by aunt George at the pastry-cook’s, such as another dozen of mince-pies for the dinner, and a large plum-cake for the children.|$|R
40|$|Microalgae {{from the}} Coal Bed Methane (CBM) ponds of the Powder River Basin (PRB) in Southeastern Montana have the {{potential}} to be utilized as fertilizer for use on the economically important plants of Montana. Three very important economic field crops of Montana (winter wheat - Triticum aestivum, potato - Solanum tuberosum, and flax - Linum usitatissimum) were used for the fertilization experiments. Isolates of unicellular green algae - PW 95 (sequenced as Neospongiococcum sp.) from the CBM ponds, and blue-green microalgae – Cyanobacteria (Anabaena Cylindrica) were cultured in the laboratory and the cells were concentrated using gravity sedimentation. Nutrient analysis of the PW 95 cultures showed nitrogen as the most abundant component with a concentration of 1240 mg/L. Other components, such as potassium and phosphorus, 264 mg/L and 130 mg/L respectively, were also detected. Concentrated algal slurry was added to the seedlings after the determination of their nutrient composition and the wheat and potatoes were harvested after 120 and 100 days respectively. Overall, when compared to control wheat grown with only water, or with water and a commercially available fertilizer, the PW 95 -fertilized wheat had higher chlorophyll content, more tillers (side shoots), and higher ratio of inflorescences (groups of flowers) per stem. Data analysis showed a statistical difference in plant height of wheat fertilized by PW 95. In terms of harvest, the average total dry weight for PW 95 -fertilized wheat was 117 % and 47 % more than those of water and chemical fertilizer (Miracle-Gro - M. Gro) - treated wheats respectively. Measurements of the seed weights showed that PW 95 -treated plants are 123 % and 58 % higher than corresponding measurements for wheat treated with water and M. Gro respectively. The {{results of this study suggest}} that PW 95 from the CBM ponds may be a viable source of fertilizer for crops and other economically important plants of Montana and may contribute to the development of an economically important and locally obtainable product from the ponds. These results were not as pronounced in PW 95 -fertilized potatoes. A major bottleneck to effective implementation and deployment of microalgae as a fertilizing agent is the availability of biomass which <b>originates</b> from <b>noticed</b> deficiencies in biomass harvesting techniques. Experiments conducted using KOH as a flocculating agent for biomass harvesting showed that PW 95 cells agglomerate as the pH of the suspension increases. An optimal pH level was found to be 11. 5. Highest flocculation efficiencies of 28 % and 42 % were achieved at optimum pH 11. 5 over a settling time of 15 and 30 minutes respectively. However, efficiency at pH 12 (51. 82 %) was marginally higher (3. 4 %) than the efficiency at pH 11. 5 at 45 minutes. As widely stated in literature, the use of KOH as flocculant is intended to contaminate, with potassium, the biomass product and lower its quality. However, with potassium being an essential growth agent for most crops, the biomass product from the flocculation experiment could represent an innovative method of increasing the properties and performance of PW 95 as a biofertilizer...|$|R
40|$|My {{creative}} {{work of the}} heroine's journey in Salt Of Our Blood <b>originated</b> when I <b>noticed</b> the absence of independent strong matriarchal characters and realized the predominance of the stories of patriarchal male heroes such as James Bond and Superman. Both are larger-than-life cartoon characters of the contemporary western world and possess mythical powers. These powers emulate the legends and mythical characters of yesteryear, e. g. Homer's Achilles, the half-god son of a sea nymph and hero of the Trojan War in the Illiad while Greek hero Jason, who appears in Medea, leads the Argonauts {{in their quest for}} the Golden Fleece. The introduction of my exegesis highlights my concerns of: those who have no voice in society, or on the marae and what happens to a society when the myths are lost, and what replaces them? A brief synopsis of my novel Salt of Our Blood is followed {{by the fact that the}} sea and human blood, sweat and tears inexplicably share the same proportion of salt. I also review my fascination for boats, seafarers and their tales, the myths of mankind and the history of trade (rats on ships spread disease world-wide) and exploration (Captain Cook, Darwin, Admiral Anson, Magellan) and mankind's eternal battle to overcome the vagaries of Mother Nature. Discovering the work of the theorists who enlightened me and had an eureka effect on my work are: Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces and Robert McKee's Story: substance, style and the principles of screen writing. Those whose contributed to my understanding of Boehmer (1995), The Post-colonial studies reader, edited by Ashcroft, Griffths & Tiffin, (1997), The Empire Writes Back by Ashcroft, Griffths & Tiffin (2001), and Post-colonial Literatures in English by Dennis Walder (1998). The influence of post colonial writers that I have long read and loved: The Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys (1968), God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy (1997), Disgrace by John M. Coetzee (2009), Tangi by Witi Ihimaera (1974) and Baby No-Eyes by Patricia Grace (1998) cannot be underestimated in the development of my style and the content of Salt of Our Blood. The exegesis will elaborate on the research process and development of the understanding of my life experiences which have contributed to the near-completion of this fifth draft of my novel. [Note: The novel "Salt Of Our Blood" is available only in hard bound copy together with the exegesis...|$|R
40|$|Probably, {{there is}} a {{relationship}} between warm and cold events in the tropical eastern South Atlantic and summer rainfall over Angola and Namibia. These events appear to originate as equatorial Kelvin waves in response to modulations of the trade winds over the tropical South Atlantic. It is well-known that the Southeast Atlantic warm events influence not only the coastal rainfall of tropical Southwestern Africa, but also {{there is a}} significant relationship between winter frontal rainfall in Southwestern South Africa and mid-latitude SST patterns, involving shifts in the jet stream and storm-tracks over the mid-latitudes. The objectives of this research work were: (1) Analyse the climate and the phenomena that influence precipitation in different regions of Angola. (2) Provide better understanding of regional rainfall climatology. (3) Make rainfall regime prognostic and future climate, which are important to managing the natural and hydrological resources and planning human activities. Over Angola, the rainfall exhibits quasi-regular low-frequency variability on both interannual and intraseasonal time scales. However, many aspects of the interrelationship between intraseasonal and interannual modes, especially the linkage between Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the El Niño South Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon have not been described yet, i. e. whether ENSO and MJO modulate or alter each other. Considering the latitude, Angola should have a typically tropical climate. However, four factors are crucial over the local weather definition, determining the climate of Angola based on (1) the migration of the Intertropical Front (ITF) and/or the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), (2) the displacement of the South Atlantic anticyclone associated to the cold phase of the Benguela Current, (3) the Namibia Desert and (4) the altitude of the central region. The mean NDJFMA rainfall and rain variance during 1951 - 1980 indicated largest variability to the south of Angola {{as well as in the}} Indian Ocean ITCZ corresponding to the large mean rainfall in the studied-region. The rain variance in summer is dominated by the SST of Benguela Current and the African ITCZ. The Southwestern Africa is influenced by the Subtropical High Centre Pressures of the Southern Atlantic Anticyclon, which controls the seasonal oscillation of the trade winds of marine influence the marine trade winds - and their continental adaptation the continental trade winds. In the dry regime, the NE trade winds are more intense. During the rainy season, they flow parallel to the coast usually, becoming marine trade winds. The results revealed that the precipitation regime in the analysed stations has a vell marked annual cycle, with rainfall concentrated in the South Hemisphere summer, which is the period of intense convection, September-April. The annual cycle is related to the waxing and waning of the ITCZ, that migrates northward to approximately 120 N, in August-September; and southward, to approximately 40 S, in March-April. The annual cycle of the series corresponding to those stations, were similar, despite the differences of intensity registered. The rainfall presented long-term variability that seems to be related with the PDO (20 - 30 years) and high frequency variability apparently related with ENSO events (3 - 7 years). It was clear that African Southwestern climate variability is related to global climate variability. Further work is required to test the dynamical hypotheses on ENSO's impact on Southern Hemisphere summer climate. During the studied period, strong influence of the Benguela's Niño was <b>noticed,</b> <b>originating</b> an increasing precipitation drift. Future work includes data analysis of neighboring countries, submitted to robust statistical tests in order to improve their consistency, investigating, among others, the interdecadal variability of the ITCZ, and its relationship with the Benguela Current and planetary structures, such as ENSO, NAO, and PDO. Longer-term changes in the ITCZ displacement have high social and economic impacts through severe droughts or flooding over areas of its influence. Pages: 1469 - 147...|$|R
