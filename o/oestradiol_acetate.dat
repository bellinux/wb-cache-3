40|$|The {{effect of}} ethynyl <b>oestradiol</b> and {{chlormadinone}} <b>acetate,</b> separately and combined, on the aorta, carotid, mesenteric and renal arteries of female rats was studied using light and scanning electron microscopy. The hormones were injected daily for either 30 or 90 days. The most constant finding was intimal thickening which consisted mainly of areas of subendothelially located smooth muscle cells. Each artery {{was given a}} score from 0 to 3 according {{to the degree of}} development of these areas. Ethynyl <b>oestradiol,</b> unlike chlormadinone <b>acetate,</b> was associated with sustained significant enhancement of both incidence and degree of intimal thickening. With the combined treatment, the degree of intimal thickening in the 30 -day group was not appreciably different from that obtained with oestrogen alone. However, in the 90 -day group it was significantly less in arteries other than the aorta, suggesting that the progestogen inhibited the enhancing effect of the oestrogen on the proliferative process in these arteries...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Treatment {{of adult}} male rats with <b>oestradiol,</b> {{cyproterone}} <b>acetate</b> or cyproterone affected spermatogenesis, accessory sexual glands and fertility in different ways. Suppression ofLeydig cells, spermatogenesis, accessory sexual glands and fertility ran parallel in oestradiol-treated ani-mals. High doses of cyproterone acetate caused severe {{suppression of the}} accessory sexual glands and fertility but had only a slight inhibitory influ-ence on spermatogenesis, Leydig cells were only temporarily affected. With high doses ofcyproterone, Leydig cells were over-stimulated initially but returned to normal appearance during treatment. There was almost no effect on spermatogenesis but the accessory sexual gland weights and fertility were markedly reduced. Recovery from any changes was rapid after cessation of cyproterone acetate and cyproterone treatment but not after oestradiol. Lower doses of cyproterone acetate and cyproterone did not affect testicular morphology but significantly depressed the accessory sexual gland weights. Different mechanisms of action for the three steroids are discussed. Objections are raised {{against the use of}} cyproterone acetate for the control of male fertility...|$|R
40|$|The {{well-known}} {{response of}} the breast feathers of the Brown Leghorn capon to oestrogens can readily {{be used to determine}} the rate of absorption of different esters[Parkes, 1937]. In the male the breast feathers are black; injection of oestrogen while feathers are growing causes deposition of the fawn pigment characteristic of the female. Only that part of the feather is changed which is growing when oestrogen is present; existing plumage is not affected. Since the rate of feather growth is known, the width of the fawn bar in the black feather indicates the time during which effective amounts of oestrogen were circulating. Thus, if a single injection is given, the duration of effect of a compound can easily be ascertained. In the work previously recorded the duration of action of the following substances was examined: oestrone, oestrone acetate, oestrone benzoate, oestrone methyl ether, oestradiol, oestradiol diacetate, oestradiol monobenzoate, oestradiol dibenzoate, oestradiol 3 -benzoate 17 -acetate, 17 -methyl oestradiol, oestriol, oestriol triacetate. The results were clear cut, and showed, in concordance with mammahan experiments, that certain of the esters, notably <b>oestradiol</b> benzoate <b>acetate,</b> have a very prolonged action. It was later demonstrated [Deanesly & Parkes, 1937] that the prolonge...|$|R
30|$|Lundström {{confirmed}} {{these results}} by comparing two studies (Lundström et al. 2011): The first, a prospective, open, uncontrolled drug safety study in 65 post-menopausal {{women who were}} treated with 20 mg CR twice daily and the second, a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical study in 154 post-menopausal women who were treated with either <b>oestradiol</b> 2 mg/norethisterone <b>acetate</b> 1 mg (E 2 /NETA), tibolone 2.5 mg or placebo. Mammograms were performed at baseline and showed comparable breast density for each treatment. Renewed mammograms after 24 weeks of treatment showed that both E 2 /NETA and tibolone significantly increased breast density (14.3 %, and 2.3 %, respectively, both p[*]<[*] 0.001) while CR and placebo {{had no effect on}} breast density. These differences were highly significant (p[*]<[*] 0.0001) (Lundström et al. 2011).|$|R

Our {{objective was to}} determine whether androgen receptor (AR) activation regulates expression of MUC 1. The following breast and prostatic cell lines were phenotyped and grouped according to AR and MUC 1 protein expression: 1) AR+MUC 1 + [DAR 17 + 19 (AR transfectants of DU- 145), ZR- 75 - 1, MDA-MB- 453, and T 47 D]; 2) AR-MUC 1 + [DZeo 1 (AR-vector control), DU- 145, BT 20,MDA-MB- 231, and MCF 7]; 3) AR+MUC 1 - (LNCaP and LNCaP-r). Cell proliferation was determined using the MTT assay in the presence of synthetic androgen R 1881, 0. 1 pM to 1 µM. Cell surface MUC 1 expression was determined by flow cytometry in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>oestradiol,</b> medroxy progesterone <b>acetate</b> or R 1881, with and without 4 hydroxy-flutamide (4 -OH), a nonsteroidal AR antagonist. The functional significance of MUC 1 expression was investigated with a cell-cell aggregation assay. Only AR+ MUC 1 + cell lines showed a significant increase in MUC 1 expression with AR activation (P (range) =. 01 to. 0001), reversed in the presence of 4 -OHF. Cell proliferation was unaffected. Increased expression of MUC 1 was associated with a significant (P (range) =. 002 to. 001) reduction in cell-cell adhesion. To our knowledge, this is the first description of androgen-dependent regulation of MUC 1 mucin. This is also functionally associated with decreased cell-cell adhesion, a recognised feature of progressive malignancy.

40|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) {{has been reported}} to exert a positive effect on preserving muscle strength following the menopause, however, the mechanism of action remains unclear. We examined whether the mechanism involved preservation of muscle composition as determined by skeletal muscle attenuation. Eighty women aged 50 - 57 years were randomly assigned to either: HRT, exercise (Ex), HRT + exercise (ExHRT), and control (Co) for 1 year. The study was double-blinded with subjects receiving <b>oestradiol</b> and norethisterone <b>acetate</b> (Kliogest) or placebo. Exercise included progressive high-impact training for the lower limbs. Skeletal muscle attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU) was determined by computed tomography of the mid-thigh. Areas examined were the quadriceps compartment (includes intermuscular adipose tissue), quadriceps muscles, the posterior compartment and posterior muscles. Muscle performance was determined by knee extensor strength, vertical jump height, and running speed over 20 m. Fifty-one women completed the intervention. Vertical jump height and running speed improved in the HRT and ExHRT groups compared with Co (interaction, P < 0. 01). For both the quadriceps compartment and quadriceps muscles, HU significantly increased (interaction, P <= 0. 005) for HRT, Ex, and ExHRT compared with Co. For the posterior compartment, HU for the HRT and ExHRT were significantly increased compared with Co, while for posterior muscles, ExHRT was significantly greater than Co. Although the effects were modest, the results indicate that HRT, either alone or combined with exercise, {{may play a role in}} preserving/improving skeletal muscle attenuation in early postmenopausal women and thereby exert a positive effect on muscle performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The polycystic ovary syndrome, {{described}} {{first as}} {{the association of}} bilateral polycystic ovaries and amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhoea, hirsutism and obesity, was later {{shown to be a}} complex metabolic syndrome. The first {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the occurrence of hyperinsulinaemia and the severity of insulin resistance and glucose tolerance disorders in polycystic ovary syndrome by means of the oral glucose tolerance test and the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp. The next goal was to investigate whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome would benefit from insulin-sensitising drugs, and in particular to compare the effects of metformin and a contraceptive pill containing ethinyl <b>oestradiol</b> and cyproterone <b>acetate.</b> Altogether, 81 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and 34 healthy control subjects were involved in the study. Marked impairment of insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome, including a decrease of both cellular oxidative and non-oxidative utilisation of glucose, and a slight non-significant decrease of insulin sensitivity in non-obese subjects was observed. Both non-obese and obese subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome exhibited increased abdominal obesity compared with the controls, confirming the fact that obesity, in particular abdominal obesity, is an important contributor in the development of insulin resistance in this syndrome. Metformin alleviated hyperandrogenism by essentially decreasing ovarian, but not adrenal androgen secretion. The improvement of hyperandrogenism and ovarian function seemed to be mediated by the improvement of hyperinsulinaemia, which resulted itself from subtle improvements in both hepatic insulin extraction and insulin sensitivity. Metformin decreased abdominal obesity and the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and improved ovarian cyclicity and fertility. The transient decrease in serum leptin levels observed may have some role in the improvement of ovarian function. The contraceptive pill significantly improved hyperandrogenism and hirsutism, and it slightly affected glucose metabolism. Thus, it could be the treatment of choice in women with hirsutism problems and no fertility hopes. Metformin could be the drug of choice for women with polycystic ovary syndrome who wish to conceive. Because of its beneficial metabolic effects, the value of metformin in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in polycystic ovary syndrome needs to be further studied...|$|R
