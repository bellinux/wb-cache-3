25|$|An {{editorial}} in the UC Berkeley student newspaper, The Daily Californian, found fault with all sides in the conflict.

25|$|DNA profiling, {{based on}} typing {{individual}} highly variable minisatellites {{in the human}} genome, was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985, with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many minisatellites simultaneously. By focusing <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few of these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and paternity testing worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Fingerprints {{collected}} at a crime scene, or on items of evidence from a crime, {{have been used}} in forensic science to identify suspects, victims and other persons who touched a surface. Fingerprint identification emerged as an important system within police agencies in the late 19th century, when it replaced anthropometric measurements as a more reliable method for identifying persons having a prior record, often under a false name, in a criminal record repository. In modern times, researchers can find traces of addictive drugs <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> fingerprint.|$|E
25|$|In comparison, we derive active social {{benefits}} from interpersonal interactions. At UCLA Medical School, Burgess measured species-typical organization of human social groups.

At the University of California, Davis Department of Psychology, Burgess demonstrated that social subgroups have a typical developmental pattern that begins in early childhood and continues throughout adulthood. Social grouping is deficient in children with developmental disorders such as autism and mental retardation.|$|E

The rest of the circuit is irrelevant, except as it pertains to controlling the temperature of the tires and setting the car up for the first judged corner. In the tandem passes, the lead driver (in the lead car, Senko) often feints their entry to the first corner to upset the chase driver (in the chase car, Atooi), however in some European series, this practice is frowned upon by judges and considered foul play, resulting in deduction of points.|$|E

In 2009, Merton started a Radio 4 series in which he reads Spike Milligan's war memoirs in an audio-book fashion.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on June 26, 2014 in Berlin. Shortly before production {{began in}} Berlin, Core got {{the cast and}} crew together to watch the original Point Break. The new team did not reach out to the original cast and crew; Bracey did not talk to Reeves, and Core did not reach out to director Kathryn Bigelow, though Ramirez did seek and receive the director's blessing. Shooting took place in a total of 11 countries across four continents, using actual extreme sports stars and stuntmen. Locations include Berlin/Germany, Hall in Tirol, Lienz and Carinthia/Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Hawaii, Tahiti, Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Venezuela, France, India, and the United Kingdom. While the original film focused <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few sports – primarily surfing – and used cranes and other Hollywood trickery to portray them, the new movie eschewed all of that, including green screens, and relied on real life practical stunts. For the numerous stunts performed in the film, Core gathered a group of the best snowboarders, free rock climbers, big wave surfers, high-speed motocross riders and wingsuit pilots in the world and filmed them, essentially, as actors.|$|E

25|$|Integrated {{urban water}} {{management}} (IUWM) in Buenos Aires {{is not unlike}} many large urban areas in Latin America where in past decades, more focus was placed <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few sectors or perhaps only one sector. The water management philosophy in Buenos Aires has evolved to one that is integrating efforts in reducing water pollution, improving stormwater management, adding drainage infrastructure, and improving {{water supply and sanitation}} (WSS). Primary challenges in urban water management continue to be flood control and stormwater management as Buenos Aires is situated in the low-lying pampas region where heavy rain is expected all year long. Adding to the challenges, urbanization has outpaced planning and development in the various water sectors. Efforts have been made to control the major tributaries of Río de la Plata such as channelizing and building culverts into urban rivers, however, this has increased flooding as the natural meander and saturating ability of the rivers have been lost. Rapid urbanization and very large quantities of industrial discharge have also caused severe contamination of the water basins that Buenos Aires is built upon. The Matanza-Riachuelo river (MR), a tributary of the Río de la Plata (La Plata River), is a prime example and has become the most contaminated basin in Argentina.|$|E

500|$|Since 1954, Panavision {{had been}} working on a new {{widescreen}} process commissioned by MGM. The resulting system used a 65mm film camera in conjunction with the APO Panatar lens, which was an integrated anamorphic lens (as opposed to a standard prime lens with an anamorphoser mounted on it). This created a 1.25x anamorphic squeeze factor. Movies using the process had an astounding potential aspect ratio of 2.76:1 when exhibited with 70mm anamorphic projection prints. Introduced as MGM Camera 65, the system was used <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few films, the first of which was Raintree County (1956). However, the film was released only in 35mm anamorphic prints because the circuit of 70mm theaters was booked with Around the World in Eighty Days (1956), shot with the competing, nonanamorphic Todd-AO system. [...] In January 1959, the posters for the 70mm release of Disney's Sleeping Beauty carried the notation [...] "Process lenses by Panavision" [...] next to the Super Technirama 70 logo. [...] The first film to be presented in 70mm anamorphic—Ben-Hur—was released by MGM in 1959 under the trade name MGM Camera 65. Panavision also developed a nonanamorphic widescreen process called Super Panavision 70, which was essentially identical to Todd-AO. Super Panavision made its screen debut in 1959 with The Big Fisherman, released by Disney's Buena Vista division.|$|E
