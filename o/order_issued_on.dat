An order issued by Stavka on 20 April 1945 said that there was a need to maintain good relations with German civilians in order to decrease resistance and bring a quicker end to hostilities.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, the then-Lahore High Court Chief Justice Khawaja Muhammad Sharif {{referred}} to the Supreme Judicial Council of Pakistan {{a list of names}} of justices who took oath under the 2007 Provisional Constitutional Order, stating that doing so went against the restraining <b>order</b> <b>issued</b> <b>on</b> 3 November 2007. By taking this oath, the judges swore to abide by the 2007 Proclamation of Emergency, the 2007 Provisional Constitutional Order No. 1, and the Code of Conduct established by the Supreme Judicial Council. This referral caused the Supreme Court to first decide it could begin contempt of court charges against many of the higher court justices who took the oath. It also caused President Asif Ali Zardari to issue orders declaring that the 76 judges that had taken the oath would no longer hold office until the decision on 31 July 2009. These judges were spread throughout the Pakistan Supreme Court, Lahore High Court, Sindh High Court, Peshawar High Court, and the Islamabad High Court.|$|E

Abd al-Mu'min ordered that the city should have a mosque, several palaces for himself and his sons, and reservoirs to provide a supply of water. It was to be protected by a [...] "wall of fine build" [...] with a single gate known as the Bab al-Fath (...) facing towards the isthmus connecting Gibraltar with the mainland. A harbour was also to be constructed, and windmills were to be constructed on the Rock.|$|E

Bavaria became the first German state where the decree was used against the Bible Students, with a police <b>order</b> <b>issued</b> <b>on</b> November 18 to prohibit and confiscate all Bible Student publications throughout the state.

2500|$|Missouri Executive Order 44, {{also known}} as the Extermination Order, was an {{executive}} <b>order</b> <b>issued</b> <b>on</b> October 27, 1838, by the Governor of Missouri, Lilburn Boggs. [...] The order was issued {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of Crooked River, a clash between Latter-day Saints and a unit of the Missouri State Militia in northern Ray County, Missouri, during the 1838 Mormon War. Claiming that Latter-day Saints had committed open and avowed defiance of the law and had made war upon the people of Missouri, Governor Boggs directed that [...] "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace—their outrages are beyond all description". [...] The militia and other state authorities—General John B. Clark, among them—would use the executive order to expel the Mormons from their lands in the state following their capitulation, which in turn led to their subsequent migration to Nauvoo, Illinois.|$|E

2500|$|The seven {{were first}} sent to Colditz Castle {{and put into}} the solitary {{confinement}} cells where Captain Black managed {{to make contact with}} Flight Lieutenant Dominic Bruce OBE MC AFM KSG RAF (known as 'The 'Medium Sized Man'), giving him and others their names which were passed on to MI5 in London. Bruce was the last British person to speak to Black. On 13 October 1942 they were removed from Colditz and taken to the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RHSA) headquarters in Berlin, where they were interrogated one by one by Obergruppenführer Heinrich Müller. They remained in Berlin until 22 October, when they were taken to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. On the next day, 23 October, they were all shot {{in the back of the}} neck and their bodies cremated. [...] These commandos were the first to fall victim to Adolf Hitler's Commando <b>Order</b> <b>issued</b> <b>on</b> 18 October 1942, which called for the execution of all commandos after capture. The official German story given to the Red Cross was that the seven men had escaped and not been recaptured.|$|E
2500|$|The Fifth Army Intelligence {{summary of}} 7 July {{described}} the elaborate defences on the Gheluvelt Plateau, that more defences were {{being added to}} the plateau than on the other sectors, which were backed by a formidable concentration of artillery. The summary contained a prediction that the Germans would pivot on the Gheluvelt Plateau if they were pushed back over the Steenbeek further north. Summaries on 14, 17 and 21 July reported that the German field artillery west of the Steenbeek had been moved east, [...] behind the front line and that the assembly areas for Eingreif divisions (Eingreifdivisionen) were behind the Gheluvelt Plateau and Passchendaele Ridge. In the Fifth Army operation <b>order</b> <b>issued</b> <b>on</b> 27 June, the green line (third objective) was made the main objective, where a protective barrage would fall for one hour after the infantry were scheduled to arrive. After the protective barrage finished, patrols were to move forward to reconnoitre and occupy ground and tactical features not occupied by the Germans {{as far as the}} fourth objective (red line).|$|E
2500|$|As {{they had}} in the War for Independence, many Mexican women served during the Mexican Revolution as {{soldiers}} and even troop leaders, as well as in more traditional camp-follower roles as cooks, laundresses, and nurses. However, those who gained recognition as veterans of the war were typically educated women who acted as couriers of arms and letters, propagandists, and spies. In part, this was due to an <b>order</b> <b>issued</b> <b>on</b> 18 March 1916 which decommissioned all military appointments of women retroactively and declared them [...] "null and void". Because of the nature of espionage, many of the women spies worked directly with the leadership of the revolution and thus had at least a semi-protected status as long as the leader they worked with was living. They formed anti-Huerta clubs, like the Club Femenil Lealtad (Women's Loyalty Club) founded in 1913 by María Arias Bernal, using their gender to disguise their activities. Some gains were made, as the right to divorce was attained in 1914 and in 1915 Hermila Galindo founded a feminist publication, Mujer Moderna (The Modern Woman) which discussed both politics and feminist ideas, including suffrage. Also in 1915, in October, the newly appointed governor of the Yucatán, Salvador Alvarado, who had studied both European and United States feminist theory and socialism, called for a feminist congress to be convened. In January 1916 the Primer Congreso Feminista (First Feminist Congress) was held in Mérida, Mexico and discussed topics of education, including sexual education; religious fanaticism; legal rights and reforms; equal employment opportunity; and intellectual equality among others, but without any real challenge to defining women in terms of motherhood.|$|E
