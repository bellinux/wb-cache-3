40|$|Copyright © 2005 Australian Society of OrthodontistsOBJECTIVE: To collect {{baseline}} data on practice types and {{services provided by}} <b>orthodontists</b> in Australia and New Zealand. METHOD: A total of 510 questionnaires was sent and 258 were returned. The response rate was 53 per cent. RESULTS: The average age of respondents was 50 years (SD: 9. 8 years) with female <b>orthodontists</b> being younger (Mean: 42. 3 years; SD: 6. 5). The ratio of responding female to male <b>orthodontists</b> was 1 : 8. 8. Overall, more <b>orthodontists</b> were in solo private practice than associateships or partnerships. New Zealand <b>orthodontists</b> {{were more likely to}} be in associateships. Australian <b>orthodontists</b> had twice the number of practices (Mean: 2. 4; SD: 1. 4) than their New Zealand counterparts (Mean: 1. 1; SD: 0. 3). <b>Orthodontists</b> estimated they saw a mean of 21. 3 (SD: 11. 3) patients per day. Older <b>orthodontists</b> saw few patients in a day and spent fewer hours in any practice activity in a week. The mean waiting time for a consultation appointment in the private sector in New Zealand was nearly twice that in Australia. There was a significant association between male <b>orthodontists</b> and referral of patients by general dental practitioners. More than three quarters of respondents incorporated retention fees into the treatment fee. Overall, <b>orthodontists</b> were satisfied with the workload and did not want more <b>orthodontists</b> in their geographical area. CONCLUSION: This study provides a sound basis for consideration of challenges in practice and changes over time. Rachael Mathew, Wayne J. Sampson and A. John Spencer[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose was}} to compare orthodontists’ and parents’ {{perception}} of orthodontic treatment outcomes in the anterior-posterior (AP) dimension. Assessment of treatment time and compliance were also investigated. Material and Methods: Parallel surveys for <b>orthodontists</b> (n= 1000) and parents (n= 750) displayed occlusions from 3 mm Class III (Cl III: 3) to 3 mm Class II. Participants rated occlusal relationships on a 100 mm VAS from least to most acceptable (0 - 100). Results: 233 <b>orthodontists</b> (23 %) and 243 parents (32 %) responded. <b>Orthodontists</b> (mean= 93. 9, 25. 9) and parents (mean= 80. 7, 40. 9) rated Class I (Cl I) occlusion most and Cl III: 3 least acceptable.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{investigated}} the attitudes of <b>orthodontists</b> and laypersons towards the choice of extracting second premolars, rather than first premolars, based on tooth condition {{and the use of}} additional anchorage devices. Methods Questionnaires were sent to two groups: 324 <b>orthodontists</b> who were members of the Thai Association of <b>Orthodontists,</b> and 100 randomly selected Thai laypersons aged above 20  years and who were unrelated to the field of dentistry. Descriptive and chi-square statistics were used to analyze the data. Results Questionnaires were returned by 142 <b>orthodontists</b> (43. 8 %) and completed by 100 laypersons. The larger the size of the caries lesion in the maxillary second premolar was found, the more <b>orthodontists</b> and laypersons both chose to extract a carious maxillary second premolar instead of a healthy maxillary first premolar. For <b>orthodontists,</b> the use of mini-implant anchorage was significantly related to their extraction decision. <b>Orthodontists</b> who were familiar with mini-implants usage would choose to extract the second premolar at a lower size of extent of caries. Besides, when larger sizes of caries lesions in maxillary second premolars were considered, laypersons tended to have greater acceptance of the use of additional anchorage devices {{in order to keep the}} healthy maxillary first premolar. Conclusions In this study, tooth condition and the use of anchorage devices are currently the main considerations by both <b>orthodontists</b> and laypersons when selecting the teeth to be extracted for orthodontic treatment...|$|R
