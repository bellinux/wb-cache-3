25|$|The fifth set {{would turn}} out to be an {{historic}} battle. Both players were dominant <b>on</b> <b>serve</b> throughout the first sixteen games without a single break point opportunity to be had. A moment of crisis arrived for Federer with him serving at 8-8 down 15-40, but he rallied to deny Roddick the opportunity to serve for the match. There was not another break opportunity until Roddick served at 14-15 and Federer broke him, for the first time in the entire match, to win a record shattering fifteenth Grand Slam championship. This set remains the longest fifth set in a Grand Slam final. It is the only time in Grand Slam final history where a player has lost despite only having their serve broken once.|$|E
25|$|Indispensable was a {{sailing ship}} built in France and {{launched}} in 1791. She {{was captured in}} 1793 at {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolutionary Wars and thus came into British hands, keeping her name (occasionally reported as Indispensible). She performed two voyages for the British East India Company (EIC) between 1793 and 1797. During this period and later she made two voyages transporting convicts to New South Wales. Amongst her notable events were the discovery of Indispensable Strait (1794), the capture of a Spanish vessel (1798), and the rescue of some castaways (1814). She later went <b>on</b> <b>serve</b> as a whaler in the South Seas until autumn 1827. She ceased trading after this last voyage and was broken up by April 1830.|$|E
25|$|Federer {{entered the}} match {{attempting}} {{to win his}} thirteenth Grand Slam title and a record fifth consecutive in New York, while the 21-year-old Murray had reached the finals of a Slam {{for the first time}} in his career. Federer came roaring out of the gates and comfortably secured the first set. The Swiss continued his dominance by achieving an early break in the second before Murray broke back to get back <b>on</b> <b>serve.</b> Federer would save three break points in the second set and eventually take the set. Federer would run away with the final set, sealing his victory with a pair of overhead smashes. This title pulled Federer within one of the all-time record of 14 majors held by Pete Sampras. Federer's victory also made him the only man to win five consecutive titles at two different majors (Wimbledon 2003-2007 and US Open 2004-2008).|$|E

25|$|Dokic {{then started}} her clay season {{campaign}} by participating at Charleston, {{where she was}} upset {{in the first round}} by qualifier Anna Tatishvili, in three close sets, 5–7, 6–2, 4–6. She then participated at Fes as the sixth seed but was forced to withdraw due to a viral illness. This also subsequently forced Dokic to withdraw from Estoril and missed both Madrid and Rome. She finalised her preparation for the French Open by playing at Strasbourg. She defeated Fes finalist Simona Halep in the first round 6–2, 6–1 in just 48 minutes, dropping only one point <b>on</b> <b>serve</b> in the second set. Dokic then fell to resurgent former child prodigy Mirjana Lučić 2–6, 2–6. Despite this, Dokic's victory over Halep will ensure that she will reach the Top 60 {{for the first time since}} 2009, with a year high ranking of #59. In Roland Garros, Dokic lost to Vera Dushevina in the first round 6–4, 3–6, 2–6. She also participated in doubles partnering with Melanie Oudin but the pair lost in the first round to Alexandra Dulgheru and Magdaléna Rybáriková. In spite of an early exit from the clay Grand Slam, Dokic's ranking rose to No. 57.|$|E
25|$|Federer's next tournament was the 2012 Swiss Indoors, {{where he}} was seeded first and was a two-time {{defending}} champion. He played Benjamin Becker in the first round, and won in straight sets after overcoming Becker in a tight first set. He then faced Thomaz Bellucci in the second round, and won the first set before dropping a tight second set tiebreak. He then fought off a comeback by Bellucci, and won the match with a break of Bellucci's serve in just over two hours. Federer played Benoît Paire of France in the quarterfinals, and swept past him in straight sets, dropping only one point <b>on</b> <b>serve</b> {{en route to a}} win in less than an hour. In a tougher semifinal, Federer dispatched Paul-Henri Mathieu in straight sets, advancing to his ninth Basel final and equalling John McEnroe's 875 career match wins. Federer played Juan Martín del Potro in the final, and found himself one set down after del Potro broke his serve {{in the middle of the}} first set. Federer fought back in the second set, saving a break point late in the set to force a tiebreak, which he won. However, he was not able to keep his seven-match win streak against del Potro, dropping the match in a third-set tiebreak after failing to convert break points earlier in the set.|$|E
25|$|He {{defeated}} Daniel Köllerer, 6–3, 6–0, in {{the second}} round of BNP Paribas Open, earning his first hard-court victory of the season, losing only eight points <b>on</b> <b>serve.</b> He then faced Juan Mónaco in the third round, their third meeting in a row, with Ferrero prevailing in the other two. He was upset, 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 3–6, in a match that lasted over three hours. At the Sony Ericsson Open, he made the round of 16, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 2–6, 2–6, after defeating John Isner, 6–2, 3–6, 6–3, and Daniel Köllerer, 4–0 RET. At the Monte Carlo Masters, he defeated Marcel Granollers, 6–0, 6–3, and Benjamin Becker, 6–3, 6–4. After defeating the German, Ferrero upset Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 6–1, 3–6, 7–5, earning his first victory over the Frenchman. He, however, lost to Rafael Nadal, 4–6, 2–6, in the quarterfinals. At the Barcelona Open, Ferrero was upset by Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker in the third round, due to not playing well in the tie-breaks, 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 6–7(4–7),. At the Rome Masters, his form worsened as he surprisingly slumped to a 0–6, 3–6 loss to qualifier Santiago Giraldo in the first round. Ferrero went into the French Open seeded 16th and tipped by some to make a good run in the tournament. He defeated Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay in the first round, 6–4, 6–3, 6–1. He then met fellow Spaniard Pere Riba {{in the second}} round, winning in four sets, 7–6(7–5), 6–7(13–15), 6–2, 6–2. However, he was upset in the third round by unseeded American Robby Ginepri. After coming back from a two-set deficit and being a break of serve up in the decider, Ferrero lost in the fifth set with a final score of 7–5, 6–3, 3–6, 2–6, 6–4. He may have been seen to have underachieved in the tournament but did improve on his previous year's performance and did therefore increase his ranking points.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} of the 1976 Wimbledon Championships, Evert faced off against old rival Goolagong. The first two sets were won via a break of the other {{opponent}} and Evert took the first set 63, which then Goolagong took the next set 46 in order to force a pivotal third set. During the roller-coaster decisive set there was plenty break of serves for both opponents, which the set lasted 50 minutes. Goolagong quickly ran out to a quick 02 lead in the third set, which she broke Evert in the second game of the set. Evert would break in the third and fifth games in order to take a marginal advantage in the set of 3 games to 0. Goolagong would not let the break lead stand for Evert and quickly broke back in the sixth game on Evert's serve for a tie at 3 games all. At this juncture of the set, Evert's game was looking better and more attuned to hitting better shots at the baseline and at the net. In the next two games both would hold serve to level the set at 4 games all, but in the ninth game Evert broke Goolagong to take a 5 games to 4 lead, which allowed her to serve for the match. Evert failed to maintain her nerves <b>on</b> <b>serve</b> and Googlagong forced her into three straight unforced errors that narrowed the set to 5 games all. Goolagong would hold her serve in the next service game to take a 5 to 6 games advantage, which Goolagong did not give Evert a single point during this game, and now in the next game Evert was just serving to stay in the match. Evert would show the steely-eyed determination, which she became known for, and held serve in the game to stay in the match and level it at 6 games all, and in the subsequent game Evert would again break the serve of Goolagong in order to serve for the match. In the fourteenth game, Evert would finally put away Googlagong on the only match point for the American with a lob shot, which Goolagong failed to reach the shot, and this was the second Wimbledon Singles title for her career.|$|E
25|$|Federer next {{played at}} his {{eleventh}} ATP World Tour Finals, {{where he was}} the two-time defending champion. He was drawn into Group B, which included David Ferrer of Spain, Juan Martín del Potro of Argentina, and Janko Tipsarević of Serbia. He first faced Tipsarević, and dropped only eight points <b>on</b> <b>serve</b> en route to defeating him in straight sets in an hour and nine minutes. With his win over Tipsarević, Federer recorded his fortieth ATP World Tour Finals win, surpassing Ivan Lendl's record of ATP World Tour Finals win. Federer then played Ferrer, and beat him in a tight second-set tiebreak after Federer clinched the first set on a break of Ferrer's serve. Federer's win marked his fourteenth consecutive win over Ferrer and also qualified him for the semifinals. Federer played del Potro to wrap up the round robin, and found himself one set down after del Potro clinched a first-set tiebreak. Federer broke del Potro early in the second set, and held the lead to level the match at one set all. However, del Potro responded by breaking him early in the third set, and Federer's unforced errors ultimately cost him the game and the match. Federer's loss meant that his streak of 12 matches won at the ATP World Tour Finals was broken. Even with the loss, Federer finished first in the group, and advanced to the semifinals, where he faced Andy Murray, who he had last played at the Shanghai Rolex Masters. Murray started out strong, breaking Federer in {{the first game of the}} set, but Federer recovered by breaking Murray later in the set. The first set eventually went to a tiebreak, and Federer found himself with two set points, converting the second to take a one-set lead. Federer then flew through the second set, breaking Murray twice en route to winning the match in just over an hour and a half. With his win, Federer advanced to his eighth final, where he played Novak Djokovic. Federer held an early lead in the first set, but Djokovic managed to level the set and ended up pulling out to a one-set lead after winning a very tight first-set tiebreak. In the second set, Djokovic was able to convert a decisive break point on Federer's serve late in the set and he subsequently served out the match to win his second end of season Championship. The loss denied Federer a chance to tie Ivan Lendl's record of three consecutive ATP World Tour Finals titles. Federer's loss also cost him a chance at tying John McEnroe's record of 77 career titles won.|$|E

This was a serious violation, especially following the on-court stabbing of Monica Seles by a spectator in 1993. Following the interruption both players held serve in the set and it went to a tiebreaker. Federer then played what he later described as the greatest tiebreaker of his career, taking it by a score of 7–1.|$|E
