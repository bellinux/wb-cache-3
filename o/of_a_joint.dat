5|$|In {{between these}} campaigns Rupert had visited his uncle's court in England. The Palatinate cause {{was a popular}} Protestant issue in England, and in 1637 a general public {{subscription}} helped fund an expedition under Charles Louis to try and regain the electorate as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> French campaign. Rupert was placed in command of a Palatinate cavalry regiment, and his later friend Lord Craven, an admirer of Rupert's mother, assisted in raising funds and accompanied the army on the campaign. The campaign ended badly at the Battle of Vlotho (17 October 1638) during the invasion of Westphalia; Rupert escaped death, but was captured {{by the forces of}} the Imperial General Melchior von Hatzfeldt {{towards the end of the}} battle.|$|E

Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E

5|$|Wiesenthal {{was first}} told about Braunsteiner in early 1964 via a chance {{encounter}} in Tel Aviv {{with someone who}} had seen her performing selections at Majdanek—deciding who was to be assigned to slave labour and who was to immediately be killed in the gas chambers. When he returned to Vienna he had an operative visit one of her relatives to clandestinely collect information. Wiesenthal soon traced Braunsteiner's whereabouts to Queens, New York, so he notified the Israeli police and the New York Times. In spite of Wiesenthal's efforts to expedite the matter, Braunsteiner was not extradited to Germany until 1973. Her trial was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> indictment with nine other defendants accused of killing 250,000 people at Majdanek.

5|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1897, United States President William McKinley signed {{the treaty of}} annexation for the Republic of Hawaii, but it failed to pass in the United States Senate after the Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by Kaulia, Kalauokalani, John Richardson and William Auld {{as evidence of the}} strong resistance of the Native Hawaiian community to annexation. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because they were asking for the restoration of the queen and the delegates. The petitions were used as evidence of the strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> resolution called the Newlands Resolution, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

30|$|The {{safety and}} {{serviceability}} of timber structures are frequently {{governed by the}} performance of joints. Bolted <b>joints</b> are <b>a</b> very commonly used form of joints and are effective {{from the viewpoint of}} the load–slip characteristics when subjected to a lateral force. The shear strength <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bolted <b>joint</b> is affected by various factors. Some of the factors affecting the shear strength <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bolted <b>joint</b> are classified into four categories in this paper: the material characteristics, geometrical factors, assembly conditions for the bolted joint, and factors that act during its service. This paper reviews the effects of these factors on the shear strength <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bolted <b>joint.</b> Numerous experimental studies were performed on the shear strength <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bolted <b>joint.</b> The effects of these factors on the shear strength varied according to the kind of shear strength and loading direction to the grain. In addition to the experimental investigations, analytical investigations to estimate the shear strength <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bolted <b>joint</b> are also discussed in this paper. Estimations of the yield strengths of bolted joints have been performed by numerous researchers; and in recent years, there has been an increase in studies to predict the load at failure.|$|R
