According {{to what he}} calls the Classical Model, rationality is seen as something like a train track: you get on at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules <b>of</b> <b>rationality</b> compel you all the way to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture <b>of</b> <b>rationality</b> holds generally.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> bounded <b>rationality</b> is not well-defined. Several aspects <b>of</b> bounded <b>rationality</b> are discussed. Two {{different}} kinds <b>of</b> bounded <b>rationality</b> are distinguished. First, rationality may be bounded {{in the sense}} that the player cannot perform all the necessary calculations within the time frame of the game. This applies not only to numerical calculations but also to any kind of information processing, for example, figuring out logical consequences, or self-examination of prefer- ences. Recent studies on the effect <b>of</b> bounded <b>rationality</b> concentrate on this type, studying the effect of limited computational capability on the set of Nash-equilibria of the game. Some objections to the approach taken in these papers in dealing with the question <b>of</b> bounded <b>rationality</b> are presented...|$|R

25|$|By {{locating}} the conditions <b>of</b> <b>rationality</b> {{in the social}} structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus <b>of</b> <b>rationality</b> from the autonomous subject to subjects in interaction. Rationality is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted communication. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative ethics as the highest stage in the internal logic {{of the evolution of}} ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new political practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary rationality.|$|E
