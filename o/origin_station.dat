40|$|Direct demand {{models have}} been {{developed}} based on ticket sales data for 85 local rail stations in South Wales. Initially log-linear regression models were calibrated, incorporating a variety of independent variables. Geographical Information Systems were used to implement flexible station catchment definition methods, notably flow-specific catchments where population units were allocated to stations by minimising the total travel time to individual destinations. To validate these methods a survey of ultimate trip end locations was carried out on the Rhymney line in South Wales. To give consistency with predictions from trip end models, methods were developed to constrain predicted trip numbers for each flow based on the total trips observed or predicted from <b>origin</b> <b>stations.</b> Simple scaling had only limited success, so probabilistic trip distribution models were calibrated by using both the linear and non-linear regression. These gave superior results and explicitly incorporated the effects of intervening opportunities in the model form...|$|R

50|$|Auto Train {{operates}} {{on the same}} route it and its predecessor have always used, with {{a majority of the}} route owned by CSX Transportation and 16 miles of track being owned by Sunrail. The trains are known by their route numbers (53 Southbound, 52 Northbound) internal to Amtrak. When communicating on the CSX road channels, they are known by their CSX designations: P053xx and P052xx, where xx is the 2-digit date at which the train departed its <b>origin</b> <b>station.</b> So a Southbound train that departed on the 23rd of the month would be known as CSX P05323 on the road channels. This allows for unique identification in the event that 2 trains on the same route are operating simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|The Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) is an {{international}} global network of more than 80 stations making high quality measurements of atmospheric composition that began official operations in 1991 {{after five years of}} planning. Originally named the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC), the goal of NDACC is to observe changes in the chemical and physical state of the stratosphere and upper troposphere and {{to assess the impact of}} such changes on the lower troposphere and climate. NDACC’s <b>origins,</b> <b>station</b> locations, organizational structure and data archiving are described. NDACC is structured around categories of ground-based observational techniques, timely cross-cutting themes (ozone, water vapour, measurement strategies and emphases), satellite measurement systems, and theory and analyses. To widen its scope, NDACC has established formal collaborative agreements with eight other Cooperating Networks. A brief history is provided, major accomplishments of NDACC during its first 25 years of operation are reviewed, and a forward-looking perspective is presented...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{computerised}} ticket issuing {{system on}} the British railway network was INTIS, introduced by British Rail {{on a small scale}} in 1981 as an interim stage before the mid-1980s launch of the All Purpose Ticket Issuing System (APTIS). [...] INTIS produced credit card-sized tickets on which the data was laid out in a particular pattern consisting of fields of a set length printed on four horizontal lines across the ticket. Class of travel and a ticket type description were on the top line; below this came the date of travel, ticket number and information about discounts or concessions; then came the <b>origin</b> <b>station,</b> validity information and fare paid; and on the bottom line was printed the destination station and any route restriction that applied. [...] The APTIS system continued with a slightly adjusted version of this layout; and when it was superseded in the mid-2000s by [...] "New Generation" [...] systems such as Shere SMART and Cubic FasTIS, these continued to issue tickets in the same format.|$|E

30|$|COST: {{the meaning}} of this factor varies in every {{alternative}} choice. (1) The pricing method of Shanghai URT system is restricted by the origin and destination stations information, without regarding which stations the route passed. That is, the cost in emergency is the same as in normal state. (2) As the shuttle bus replaces the interrupting section, passengers must leave and reenter the URT system. The cost consists of four parts: (a) <b>origin</b> <b>station</b> to Shanghai Railway Station; (b) Shanghai Railway Station to a certain subway station by the shuttle bus. This service is free based on the previous emergent situations. (c) A certain station to destination station. (d) ¥ 1 privilege is given at reentering the URT system. (3) The only cost passengers need to pay is from <b>origin</b> <b>station</b> to Shanghai Railway Station. (4) Taxi fare is used as the cost of mode 4.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a flow capturing location problem {{which focuses on}} railway passen-ger flows. The flow capturing location problem (FCLP), originally proposed by Hodgson (1990), aims to locate a given number of facilities on a network to maximize the total flow that can obtain service at facilities along their pre-planned routes. For railway users, facilities located at the <b>origin</b> <b>station</b> and the destination station are more easily accessible than facilities located midway along the path. Therefore, we differentiate these two cases by introducing two levels of coverage; a given flow is fully captured when captured at the <b>origin</b> <b>station</b> or the destination station, or partially captured when captured at a midway station along the path. We provide an integer programming formulation of the proposed problem. We apply the model to analyze the optimal locations of flow capturing facilities on Keio Line using commuter traffic flow data, which is extracted from transportation census data of Tokyo Metropolitan area...|$|E
