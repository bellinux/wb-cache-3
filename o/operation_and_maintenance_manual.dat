The cantons of Corredores and Golfito, {{located in}} the {{southern}} region, dump their solid waste in a "garbage dump". The environmental issue that revolves around waste disposal without previous treatment is serious. This {{is due to the}} generation of highly polluting leachate, gases, unpleasant odors, insect proliferation, rodents and birds. It also implies risks to public health for the presence of waste collectors exposed to unsuitable conditions. The design of a landfill with the main technical components, would allow to both municipalities properly dispose their waste. The beneficiaries would be the Municipality of Corredores, the Municipality of Golfito and the population of the region that receives the Collection solid waste service. For this reason, the general objective of this project is to design the main technical requirements of the landfill for disposal and treatment of the solid waste generated in the cantons of Corredores and Golfito. Therefore, this project proposes the cells design, leachate collection systems, gases and rainwater, considering the topographical, climatological and geological conditions, population characteristics and regulatory framework applicable.

50|$|A Technical Data Management System (TDMS) is {{essentially}} a Document management system (DMS) pertaining to the management of technical and engineering drawings and documents. Often the data are contained in 'records' of various forms, such as on paper, microfilms or digital media.

Proper Technical Document Management Systems are essential for executions within large organisations with large scale projects involving engineering. For example, TDMS is a vital function for the successful management of Integrated Steel Plants (ISP), Automobile factories, Aero-space facilities, Infrastructure companies, City Corporations, Research Organisations, etc. In such organisations, Technical Archives or Technical Documentation Centres are created as central facilities for effective management of technical data and records.TDMS functions are {{similar to that of}} conventional archive functions in concepts, except that the archived materials in this case are essentially engineering drawings, survey maps, technical specifications, plant and equipment data sheets, feasibility reports, project reports, <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>manuals,</b> standards, etc.|$|R

40|$|High-heat {{producing}} sludge from tank 241 -C- 106 will be sluiced {{and transferred}} to tank 241 -AY- 102 beginning in October 1998. Safety analyses have postulated that after retrieval, the waste in 241 -AY- 102 may generate and retain unsafe levels of flammable gases (Noorani 1998, Pasamebmetoglu etal. 1997). Unsafe levels of retained gas are not expected, but cannot be ruled out {{because of the large}} uncertainty in the gas generation and retention rates. The Tank Waste Remediation System Basis for Interim Operation (Noorani 1998) identifies the need for a contingency plan to add void fraction monitoring to tank 241 -AY- 102 within 2 weeks of the identification of flammable gas buildup that would warrant monitoring. The Tank 241 -C- 106 Waste Retrieval Sluicing System Process Control Plan (Carothers et al. 1998) committed to providing a contingency plan for deployment of the void fraction instrument (VFI) in tank 241 -AY- 102. The VFI determines the local void fraction of the waste by compressing a waste sample captured in a gas-tight test chamber. The sample chamber is mounted {{on the end of a}} 76 -cm (2. 5 -ft) arm that can be rotated from vertical to horizontal when the instrument is deployed. Once in the waste, the arm can be positioned horizontally and rotated to sample in different areas below the riser. The VFI is deployed using a crane.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to evaluate operations, make recommendations, and train personnel at the Schofield Barracks Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBWWTP) {{for the purpose of}} improving the operating efficiency of the plant. There are several tasks associated with this study, including (1) implementing a process monitoring program, (2) determining the treatment capacities, (3) developing process control strategies, (4) providing technical guidance, (5) review/update operations and maintenance manual, and (6) conducting mini-studies. Like the first progress report, this second quarterly progress report contains a brief summary of the more important findings obtained thus far and descriptions of in-progress efforts. In the first report it was stated that all of the in-plant flow meters were in serious need of calibration and this was an impediment to progress. We are pleased to report that this is no longer the case. At approximately the beginning of September, all of the in-plant flow meters were apparently calibrated. This has allowed us to make increased progress on Task 2. Since the first quarterly progress report we have continued to collect and analyze a large quantity of samples from the treatment plant in order to characterize all process streams (Task 1). In this report, these data are presented and summary calculations of treatment efficiency have been prepared for primary clarification, activated sludge, secondary clarification, and dissolved air flotation thickening (DAFT). We have also been able to prepare preliminary solids balances for the entire plant under current conditions and under more desirable conditions (smaller sludge wasting rate and higher efficiency DAFT operation). Based upon the results of process monitoring efforts, planning and/or implementation of several mini-studies have been initiated as in-progress efforts (Task 6) including: a DAFT performance study, an anoxic selector study, a bioaugmentation study, and an activated sludge stress test. We should have results from these studies for the next progress report. Specific goals for the third quarter of this project include: 1. Training operations personnel to conduct chemical oxygen demand (COD) and Oil and Grease (O&G) tests (Task 4). 2. Complete preliminary estimates of treatment capacity of each process area (Task 2). 3. Develop process control strategies for certain process areas including preliminary and primary treatment processes (Task 3). 4. Make significant progress on already-initiated mini studies. 5.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} flood control channels {{in urban areas}} built by the USACE between the 1950 s and 1970 s. These uniform-shaped earth or concrete lined channels were designed to "control" flooding and to make possible expanded floodplain developments. As many of these channels have been in service for over 50 years, it may be instructive to reassess them to examine how they were planned, designed, and maintained, and to identify the current conditions and issues. The assessment provides the basis to develop management strategies for this aging infrastructure. In this dissertation, I examined the flood control channels in the Federal scale and the local scale. At the Federal scale, I reviewed the history and evolution of USACE policy, planning process, design criteria, and the 100 -year flood standard. I also conducted a systematic evaluation of nine urban flood control channels built by USACE between the 1950 s and 1970 s in the San Francisco Bay Region. I found the commonality of problems in these flood control channels, driven by the USACE planning policies when these channels were built. The finding forms the justification to develop a channel safety program to manage all USACE flood control channels at the federal scale. The policy review found that the planning process for these projects singly focused on national economic benefits, while environmental consequences were largely excluded. The land enhancement benefit in the cost benefit analysis encouraged floodplain and tidal marsh developments. However, habitat elimination resulting from the developments was not considered as a cost. The land enhancement benefit had significant impact on project justification. The San Francisco Bay Area case study found that six of the nine projects included the land enhancement benefit in the cost benefit analysis. If the land enhancement benefit were subtracted from the total project benefit, three of the six projects {{would not have been}} authorized due to low cost benefit ratio. This implies that if habitat protection had equal footing as flood risk reduction, as a planning criterion for these projects, many of the projects would not have been authorized in the form they were constructed. The primary design criteria for these flood control channels were to maximize flow capacity within a minimal footprint. The hydraulic design assumed a clear water condition, ignoring sediment effects. However, oversized thalwegs invite in-channel sediment deposition, and sediment transport increases channel roughness. Both effects reduce channel capacity. The clear water assumption led to questionable channel designs. The San Francisco Bay Area case study shows that six of the nine flood control channels have channel thalweg elevation at the outfall lower than the adjacent bay bed, created sediment sumps. The study also found that eight of the nine flood control channels had concrete channel reaches designed under supercritical flow. Such design demands the channel to function as designed under the clear water condition. The San Francisco Bay Area case study found that the maintenance guidelines were ambiguous, but sediment deposition created significant operation and maintenance burden to local sponsors. On average the current sediment maintenance cost is 5 times higher than the original design estimate. Due to sediment deposition and channel deterioration, the average channel capacity reduced by 31 %, as compared to the original design capacity. None of the channels in the study have the capacity to convey the existing 100 year flow. Even under the original design condition, five of the nine channels cannot provide existing 100 year flow capacity, considering two of the five channels were designed for the Standard Project Flood. This result is a matter of concern, since even if the channels were maintained to the original design specification and under the clear water condition, these channels still cannot provide 100 -year flood protection. The Federal scale analysis identified common issues among these flood control channels. These channels provide a false sense of flood protection security to the communities they serve, and the resultant floodplain developments further increase flood risk. At the Federal scale, the findings form the justification basis to develop a channel safety program to manage all USACE flood control channels. The proposed program would be similar to the existing dam and levee safety programs. The proposed program provides a management framework for the entire USACE flood control channel portfolio, for periodic inspection and risk assessment, condition review and classification, and critical improvement prioritization for flood risk reduction. At the local scale, I conducted a detail review on the planning process of the Corte Madera Creek flood control project, to validate the findings from the USACE planning policies review. I also developed a hydraulic analysis to evaluate how sediment management schemes affect channel capacity. The case study at Corte Madera Creek further illustrated the sediment management issue found in the Federal scale analysis. The local sponsor devised a more efficient sediment removal plan for 100 year flood protection, however it still costs 14 times more than the original maintenance budget estimate. Furthermore, the proposed flood protection projects in the upper watershed were designed based on the flood control channel providing 5, 600 cfs capacity, about 2, 000 cfs lower than the original design capacity. The analysis shows that even if the channel were maintained in accordance with the USACE <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>manual,</b> the channel still would not provide the capacity needed. This finding validated the fundamental project design issues found at the Federal scale analysis. At the local scale, my analysis identified a need to update the USACE <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>manual,</b> to specify sediment removal frequency and volume based on the required channel capacity. Local sponsors should develop a sediment deposition and channel capacity relationship, so the local sponsor can assess the need for sediment removal based on channel flow and stage monitoring data. The channel safety program provides the management tool to systematically prioritize and implement these updates to USACE projects. USACE should update the engineering manual for flood control channel project planning and design. The revision should include methods to estimate channel roughness coefficient under various sedimentation and sediment transport conditions. To provide the technical basis to update the engineering manuals and project assessment methods, additional research is needed to (1) investigate how bedload sediment transport on smooth surface with no deposition affects channel roughness, and (2) improve existing risk analysis tools to quantify the stage discharge uncertainty. In addition to managing the aging infrastructure to maintain its level of service, {{there is a need to}} develop intervention strategies to reinvent flood control channels to meet contemporary objectives in ecological restoration, floodplain management, recreation, and flood risk reduction. The intervention also needs to overcome the space limitation due to urban encroachments in the floodplain and often up to the channel banks...|$|E
