5|$|Nereid is {{the third-largest}} moon of Neptune. It has a {{prograde}} but very eccentric orbit and {{is believed to}} be a former regular satellite that was scattered to its current orbit through gravitational interactions during Triton's capture. Water ice has been spectroscopically detected on its surface. Early measurements of Nereid showed large, irregular variations in its visible magnitude, which were speculated to be caused by forced precession or chaotic rotation combined with an elongated shape and bright or dark spots on the surface. This was disproved in 2016, when <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> the Kepler space telescope showed only minor variations. Thermal modeling based on infrared <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes suggest that Nereid is only moderately elongated which disfavours forced precession of the rotation. The thermal model also indicates that the surface roughness of Nereid is very high, likely similar to the Saturnian moon Hyperion.|$|E
5|$|On June26, 2005, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave well-inland over Africa. The feature was tracked via radiosonde <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> various nations {{for two days}} before being analyzed as a surface feature on June28 over western Senegal. Accompanied by scattered convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—the westward moving system featured some cyclonic flow; it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean early on June29. Conflicting <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> Dakar, Senegal, made tracking the wave difficult, with surface observations revealing a clear shift in wind direction and upper-level soundings showing no change. Regardless of the exact position of the system, accompanying convection soon diminished and the system became ill-defined. By June30, the system grew significantly and multiple low-level circulations developed within the broader cyclonic envelope. Weather models at the time depicted a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis in the subsequent days. Gradual development ensued over the following days, though the broad circulation initially remained largely devoid of convection due to dry air associated with the Saharan Air Layer.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, <b>{{observations}}</b> <b>from</b> Earth {{were made}} of Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
