5|$|As of May 2008, a {{film version}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> {{is in the}} {{scripting}} stage, with Brian K.

Feige has said that while {{it may not be}} a precise story line of any of his comics, it will be similar to the tone or origins of its initial run.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{originality}} and longevity, Winnie Winkle {{became a}} household name and an icon, inspiring even Pop Art artist Roy Lichtenstein. Winnie Winkle was reprinted in Dell Comics, {{and for a time}} her face appeared on a cigar box lid. In retrospect, Winnie Winkle is seen as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> strips heralding a new, more independent role for American women after World War I.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse {{rolls over}} the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind takes hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> so that it flies towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The next morning, the three boys reflect on how their inability to share led to the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comic,</b> although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E

5|$|The Last of Us: American Dreams {{received}} generally positive reviews. Praise {{was particularly}} {{directed at the}} story and artwork <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comic,</b> which were said to compliment each other.

5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> strip Dykes to Watch Out For. It {{chronicles the}} author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex {{relationship with her}} father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I.

Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program, a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book's plot to date, and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama. G.I.

5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comic,</b> you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E

Inspired by the goddess, Priya fights against gender-based sexual violence in India and around the world, supporting the movement against patriarchy and misogyny.|$|E

5|$|The Joker is {{a fictional}} supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first {{appeared}} in the debut issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book Batman (April 25, 1940), published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.|$|E
