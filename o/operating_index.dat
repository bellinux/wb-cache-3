The paper proposes a novel transmission scheme for text information by hiding it into a carrier image. Firstly, we use ASCII codes to represent the text information and encode these information codes by BCH code before transmitting them. Secondly, we divide the carrier image into 8 × 8 blocks and transform every block by two-dimensional DCT, calculate JND value of every DCT coefficient and choose the hiding coefficients. Finally, we hide the information codes into the selected coefficients in DCT domain. The process of extracting information codes is the inverse.

40|$|Since {{blasting}} is a comminution process, {{the feasibility}} of establishing a correlation between the Bond rod mill work index (kWh/t) and some easily measurable physico-mechanical properties relevant to blasting was investigated. Further, the concept of <b>operating</b> blast work <b>index</b> and its potential applications were explored. Four different rock types and a well documented case study of two blasts were selected for this study. The work index {{is found to be}} uncorrelated with the density and unconfined compressive strength, slightly related with tensile strength, and well correlated with dynamic rock properties, especially the P-wave velocity and the bulk modulus. The standard deviation in measured compressive and tensile strength values is found to be very high, compared to their seismic and dynamic elastic properties. The case study encompassed two blasts with identical blast-patterns and rock type consuming almost the same amount of explosive (kg/t) but with very different specific blast energies (MJ/t). The agreement between <b>operating</b> work <b>index</b> of the two blasts (13. 4 kWh/t vs. 13. 1 kWh/t) and laboratory work index (17. 0 kWh/t) was modest (within 30 %). The <b>operating</b> work <b>index</b> corresponding to either blast has been used to predict the product size (P$ sb{ 80 }$) of the other. The choice of feed size (F$ sb{ 80 }$) was discussed; whereas the previous researchers had used the theoretical value of infinity, the use of much smaller value, the average of effective burden and spacing, was proposed. This concept is used in a proposed method to estimate blasting energy requirements as a function of blast geometry, rock type and desired product size. Future test work that would provide a data base and validation for this concept is described...|$|R

40|$|Problems {{related to}} Power System Reliability {{calculations}} are very complex since it involves modeling the stochastic {{nature of the}} power system. Till now most of the reliability calculations were performed using a probalilistic model which aims at foreseeing only the average outage performance {{of a group of}} units during {{a long period of time}} [2]. Most models permit only the existance of two states i. e., whether an unit is available or not. Inclusion of additional states increases the complexity of the model. Using modern tools like fuzzy logic and neural networks, it is much more easier to incorporate the stochastic nature of the power system. It is also very convenient to model the power system closer to the actual <b>operating</b> <b>indices</b> rather than to use averaged indices. This paper presents the generator and load model which use fuzzy logic. Further the models are extended to the system with many units which is defined on aggregate basis. Finally, the system reliability is defined in the fuzzified jargon as Linguistic Reserve Capacity States. Artificial Neural Network is used to model the essential parameters of the generating units. The method presented can be easily incorporated into the existing frequency and duration approach for the evaluation of power system reliability. The proposed method has been applied to existing system data and the results are presented and discussed...|$|R
