50|$|The European <b>Covered</b> <b>Bond</b> Council (ECBC) is a European {{platform}} for <b>covered</b> <b>bonds,</b> which brings together <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> issuers, credit analysts, investment bankers, rating agencies and other interested market participants. The ECBC {{was created by}} the European Mortgage Federation in 2004. The European <b>Covered</b> <b>Bond</b> Council focuses on the developments shaping the economic and regulatory environment of <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> at EU level and also globally. The goal is to enhance the visibility of <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> at European and global level. As of January 2016, the ECBC has over 100 members across over 30 active <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> jurisdictions. ECBC members represent over 95% of <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> outstanding, which were worth nearly 2.5 trillion EUR at the end of 2015.

40|$|Following the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> (bank-issued {{debt instruments}} with credit en-hancements such as dual-recourse and dynamic cover pool) {{have been discussed}} {{as an alternative to}} mortgage-backed-securities (MBS) because of their potential of adding stability to the banking system. While being liquid is a key feature of the MBS market, the liquidity of <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> remains less well-understood by investors and academics. To better understand <b>covered</b> <b>bonds,</b> this project measures the liquidity of German <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> using transactional data and several common proxies. Results show that German <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> liquidity is resilient: German <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> became less liquid after the Lehman Brothers default and recovered to the pre-crisis level in only one year. Surprisingly, jumbo <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> (a conventionally more liquid <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> market) have lost their liquidity advantage since the onset of the financial crisis. Furthermore, al-though the <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> market remained relatively liquid after the Lehman shock, the illiquidity risk premium has become larger post-Lehman compared to pre-Lehman, implying that investors require a higher compensation for holding illiquid <b>covered</b> <b>bonds.</b> The result of this study may have implications for countries that are new to <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> to emphasize on managing the liquidity of this market...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{liquidity}} in the Norwegian secondary <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> market, {{in comparison to}} <b>other</b> Scandinavian <b>covered</b> and government <b>bond</b> markets. We have gathered data on trades and bonds in the markets from market participants and Financial S upervisory Authorities in the relevant countries, a process that {{can be characterized as}} challenging and time consuming. We discuss how new regulations, the reversal of the Government Swap Agreement and the introduction of the Norwegian <b>Covered</b> <b>Bonds</b> Bench mark has affected liquidity. Further, we investigate any differences in liquidity with in the Norwegian <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> market. The research is conducted by implementing different liquidity measures that together allow for thorough research of liquidity in the markets we focus on. Overall, we find that the liquidity in the Norwegian secondary <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> market is neither higher nor lower than the liquidity in the comparable markets, even if there are important differences between some markets. Looking at dif ferent groups of bonds in the Norwegian <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> market, we conclude that the larger bonds included in the <b>Covered</b> <b>Bond</b> Benchmark have the highest liquidity. Over the last years, the liquidity in the Norwegian <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> market has improved considerably along with the growth of the market. From an unstable period with few bonds in the market in 2007 and 2008, all measures point at higher liquidity from 2010 / 2011 in more stable market conditions. We {{have not been able to}} prove what part new regul ations and the reversal of the swap a greement have played in the development, but we have some evidence for higher liquidity due to the implementation of the Covered B ond Benchmark. nhhma...|$|R
25|$|In Europe {{there exists}} a type of asset-backed <b>bond</b> called a <b>covered</b> <b>bond,</b> {{commonly}} known by the German term Pfandbriefe. <b>Covered</b> <b>bonds</b> were first created in 19th-century Germany when Frankfurter Hypo began issuing mortgage <b>covered</b> <b>bonds.</b> The market has been regulated since {{the creation of a}} law governing the securities in Germany in 1900. The key difference between <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> and mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities is that banks that make loans and package them into <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> keep those loans on their books. This means that when a company with mortgage assets on its books issues the <b>covered</b> <b>bond,</b> its balance sheet grows, which would not occur if it issued an MBS, although it may still guarantee the securities payments.|$|R
40|$|<b>Covered</b> <b>bonds,</b> {{which have}} been part of European fi nance since the time of Frederick the Great, are now being widely touted as the answer to securitization’s imperfections.

This article attempts to demystify <b>covered</b> <b>bonds,</b> examining how they fi t within a larger fi nancing framework, analyzing their legal rights and obligations, and comparing their costs and benefi ts. The benefi ts of <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are similar to those of}} securitization; both can access low-cost capital market funding with low risk to their investors, and both can be used to regenerate lending markets. The costs of <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> may be higher, though, because the “dynamic” collateral pools and “dual” recourse to the issuer that protect <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> shift virtually all risk to unsecured creditors. Whether that risk should be allowed to be shifted so asymmetrically is a policy question for any nascent <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> regime...|$|R
