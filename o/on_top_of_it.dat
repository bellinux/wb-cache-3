In 1947, a {{pedestal}} of granite taken from the Mellon Mansion was erected on the northern end of the oval. <b>On</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was placed a life-size bronze statue of Christ with open arms. On Armistice Day, November 11, 1951, the monument was dedicated to the defenders of the United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun {{in the rear of the}} turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E

5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E
5|$|Parliament then {{appointed}} Thomas Dickenson, {{the local}} mayor, {{as the governor}} of Clifford's Tower. Control of the castle rested with the post of mayor until the Restoration. Efforts were made to separate the structures of Clifford's Tower, which Parliament used as a garrison, from the buildings of the bailey, which continued {{to be used as}} a prison. Oliver Cromwell visited Clifford's Tower in 1650, and received a salute from the guns stationed <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The cost of the garrison was levied on the city of York.|$|E
5|$|Stela 21 {{is located}} inside the chamber {{at the top}} of StructureA-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber {{collapsed}} <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand hands a shield with the face of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.|$|E

5|$|The Hachisuka scroll {{contains}} paintings {{which are}} not associated with any text sections of the scroll. The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the second text section of the Hinohara scroll, where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed tsumado (hinged plank door) and shitomido (latticed shutters). Next to her is an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> (tōdai).|$|E
5|$|The magician John Nevil Maskelyne {{also criticized}} {{the design of}} the {{experiment}} for taking place under a table. The psychologist Millais Culpin wrote the experiment was not scientific and questioned why the experiment was done under the table instead of in a more convenient position <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Before the accordion experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the accordion feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's accordion played only two pieces, Home Sweet Home and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} potbelly monuments {{is that they}} were representations of rulership. This is suggested by the body position represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, Antigua Guatemala, Kaminaljuyu, Santa Cruz del Quiché, Takalik Abaj, Tikal, Ujuxte, El Balsamo, Los Cerritos and La Nueva in Guatemala, Chalchuapa in El Salvador, and Copán in Honduras. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then Bilbao Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Kini Nui, a great temple at the island's centre, Jaller and Takua {{are confronted}} by all six Rahkshi. The six Toa mount a united {{offensive}} and defeat five of them, but a surviving Rahkshi attacks Takua. Jaller sacrifices himself to protect Takua, and Jaller's final words prompt Takua to don the Mask of Light: the Mask transforms him into Takanuva, the Toa of Light. Defeating the final Rakhshi, he constructs a craft {{powered by the}} worm-like creatures inside the Rahkshi to guide him to Makuta. Traveling to his lair beneath Mata Nui, the two hold a Kohlii contest for the island's fate. At Takanuva's bidding, the Toa, Turaga and Matoran gather together in the chamber, and witness Takanuva merging with Makuta to form a single powerful being. With Takanuva's willpower dominant, the being raises a gate leading deeper beneath the island, through which the gathered people flee. The being also revives Jaller before the gate collapses <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The Turaga proceed to awaken Mata Nui using the Mask of Light, which in turn revives Takanuva. The film ends with Takanuva discovering , the Matoran's original home.|$|E
5|$|Construction resumed in 1879 {{under the}} {{direction}} of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lincoln Casey of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Casey redesigned the foundation, strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40,000 tons. The first stone atop the unfinished stump was laid August 7, 1880 in a small ceremony attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes, Casey and a few others. The president placed a small coin on which he had scratched his initials and the date in the bed of wet cement at the 150-foot level before the first stone was laid <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Casey found 92 memorial stones (presented stones) already inlaid into the interior walls of the first phase of construction. Before construction continued he temporarily removed eight stones at the 150-foot level so that the walls at that level could be sloped outward, producing thinner second-phase walls. He inserted those stones and most of the remaining memorial stones stored in the lapidarium into the interior walls during 1885–89. The bottom third of the monument is a slightly lighter shade {{than the rest of the}} construction because the marble was obtained from different quarries.|$|E

Following this, tamp the surface with pestles or stamp with feet randomly to even out the surface. Every five-cun layer of earth should be compressed to three cun; every three-cun layer of brick and stone to {{one and a half}} cun.|$|E

As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Geophysical prospection {{was carried out in}} some areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses.

5|$|The {{contract}} to lease two Boeing 737-300 aircraft from 1994 {{was made with}} International Lease Finance Corporation in May. Maintenance was outsourced to a British company, after Braathens, which also operated 737 Classic aircraft, had denied Color Air the use of its simulators and technical workshops. For the start-up, Color Air hired 18 pilots, 40 flight attendants and 40 ground employees, {{in addition to the}} administration. The company was criticized for only hiring women flight attendants. Braathens operated with an internal pension age of 58 years for its pilots, while SAS had a 60-year age limit. Due to EEA rules, the judicial age limit was 65 years, so Color Air was able to hire retired SAS and Braathens pilots. These could be paid only NOK500,000 in annual wage, since they received a full pension from their old employers <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association stated that this was morally reprehensible, but Color Air was supported by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, medical experts, and SAS, who all claimed that there were no medical reasons to not let people in their 60s operate aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church was}} {{markedly}} cruciform {{in shape and}} smaller than the present floor plan. This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides (Fig. 4). The central tower rose above the crossing {{between the north and}} south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey. The north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure, dating to the years immediately after the church's 1224 foundation; the clerestory windows <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> are from the later post-1270 reconstruction. This wall has blocked up windows extending to a low level above ground, indicating that it was an external wall and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle (Fig. 5).|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett was pitted against Rhino with Tito Ortiz as Special Guest Referee. Jarrett was {{accompanied}} to the ring by Gail Kim. A casket was positioned by the ring, as in storyline Jarrett planned to bury his opponent after defeating them. During the match, Kim distracted Ortiz allowing Jarrett to bash Rhino {{over the head with}} a guitar for a two-count. AMW then came to ringside to distract Ortiz and slide Jarrett another guitar. As Jarrett attempted to hit Rhino with the guitar, Rhino countered by crashing into Jarrett with his Gore maneuver for the pinfall victory at 5 minutes and 30 seconds to become the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. After the contest, AMW, Jarrett, and Team Canada attacked Rhino and placed him in the casket. Team 3D came to his defense, as well as the 3LiveKru. A brawl between all the wrestlers took place, with Eric Young of Team Canada ending up in the casket and Rhino standing <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> holding the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt as the event came to a close.|$|E

The presence at left of a young man on crutches, not in the source, suggests that others are doing the same. The sleeping woman beside the tomb is either another such, or an attendant on the princess. As Constantina sleeps, Agnes, holding her lamb, appears to her, saying Si in xpm (Christum) credideris sanaberis ("If you believe in Christ you will be healed", an adaptation of the text in the source). In the final scene, the cured, and baptized, Constantina tells her crowned father the story, with the inscription Hec est virgo sapiens una de numero prudencium ("This is a wise virgin, one of the number of the prudent").|$|E

The main station entrance and ventilation building {{consists of four}} escalators and an elevator {{on the west side}} of Hudson Boulevard between 33rd and 34th Streets. The main entrance has a turtle shell-shaped glass canopy above it that allows light to shine on the upper mezzanine. The elevator is located south of 34th Street in Hudson Park, while the escalator entrance is located further east, closer to the boulevard. At the time of construction, the ventilation building was designed so developers could built <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> later.
