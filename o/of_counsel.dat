5|$|The Assistance <b>of</b> <b>Counsel</b> Clause includes, as {{relevant}} here, {{at least six}} distinct rights: the right to counsel of choice, the right to appointed counsel, the right not to be constructively denied counsel, the right to conflict-free counsel, the effective assistance <b>of</b> <b>counsel,</b> {{and the right to}} represent oneself pro se.|$|E
5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance <b>of</b> <b>counsel</b> of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance <b>of</b> <b>counsel</b> is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth in}} the {{availability}} <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> services {{has been accompanied by}} growing concern about the conduct of counsellors, which in turn has led to the expressed need for an ethics <b>of</b> <b>counselling.</b> This paper will argue that there is an inherent tension between this need and the central tenets of one variety <b>of</b> <b>counselling,</b> client-centred counselling. The tension is identifiable on the basis of an inquiry into the nature of moral judgment which results in the recognition of the implicit value base in client-centred counselling. It is only when this value base is made explicit that any adequate ethics <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> becomes a viable possibility...|$|R

40|$|It {{is unfair}} to {{conclude}} that Western and Eastern differences have caused conflict in the practice <b>of</b> <b>counselling,</b> especially in mandated counselling. It {{is reasonable to assume}} that without the Western approach and understanding <b>of</b> <b>counselling,</b> the East would still be unable to develop their own theory of helping. How then does one compare different approaches? Such an assessment can be argued clearly from a cultural perspective as in the case <b>of</b> mandated <b>counselling.</b> This paper discusses the influence of culture which has shaped the practice <b>of</b> mandated <b>counselling</b> and the appropriate practice <b>of</b> mandated <b>counselling</b> in a Malaysian setting. Many of the points discussed here are drawn from the data informed by seven informants in a research entitled ‘Mandated Counselling In Malaysia: A Heuristic Phenomenological Inquiry Of Involuntary Participation’. The phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> as originated and practised in the West, which has served as the significant model for the Malaysian style <b>of</b> <b>counselling,</b> is discussed. The concept of guidance and crisis intervention in counselling as practised in Malaysia has shaped the appropriate acceptance <b>of</b> mandated <b>counselling.</b> Respect for authority, a need to ‘save face’, directives from the authority and the values of we-ness makes mandated counselling in a Malaysian setting a relevant intervention...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study {{was based on}} the premise that there exists numerous methodologies <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> that are grounded in non-Western forms <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> psychology. The problem is that there is very little information to be found on Indigenous forms <b>of</b> <b>counselling.</b> The intention <b>of</b> this study is to begin the process of identifying the theory that underlies Northern Manitoba Cree counselling methods. This study, however, only begins the task of documenting the theoretical premises underlying Muskego (Swampy) and Rock (Asini) Cree counselling and there is much more to done. The research methodology used for this study incorporated a blend of Western academic theory and Indigenous Research approaches. The Western theories adopted for this study were Ethnography and Naturalistic Inquiry. The Indigenous research was primarily Oral Tradition, as it had been taught to the researcher in her home territory of Northern Manitoba. Both the data collection and analysis phases utilized a blending of Western and Indigenous approaches to identify relevant information regarding theoretical premises <b>of</b> <b>counselling.</b> Indigenous forms <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> are grounded on animism and are predominantly intuitive in nature. Although this philosophical basis is in diametric opposition with Western academic psychology, it is no less valid, just different. This study identifies methodologies to demonstrate that there are methods <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> other than Western psychological methods. The study documents five theoretical premises; the role of language in learning to become and carrying <b>counselling,</b> the role <b>of</b> spirituality in <b>counselling,</b> Indigenous counselors receive training that is structured and systematic, becoming a counselor requires specific inherent personal qualities, and looks at a few techniques <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> utilized by the Muskego and Asini Cree people...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{provision}} <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> {{in general}} practice is increasing, despite uncertainty concerning its effectiveness. Furthermore, {{the relationship between}} <b>counselling</b> and prescribing <b>of</b> antidepressants, hypnotics and anxiolytics in general practice is not known. AIM. This study set out to assess the relationship between provision <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> and prescribing <b>of</b> antidepressants, hypnotics and anxiolytics in general practice. METHOD. An observational, cross-sectional study of general practices in Oxfordshire Family Health Services Authority was undertaken. Practices were surveyed on the availability <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> services. The quantity and cost of prescribing of psychotropic drugs over one year (April 1992 to March 1993) were compared for practices with different levels <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> provision. RESULTS. <b>Of</b> the 82 (96 %) respondents, 74 (90 %) referred patients for counselling; of these 74 practices, {{the highest levels of}} prescribing, in terms of number of items and net ingredient cost, were seen in those practices that employed a counsellor working on the premises. The lowest levels of prescribing were seen in those practices that referred their patients to a counsellor not working on the practice premises. CONCLUSION. The relationship between the provision <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> and the level of prescribing of antidepressants, hypnotics and anxiolytics is complex. In this study lower levels of prescribing of these drugs in practices with higher provision <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> were not observed...|$|R
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial <b>of</b> <b>counsel),</b> constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} rights {{regulate}} pre-trial procedure: {{access to a}} non-excessive bail, the right to indictment by a grand jury, {{the right to a}}n information (charging document), the right to a speedy trial, and the right to be tried in a specific venue. Several of these rights are trial rights: the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial, the right to confront witnesses at trial, the right to a public trial, the right to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography, and the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself. Others, such as the assistance <b>of</b> <b>counsel</b> and due process rights, have application throughout the proceeding.|$|E
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects the role <b>of</b> <b>counsel</b> and certain {{attributes of the}} attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E

Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance <b>of</b> <b>counsel,</b> cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> services in schools in Ireland. The use <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> provides a potentially useful {{means by which}} education may better serve the needs young people attending secondary school in Ireland. The study examines the counselling provision in Irish schools {{in the context of}} the development <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> theory and therapy both world wide and in the Irish context. The development <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> throughout the ages is considered initially. This provides an historical perspective by which to understand the nature <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> theory and therapy. Some progress in the area of educational theory was made during the middle ages, but counselling as we know developed only in the very late nineteenth century. Having considered the background to counselling, the definitions, types and theories which have evolved throughout this century are considered, working towards an understanding <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> theory and therapy as it is today. The study then narrows down to examine the status <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> In Ireland today. The types of training and services available are listed, giving an indication of the range of theories in use and considering the therapies which are available and relevant to Irish society. As the specific area under investigation is counselling in schools in Ireland, the status <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> in Irish schools is studied, on an educational policy basis, and also considering the practical situation in schools and its implication for the counselling provision. The next chapter considers the person involved in the study, the school going child, this chapter attempts to resolve whether the nature of adolescence is such that a counselling service would be of particular benefit to this age group. The research is described, explaining the reasoning behind the type of methods used. The research used a questionnaire, completed by three-hundred and thirty pupils in fourteen Dublin schools. These questionnaires yeilded information by which the counselling provision in Irish schools was then assessed...|$|R

The institutionalised construction <b>of</b> <b>counselling</b> by doctors and matrons, and their power versus the power of the nurse counsellors was also cited as sources of conflict.
