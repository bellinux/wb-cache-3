25|$|<b>Ophthalmologic</b> {{problems}} include strabismus. This requires early identification {{to avoid}} amblyopia. Surgery or patching are usually necessary to treat strabismus if diagnosed early. Refractive errors {{in patients with}} FXS are also common.|$|E
25|$|The renowned Andalusian <b>ophthalmologic</b> surgeon Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi ("Abulcasis", 936–1013 CE) {{relied on}} opium and {{mandrake}} as surgical anaesthetics {{and wrote a}} treatise, al-Tasrif, that influenced medical thought well into the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Manifestation {{appears to}} be {{slightly}} different according to race and sex. Erythema nodosum is far more common in men than in women and in Caucasians than in other races. In Japanese patients, <b>ophthalmologic</b> and cardiac involvement are more common than in other races.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{complete}} inability to see color, individuals with complete achromatopsia {{have a number}} of other <b>ophthalmologic</b> aberrations. Included among these aberrations are greatly decreased visual acuity (<0.1 or 20/200) in daylight, Hemeralopia, nystagmus, and severe photophobia. The fundus of the eye appears completely normal. Also see Pingelap#Color-blindness.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of retinal tears with new onset of floaters was surprisingly high (14%; 95% confidence interval, 12–16%) {{as reported in}} a meta-analysis published {{as part of the}} Rational Clinical Examination Series in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Patients with new onset flashes and/or floaters, especially when associated with visual loss or restriction in the visual field, should seek more urgent <b>ophthalmologic</b> evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Large {{intestinal}} ileus is {{most commonly}} seen in horses following orthopedic surgery, but its risk is also increased {{in cases where}} post-operative pain is not well-controlled, after long surgeries, and possibly following <b>ophthalmologic</b> surgeries. It is characterized by decreased manure output (<3 piles per day), rather than nasogastric reflux, as well as decreased gut sounds, signs of colic, and the occasional impaction of the cecum or large colon. Cecal impactions can be fatal, so {{care must be taken}} to monitor the horse for large intestinal ileus after orthopedic surgery, primarily by watching for decreased manure production.|$|E

2500|$|The {{capacity}} of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences of melanin binding is unknown. [...] Clinical trials excluded subtle effects and optimal duration of treatment. [...] There are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring. [...] Lamotrigine binds {{to the eye}} and melanin-containing tissues which can accumulate over time and may cause toxicity. [...] Prescribers {{should be aware of}} the possibility of long-term <b>ophthalmologic</b> effects and base treatment on [...] clinical response. [...] Patient compliance should be periodically reassessed with lab and medical testing of liver and kidney function to monitor progress or side effects.|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{genetics}} encompasses {{many different}} areas, including clinical practice of physicians, genetic counselors, and nutritionists, clinical diagnostic laboratory activities, and {{research into the}} causes and inheritance of genetic disorders. [...] Examples of conditions that fall {{within the scope of}} medical genetics include birth defects and dysmorphology, mental retardation, autism, and mitochondrial disorders, skeletal dysplasia, connective tissue disorders, cancer genetics, teratogens, and prenatal diagnosis. [...] Medical genetics is increasingly becoming relevant to many common diseases. [...] Overlaps with other medical specialties are beginning to emerge, as recent advances in genetics are revealing etiologies for neurologic, endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, <b>ophthalmologic,</b> renal, psychiatric, and dermatologic conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Congenital {{stationary}} {{night blindness}} is an <b>ophthalmologic</b> disorder in horses which is present at birth (congenital), non-progressive (stationary) and affects the animal's vision in conditions of low lighting. Horses with CSNB may be hesitant to enter dimly-lit places - such as indoor arenas, dark stalls, or trailers - and be apprehensive when in such conditions, which {{may interfere with}} handling or riding. CSNB is usually diagnosed based on the owner's observations, but some horses have visibly abnormal eyes: poorly aligned eyes (dorsomedial strabismus) or involuntary eye movement (nystagmus). The condition can be confirmed using electroretinography, from which a [...] "negative ERG" [...] indicates CSNB. While the retina is a normal shape, the nerve signal triggered when light reaches rod cells does not reach the brain. Rod cells in the retina are connected to bipolar cells, which transmit the nerve impulse to {{the next set of}} neurons. It is thought that these cells fail to undergo the basic chemical reaction for nerve impulse transmission, which involves shuttling of calcium (Ca2+).|$|E
