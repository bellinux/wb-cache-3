In September 1506, when Philip died of a fever in Spain, many of the singers of the grande chapelle departed, mostly going back to France or the Netherlands, but Reingot was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> who {{remained}} behind, along with Pierre de La Rue. For {{the next several years}} they took part in Juana's bizarre journey across Castile, each night singing a requiem to the disinterred corpse of Philip, which they brought along with them in its coffin, until Ferdinand II, Juana's father, had her locked up in the fortress at Tordesillas and had Philip more permanently buried.|$|E

500|$|Michael Ray Rhodes {{directed}} the episode {{as part of}} a deal with The Bronx Zoo, another television show filmed at Paramount Studios. Rhodes had previously won Emmy Awards on four occasions for his work on the television series Insights between 1981 and 1984. Wil Wheaton later recalled that there were some issues between the main cast and the director, but didn't know what they were about as he only worked for one day of the shoot. Gates McFadden described it as [...] "one of the most sexist episodes we ever had", and Patrick Stewart sought to have the episode changed to reduce those elements. Some of the production crew subsequently thought poorly of [...] "Angel One". Executive producer Maurice Hurley described it as [...] "Terrible. Just terrible. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> you'd just as soon erase". Producer Herbert Wright felt that the [...] "sexual places it was dragged to were absurd".|$|E

Speedie led the NFL in receiving in 1951 {{and was named}} a first-team All Pro, {{but he did not}} play in the championship game due to an injury. He was selected for the Pro Bowl for a second time in 1952. After that season, however, he left the Browns to join the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union under acrimonious circumstances. Speedie had an independent streak that did not sit well with Brown, whose domineering coaching style grated against many of the men who played for him. [...] "He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> that Paul Brown picked on quite a bit", recalled former teammate Ken Carpenter. [...] "He'd get on Speedie's case for no particular reason." [...] Speedie showed his displeasure by bringing a skunk to training camp in 1952 and calling it [...] "Paul". Brown told Speedie he did not think it was very funny, to which Speedie responded that it was a nocturnal animal and was named after Paul Revere.|$|E

2500|$|Nussbaum also refines {{the concept}} of [...] "objectification", as {{originally}} advanced by Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin. Nussbaum defines the idea of treating as an object with seven qualities: instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness, fungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity. Her characterization of pornography {{as a tool of}} objectification puts Nussbaum at odds with sex-positive feminism. At the same time, Nussbaum argues in support of the legalization of prostitution, a position she reiterated in a 2008 essay following the Spitzer scandal, writing: [...] "The idea that we ought to penalize women with few choices by removing <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> they do have is grotesque." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Stove's {{argument}} for induction, {{based on the}} statistical syllogism, was presented in the Rationality of Induction and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late Donald Cary Williams (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book The Ground of Induction. Stove argued {{that it is a}} statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, {{as long as it is}} not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset [...] "matches" [...] the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or [...] "representative" [...] ones. So as long as you have no reason to think that your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.|$|E

You couldn't ever take an artist's opinion on a picture. Nine out of ten of them had views on Art which would have admitted them to any looney-bin, and no questions asked. He had met several of the species who absolutely raved over things which any reasonable chappie would decline to be found dead in a ditch with. His admiration for the Wigmore Venus, which had faltered for a moment during his conversation with J. B. Wheeler, returned in all its pristine vigour. Absolute rot, he meant to say, {{to try to make}} out that it wasn't <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> and just like mother used to make. Look how Lucille had liked it! ...|$|E
