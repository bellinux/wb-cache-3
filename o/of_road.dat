5|$|The first {{segments}} <b>of</b> <b>road</b> {{appeared in}} the location of what would become RE11 by 1940. The southern road segment began at an at-grade intersection, near the location of RE11, and traveled northward, before traveling slightly westward and terminating at a dead end. The road was graded and drained, and had a gravel surface, with a cattle guard near the middle of it. The northern segment <b>of</b> <b>road</b> traveled near the location of RE11. This road was also graded and drained, and had three cattle guards located along its course. By 1951, a gate had {{been added to the}} southern road segment, and the northern segment had several turns straightened and lengthened. On October 28, 1953, RM 2134 was designated from Millersview along a road to the northern segment of what would become RE11.

5|$|While Britain's {{seafaring}} {{and trading}} concerns ensured {{the spread of}} cricket overseas, at home it relied heavily on ease of transport and communications, most of these being waterborne as long journeys tended to be undertaken using coastal or river vessels.

The turnpike trusts borrowed capital for road maintenance against the security of tolls. This arrangement became the common method <b>of</b> <b>road</b> maintenance for the next 150 years and came in time to assist the spread of cricket throughout Britain.|$|E
