25|$|On 19 November 1931, Urlus {{delivered}} his last Tristan in Amsterdam. It was his final <b>operatic</b> <b>performance</b> {{after more than}} 1000 nights spanning 37 years. He still appeared occasionally in concerts, however, until 1933.|$|E
25|$|A Kathakali {{repertoire}} is an <b>operatic</b> <b>performance</b> {{where an}} ancient story is playfully dramatized. Traditionally, a Kathakali performance is long, starting at dusk and continuing through dawn, with interludes and breaks for the performers and audience. Some plays continued over several nights, starting at dusk everyday. Modern performances are shorter. The stage with seating typically in open grounds outside a temple, {{but in some}} places, special theatres called Kuttampalam built inside the temple compounds have been in use.|$|E
25|$|The year 1867 {{brought the}} {{engagement}} of Sweden's Christine Nilsson, and Santley appeared {{with her in}} La traviata and I Lombardi. La forza del destino was also given, along with Don Giovanni, Dinorah, Fidelio, Oberon, Medea, Der Freischütz and Les Huguenots. After the autumn tour with Alessandro Bettini in Les Huguenots, the November session opened with Faust, followed by La traviata and Martha, and Linda di Chamounix, in which Santley first sang the part of Antonio. Don Giovanni, with Clara Louise Kellogg as Zerlina and Santley as Leporello, {{proved to be the}} final <b>operatic</b> <b>performance</b> of that season: Santley had been due to play Pizarro, when the news came to him, while he was appearing in concert in Brighton, that Her Majesty's Theatre had been burnt to the ground. Santley had sung the last notes ever to be heard in that theatre.|$|E

25|$|The 1751 Carnival in Dresden saw the {{retirement}} of Faustina from <b>operatic</b> <b>performance.</b> Hasse continued to produce new operas throughout the decade, including a setting of Metastasio's Il re pastore, a text later used by Mozart. In 1756 the Seven Years' War compelled the court at Dresden to move to Warsaw, though Hasse himself lived mostly in Italy, travelling to Poland solely to supervise productions of his operas, if at all. In the autumn of 1760 he moved to Vienna, where he stayed {{for the next two}} years, returning to Dresden in 1763 to find much of his home destroyed and the musical apparatus of the court opera wrecked. Hasse's main patron at Dresden, king Augustus III of Poland and Saxony died soon after and his successor, who also died quickly, deemed elaborate musical events at the court superfluous. Hasse and Faustina were paid two years' salary but given no pension.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Domingo {{made his}} operatic debut in {{a leading role}} as Alfredo in La traviata at the Teatro María Teresa Montoya in Monterrey. Later the same year, he made his debut in the United States with the Dallas Civic Opera, where he sang the role of Arturo in Lucia di Lammermoor {{opposite}} Joan Sutherland {{in the title role}} and Ettore Bastianini as Enrico. In 1962, he returned to Texas to sing the role of Edgardo in the same opera with Lily Pons at the Fort Worth Opera. It would be the coloratura soprano's final <b>operatic</b> <b>performance.</b> That November Domingo sang the second tenor role of Cassio to Mario del Monaco's celebrated Otello in Hartford, Connecticut. At the end of 1962, he signed a six-month contract with the Israel National Opera in Tel Aviv, but later extended the contract and stayed {{for two and a half}} years, singing 280 performances of 12 different roles.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the great}} fanfare {{surrounding}} {{her return to}} the Met in early 1951, and her success in resuming her roles there, Flagstad decided {{that it would be}} her final year singing Wagner on the stage. She had gained quite a bit of weight since her pre-war years at the Met when she sang those long and physically demanding roles night after night. In 1950, when she accepted Bing's invitation, she felt she did not have the stamina she had had as a younger woman. She had also developed an arthritic hip in mid-1951 (and had to consult doctors in New York); this further made the operatic stage difficult for her, especially when singing Wagner. She gave her farewell <b>operatic</b> <b>performance</b> at the Met on 1 April 1952, not as Brünnhilde or Isolde but in the title role of Gluck's Alceste, a role she had learnt in the war years in Norway. In London she appeared as Dido (another recently learnt role) in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas at the Mermaid Theatre (in the 1951 Festival of Britain season): the portrayal was recorded (in studio), and issued by EMI in January 1953 (see: Recordings). Her last operatic appearance was as Dido in Oslo on June 5, 1953.|$|E

40|$|Lay {{listeners}} are reliable judges {{when evaluating}} pitch accuracy of occasional singers, suggesting that enculturation and laypersons’ perceptual abilities are sufficient to judge “simple” music material adequately. However, {{the definition of}} pitch accuracy in <b>operatic</b> <b>performances</b> is much more complex than in melodies performed by occasional singers. Furthermore, because listening to <b>operatic</b> <b>performances</b> is not a common activity, laypersons‘ experience with this complicated acoustic signal is more limited. To {{address the question of}} music expertise in evaluating operatic singing voices, listeners without music training were compared with the music experts examined in a recent study (Larrouy-Maestri, Magis, & Morsomme, 2014 a) and their ratings were modeled with regard to underlying acoustic variables of pitch accuracy. As expected, some participants lacked test-retest reliability in their judgments. However, listeners who used a consistent strategy relied on a definition of pitch accuracy that appears to overlap with the quantitative criteria used by music experts. Besides clarifying the role of music expertise in the evaluation of melodies, our findings show robust perceptual abilities in laypersons when listening to complex signals such as <b>operatic</b> <b>performances.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

[...] She landed a second operatic role as Mallika in Delibes' Lakmé, which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company. [...] The opera opened in June 1910. [...] Supposedly, Luisa Tetrazzini, the prima donna soprano of the company, feared that Gauthier's voice would outshine her own, and demanded that Gauthier {{be removed from the}} opera. [...] The company's director acquiesced to Tetrazzini's demands, informing Gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing. Rather than give in to artistic blackmail, Gauthier quit opera entirely.|$|E

6000|$|... "In Prussia, {{under the}} reign of Frederick William II., when one good, hard-handed man governed the whole country like a strict schoolmaster, the public amusements for the people were made such as to present a model for all states. The theatres were {{strictly}} supervised, and actors obliged {{to conform to the}} rules of decorum and morality. The plays and performances were under the immediate supervision of men of grave morals, who allowed nothing corrupting to appear; and the effect of this administration and restraint is to be seen in Berlin even to this day. The public gardens are full of charming little resorts, where, every afternoon, for a very moderate sum, one can have either a concert of good music, or a very fair dramatic or <b>operatic</b> <b>performance.</b> Here whole families may be seen enjoying together a wholesome and refreshing entertainment,--the mother and aunts with their knitting, the baby, the children of all ages, and the father,--their faces radiant with that mild German light of contentment and good will which one feels to be characteristic of the nation. When I saw these things, and thought of our own outcast, unprovided boys and young men, haunting the streets and alleys of cities, in places far from the companionship of mothers and sisters, I felt as if {{it would be better for}} a nation to be brought up by a good strict schoolmaster king than to try to be a republic." ...|$|E
