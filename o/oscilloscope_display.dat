25|$|Würzburg C {{featured}} lobe {{switching to}} improve aiming accuracy. The C model was aimed by sending the signal {{out of one}} of two slightly off-centre feed horns {{in the middle of the}} antenna, the signal being switched rapidly between the two horns. Both returns were sent to an <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>display,</b> slightly delaying the signal from one of the horns. The result appeared as two closely separated blips which the operator attempted to keep at the same height on the display. This system offered much faster feedback on changes in target position, and changes in signal strength due to changes in reflection off the target affected both lobes equally, eliminating common reading errors. An almost identical system was used in the United States' first gun-laying radar, the SCR-268.|$|E

25|$|Several {{versions}} of the basic Würzburg system were deployed {{over the course of}} the war. The first, Würzburg A, was operated manually and required the operators to pinpoint the target by maintaining a maximum signal on their <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>display.</b> Since the signal strength changed on its own for various reasons as well as being on or off target, this was inaccurate and generally required the use of a searchlight to spot the target once the radar had settled on an approximate position. Nevertheless, one of the very first Würzburgs in service directly assisted in the shooting-down of an aircraft in May 1940 by orally relaying commands to a flak unit. An experimental Würzburg B added an infra-red detector for fine tuning, but in general these devices proved to be unusable and production was discontinued.|$|E
500|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube {{amusement device}} {{consists of a}} cathode ray tube connected to an oscilloscope {{with a set of}} knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. The CRT projects a spot on the <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>display</b> screen, which traces a parabolic arc across the screen when a switch is activated by the player. This beam spot represents the trajectory of an artillery shell. Overlaid on the screen are transparent plastic targets representing objects such as airplanes. At the end of the spot's trajectory, the beam defocuses, resulting in the spot expanding and blurring. This represents the shell exploding as if detonated by a time fuze. The goal of the game is to have the beam defocus when it is within the bounds of a target. Prior to the beam spot beginning its arc, the player can turn the control knobs to direct the beam spot's trajectory and adjust the delay of the shell burst. The machine can be set to fire a [...] "shell" [...] either once or at a regular interval, which is adjustable by the player. This gives the player the goal of hitting one of the overlay targets with the shell burst within a time limit. The player was recommended to make the trajectory far removed from a straight line [...] "so as to require an increased amount of skill and care".|$|E

A total of 50 were built (all using DEC System Module Blocks and cabinets), most at Lincoln Labs, housing the desktop instruments in four wooden racks. The first LINC included two <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>displays.</b> Twenty-one were sold by DEC at $43,600, delivered in the Production Model design. In these, the tall cabinet sitting behind a white Formica-covered table held two somewhat smaller metal boxes holding the same instrumentation, a Tektronix <b>display</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> over the [...] "front panel" [...] on the user's left, a bay for interfaces over two LINC-Tape drives on the user's right, and a chunky keyboard between them.

50|$|HF/DF used {{a set of}} antennas {{to receive}} the same signal in {{slightly}} different locations or angles, and then used the slight differences in the signal to display the bearing to the transmitter on an <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>display.</b> Earlier systems used a mechanically rotated antenna (or solenoid) and an operator listening for peaks or nulls in the signal, which took considerable time to determine, often {{on the order of}} a minute or more.

50|$|In the past, {{the bypass}} {{capacitor}} in the probe head was adjustable (to achieve this 10× attenuation). More modern probe designs use a laser-trimmed thick-film electronic circuit {{in the head}} that combines the 9 megohm resistor with a fixed-value bypass capacitor; they then place a small adjustable capacitor in parallel with the oscilloscope's input capacitance. Either way, the probe must be adjusted so that it provides uniform attenuation at all frequencies. This {{is referred to as}} compensating the probe. Compensation is usually accomplished by probing a 1 kHz square wave and adjusting the compensating capacitor until the <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>displays</b> the most square waveshape. Most oscilloscopes have a 1 kHz calibration source on their front panels since probe compensation must be done every time a 10:1 probe is attached to an oscilloscope input. Newer, faster probes have more complex compensation arrangements and may occasionally require further adjustments.|$|R
