5|$|The {{blackcap}} has a {{very large}} range, and its population in Europe is estimated at 25–49million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Africa and Asia, the total population is between 80–196million individuals. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{has a very}} large range of 9,650,000km2 (3,700,000mi2), and its {{population}} in Europe is estimated at 17–31million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Asia, the total population is between 54–124million individuals. There {{is no evidence of}} any serious decline in numbers, so it is classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E

5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E
5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> <b>as</b> organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the European {{population}} of the European nightjar range from 470,000 to more than 1million birds, suggesting a total global {{population of}} 2–6million individuals. Although {{there appears to be}} a fall in numbers, it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The huge breeding range and population mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The European {{population}} of the Eurasian nuthatch has been estimated as 22.5–57million birds, suggesting a global total of 45.9–228million individuals. China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Russia each have between 10,000 and 100,000 breeding pairs. The known breeding area is about 23.3million km2 (9million sq mi), which is {{a large proportion of}} the potential suitable habitat, and the population appears to be stable. The large numbers and huge breeding range mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe has {{intrigued}} various cultures, both {{ancient and}} modern, for its peculiar appearance, and {{has often been}} featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> Vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. The UN backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in 2017. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild, with around 1,144 in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{open cup}} nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against {{potential}} predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The clutch, typically {{of three to}} five eggs, is incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a large range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, {{although there has been}} a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of least concern.|$|E
40|$|Writers like Christine Korsgaard and Allen Wood {{understand}} Kant's idea <b>of</b> rational <b>nature</b> <b>as</b> an end {{in itself}} as a commitment to a substantive value.

5|$|The {{other three}} species are {{classified}} by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of Least Concern. The populations {{of all three}} are large, {{with that of the}} magnificent frigatebird thought to be increasing, while the great and lesser frigatebird decreasing. Monitoring populations of all species is difficult due to their movements across the open ocean and low reproductivity. The status of the Atlantic populations of the great and lesser frigatebirds are unknown and possibly extinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} cannot survive on islands where land mammals such as rats and cats have been introduced, and it suffers natural {{predation}} from gulls, skuas, owls and falcons. Although the population may be declining slightly, this petrel is classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of Least Concern {{due to its}} high total numbers. Its presence in rough weather at sea has led to various mariners' superstitions, and, by analogy, to its use as a symbol by revolutionary and anarchist groups.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> <b>as</b> the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E

5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are relatively large, each with a reflective layer, which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Prize medals, minted by Myntverket in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are {{registered}} trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal has {{an image of}} Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design. The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design <b>of</b> <b>Nature,</b> <b>as</b> a Goddess, whose veil is held up by the Genius of Science. These medals and the ones for Physiology/Medicine and Literature were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift has a {{very large}} range, {{exceeding}} 10,000,000km2 (3,800,000mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with {{no evidence of any}} decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, a close relative of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21years old.|$|E

5|$|The masked shrike's {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations. The nest is a neat cup {{built in a}} tree by both adults, and the clutch is normally 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18–20days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked shrike eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire. Populations are decreasing {{in parts of the}} European range, but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns, and the species is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>as</b> being of least concern.|$|E
