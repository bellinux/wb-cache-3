This topic mainly {{research}} the high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> heat supply technology of {{steam turbine generator}} unit and the correlation analysis of turbine under high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>operating</b> condition. High <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> heat supply is an energy saving technology developed {{in order to meet}} the requirements of energy saving and environmental protection. This technology can not only reduce the cold end losses to improve the thermal efficiency of power plant, but also decrease the energy loss and pollution emissions because it take the place of traditional heating boiler. High <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> heat supply of steam turbine is to increase the quantity of air inlet and outlet as well as exhaust temperature through improving turbine <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> For condensing steam turbine unit of 50 MW studied in this article, <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> of which rise to 0. 032 MPa from 0. 0046 MPa, and the exhaust temperature will increase to 70 ℃ respectively.

40|$|SYNOPSIS Hovercraft lift {{fans are}} {{subjected}} to varying <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> due to wave action and craft motions when these vehicles are operating in a seaway. The oscillatory <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> causes the fans to perform dynamically, exhibiting a hysteresis type of response and a corresponding degrada-tion in mean performance. Since hovercraft motions are influenced by variations in lift fan pressure and discharge, {{it is important to}} un-derstand completely the nature of the dynamic performance of lift fans in order to completely solve the hovercraft seakeeping problem. The present study was performed to determine and classify the insta-bilities encountered in a centrifugal fan <b>operating</b> against time-varying <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> A model-scale experiment was developed in which the fan discharge was directed into a flow-measuring device, terminating in a rotating valve which produced an oscillatory <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> superimposed upon a mean aerodynamic resistance. Pressure and local velocity were measured as functions of time at several locations in the fan volute. The measurements permitted the identification of rotating (or propagating) stall in the impeller. One cell and two cell configurations were classified and the transient condition con-necting these two configurations was observed. The mechanisms which lead to rotating stall in a centrifugal compressor are presented and discussed with specific reference to hovercraft applications...|$|R

40|$|Steam {{is highly}} used {{in most of}} the industries. There are many {{occasions}} where low pressure steam is used. Most of the times, relatively higher pressure is generated, transported and finally the pressure is reduced before use. Throttling devices are used for reducing pressure. Throttling valves or pressure reducing valves have been used for this work {{in most of the}} instances. There is a huge potential of utilizing this energy by introducing <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbines. If the turbine exhaust pressure can be further dropped, power generation through the steam turbine can be increased. This research project was created to cover these areas. There is no literature which can be used to calculate the power output of a turbine with known flow rates and input and output conditions. This project is aimed to give the information how much power is generated under the given conditions. This can be used for selecting a suitable <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine for the particular requirement. Giving the capital investment for such project also was an objective. It can be decided whether the selected project on retrofitting pressure reducing valves with the steam turbines is viable. There is no sufficient information on performance of thermo-compressors which can be used for increasing steam pressure. There is an objective of finding out the motive flow required for the known suction flow at known input and output conditions. As the title of the research shows, ultimate objective {{of this study was to}} see whether combining thermo-compressors to reduce <b>back</b> <b>pressures</b> is feasible or not. This research project was done for five input steam conditions and six output steam conditions of the turbines. For a selected turbine, performance at known pressures was calculated. This information was graphically represented to give a clear picture. Similarly performance of thermo-compressors was calculated for known input and conditions. This information also was graphically represented. Finally the performance of the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> turbines were calculated when the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> dropped further by introducing thermo-compressors. Calculated values were graphically represented to check whether this was a viable option. As per the outcome of this project, guide lines were made for <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbines with different input and output conditions. As the input, superheated steam varying from 10 barg at 350 deg. C up to 50 barg at 450 deg. C have been considered. Turbine exhaust pressures varying from 1 bara to 6 bara also have been considered. Guide lines were extended to show the cost of investment to retrofit pressure reducing valves with <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> turbines. Guide lines were made on the amount of motive pressure consumed to increase the pressure of steam at different input and output conditions. These guidelines also were extended to show the capital investment of the installing thermo-compressors. Process steam pressures varying from 2 bara to 6 bara have been discussed against turbine exhaust pressures varying from 1 bara to 6 bara under the study of the behavior of the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbines combined with thermo-compressors. Further study was done to ensure whether there is any effect of the isentropic efficiency and the generator efficiency on this behavior. Finally, it was proved that there was no benefit of <b>operating</b> the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbines at lower exhaust pressure by introducing thermocompressors and increasing the pressure before giving to the process for the pressure and temperature ranges covered in this study. Retrofitting of PRV with steam turbines seems to be an attractive option. This study discussed only the application of superheated steam. Further studies can be extended to saturated steam to use single stage steam turbines. Introducing of thermo-compressors for specific industries also can be done as a further study. However, further study of introducing thermo-compressors to enhance performance of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine will not be done as it seems not viable...|$|R

40|$|Samples of {{electrolytic}} {{tough pitch}} (ETP) pure copper {{were subjected to}} 12 passes of Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at room temperature with and without <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> Subsequent annealing was performed to evaluate the influence of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> during ECAP on the thermal behavior of ultrafine-grained copper. The microstructural and hardness changes caused by annealing were characterized by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and microhardness measurements. The application of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> resulted in an earlier drop in hardness upon annealing, which {{is believed to be}} associated with a lower critical temperature for the initiation of recrystallization and a rapid coarsening of microstructure.
