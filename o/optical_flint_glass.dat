It was in vain that the French Academy of Sciences offered prizes for large perfect disks of <b>optical</b> <b>flint</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After {{successfully}} {{defending a}} legal {{challenge to the}} patent he held for the achromatic lens the business prospered and he successfully sued his rivals for patent infringement. [...] Dollond's reputation, especially with his father being a Fellow of the Royal Society {{as a result of}} his development and patenting of the achromat, provided the company with the de facto right of refusal on the best <b>optical</b> <b>flint</b> <b>glass.</b> [...] This privilege permitted Dollond to maintain an edge in quality over competitor's telescopes and optical instruments for many years.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flint</b> <b>glass</b> is <b>optical</b> {{glass that}} has {{relatively}} high refractive index and low Abbe number (high dispersion). <b>Flint</b> <b>glasses</b> are arbitrarily defined {{as having an}} Abbe number of 50 to 55 or less. The currently known <b>flint</b> <b>glasses</b> have refractive indices ranging between 1.45 and 2.00. A concave lens of <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> is commonly combined with a convex lens of crown glass to produce an achromatic doublet lens because of their compensating optical properties, which reduces chromatic aberration (colour defects).|$|R

50|$|Since the Anglo-American War of 1812 {{had stopped}} the {{importation}} of fine cut glass from abroad, American factories progressed {{in the making of}} <b>flint</b> <b>glass.</b> Glassworks such as the South Boston Crown <b>Glass</b> Company manufactured <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> in South Boston. Another <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> manufacturer, the New England Glass Company, was established in 1818. Glassmakers often worked for a number of companies; many split off to form their own glassworks. The glassmaking business could be risky; many glassworks closed after only a few years in business due to labor or financial troubles.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a history of the <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> makers and their unionAn the period between 1850 and 1880. The thesis {{attempts}} to throw light both on the <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> makers and on the concept of Labour aristocraoy. Part one is an analysis of the <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> makers at the point of production. After giving some account of the <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> industry, the peculiarity of the work situation is examined; the produotion processq hours of workq methods of wage payments and other working conditions. Wage differentials between different groups of glass makers are analysed as a necessary condition for the formation of the Labour aristocracy. In particular, an attempt is made to reconstruct the life time experience of the glass makers. Special attention is paid to the relationship between glass makersp glass cutters and bottle makers. Part two comprises a detailed investigation of the structure and policies of the <b>Flint</b> <b>Glass</b> Makers Friendly Society in which it is argued that although the Society was a "New Model" Union as the Webbs labelled it, it did not always behave in accordance with Webbian notions of "New-Model" activities...|$|R

A new {{ownership}} group of previous owners David Yuile and Ralph King, {{as well as}} new owners Norman MacLeod Yuile (son of William Yuile), James Watt King (Ralph's brother), George Arthur Grier, and David Alexander Gordon started the new Diamond <b>Flint</b> <b>Glass</b> Company Limited, with David acting as the secretary-treasurer from February onwards and president from August onwards. The Diamond <b>Flint</b> <b>Glass</b> Company bought the Diamond Glass Company for $1,938,309. At this time the Diamond <b>Flint</b> <b>Glass</b> Company was the largest glass manufacturer in Canada, employing some one thousand people. Yuile helped organise the formation of the Dominion Textile Company in 1905 from several smaller cotton mills, and was elected the president of the firm upon its creation. In 1906 the Diamond <b>Flint</b> <b>Glass</b> Company obtained exclusive rights {{to the use of the}} Owens automatic bottle machine in Canada.

50|$|Possibly {{the least}} known, but vitally important, {{industry}} in Ancoats was {{the manufacture of}} <b>flint</b> <b>glass.</b> More than 25 glassworks {{have been identified in}} Manchester, all built during the 19th century, and many of these were in Ancoats. Thomas Percival and William Yates established one of these on Union Street (now Redhill Street) in 1844. The works was equipped with two furnaces (later three), an annealing house, workshops, a warehouse and offices. In 1852, Thomas Vickers joined the company and William Yates left in 1862. After this, the company became known as Percival Vickers British and Foreign <b>Flint</b> <b>Glass</b> Works. It made a large range of glassware that included tumblers, wine glasses, decanters, vases, celery vases, salts and cake stands. One of the buildings in Ancoats, the <b>Flint</b> <b>Glass</b> Works, still exists today and has been converted into serviced offices.|$|R
