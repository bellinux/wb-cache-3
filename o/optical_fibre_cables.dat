This is then converted to direct current before being converted to three-phase electricity through one of three gate turn-off thyristors. Each bogie has three rectifiers, each connected to a transformer that is again connected to two inverters. The motors are three-phase asynchronous motors located in the bogie frame and equipped with regenerative brakes. There is also an auxiliary three-phase power supply which powers the compressor, pumps, ventilators and other auxiliary equipment, operated by four separate inverters. The controller is a 16-bit microprocessor that communicates using <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>cables.</b> The rectifier, auxiliary rectifiers, controllers and the error and diagnostic system is of the same type as used on the NSB Class 70 multiple units.|$|E

50|$|The Sydney-Melbourne {{coaxial cable}} was officially opened on 9 April 1962 when the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, made an interstate direct dial call.The coaxial cable {{infrastructure}} supported {{the introduction of}} subscriber trunk dialling between the cities and live television link-ups. After its commissioning in April 1962 the cable carried telegraph and telephone traffic. It also provided the first inter-city television transmission in Australia, allowing simultaneous television broadcasting in Melbourne and Sydney for the first time.The cable is understood to be decommissioned, superseded long ago by competing <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>cables</b> operated by firms such as Telstra, Optus and NextGen.|$|E

50|$|The final {{commercial}} {{developments of}} wrapped cable systems {{took place in}} France in about 2005 when RTE, the national electricity transmission utility began to install substantial quantities of <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>cables</b> including OPGW and wrapped cables.

Neither system had a product name other than COE or was marketed outside France. Both systems were withdrawn in about 2010 after a total of about 1000 km of wrapped cable installations for RTE.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{communication}} cables found on utility poles are copper or {{fibre optic cable}} (FOC) for telephone lines and coaxial cable for cable television (CATV). Coaxial or <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>cables</b> linking computer networks are also increasingly found on poles in urban areas. The cable linking the telephone exchange to local customers is a thick cable lashed to a thin supporting cable, containing hundreds of twisted pair subscriber lines. Each twisted pair line provides a single telephone circuit or local loop to a customer. There may also be fibre optic cables interconnecting telephone exchanges. Like electrical distribution lines, communication cables connect to service drops when used to provide local service to customers.|$|E
50|$|Optical {{attached}} cable (OPAC) {{is a type}} of {{fibre optic}} cable that is installed by being attached to a host conductor along overhead power lines. The attachment system varies and can include wrapping, lashing or clipping the fibre optic cable to the host. Installation is typically performed using a specialised piece of equipment that travels along the host conductor from pole to pole or tower to tower, wrapping, clipping or lashing the fibre optic cable in place. Different manufacturers have different systems and the installation equipment, cable designs and hardware are not interchangeable.Although lashed cable systems and clipped cable systems have been investigated as a means of attaching <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>cables</b> to overhead power lines, wrapped cables were the first type to be developed and are the only type in common use today.|$|E
