Formally the mayor of a town council is a Town Mayor. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> councillors is elected by the council (at the 'Annual Meeting' in May) as jointly chairman and Town Mayor. Although Church Stretton's parish council became a town council in 2002, the title of Town Mayor was not bestowed upon the chairman until 2004.|$|E

2500|$|During the German Peasants' War, Riemenschneider was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> {{council members}} {{who refused to}} obey an order by Konrad von Thüngen, the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg to fight the revolting peasants. On 4 June 1525, the peasant's army was destroyed, with 8,000 killed, just outside Würzburg by the troops of Georg, Steward of Waldburg-Zeil, and the bishop. After the town surrendered, the full town council, {{including}} Riemenschneider, was incarcerated and tortured in Marienberg Fortress. The claim that both of his hands were broken during the torture, which ended his artistic career, is today {{considered to be a}} legend without base in fact. It probably only originated in the 19th century after his [...] "rediscovery". Together {{with the rest of the}} council, Tilman was set free after two months, with loss of most of his property. The only order he is known to have received after this was work in 1527 for a Benedictine nunnery at Kitzingen. Until his death on 7 July 1531 at Würzburg, he led a retired life with his fourth wife. His son Jörg from his second marriage continued the workshop after his death.|$|E

6000|$|He {{was very}} much admired indeed. [...] "He is as {{beautiful}} as a weathercock," [...] remarked <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; [...] "only not quite so useful," [...] he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.|$|E

60|$|They drifted {{along the}} line of seats made gay with the dresses of the summer boarders, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> {{officials}} patrolled and perspired till he shone all over with pure civic pride.

60|$|I {{had given}} those boots up, when one evening they came. Opening the parcel, I set the four pairs {{out in a}} row. Then one by one I tried them on. There was no doubt about it. In shape and fit, in finish and quality of leather, they were the best he had ever made me. And {{in the mouth of}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> walking-boots I found his bill.|$|E
6000|$|Then came a great surprise, in {{the shape}} of a letter {{delivered}} in a mysterious way to the hotel-keeper. He was seated in the hotel office in the evening, talking to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> constables, when a missive was hurled at him through an open window. He dodged at first, fearing more dynamite, but when he saw it was only a letter, he picked it up and turned it over. It was addressed to him and marked [...] "Private and Personal." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Harry Haydocks {{gave the}} last lawn-festival of the season; a splendor of Japanese {{lanterns}} and card-tables and chicken patties and Neapolitan ice-cream. Erik {{was no longer}} entirely an outsider. He was eating his ice-cream {{with a group of}} the people most solidly [...] "in"--the Dyers, Myrtle Cass, Guy Pollock, the Jackson Elders. The Haydocks themselves kept aloof, but the others tolerated him. He would never, Carol fancied, be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> pillars, because he was not orthodox in hunting and motoring and poker. But he was winning approbation by his liveliness, his gaiety--the qualities least important in him.|$|E
6000|$|... "His Majestie's Sollicitor {{having these}} informations, implored privately such persons {{as he could}} best rely on, and the truth was, {{there were very few}} in whom he could repose confidence. But he was, indeed, {{faithfully}} served by one Webster, a soldier in the Welsh fuzileers, recommended him by Lieutenant Alshton, who, with very great address, informed himself, and really run some risque in getting his information, concerning the places where the persons informed against used to haunt, and how they might be seized. In consequence of which, a party of the Guard from the Canongate was agreed on to march up at a certain hour, when a message should be sent. The Sollicitor wrote a letter and gave it to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> officers, ordered to attend Captain Maitland, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> Captains, promoted to that command since the unhappy accident, who, indeed, was extremely diligent and active throughout the whole; and haveing got Stirling and Braidwood apprehended, dispatched the officer with the letter to the military in the Canongate, who immediately begun their march, {{and by the time the}} Sollicitor had half examined the said two persons in the Burrow-room, where the Magistrates were present, a party of fifty men, drums beating, marched into the Parliament close, and drew up, which was the first thing that struck a terror, and from that time forward, the insolence was succeeded by fear.|$|E
6000|$|From meanly hating him {{she rose}} to {{compassion}} {{as she saw}} that his eyes begged every one to like him. She perceived how inaccurate her judgments could be. At the picnic she had fancied that Maud Dyer looked upon Erik too sentimentally, and she had snarled, [...] "I hate these married women who cheapen themselves and feed on boys." [...] But at the supper Maud {{was one of the}} waitresses; she bustled with platters of cake, she was pleasant to old women; and to Erik she gave no attention at all. Indeed, when she had her own supper, she joined the Kennicotts, and how ludicrous it was to suppose that Maud was a gourmet of emotions Carol saw in the fact that she talked not to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> beaux but to the safe Kennicott himself! ...|$|E

60|$|Sam Cotting, being {{himself of}} great local importance, had never {{regarded}} with favor the rivalry of the nabob, but he placed stools near the telephone booth {{for the three}} girls, who accepted the courtesy with a graciousness that ought to have disarmed the surly storekeeper. They could not fail to be amused at the interest they excited, and as they personally knew every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> people they pleasantly nodded to each arrival and inquired after their health and the welfare of their families. The replies were monosyllables. Millville folks were diffident {{in the presence of}} these city visitors and while they favored the girls with rather embarrassing stares, their chief interest was centered on the little man in the telephone booth, who could plainly be seen through the glass door but might not be heard, however loudly he shouted.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} side of the way Barnet {{observed}} a man under an umbrella, walking parallel with himself. Presently this man left the footway, and gradually converged on Barnet's course. The latter then saw that it was Charlson, a surgeon of the town, who owed him money. Charlson was a man not without ability; yet he did not prosper. Sundry circumstances stood in his way as a medical practitioner: he was needy; he was not a coddle; he gossiped with men instead of with women; he had married a stranger instead of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> young ladies; and he was given to conversational buffoonery. Moreover, his look was quite erroneous. Those only proper features in the family doctor, the quiet eye, and the thin straight passionless lips which never curl in public either for laughter or for scorn, were not his; he had a full-curved mouth, and a bold black eye that made timid people nervous. His companions were what in old times would have been called boon companions--an expression which, though of irreproachable root, suggests fraternization carried to the point of unscrupulousness. All this was against him in the little town of his adoption.|$|E
60|$|It chanced {{to be the}} {{principal}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town.</b> It had the generic quality--that is, was dirty, dingy, ill-smelling, and yellow with cigarette smoke. Its walls were adorned by various prints--one or two French in origin, excellent in art, and defective in moral sentiment, and several of Spanish origin, infamous in art, and admirable in religious feeling. It had a portrait of Santa Anna, and another of the latest successful revolutionary general. It had an allegorical picture representing the Genius of Liberty descending with all the celestial machinery upon the Mexican Confederacy. Moved apparently by the same taste for poetry and personification, the proprietor had added to his artistic collection a highly coloured American handbill representing the Angel of Healing presenting a stricken family {{with a bottle of}} somebody's Panacea. At the farther extremity of the low room a dozen players sat at a green-baize table absorbed in monte. Beyond them, leaning against the wall, a harp-player twanged the strings of his instrument, in a lugubrious air, with that singular stickiness of touch and reluctancy of finger peculiar to itinerant performers on that instrument. The card-players were profoundly indifferent to both music and performer.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} after my arrival, {{he took me}} in his chariot to see the town, which is about half the bigness of London; but the houses very strangely built, {{and most of them}} out of repair. The people in the streets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were {{generally}} in rags. We passed through <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> gates, and went about three miles into the country, where I saw many labourers working with several sorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they were about: neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass, although the soil appeared to be excellent. I could not forbear admiring at these odd appearances, both in town and country; and I made bold to desire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me, what could be meant by so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in the streets and the fields, because I did not discover any good effects they produced; but, on the contrary, I never knew a soil so unhappily cultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.|$|E

She was terribly frightened, and the two gentlemen {{stood in front of}} her till the tumultuary procession had passed by. She was staying in lodgings at Clifton, and had driven in to Bristol to shop, when she thus found herself entangled in the mob. They then escorted her to the place where she was to meet her carriage, and found it for her with some difficulty. Then, while the officer returned to his quarters, Griff accompanied her far enough on the way to Clifton to see that everything was quiet before her, and then returned to seek out his friend. The court at the Guildhall had had to be adjourned, but the rioters were hunting Sir Charles to the Mansion-House. [...] Griff was met by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> Council, a tradesman with whom we dealt, who, having perhaps heard of his prowess at Hillside, entreated him to remain, offering him a bed, and saying that all friends of order were needed in such a crisis as this. Griff wrote a note to let us know what had become of him, but everything was disorganised, and we did not get it till two days afterwards.|$|E
