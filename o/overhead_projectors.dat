500|$|Avery Coonley added a full-day {{kindergarten}} {{program in}} 2005, again requiring more space, and a $4million, [...] middle school wing was constructed, financed through tax-exempt bonds from the Village of Downers Grove. Its cream and red bricks, hipped roof, deep eaves, and detailed brickwork harmonize with {{the style of}} the earlier building. The project added modernized math and science labs, two computer labs, and seven wireless classrooms using tablet computer technology, videoconferencing, and computer controlled <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors.</b>|$|E
500|$|Two main {{types of}} {{electron}} microscopes exist: transmission and scanning. Transmission electron microscopes function like <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors,</b> with {{a beam of}} electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge-coupled device. [...] Scanning electron microscopes rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.|$|E
500|$|In what ACS calls [...] "one-to-one computing", {{every student}} in the fifth group through the eighth group {{receives}} a tablet computer, which they use to manage their daily schedules, work on class assignments, and prepare special projects. Students in early childhood and junior kindergarten have shared tablets available, and each kindergarten through the fourth group class has at least four. Students study in classrooms equipped with wireless <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors,</b> manipulate programs and presentations on touchscreen-equipped SMART board systems, and engage in self-paced classroom learning using ActiveExpression wireless response systems. Students, teachers, and parents communicate and interact online via a school-wide intranet and an extranet for parents. Sixteen dual platform iMacs were added in 2009 for computer lab work.|$|E

2500|$|Ramsey founded his company, The Lampo Group, Inc., in 1992 (Now called Ramsey Solutions.), {{initially}} {{helping people}} one-on-one who were struggling with financial issues. In 1994, he hired Russ Carroll, Ramsey's lead financial counselor, {{and together they}} began teaching the first Financial Peace University classes on <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors.</b> Between 1999 and 2004, The Lampo Group grew from 18 to 105 team members. [...] There are currently over 500 team members.|$|E
2500|$|Leading {{proponents of}} the 1960s Psychedelic Art {{movement}} were San Francisco poster artists such as: Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, Bonnie MacLean, Stanley Mouse & Alton Kelley, and Wes Wilson. Their Psychedelic Rock concert posters were inspired by Art Nouveau, Victoriana, Dada, and Pop Art. The [...] "Fillmore Posters" [...] {{were among the most}} notable of the time. Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style. The style flourished from roughly the years 1966 to 1972. Their work was immediately influential to album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers. Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion that was set between large convex lenses upon <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors,</b> the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music. This was mixed with slide shows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form, and to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely [...] "trippy" [...] atmosphere for the audience.|$|E
50|$|It {{became popular}} to use {{transparent}} film for presentations (with opaque text and images) using <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors</b> in the 1940s, and slide projectors in the 1950s. Transparencies for <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors</b> could be printed by some photocopiers. Computer presentation programs became {{available in the}} 1980s, {{making it possible to}} lay out a presentation digitally. Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected directly using LCD <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors.</b> Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a video projector, computer monitor, or large-screen television.|$|E

50|$|Eiki Industrial Co., Ltd. (Eiki Kōgyō Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese {{company that}} {{manufactures}} LCD and DLP projectors, related accessories and <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1870 as Reißzeugrichter and {{manufactured}} drawing table tools. In 1874 the founder Emil Oskar Richter invented the bow compass. After switching its focus to <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors</b> in the late 1960s, it was renamed to VEB Polytechnik. After {{the collapse of the}} GDR, the remains of VEB Polytechnik were rescued in a new company called Polytechnik Frankenberg GmbH. It produced <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors</b> and hand lever cutting machines. The new company was closed in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|The Polylux was an {{overhead}} projector {{produced in the}} German Democratic Republic. It also functioned as a generic name for <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors</b> in the GDR.|$|E

50|$|Critics {{feel that}} there are some downsides as these {{technologies}} are more prone to failure and have a much steeper learning curve for the user than a standard <b>overhead</b> <b>projector.</b>|$|R
