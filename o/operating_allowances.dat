50|$|Faction leaders {{offer their}} {{followers}} services without which the followers {{would find it}} difficult, if not impossible, to survive politically. Leaders provide funds for the day-to-day operation of Diet members' offices and staff as well as financial support during expensive election campaigns. The <b>operating</b> <b>allowances</b> provided by the government are inadequate, even after the introduction of public funding in 1994. The leader also introduce his followers to influential bureaucrats and business people, which make it much easier for the followers to satisfy their constituents' demands.|$|E
5000|$|The cutback in {{operating}} funds and manpower, {{faced by the}} Royal Navy when the new Conservative government limited fuel and <b>operating</b> <b>allowances</b> in a policy of tight monetary control, and {{the belief in the}} economy of Nimrod aircraft and submarines for anti-submarine operations quickened their demise. The recommissioning of the carrier [...] and conversion of [...] meant that they could carry twice as many Sea Kings as could the Tigers in anti-submarine warfare, vital against the Soviet Union submarine threat in the Atlantic, and decreased the importance of the Tigers even further. What was often overlooked however was the vulnerability of Hermes or Bulwark {{in operating}} independently, with only minimal CIWS, and the Dutch [...] and [...] were particularly vital stand-in, destroyer leader ships working with RN carriers from the mid 1970s. Operating alone as a RN task force, carriers could not be risked in blue water operations without an escort of Type 42 destroyers, Type 22 frigates or Sea Wolf-fitted s. The true manpower requirements for open water and power projection were high in terms of fiscal cost and hulls but not improved by ships like the Tigers. It is easy to overlook the fear the Royal Navy had of the Second World War era ex-American cruiser [...] during the Falklands War, but her ability to efficiently fight her armament is doubtful and her two Exocet-armed FRAM 2 [...] escorts may have represented a greater threat to the Task Force. The rapid-firing twin 6-inch Mk.26 turrets of 'Tiger' and 'Blake', their flight-decks and speed, along with a virtually inexhaustible stock of 6-inch and 3-inch ammunition held for them in the 1970s, were arguments for emergency reactivation as landing pads during the Falklands War but the stock of 3-inch ammunition held for the Tigers was more useful providing for the Canadian [...]|$|E

This practice continued into the 1970s, though the [...] "nature of the awards has changed".

40|$|The Janke-Barron heart {{support was}} used {{successfully}} on 1500 patients who required {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery to at least two vessels. The significant advantages it provided were improved exposure and access to all coronary arteries, elimination of damage caused by an assistant holding the heart, provision of a dryer <b>operating</b> field, and <b>allowance</b> for a smaller incision without compromising exposure of the heart...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} the intellectual property (IP) system on the timing of cooperation/licensing by start-up technology entrepreneurs. If the market for technology licenses is efficient, the timing of licensing is independent of whether IP has already been granted. In contrast, the need to disclose complementary (yet unprotected) knowledge, asymmetric information or search costs may retard efficient technology transfer. In these cases, reductions in uncertainty surrounding the scope and extent of IP rights may facilitate trade in the market for ideas. We employ a data set combining information about cooperative licensing and the timing of patent allowances (the administrative event when patent rights are clarified). Although preallowance licensing does occur, the hazard rate for achieving a cooperative licensing agreement significantly increases after patent allowance. Moreover, {{the impact of the}} patent system depends on the strategic and institutional environment in which firms <b>operate.</b> Patent <b>allowance</b> plays a particularly important role for technologies with longer technology life cycles or that lack alternative appropriation mechanisms such as copyright, reputation, or brokers. The findings suggest that imperfections in the market for ideas may be important, and that formal IP rights may facilitate gains from technological trade. patents, licensing, commercialization, innovation, entrepreneurship...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 212 - 223. With {{very few}} exceptions, all libraries, be they national, university, provincial, {{municipal}} or special, are funded {{to a greater}} or lesser degree by public money. Thus as Malan says, this subsidy presupposes that their services and stock should be used in the public interest. (Malan, 1978 : 83). In the case of South African university libraries, which constitutes the province of this study, the parent institution currently receives a subsidy according to the provisions laid down in the van Wyk de Vries Commission's recommendations. (de Vries, 1974). Included in this subsidy are formulae designed specifically to enable the university library to <b>operate,</b> i. e. <b>allowances</b> are made both for personnel and for the acquisition of library materials. It is in this latter connection that the present inves- tigation has been made, viz. the allocation of funds received from the State via the university administration to the teaching and research units to enable them to fulfil their basic function...|$|R
