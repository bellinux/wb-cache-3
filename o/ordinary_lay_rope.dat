50|$|Stranded ropes are an {{assembly}} of several strands laid helically {{in one or}} more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but can't absorb much lubricant, natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the inner wires much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, wire strand core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most durable in all types of environments. Most types of stranded ropes only have one strand layer over the core (fibre core or steel core). The lay direction of the strands in the rope can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the lay direction of the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind of rope is called <b>ordinary</b> <b>lay</b> <b>rope</b> if the lay direction of the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the lay of the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same lay direction, the rope is called a lang lay rope (formerly Albert’s lay or Lang’s lay). Regular lay means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.|$|E
30|$|With the {{increase}} of demand in predicting the behavior of ropes, many advanced digital techniques {{had been used in}} the strand and rope analysis. Computer-aided design and the finite element method created powerful sophisticated tools for the modeling and analysis of ropes. Judge et al. (2012) developed full 3 D elastic–plastic finite element models of the multi-layer spiral strand cables subjected to quasi-static axial loading using LS-DYNA. Nawrocki and Labrosse (2000) presented a finite element model of a simple straight wire rope strand and studied all the possible inter-wire motions. The role of contact conditions in pure axial loading and axial loading combined with bending were investigated. Stanova et al. (2011 b) established a geometric model of a multi-layered strand by CATIA V 5 and analyzed force-strain relationship of the strand by ABAQUS/Explicit. Jiang et al. (2000, 2008), Jiang (2012) performed concise finite element models for 1  ×  7 wire strand under axial extension and pure bending load, and studied the contact stress among wires, wire radial displacement, global response of the strand and predicted the detailed progressive nonlinear plastic behaviors of the strand wires. Ma et al. (2008, 2009) reported the 6  ×  19 IWS right lang lay and right <b>ordinary</b> <b>lay</b> <b>rope</b> models with ANSYS software. Wang et al. (2012, 2013) proposed finite element models for 6  ×  19 wire rope from the viewpoint of determination of fretting parameters. Many scholars (Bradon et al. 2007; Ghoreishi et al. 2007 a, b; Usabiaga and Pagalday 2008; Argatov 2011; Beltrán and Williamson 2011; Paczelt and Belezna 2011; Beltra’n and Vargas 2012; Prawoto and Mazlan 2012) dealt with theoretical models, fiber ropes and broken ropes using 3 D finite element analyses.|$|E

50|$|The art scholar Franco Mormando has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} Plague in an Ancient City depicts a specific plague that according to Christian sources took place in Rome in 361-63 {{during the reign of}} emperor Julian.

In the composition Sweerts was likely commenting on the contemporary struggle of the Catholic Church against Protestantism.

This geometrical insight explains why nearly identically appearing ropes can be made from very different materials and it is also the reason behind the unyielding nature of ropes. The maximally rotated strands behave as zero-twist structures. Under strain they neither rotate one or the other way.

Primarily using introductory sections of accounts about cases in a spread of therapeutic traditions, the paper analyses how ordinary commonplace accouts of embodiment may offer initial clues as to the 'state' of the client, present a picture of the problem, or be used as relevant biographical data. A key feature of the analysis is to show that these embodied accounts, using <b>ordinary</b> <b>lay</b> language, do important work in establishing problems as 'in and part of the world', but are also an appropriate supplement to thereapeutic accounts...|$|R

2500|$|The full bhikkhuni (nuns) {{lineage of}} Theravada Buddhism died out, and for various {{technical}} and social reasons was therefore permanently absent.

In this article, we analyze the relationship between scientific experts and <b>ordinary</b> <b>lay</b> citizens in the context of risks from pesticide usage in Denmark. Drawing on concepts from the “sociology of scientific knowledge” (SSK), we contend that differences in risk perception must be understood at the level of social identities. On the basis of qualitative interviews with citizens and experts, respectively, we focus on the multiple ways in which identities come to be employed in actors' risk accounts. Empirically, we identify salient characteristics of “typical” imagined experts and lay-people, while arguing that these conceptions vary identifiably in-between four groups of citizens and experts. On the basis of our findings, some implications for bridging the lay—expert discrepancy on risk issues are sketched out...|$|R
