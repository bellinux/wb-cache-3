The reason for the restriction can be {{for a number of}} different reasons. Examples include legal requirements, where the moneys can only be lawfully used for a specific purpose, or a restriction imposed by the donor or provider. These donor/provider restrictions are usually communicated in writing and may be found in the terms <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement,</b> government grant, will or gift.|$|E

5|$|Out {{of respect}} for Momchil, Kantakouzenos spared his wife, a Bulgarian woman he had {{captured}} during his conquest of Xanthi. He allowed her to flee to Bulgaria along with all of her property. However, it is unknown whether Momchil had any children from this marriage or a previous one, if any. Pavlov presents the hypothesis that Momchil's wife was a noblewoman from the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo, whom he married as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Bulgarian court.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger-Cats {{traded for}} Alipate in May 1991 as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> that sent quarterback Tom Worman to Saskatchewan. Due to the CFL's import ratio, Alipate was held out of games during the {{beginning}} of the season. He started in place of Pete Giftopoulos in early September but was later injured and placed on the reserve list. Alipate ended the season with 25 tackles, three sacks, and a fumble recovery over seven games. The Saskatchewan Roughriders signed Alipate for training camp in 1992, but he was released {{before the start of the}} regular season.|$|E

5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath's {{prospects}} originally {{revolved around}} the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This {{gave way to a}} more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke {{is an old}} {{market town}} {{expanded}} in the mid 1960s as a result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> between London County Council and Hampshire County Council. It was developed rapidly after World War II, along with various other towns in the United Kingdom, {{in order to accommodate}} part of the London 'overspill' as perceived under the Greater London Plan in 1944. Basingstoke market was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, and it remained a small market town until the early 1960s. At the start of World War II the population was little more than 13,000. It still has a regular market, but is now larger than Hampshire County Council's definition of a market town.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} three decades of the 20th century, ethnic Chinese owned most, if not all, movie theaters in cities {{throughout}} the Dutch East Indies. Films from China were being imported by the 1920s, and a film industry began to emerge in 1928 {{with the arrival of}} the three Wong brothers from Shanghai—their films would dominate the market through the 1930s. These earliest films almost exclusively focused on the ethnic Chinese community, although a few examined inter-ethnic relations as a main theme. The later ban on the public use of Chinese language meant that imported films and television programs were required to be dubbed in English with subtitles in Indonesian. When martial arts serials began appearing on national television in 1988, they were dubbed in Indonesian. One exception was the showing of films from Hong Kong in Chinese—limited to ethnic Chinese districts and their surroundings—because <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> between importers and the film censor board.|$|E
5|$|Most Sri Lankan Tamils {{live in the}} Northern and Eastern {{provinces and}} in the capital Colombo, and most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands. Historically, both groups have seen {{themselves}} as separate communities, {{although there has been}} a greater sense of unity since the 1980s. In 1948, the United National Party government stripped the Indian Tamils of their citizenship. Under the terms <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> reached between the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in the 1960s, about forty percent of the Indian Tamils were granted Sri Lankan citizenship, and most of the remainder were repatriated to India. By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Sextus Pompeius {{was the son}} of First Triumvir Pompey {{and still}} a renegade general {{following}} Julius Caesar's victory over his father. He was established in Sicily and Sardinia as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39BC. Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius, {{who was a member of}} the republican party, ironically, not the Caesarian faction. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40BC when he married Scribonia, a daughter of Lucius Scribonius Libo who was a follower of Sextus Pompeius as well as his father-in-law. Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, Julia, who was born the same day that he divorced her to marry Livia Drusilla, little more than a year after their marriage.|$|E

5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} consists <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> {{between two}} or more people to commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E
5|$|To {{train for}} the Olympics, Fiderd Vis left Aruba to train in Brazil, taking {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> between the COA and the Brazilian Olympic Committee and another between the COA and the Brazilian Judo Confederation fostered after Aruba's {{participation in the}} 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro. Vis left for Brasília on Wednesday, June 4, 2008 to participate in Campeonato Suramericano. He later traveled to São Paulo to train with Brazilian judokas. Having seen Vis's progress, the International Olympic Committee extended to him a special invitation that guaranteed his participation in the Beijing Olympics. The COA accepted the invitation, and Fiderd Vis became Aruba's second and final athlete for the year's Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Until 1969, Cardiff RFC and Wales both {{played their}} home matches {{on the same}} pitch at Cardiff Arms Park, but all this changed in the 1969–70 season. As a result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> between Cardiff Athletic Club and the WRU, the National Stadium project {{established}} that a new stadium for international matches and events was required, with Cardiff RFC moving to a new purpose built stadium on the original cricket ground {{at the site of}} the former Cardiff Arms Park stadium. By 7 April 1984 the National Stadium was officially opened. However, in 1994, a redevelopment committee was set up to consider redeveloping the National Stadium, and by 1995 the WRU had been chosen to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Australian Army {{units were}} {{deployed}} as occupation forces following the Japanese surrender. Under the terms <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> reached between Blamey and Admiral Louis Mountbatten, {{the head of}} South East Asia Command, Australia was responsible for providing occupation forces for all of Borneo, the NEI east of Lombok (including western New Guinea) and the pre-war Australian and British territories in eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands as well as Nauru and Ocean Islands in the Pacific. The Australian forces in Borneo and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945. I Corps was responsible for garrisoning Borneo and the eastern NEI, and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea. After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of Borneo and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin to the key islands in the eastern NEI. While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists, the Australians were careful to not {{become involved in the}} Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible. Relations between the Australian troops and Indonesians were generally good, {{due in part to the}} decision by the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia to not load Dutch ships which were carrying military supplies bound for the NEI. The last Australian occupation troops left the NEI in February 1946.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{governor}} controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 {{according to a}} 1992 estimate—the office has been historically {{considered one of the}} most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, {{the governor}} is given wide discretion in awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor's appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an executive order creating a merit system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert T. Combs, pushed a new merit system through the legislature, protecting it from abolition by executive order. Despite the presence of the merit system, many governors have been criticized for abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration were indicted for violating the merit system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.|$|E
5|$|Dinges {{wrote that}} in the early 1970s the U.S. Justice Department had enough {{evidence}} to bring an indictment of Noriega on drug charges in a U.S. court, but chose not to do so because of the diplomatic consequences involved. This evidence included the testimony of an arrested boat courier, and of a drug smuggler arrested in New York. Though Torrijos frequently promised the U.S. cooperation in dealing with drug smuggling, Noriega would have headed any effort at enforcement, and the U.S. began to see him as the real problem. Dinges writes that the U.S. government considered several options to move Noriega out of the drug trafficking business, including assassinating him, and linking him to a fictional plot against Torrijos. Though no assassination attempt was made, the other ploys may have been tried in the early 1970s, according to Dinges. Beginning in 1972, however, Dinges writes that the U.S. relaxed its efforts at trapping individuals involved with smuggling within the Panama government, possibly as a result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> between Torrijos and U.S. president Richard Nixon. Moreover, during the same period Noriega was becoming a trusted ally of the CIA, including acting as the U.S. emissary to Cuba during negotiations following the Johnny Express incident. Noriega, too, made an effort during this period to portray Panama as a hub of enforcement against drug smuggling, possibly as a result of pressure from Torrijos. Noriega's drug-related activities came to the U.S. government's attention once again during the ratification process for the Panama Canal treaties, but were once again downplayed by the U.S. intelligence services {{in order to get the}} treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate.|$|E
