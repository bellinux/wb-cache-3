40|$|Prevalence of the {{pathogen}} Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), implicated in amphibian population declines worldwide, {{is associated with}} habitat moisture and temperature, but few studies have varied these factors and measured the response to infection in amphibian hosts. We evaluated how varying humidity, contact with water, and temperature affected the manifestation of chytridiomycosis in boreal toads Anaxyrus (Bufo) boreas boreas and how prior exposure to Bd affects the likelihood of survival after re-exposure, such as may occur seasonally in long-lived species. Humidity did not affect survival or the degree of Bd infection, but a longer time in contact with water increased the likelihood of mortality. After exposure to ~ 106 Bd zoospores, all toads in continuous contact with water died within 30 d. Moreover, Bd-exposed toads that were disease-free after 64 d under dry conditions, developed lethal chytridiomycosis within 70 d of transfer to wet conditions. Toads in unheated aquaria (mean= 15 °C) survived less than 48 d, while those in moderately heated aquaria (mean= 18 °C) survived 115 d post-exposure and exhibited behavioral fever, selecting warmer sites across a temperature gradient. We also found benefits of prior Bd infection: previously exposed toads survived 3 times longer than Bd-naïve toads after re-exposure to 106 zoospores (89 vs. 30 d), but <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>dry</b> microenvironments were available. This study illustrates how the outcome of Bd infection in boreal toads is environmentally dependent: when continuously wet, high reinfection rates may overwhelm defenses, but periodic drying, moderate warming, and previous infection may allow infected toads to extend their survival...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{housing is}} {{essential}} in profitable swine production. The largest financial returns are obtained <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>dry,</b> sanitary, comfortable and convenient housing conditions are provided. It {{is a mistake to}} think the hog {{does not need to be}} protected from the weather. Having been originally a native of comparatively warm climates, nature has not provided the hog with much in the way of protective covering. It is true it has layers of fat, when it is fat, which offer protection but there is not the thick coat of hair or wool with which other farm animals are provided. Again, it is recognized that the best way to guard against the ravages of disease is to provide sanitary conditions. These considerations, together with the possibility of saving much labor in a well planned house over a poorly planned one, is the occasion for giving much thought and study to the problem of housing swine. For several years, the Agricultural Engineering and Animal Husbandry sections of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment station have been making a careful investigation of the design and construction of hog houses. Bulletin 152, published in October, 1914, in addition to setting forth the essentials of an ideal hog house and discussing quite fully the relative. merits of the movable and consolidated or community types, described in detail the construction of several types of movable hog houses which had been thoroly tried out at the station.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} a simple routine procedure to preserve, decarbonate and analyse low-carbonated filters of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) for particulate organic carbon and nitrogen content, δ 13 C and δ 15 N. Our goal was to analyse these four parameters from a single and entire filter of POM without altering the organic material. First, freezing (- 20 °C) versus oven-drying (60 °C) were compared as the initial preservation step. Afterwards, non-acidified samples were compared to acid-treated samples using 0. 12 N HCl (diluted HCl rinsing at the end of the filtration) or 12 N HCl (filters exposed to HCl fumes for four hours in a dessicator). Regarding the preservation methods, our results indicate that freezing increases the uncertainty of δ 15 N measurements and, in combination with concentrated HCl treatment, leads to a loss of particulate nitrogen and an alteration of the δ 15 N signature. Consequently, we recommend drying to preserve filter samples. Regarding acid treatments, we found that (i) diluted HCl would not be sufficient to fully remove the carbonate from our samples, (ii) in contrast, a four-hour exposure of the filters to the HCl fumes was enough to remove all the inorganic carbon, and (iii) the concentrated HCl treatment did not alter the nitrogen measurements (<b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>drying</b> without freezing is used to preserve the filters). Consequently, we propose that low-carbonated POM filters are preserved by drying and carbonates are removed by exposing the filters to HCl fumes (four hours) for the analysis of particulate organic C and N content and isotope ratios...|$|R

40|$|Various {{materials}} were mixed with suspensions of Serratia marcescens and other organisms. Samples were removed and frozen at intervals after mixing; {{the number of}} cells that survived both freeze-drying and exposure to air varied rhythmically {{as a function of}} time between mixing and freezing. When assayed before or immediately after drying there were essentially no fluctuations. The response was evident <b>only</b> <b>when</b> these <b>dried</b> samples were exposed to air. In a typical experiment, the number of cells surviving in the sample frozen 30 sec after adding propyl gallate was at least 10 times that in samples frozen either 20 sec earlier or 20 sec later. Other “peaks” in survival were observed at approximately 125 and 450 sec, but the times at which the peaks were observed were not consistent from one experiment to the next. Although we have been unable to control or predict the time at which maxima in resistance occur, we have shown that the phenomenon does occur with Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as with S. marcescens. Furthermore, a rhythmic response also was obtained after a change in pH or cell concentration. It appears that microorganisms respond physiologically and synchronously to changes in their environment, and some of these responses have survival value...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{calculate}} an energy engineering of hybrid dryer based of exhaust gases and LPG, integrated with rice milling unit using a cogeneration system for utilization diesel engine exhaust gas temperature at the power plant of rice milling unit for paddy drying process and LPG burners. The method used is to measure the temperature and mass flow rate of the exhaust gas of a diesel engine and capacity of dryer for calculating heat exchanger design. Results of measurements at 120 kVA diesel engine exhaust gas temperature at 357 ??C and the mass flow rate 636 kg/h. From the calculation results, power that can be generated by the exhaust gases are 56 kW and heat required for drying are 24 kW/ton. The total grain can be dried is 2 tons. Selection of LPG burners adjusted to results of the calculation of the energy need for drying capacity of 1 to 2 tons is gas burners wich can operate in the power range 23 kW to 58 kW.

50|$|Since Sclerophthora macrospora can infect a {{wide range}} of hosts, many growers will {{have to find a way}} to manage the pathogen. Cultural control, {{sanitary}} methods, and chemical control are common ways to prevent the disease. Typical cultural practices used include mowing <b>only</b> <b>when</b> grass is <b>dry</b> and avoiding over watering. Since the disease proliferates in wet conditions, it is best to ensure that fields are well drained so sporangia don’t spread. Preventive fungicides applied under certain guidelines can reduce the amount of the pathogen’s structures in the field - but the success is limited. Spring applications of the fungicide metalaxyl, known under the trade name Subdue, can be effective especially for yellow tuft disease. It is important to recognize that most fungicides for Sclerophthora macrospora are preventive type, not curative. Therefore, it is vital that a grower recognizes the symptoms and signs as soon as possible. A variety of resistance strains have also been bred - most notably in maize.|$|R

40|$|The study {{assessed}} the fertility status of Ferric Acrisols in the humid area of Nigeria. The {{objectives of the}} study were to provide data on the physical and chemical properties of the soils and to identify any constraints inherent in them that could adversely affect their productivity. Subsequently, appropriate measures to adequately ameliorate the constraints were recommended so as to enhance the fertility status and the overall productive potentials of the soils for upland crops. Among the fertility constraints identified were low effective cation exchange capacity and soil acidification. In addition, the clayey texture of the subsoil made these soils susceptible to erosion as well as caused harvesting difficulties. Liming was recommended to ameliorate the acidity constraints. Liming together with incorporation of organic materials into the soils were the measures needed to enhance their effective cation exchange capacity. Soil erosion control was to be given high priority especially by maintaining adequate surface cover and ensuring that tillage was limited to <b>only</b> <b>when</b> soil was <b>drier</b> than the plastic limit...|$|R

40|$|Melamine {{formaldehyde}} (MF) resins {{are widely}} used for the gluing and surface coating of wood-based consumer products in the interior design of living environments. MF resins are especially relevant in decorative laminate applications because of their good performance-to-price ratio. In their industrial processing, an important intermediate state is the liquid MF prepolymer that is used for decorative paper impregnation. Here, the drying of impregnated papers is investigated with respect to premature curing. A new method to quantify water release upon drying that allows estimation {{of the degree of}} undesired precuring is described. Since curing proceeds via polycondensation, crosslinking brings about the release of water molecules. By thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), drying was studied in terms of water release due to physical drying (elimination of “dilution water”) and chemical crosslinking of the prepolymer to a three-dimensional MF network (elimination of chemically liberated water). The results obtained by TGA/IR spectroscopic analysis of the liberated volatiles show that the emission of water from b-stage MF can be clearly analytically separated into a physical (evaporation of dilution water) and a chemical (liberation via condensation) sequence. TGA experiments were correlated with curing experiments performed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to estimate the residual crosslinking capacities of the impregnated papers. The drying conditions used during the preparation of impregnated decorative papers seemed to significantly affect their remaining reactivity <b>only</b> <b>when</b> harsh <b>drying</b> conditions were used.

40|$|The thermal {{emission}} spectrometer (TES) {{and the radio}} science (RS) experiment flying on board the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft have made observations of atmospheric temperatures below the saturation temperature of carbon dioxide (CO 2). This supersaturated air provides a source of convective available potential energy (CAPE), which, when realized may result in vigorous convective mixing. To this point, most Mars atmospheric models have assumed vertical mixing <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the <b>dry</b> adiabatic lapse rate is exceeded. Mixing associated {{with the formation of}} CO 2 clouds could {{have a profound effect on}} the vertical structure of the polar night, altering the distribution of temperature, aerosols, and gasses. Presented in this work are estimates of the total planetary inventory of CAPE and the potential convective energy flux (PCEF) derived from RS and TES temperature profiles. A new Mars Global Circulation Model (MGCM) CO 2 cloud model is developed to better understand the distribution of observed CAPE and its potential effect on Martian polar dynamics and heat exchange, as well as effects on the climate as a whole. The new CO 2 cloud model takes into account the necessary cloud microphysics that allow for supersaturation to occur and includes a parameterization for CO 2 cloud convection. It is found that when CO 2 cloud convective mixing is included, model results are in much better agreement with the observations of the total integrated CAPE as well as total column non-condensable gas concentrations presented by Sprague et al.
