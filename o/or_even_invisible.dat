50|$|The current {{accepted}} {{answer is}} that, although {{the universe is}} infinitely large, it is not infinitely old.

Light from stars farther away has not reached Earth, and cannot contribute to making the sky bright. Furthermore, as the universe is expanding, many stars are moving away from Earth. As they move, the wavelength of their light becomes longer, through the Doppler effect, and shifts toward red, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> becomes <b>invisible.</b> As a result of these two phenomena, there is not enough starlight to make space anything but black.|$|R

As the visual basis of human perception of the world, image is an important means for humans to obtain information, express information, and transmit information. Digital image processing, that is, processing images with a computer, {{has a long history}} of development. Digital image processing technology originated in the 1920 s, when a photo was transmitted from London, England to New York, via a submarine cable, using digital compression technology. First of all, digital image processing technology can help people understand the world more objectively and accurately. The human visual system can help humans get more than 3 / 4 of the information from the outside world, and images and graphics are the carriers of all visual information, despite the identification of the human eye. It is very powerful and can recognize thousands of colors, but in many cases, the image is blurred <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>invisible</b> to the human eye. Image enhancement technology can make the blurred <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>invisible</b> image clear and bright. There are also some relevant research results on this aspect of research, which proves that relevant research is feasible [26, 27].|$|E

40|$|The data {{indicating}} {{existence of}} {{different forms of}} dark matter in the universe {{as well as the}} role of this matter in structure formation are briefly reviewed. It is argued that vacuum energy gives a dominant contribution into the total energy density of the universe. The model of structure formation with unstable tauneutrino with MeV-mass and KeV-majoron is described. 1 Permanent address: ITEP, 113259, Moscow, Russia. 1 It is commonly agreed now that the matter (or energy) in the universe is predominantly (90 % <b>or</b> <b>even</b> more) <b>invisible</b> and that most probably this invisible matter is not the normal baryonic staff that we are familiar with. The agreement however does not go beyond this point and as for the nature of this dark matter the problem remains open and will probably be open for quite some time. There are some hints from cosmology regarding the properties of dark matter. They are given by direct astronomical observations and by the theory of large scale structure formation in the universe. From the other side the elementary particle theory gives plenty predictions about possible new stable particles which might be constituents of dark matter. Unfortunately these predictions do not directly follow from the well established minimal SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) - theory but from one or other higher energy extensions of this theory which have not yet been verified by experiment. So at the moment we are unable to chose different possibilities and have to rely only on aesthetic properties of the model which may be grossly misleading. The fraction of a particular form of matter in the universe is given in terms of the dimensionless parameter Ωj = ρj/ρc (1) where ρj is the mass (energy) density of this form of matter and ρc is the critical or closure density, ρc = 3 H 2 m 2 P...|$|R

We constructed the wave intensity (WI) images of unsmooth pulse based on the pressure wave (P), flow velocity wave (U), and WI [(dP/dt) (dU/dt) ] by ALOKA Prosound α 10 Color Doppler. The characteristic of Cunkou normal pulse could be summarized as follows: compared to Renying pulse, its W 1 amplitude is smaller and NA wave is more obvious, while the W 2 wave is indistinct <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>invisible,</b> and the R- 1 st is longer than that of Renying pulse.

Galaxies were selected to be more massive than 10 ^ 10 Msun and have specific star formation rates above 1 /t_H. We model the 7 -band optical ACS + near-IR WFC 3 spectral energy distributions of individual bins of pixels, accounting simultaneously for the galaxy-integrated photometric constraints available over a longer wavelength range. We analyze variations in rest-frame color, stellar surface mass density, age, and extinction as a function of galactocentric radius and local surface brightness/density, and measure structural parameters on luminosity and stellar mass maps. We find evidence for redder colors, older stellar ages, and increased dust extinction in the nuclei of galaxies. Big star-forming clumps seen in star formation tracers are less prominent <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>invisible</b> on the inferred stellar mass distributions. Off-center clumps contribute up to ~ 20 % to the integrated SFR, but only 7 % or less to the integrated mass of all massive star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1 and z ~ 2, with the fractional contributions being a decreasing function of wavelength used to select the clumps. The stellar mass profiles tend to have smaller sizes and M 20 coefficients, and higher concentration and Gini coefficients than the light distribution. Our results are consistent with an inside-out disk growth scenario with brief (100 - 200 Myr) episodic local enhancements in star formation superposed on the underlying disk. Alternatively, the young ages of off-center clumps may signal inward clump migration, provided this happens efficiently on the order of an orbital timescale.

40|$|For {{several years}} I have, from a {{management}} control perspective, followed {{the development and}} application of several popular management models, for example, the knowledge management, balanced scorecard, and intellectual capital models. This thesis, comprising four papers and an extended covering paper, contributes to the management control field by discussing and problematizing management models and how they describe humans by means of measurement. This thesis thus does not emphasize the various possibilities for measurement, but rather how measurement is becoming important and what measurement processes might accomplish. Confidence in measurements is great, and the literature often argues for their importance. Furthermore, there is extensive discussion of what factors should be measured and how they should be measured. However, adages such as ‘What gets measured gets managed’ are rarely discussed or problematized. The dream of better visualizing humans in organizational management models is sometimes expressed in powerful terms, both poetic and dreamlike. If only humans were better visualized, the value-creation process would become more understandable, benefiting everyone and burnishing {{the image of the}} good organization. However, it sometimes seems as though this initial dream has become blurred, and measurement per se has tended to overshadow the initial vision. In that case, management models become not just tools, means to attaining the dream, but gradually become ends in themselves. There seems to be a contradiction between the idea of visualizing humans in organizational management models and the results of these models. Paradoxically, these management models are not necessarily making people visible – as was intended; rather, the risk is that they may actually make people less visible, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>invisible.</b> Humans have become bare numbers, and where there is no feedback to ‘flesh and blood’ (i. e., humans), measurements risk losing their purpose. The question remains whether humans are actually made more visible by the measurements used in ‘new’ management models, or whether organizations risk rendering humans invisible and reducing them to objects...|$|E

40|$|Both historiographical and {{literary}} practices have undergone revision {{in recent years}} in attempting to address the inheritance of nineteenth-century realism. Since the object of realist stylistics, employed in both the writing of fiction and history, is to render authorship authoritative <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>invisible,</b> the ideological import of these narratives is often such that the constructedness of the historical record and its absences are veiled. In developments beginning in the 1980 s with the advent of ‘New Historicism’ and with the emergence of postmodern literary techniques, the interface of literature and history became of seminal importance, since both were now credited as being products of narrative and discourse, and hence, to varying degrees, of the literary imagination. This movement intersects interestingly with developments in postcolonial studies, since it is the voices of the marginalized and disempowered colonized peoples that are routinely co-opted and excised from nineteenth-century realist histories. These concerns are now being fully explored in the literature of the contemporary post-transitional South African moment, since authors in this country seemingly now feel freed up to look back to histories that precede the immediate traumas of apartheid. The concern, in relation to apartheid developments but also on a broader universal scale, is this: if history is viewed as perpetual emergences of modernities, then one of the great absences in the record is the historical determinants of any given epistemology. The attempt to recreate such an epistemological genealogy is thus simultaneously postcolonial, historiographical, {{and literary}}. Russel Brownlee’s Garden of the Plagues (2005), Ingrid Winterbach’s To Hell with Cronjé (2010), and Etienne van Heerden’s The Long Silence of Mario Salviati (2002) attempt to bridge this gap in the recorded sensibilities of any historical moment by representing a ‘lived experience’ of the past, and in the process imaginatively recreating the cultural, historical and psychological locations of the proponents of an emerging modernity. This study concerns itself with the ways in which these authors address the influence of realist historiography through the use of literary innovations that allow for the departure from realist stylistics. Most commonly, all three authors draw on forms of magic realism, but multiple refigurings and recombinations of notions of temporality, narrative, and characterization likewise work to defamiliarize the once stable discourse of history...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to reflect on transdisciplinar {{character}} of ageing disciplines. Geriatric Dentistry is a new Dental specialty in Brazil. As a dentist, beyond the questions inherent to the aging process, I must try to understand how aging is processed with and without oral health. Which are the effects of oral health on the general health and what are the effects of systemic diseases and their treatment on oral health. Again, questions beyond organs, systems, cells, and molecules linked to ageing specialties are not enough to build the context. The individual (and what individual?) within the society (and which society?) must compound the framework of our attention. Labyrinths and puzzles were used as graphic metaphors {{in order to try to}} explain the transdisciplinarity. We use the labyrinth model in order to reflect on perspective of body compounded by several intricate parts. The individual as a labyrinth is set in the society, another labyrinth itself. This intricate relationship is full of other complexities and gearings, with other multiple views, spectrums, and shadows, including not only the fields of politics and economy, but the fields of ethics, spirituality and illusions as well. Puzzles were used as a representation of a lack of transdisciplinary and how aging-related sciences use to work, with no notion of how is the final image formed. We just try to put several pieces together. The scientists of different disciplines have worked trying to move forward juxtaposing at the trial and error, pieces and pieces. However, every ageing discipline still remains as a peace forgotten because we do not have the complex view of “the whole”. In conclusion the graphic explanation of transdisciplinarity may not take us to another incomprehensible labyrinth <b>or</b> <b>even</b> to an <b>invisible</b> final image of a puzzle.
