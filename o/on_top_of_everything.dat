Commenting to Cherwell, she claimed her views on LGBT issues were [...] "very, very middle ground" [...] and that she had not said anything homophobic, but been the victim of [...] "a malicious witch hunt". Roweena Russell, former chair of the International Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Youth and Student Organisation, emailed Gasper to discuss the latter's comments, to which Gasper responded that Russell too should be institutionalised. Russell proceeded to condemn Gasper, stating that [...] "as a long-term political activist I'm disgusted she used this kind of language.

40|$|Learning {{technology}} {{standards are}} widely promoted by various organisations internationally because they potentially have several advantages. Such advantages are for example reusability of learning content, or the reuse of pedagogical scenarios. The current {{situation is that}} many learning technology standards have been created and evaluated in limited settings. The aim of the Alfanet project was to use a suite of learning technology standards rather than a single standard to realise adaptive features for learners that otherwise {{could not have been}} realised. This has increased the initial investment in development but has allowed us to build an open architecture composed by re-usable components. aLFanet applies important standards in e-learning. The central standard is IMS LD. It enables the design of a variety of pedagogical models and separates the design of the pedagogical model from the content. Thus, it allows to dynamically select from the available learning objects the content to be provided depending on the associated metadata. To complement this standard, IMS Metadata (IEEE LOM) to deal with the knowledge on the contents, IMS LIP for a representation of the user and the IMS QTI to compute the formal progress are used. <b>On</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> them, <b>everything</b> is delivered in IMS CP. In addition Alfanet makes use of a set of technical standards in particular SOAP and FIPA. This report describes the standards used, the Alfanet adaptation scenarios {{and the role of the}} standards in these scenarios. The report contains two parts. In the first part of this report the standards used are introduced and briefly explained and a study on IMS LD, the central standard in the project, is described. Learning Design has been developed to support any kind of education and some prove has been provided by use-cases as presented in the Best practice guide. However, at the time Alfanet selected IMS LD there was no information on how suitable LD is to describe education as it is delivered currently by various educational institutes. Therefore, an investigation was set up to find out what problems would occur if we would try to describe a random sample of lesson plans with LD. Here the findings are reported and special cases that needed more attention are elaborated in more detail. The second part of the report (chapter 4 and onwards) starts with an overview of the main adaptation scenarios supported in Alfanet. They include adaptation to pre-knowledge, adaptation to learning characteristics, adaptation on assessments and adaptation based on similarities with peers. Subsequently each of these scenarios is explained in a separate chapter and the way the standards are applied to achieve the desired adaptation is clarified. The adaptive features of the Alfanet system are triggered by the data that is collected on individual learners which serves as a base to alter a course for an individual or these data are used to reason upon collective learner behaviour and make alterations in courses for groups of learners. The learner data is stored in a portfolio. This report describes how determining a learners’ learning style, cognitive modality and his/her present knowledge on a course specific domain creates the initial learner profile. It is explained how, based on the learners’ profile, changes are made to the outline of the course material and what standards are used to realise these adaptations To determine if a learner makes progress in mastering the learning material, the learner has to take formal assessments during the course, but a learner can also periodically test his/her learning progress. In the Alfanet system tests are used, and two adaptation mechanisms were created that make use of the outcome of these tests. It is explained how question items are created and how adaptive tests can be created out of these individual test items with additional meta-data and specifically created tool. Moreover a description is given how the test results are handled by the Alfanet system to feed them back into the Learning Design of a course. Besides designed course adaptation the Alfanet system is also equipped with a module that monitors user behaviour and searches in the course material to recommend learner and situation specific interventions that should keep learners motivated and enhance learner performances. It is explained what kind of measures have to be taken at design time to realise this functionality at run-time. Finally, when courses are designed, the authors have certain expectations with regard to how learners will react to that course. For example, learners are expected to complete a course within a certain amount of time, or authors design a route and learners are expected to follow this route, but are they? To answer questions like these the Alfanet system is equipped with audit functionality that monitors learner behaviour and compares this behaviour with predefined expectations by authors. The results are reported back to the authors with the expectation that when a bottleneck is found in a course it can be put right.

I have written to Harry {{a good deal}} from the first, and to your dear selves last week, and you will know how wide open the mouth of my desire stands to learn from you everything and anything you can chuck into it. Most vivid and pathetic these so surprisingly lucid pictures dashed down--or rather so calmly committed to paper--by both {{of you in the}} very midst of the crash, and what a hell of a time you must have had altogether. What a noble act your taking your Miss Martin to the blazing and bursting San Francisco--and what a devil of a day of anxiety it must have given to the sublime Alice. Dearest sublime Alice, your details of feeding the hungry and sleeping in the backyard bring tears to my eyes. I hope all the later experience didn't turn to worse dreariness and weariness--it was probably kept human and [...] "vivid" [...] by the whole associated elements of drama. Yet how differently I read it all from knowing you now restored to your liberal home and lovely brood--where I hope you are guest-receiving and housekeeping as little as possible. How your mother must have folded you in! I kept thinking of her, for days, please tell her, almost more than of you! It's hideous to want to condemn you to write <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> else--yet I sneakingly hope for more, though indeed it wouldn't take much to make me sail straight home--just to talk with you for a week.|$|E
60|$|That, {{none the}} less, {{was but a}} flicker; what made the real difference, as I have hinted, was his mute passage with Maggie. His daughter's anxiety alone had depths, and it opened out for him the wider that it was {{altogether}} new. When, in their common past, when till this moment, had she shown a fear, however dumbly, for his individual life? They had had fears together, {{just as they had}} had joys, but all of hers, at least, had been for what equally concerned them. Here of a sudden was a question that concerned him alone, and the soundless explosion of it somehow marked a date. He was on her mind, he was even in a manner on her hands--as a distinct thing, that is, from being, where he had always been, merely deep in her heart and in her life; too deep down, as it were, to be disengaged, contrasted or opposed, in short objectively presented. But time finally had done it; their relation was altered: he SAW, again, the difference lighted for her. This marked it to himself--and it wasn't a question simply of a Mrs. Rance the more or the less. For Maggie too, at a stroke, almost beneficently, their visitor had, from being an inconvenience, become a sign. They had made vacant, by their marriage, his immediate foreground, his personal precinct--they being the Princess and the Prince. They had made room in it for others--so others had become aware. He became aware himself, for that matter, during the minute Maggie stood there before speaking; and with the sense, moreover, of what he saw her see, he had the sense of what she saw HIM. This last, it may be added, would have been his intensest perception had there not, the next instant, been more for him in Fanny Assingham. Her face couldn't keep it from him; she had seen, <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything,</b> in her quick way, what they both were seeing.|$|E
60|$|She never, at present, {{thought of}} what Amerigo might be intending, without the reflection, by the same stroke, that, {{whatever}} this quantity, he was leaving still more to her own ingenuity. He was helping her, when the thing came to the test, only by the polished, possibly almost too polished surface his manner to his wife wore for an admiring world; and that, surely, was entitled to scarcely more than the praise of negative diplomacy. He was keeping his manner right, as she had related to Mrs. Assingham; the case would have been beyond calculation, truly, if, <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything,</b> he had allowed it to go wrong. She had hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all this pressed in upon her as a tacit vow from him to abide without question by whatever she {{should be able to}} achieve or think fit to prescribe. Then it was that, even while holding her breath for the awe of it, she truly felt almost able enough for anything. It was as if she had passed, in a time incredibly short, from being nothing for him to being all; it was as if, rightly noted, every turn of his head, every tone of his voice, in these days, might mean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced to abjection could hold himself. During those of Maggie's vigils in which that view loomed largest, the image of her husband that it thus presented to her gave out a beauty for the revelation of which she struck herself as paying, if anything, all too little. To make sure of it--to make sure of the beauty shining out of the humility, and of the humility lurking in all the pride of his presence--she would have gone the length of paying more yet, of paying with difficulties and anxieties compared to which those actually before her might have been as superficial as headaches or rainy days.|$|E

I met here at first on coming down a week--nine days--ago (quite fleeing from the hot and blighted Rye) the assault of all that miserable and yet in a way helpful vision--but have since been very glad I came, just as I am glad that you were here then--in spite of everything....

So I daresay I shall stay on for ten or twelve days more (I don't want to stir, for one thing, till we have had some relief by water. It has now rained in some places, but there has fallen as yet no drop here or hereabouts--and the earth is sickening to behold.)

You know what a Yukon steamboat is, but you can’t guess what the Golden Rocket was when it left Dawson that June of 1898. She was a hummer. Being the first steamer out, she carried all the scurvy patients and hospital wrecks. Then she must have carried a couple of millions of Klondike dust and nuggets, {{to say nothing of}} a packed and jammed passenger list, deck passengers galore, and bucks and squaws and dogs without end. And she was loaded down to the guards with freight and baggage. There was a mountain of the same on the fore-lower-deck, and each little stop along the way added to it. I saw the box come aboard at Teelee Portage, and I knew it for what it was, though I little guessed the joker that was in it. And they piled it <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> else on the fore-lower-deck, and they didn’t pile it any too securely either. The mate expected to come back to it again, and then forgot about it. I thought at the time that there was something familiar about the big husky dog that climbed over the baggage and freight and lay down next to the box. And then we passed the Glendale, bound up for Dawson. As she saluted us, I thought of Dave on board of her and hurrying to Dawson to Flush of Gold. I turned and looked at her where she stood by the rail. Her eyes were bright, but she looked a bit frightened by the sight of the other steamer, and she was leaning closely to the Count fellow as for protection. She needn’t have leaned so safely against him, and I needn’t have been so sure of a disappointed Dave Walsh arriving at Dawson. For Dave Walsh wasn’t on the Glendale. There were a lot of things I didn’t know, but was soon to know—for instance, that the pair were not yet married. Inside half an hour preparations for the marriage took place. What of the sick men in the main cabin, and of the crowded condition of the Golden Rocket, the likeliest place for the ceremony was found forward, on the lower deck, in an open space next to the rail and gang-plank and shaded by the mountain of freight with the big box on top and the sleeping dog beside it. There was a missionary on board, getting off at Eagle City, which was the next step, so they had to use him quick. That’s what they’d planned to do, get married on the boat.|$|E
