40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{deals with}} <b>Open</b> Government <b>Data</b> and the {{methodology}} for publication {{of this kind}} of data. Public sector bodies hold a significant amount of data that can be reused in innovative way leading to development of new products and services. According to the Open Knowledge Foundation "Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike. " Publication and reuse of <b>Open</b> Government <b>Data</b> can lead to benefits such as increased economic growth. State, society as well as the public sector bodies themselves can benefit from <b>Open</b> Government <b>Data.</b> However the public sector bodies currently face a number of problems and issues when publishing <b>Open</b> Government <b>Data,</b> e. g. regular updates of the published datasets are not always ensured. Different public sector bodies apply different approaches to publication of <b>Open</b> Government <b>Data.</b> The main goal of this thesis is to design the <b>Open</b> Government <b>Data</b> Publication Methodology which should address current problems related to the publication of <b>Open</b> Government <b>Data...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Open</b> <b>data</b> {{is slowly}} growing {{with the opening}} of the CytoBank {{database}} in 2010, and FlowRepository in 2012, both of which allow users to freely distribute their data, and the latter of which has been recommended as the preferred repository for MIFlowCyt-compliant data by ISAC.|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{structure}} data in CIF format {{are linked}} to scientific articles as supplementary material. CIFs may be accessible directly from the publisher’s website, crystallographic databases, or both. In recent years, many publishers of crystallographic journals have come to interpret CIFs as formatted versions of <b>open</b> <b>data,</b> i.e. representing non-copyrightable facts, and therefore tend to make them freely available online, independent of the accessibility status of linked scientific articles.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009, the Open Commons Linz {{initiative}} {{has made}} available {{a wide variety}} of “free” data: geo-data and statistical information having to do with city life, local government, recreation and tourism. An associated effort is the Hotspot initiative that has installed 202 hotspots providing free WLAN, as well as Public Server, the municipal cloud available to all citizens registered in Linz. Linz is thus at the forefront in Europe when it comes to universal access to <b>open</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

The authors {{focus on the}} current <b>open</b> government <b>data</b> landscape of European Union countries. Another example is the study [24], which presents a survey of existing <b>Open</b> Government <b>Data</b> platforms, focusing on the technical aspects. The authors took into account features such as standardization, discoverability, and machine readability. According to them, most platforms lack of proper standards and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), {{and there is a}} significant amount of data published either using non-machine-readable format or in a proprietary format [24].|$|R

IRI's <b>open</b> <b>data</b> definition file format is also supported by AnalytiX DS and Meta Integration Technology (MITI) so that third-party ETL, BI, and data modeling tool users can convert or re-use their existing metadata in IRI product environments.|$|E

2500|$|One of O'Malley's first {{actions as}} {{governor}} was {{to implement the}} same CitiStat system he used to manage the city Baltimore as mayor on a statewide level. [...] Maryland StateStat was first tried in 2007 by a few public safety and human services agencies. [...] By 2014, over 20 agencies were engaged in the StateStat process through monthly individual agency meetings and quarterly cross-agency Stats including BayStat, StudentStat, VetStat and ReEntryStat. [...] (The EPA would later base its ChesapeakeStat program on O'Malley's innovative BayStat program.) [...] In 2012, he launched Maryland's <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> Portal- StateStat, which used the data in the Portal to track progress towards his 16 strategic goals. As {{one of the few}} states at the time linking progress directly to <b>open</b> <b>data,</b> Maryland led the nation in government transparency and accountability. O'Malley has said that President Obama has looked at StateStat as a potential model for tracking stimulus funding.|$|E

2500|$|The 100 human genomes to be sequenced in this {{competition}} were donated by 100 centenarians (ages 100 or older) {{from all over}} the world, known as the 100 Over 100. Sequencing the genomes of the 100 Over 100 presented an unprecedented opportunity to identify those [...] "rare genes" [...] that protect against diseases, while giving researchers valuable clues to health and longevity. These centenarians’ genes would provide us with a window to the past, significantly impacting the future of healthcare. Although the contest is cancelled, the X PRIZE foundation collected blood samples and created cell-lines to preserve the DNA from more than 100 centenarians. Those genomes are expected to be sequenced nonetheless and put into an <b>open</b> <b>data</b> forum.|$|E

2500|$|Like the New York City Subway, Boston's {{subway system}} in theory does keep to an exact fixed schedule. Starting around 2011, the MBTA {{introduced}} overhead displays {{at the train}} platform level which indicate estimated arrival times {{for the next two}} trains in each direction. [...] In addition, real-time information about train location (and bus location) is available via an <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> protocol on the Internet, enabling a large number of third-party smartphone apps and web sites to display expected arrival times throughout the MBTA system. [...] The Green Line relies more on operators than its signal system compared to other lines, especially where trams are driven across or even in automobile lanes on surface rails. [...] Due to a sparsity of data collected by the existing system, real-time Green Line arrival predictions are not expected until tracking infrastructure upgrades are completed in 2015.|$|E
