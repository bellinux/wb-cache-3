40|$|Studies to {{determine}} the prevalence of antibodies to Onchocerca volvulus, prior to and after actions carried out to interrupt transmission, are scarce in Mexico. Here we report the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG 4 antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a crude extract of O. volvulus adult worm in serum samples from persons under noninterrupted biannual treatment with ivermectin in areas of <b>onchocercosis</b> endemicity in Mexico. To perform the prevalence studies, the ELISA procedures were first evaluated. Serological studies were performed with serum samples from skin microfilaria carriers from Guatemala and from people microfilariodermic negative {{living in the same}} area as the Guatemalan patients. Sensitivity values for IgG or IgG 4 detection were 71 and 86 %, while specificities were 92 and 100 %, respectively. No anti-O. volvulus antibodies were found in samples from nonendemic controls from Mexico, but 3 of 71 samples from residents in the <b>onchocercosis</b> area of Oaxaca, Mexico, and who have been under ivermectin treatment during the last 10 years were only positive to IgG. Notwithstanding that the IgG 4 isotype was not detected and a low (4. 2 %) anti-O. volvulus IgG antibody prevalence was found, a seroepidemiological follow-up must be performed in order to confirm interruption of <b>onchocercosis</b> transmission in the area of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which <b>onchocercosis</b> is endemic...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, <b>onchocercosis</b> has been {{reported}} with increasing frequency in dogs in Europe and the United States, and 64 cases have been described so far. According to some authors, the Onchocerca sp. responsible for canine cases spills over from domestic or wild ungulates into dogs. However, canine Onchocerca does not match any of the descriptions for species of Onchocerca reported from domesticated and wild animals in Europe or North America. The nucleotide sequences of canine Onchocerca are also unique within the genus. Moreover, patent Onchocerca infections can be seen only in accidental hosts {{closely related to the}} natural hosts. In canine <b>onchocercosis</b> cases, high microfilarial load could be observed indicating that canids might be the definitive hosts of the parasite. Therefore, others suggested that Onchocerca lupi Rodonaja, 1967 originally described from a wolf (Canis lupus) can be responsible for these infections, which is a typical example for host switch and site shift, the dominant modes of speciation of the genus Onchocerca. The morphology, molecular characteristics, phylogeny, life cycle, host specificity, geographical distribution of Onchocerca sp. infecting dogs, as well as the clinical signs, pathology, laboratory diagnosis, therapy and possible zoonotic significance of canine <b>onchocercosis</b> are reviewed. Research into human <b>onchocercosis</b> has been hampered by the lack of analogous models. As infections in dogs may provide a practical experimental system, further studies should be encouraged to try to establish experimental Onchocerca infections in dogs...|$|E

Similarly, the signature of the 5 S rDNA spacer sequences of O. lupi does not resemble any other Onchocerca 5 S rDNA spacer sequences including those of the members of domestic cattle or horse clades.

40|$|Equids can be {{infected}} by {{a range of}} skin-dwelling filarial nematodes, including four species of the genus Onchocerca. Current literature on equine <b>onchocercosis</b> is fragmentary and often limited to isolated case reports. The present study aimed to describe a clinical case of equine <b>onchocercosis</b> caused by Onchocerca boehmi (Supperer, 1953) (syn. Elaeophora boehmi) in an 8 -year-old gelding Belgian show jumper from northern Italy. The horse was presented with a firm and painless mass on the proximal third of the right metacarpal region. Ultrasound examination showed a peritendinous enlargement around the palmaro-lateral area of the tendons, characterized by an elongated hypoechoic and well-defined structure, embedding a coiled hyperechoic line. The metacarpal nodule was resected and histologically examined. Fragments of a parasitic nematode were detected, isolated and examined. The morphological analysis allowed identifying the nematode as O. boehmi. In addition, total genomic DNA was extracted from individual fragments using a commercial kit for the nematode identification and a comparative sequence analysis of the nematode cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) sequence with data available in the GenBank^TM database revealed the closest identity (i. e. 91...|$|E

40|$|Background: Onchocerca lupi, a filarioid of {{zoonotic}} concern, infects {{dogs and}} cats causing ocular lesions of different degrees, from minor to severe. However, infected animals do not always display overt clinical signs, rendering the diagnosis of the infection obscure {{to the majority of}} veterinarians. Canine <b>onchocercosis</b> has been reported in the Old World and the information on its occurrence in the United States, as well as its pathogenesis and clinical management is still meagre. This study reports on the largest case series of O. lupi infection from the United States and reviews previous cases of canine <b>onchocercosis</b> in this country. Methods: Information on the clinical history of a series of eight cases of O. lupi infection in dogs diagnosed in Minnesota, New Mexico, Colorado and Florida, from 2011 to 2014, was obtained from clinical records provided the veterinary practitioners. Nematodes were morphologically identified at species level and genetically analyzed. Results: All dogs displayed a similar clinical presentation, including subconjunctival and episcleral nodules, which were surgically removed. Each dog was subjected to post-operative therapy. Whitish filaria-like parasites were morphologically and molecularly identified as O. lupi. Conclusions: This study confirms that O. lupi is endemic in the United States, indicating that the distribution of the infection is probably wider than previously thought. With effect, further studies are urgently needed in order to improve the diagnosis and to assess the efficacy of therapeutic protocols, targeting the parasite itself and/or its endosymbionts...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, {{subconjunctival}} <b>onchocercosis</b> {{has been reported}} from 63 dogs in south-western United States (Arizona, California, Utah) and Southern and Central Europe (Germany, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Switzerland). To reveal the taxonomic status of the parasite responsible for these infections, fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND 5) genes of three European strains of canine Onchocerca sp. and the 16 S ribosomal RNA (16 S rRNA) gene of their Wolbachia endosymbionts were sequenced and compared to the homologous sequences of other spirurid nematodes. The evolutionary divergence between COI and ND 5 gene sequences of Greek, Hungarian and Portuguese strains of canine Onchocerca sp. were similar in magnitude to that seen within Thelazia callipaeda or Onchocerca lienalis. The evolutionary divergence between the sequences of canine Onchocerca sp. and other Onchocerca spp. including O. lienalis were similar or higher in magnitude to that seen between other Onchocerca spp. The {{results of the current}} and earlier phylogenetic analyses indicate that canine Onchocerca sp. separated from other Onchocerca spp. early in the evolution. Based on the similar clinical pictures, the identical morphology of nematodes and the sequence analyses of COI and ND 5 genes of the worms and 16 S rRNA gene of their wolbachiae, the Onchocerca worms isolated from European dogs appear to belong to the same species. The results support the earlier biological and morphological arguments that a distinct species, most likely O. lupi originally described from the subconjunctival tissues of a Caucasian wolf is responsible for canine ocular <b>onchocercosis</b> in Europe...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of subcutaneous nodular <b>onchocercosis</b> was investigated at slaughter of 151 red deer (Cervus elaphus) (107 juveniles and 44 adults) between OctoberâDecember 2015. The prevalence of subcutaneous nodules was 56 %. Nodules {{were located in}} the lumbar region of the back in 96 % of the cases, and 38 % of the infected red deer had additional parasitic nodules in other body locations, such as rump, thorax, forelimbs and neck. The number of nodules per deer was 1 â 10 in two-thirds of the affected animals, and only 2 % had more than 50 nodules. Significant differences in prevalence of nodule presence were found between adult (81 %) and juvenile red deer {{less than two years}} of age (45 %) (pÂ =Â  0. 0001). Species confirmation and identification was done on 14 randomly selected nodules taken from the lumbar region of 14 deer of different geographical origin, by sequencing the mitochondrial 12 S, 16 S and nad 5 gene fragments. The sequences were more or less identical (12 SÂ =Â  99 â 100 %; 16 SÂ =Â  93 â 100 %; nad 5 Â =Â  92 â 100 %) to previously published sequences for Onchocerca flexuosa. The high prevalence of nodular <b>onchocercosis</b> caused by O. Â flexuosa in red deer in Sweden shows that the investigated areas in the southern third of Sweden have favorable vector (simuliids and ceratopogonids) conditions and suitable environment for the maintenance of the parasite.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, cases of canine ocular <b>onchocercosis</b> have been {{reported}} worldwide, particularly in the United States and Europe.

In the present study, we describe, for the first time, the occurrence of O. lupi in the subconjunctival region of the human eye in a patient from Turkey. The nematode was identified as O. lupi based on its morphology and molecular phylogenetic analysis of partial cox 1 and 12 S ribosomal DNA genes. The results suggest that O. lupi should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other eye parasitic infections in humans.

40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 20 th century, pets are more {{frequently}} considered as “family members” within households. However, cats and dogs still can be a source of human infection by various zoonotic pathogens. Among emerging or re-emerging zoonoses, viral diseases, such as rabies (mainly from dog pet trade or travel abroad), but also feline cowpox and newly recognized noroviruses or rotaviruses or influenza viruses can sicken our pets and be transmitted to humans. Bacterial zoonoses include bacteria transmitted by bites or scratches, such as pasteurellosis or cat scratch disease, leading to severe clinical manifestations in people because of their age or immune status and also because of our closeness, not to say intimacy, with our pets. Cutaneous contamination with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Leptospira spp., and/or aerosolization of bacteria causing tuberculosis or kennel cough are also emerging/re-emerging pathogens that can be transmitted by our pets, as well as gastro-intestinal pathogens such as Salmonella or Campylobacter. Parasitic and fungal pathogens, such as echinococcosis, leishmaniasis, <b>onchocercosis,</b> or sporotrichosis, are also re-emerging or emerging pet related zoonoses. Common sense and good personal and pet hygiene are the key elements to prevent such a risk of zoonotic infection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwenty-seven {{species of}} the genus Onchocerca (Nematoda; Filarioidea) can cause a vector-borne {{parasitic}} disease called <b>onchocercosis.</b> Most Onchocerca species infect wild and domestic ungulates or the dog, and one species causes river blindness in humans mainly in tropical Africa. The European red deer (Cervus e. elaphus) is host to four species, which are transmitted by blackflies (simuliids) or biting midges (ceratopogonids). Two species, Onchocerca flexuosa and Onchocerca jakutensis, produce subcutaneous nodules, whereas Onchocerca skrjabini and Onchocerca garmsi live free in the hypodermal serous membranes. During the hunting season, September 2013, red deer (n =  25), roe deer (Capreolus c. capreolus, n =  6) and chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra, n =  7), all shot in the Grisons Region (Switzerland) were investigated {{for the presence of}} subcutaneous nodules which were enzymatically digested, and the contained Onchocerca worms were identified to species by light and scanning electron microscopy as well as by PCR/sequencing. In addition, microfilariae from skin samples were collected and genetically characterized. Neither nodules nor microfilariae were discovered in the roe deer and chamois. Adult worms were found in 24 % of red deer, and all of them were identified as O. jakutensis. Two morphologically different microfilariae were obtained from five red deer, and genetic analysis of a skin sample of one red deer indicated the presence of another Onchocerca species. This is the first report of O. jakutensis in Switzerland with a prevalence in red deer similar to that in neighbouring Germany...|$|E
40|$|Onchocerca lupi (Spirurida, Onchocercidae) is an {{emerging}} vector-borne helminth that causes nodular lesions as- sociated with acute or chronic ocular disease in dogs and cats. Since its first description in dogs in 1991, this zoo- notic filarioid has been increasingly reported in Europe and the United States. An 8 -year-old outdoor mixed- breed female dog from the Algarve (southern Portugal) {{was presented with}} a history of severe dyspnoea. Cervical and thoracic radiographs revealed a slight reduction in the diameter of the cervical trachea and a moderate in- crease in radiopacity of the laryngeal soft tissue. An exploratory laryngoscopy was performed, revealing filiform worms associated with stenosis of the thyroid cartilage and a purulent necrotic tissue in the larynx lumen. A sin- gle sessile nodule, protruding from the dorsal wall of the laryngeal lumen caused a severe reduction of the glottis and tracheal diameter. Fragments of the worms were morphologically and molecularly identified as O. lupi. His- tological examination of the nodule showed a granulomatous reaction with sections of coiled gravid female nem- atodes. Following laryngoscopy, a tracheostomy tube was inserted to relieve dyspnoea and ivermectin (300 μg/kg, once a week, for 8 weeks) combined with prednisolone was prescribed. The dog showed a complete recovery. Although O. lupi has been isolated in human patients from the spinal cord, this is the first report of an aberrant migration of O. lupi in a dog. The veterinary medical community should pay attention to aberrant loca- tion of O. lupi and consider <b>onchocercosis</b> as a differential diagnosis for airway obstruction in dogs...|$|E
40|$|Lymphatic {{filariasis}} is a {{major problem}} in tropical and sub-tropical countries including Thailand. Lymphatic filariasis in cats is caused by Brugia spp., such as B. malayi and B. pahangi. The former species is a significant cause of human lymphatic filariasis which is also endemic in southern parts of Thailand [1]. However, B. pahangi is commonly found in cats and dogs in Bangkok area [2]. Both Brugia species are transmitted by mosquitoes especially Armigeres spp. and Mansonia spp. [3]. Pathology is progressed when lymphatic vessels are obstruct-ed. The severity of disease depends on the number of worms present [2]. Macrocyclic lactones are broad-spectum anthelmintics that are used to treat a variety of nematode infections. Ivermectin is the only macrocyclic lactone that is approved for use in human [4]. In control program for filariasis, ivermectin is the drug of choice, especially in areas with <b>onchocercosis</b> [5]. There are several studies about the efficacy of ivermectin against filarial worms [1, 6 - 8]. For Onchocerca volvulus, treatment with ivermec-tin reduces microfilarial motility in vitro [9], and embryogene-sis is impaired in adult female worms [6]. Moreover, a single dose of ivermectin was effective to cure cats naturally infected with B. malayi, although microfilariae could not be completely cleared in cats [10]. However, treatment of B. pahangi infection with ivermectin in cats has never been reported. Thus, the ob-jective {{of this study was to}} determine the efficacy of multiple doses of ivermectin against microfilariae of B. pahangi in natu-rally infected cats. This study was conducted as a blinded, randomized study following the standard protocol accepted by the Laborator...|$|E
40|$|Background: Of {{increasing}} {{importance to}} the medical and veterinary communities is the zoonotic filarioid nematode Onchocerca lupi. <b>Onchocercosis,</b> thus far found in wolves, dogs, cats and humans, is diagnosed via skin snips to detect microfilariae and surgical removal of adults from {{the eye of the}} host. These methods are time-consuming, laborious and invasive, highlighting the need for new tools for the diagnosis of O. lupi in susceptible hosts. Symptoms related to the presence of the adults in the eye can range from none apparent to severe, including blindness. No reliable chemotherapeutic protocols are available, as yet, to eliminate the infection. Paramyosin, an invertebrate-specific protein, has been well-studied as an allergen, diagnostic marker and vaccine candidate. The aim of this study, therefore, was to isolate and characterise paramyosin from O. lupi to assess its suitability {{for the development of a}} serological diagnostic assay. Methods: The adult and microfilarial stages of O. lupi were isolated from the eyes and skin of a 3 -year-old male dog. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into single stranded cDNA. Reverse-transcription PCR was used to isolate a full-length paramyosin cDNA from adult worms and to investigate the temporal expression patterns of this gene. All amplicons were sequenced using dideoxy chain termination sequencing. Bioinformatics was used to predict the amino acid sequence of the gene, to compare the DNA and protein sequences with those available in public databases and to investigate the phylogenetic relationship of all molecules. Antibody binding sites were predicted using bioinformatics and mapped along with published antigenic epitopes against the O. lupi paramyosin protein. The native protein, and three smaller recombinantly expressed peptides, were subjected to western blot using serum from dogs both positive and negative for O. lupi. Results: Paramyosin of O. lupi was herein molecularly characterized, encoded by a transcript of 2, 643 bp and producing a protein of 881 amino acids (101. 24 kDa). The paramyosin transcript was detected, by reverse transcription PCR, in adults and microfilariae, but not in eggs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this molecule clusters with paramyosins from other filarioids to the exclusion of those from other taxa. A total of 621 unique antibody binding epitopes were predicted for this protein and another 28 were conserved in other organisms. This information was used to design three peptides, for recombinant expression, to identify the antibody binding epitope(s) and reduce potential cross-reactivity with serum from dogs infected with other filarioid nematodes. Native paramyosin, purified from microfilariae and adults, was detected by antibodies present in serum from dogs with known O. lupi infections. Conclusions: Data provided herein may assist in the development of a serological diagnostic test, based on antibodies to O. lupi paramyosin, for the diagnosis of this infection, in order to gain more information on the real distribution of this little known filarioid of zoonotic concern...|$|E
