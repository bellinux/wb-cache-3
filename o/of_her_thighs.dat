40|$|Copyright © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. The {{evaluation}} of injuries due to self-mutilation may be complicated by atypical lesions and fabricated {{histories of the}} causative events. Four cases are described {{where one of the}} most striking findings was the presence of "mirror-image" injuries and/or a "chessboard" pattern of intersecting parallel lines from self-inflicted incised wounds. Case 1 : A 32 -year-old man was dead in his burnt-out car, with symmetrical, "mirror-image", circular burns from the car cigarette lighter over his forehead, cheeks, ears, upper and lower arms, the dorsal and palmar aspects of the hands, the anterior chest wall including the nipples, the anterior abdomen, thighs, lower legs, and the back of his neck. The deceased had a history of psychotic depression and had died of burns and inhalation of products of combustion. Case 2 : A 19 -year-old woman who fabricated a history of assault demonstrated multiple, superficial, "mirror-image" injuries <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>thighs</b> and forearms. Case 3 : A 32 -year-old man who exsanguinated from cut wrists showed multiple, superficial, and "mirror-image" incised wounds of the wrists, with a "chessboard" pattern. Case 4 : A 26 -year-old man died after jumping from a building. He had multiple superficial, "mirror-image" incised wounds of his anterior chest and thighs, with a typical "chessboard" pattern. Given the difficulties that sometimes arise in determining whether injuries have been self-inflicted or not, the finding of symmetrical "mirror-image" injuries, and/or a "chessboard" pattern formed by 2 groups of regular, parallel, superficial incised wounds running at right angles to each other provides compelling evidence of self-mutilation, unless a plausible alternative explanation is available...|$|E

40|$|In the West, the fat {{woman is}} most often relegated to the asexual {{category}} of the "big girl". The soft dimpled curves <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>thighs,</b> the fleshy rolls of her stomach, the alarming swell of her breasts, all seem a parody of female sexuality, a distortion of contemporary paradigms of feminine beauty and desirability. The fat woman's corporeal experience is constituted largely by the expectation of a constant disavowal of her flesh, an enforced disconnection from her body and a refusal {{of herself as a}} sexual being. The fat female body in Western societies stands as a symbol of a body that is uncared for, uncultivated and, indeed, as a body that has failed as the subject of aesthetics. In The Use of Pleasure, Foucault suggests "we have to create ourselves as a work of art', and advocates living a "beautiful life" by engaging with practices that seek to produce a "cultivated self". In this paper the author wishes to examine Foucault's notion of an "aesthetics of existence', and the implicit bodily transformation that is effected through his "practices of the self'. In light of this, she seeks to interrogate the problem of aesthetics in Foucauldian ethics, and the prescriptive modes of becoming that aesthetic ideals inevitably produce. Does "making our lives a work of art' enable a means of overturning dominant discourses around the fat body that relate to the perceived neglect of bodily maintenance and failure of the will by thinking through new ways of living the fat body, or does an "aesthetics of existence' reinforces these discourses, by insisting upon sets of practices that disallow the fat "self" from ever coming into being as it is. Can we choose the level of investment we have in aesthetic ideals, and do Foucault's aesthetics for a "beautiful life" irrevocably discipline the fat body, deprive it of its sexuality, and seek to overcome its very flesh in order to transform it into a socially sanctioned "work of art'? 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONNecrotising {{fasciitis}} (NF) is a rare, severe, rapidly progressing and life-threatening synergistic infection primarily {{affecting the}} superficial fascia. A novel method of definitive and aesthetic reconstruction of NF thigh defects {{by using a}} pedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap without recourse to temporising skin grafts is presented. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 30 -year-old parous woman presented in extremis with fulminant NF <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left anteromedial <b>thigh.</b> Following emergency radical debridement and intensive care stabilisation she was reconstructed 48 h later in a single stage with a pedicled TRAM flap islanded on the ipsilateral deep inferior epigastric vessels. There was excellent contour restoration <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>thigh</b> and coverage <b>of</b> the exposed femoral vessels. DISCUSSIONPedicled flaps based on the rectus abdominis muscle provide a large, readily available reconstructive option for correction of substantial regional defects as herein illustrated. They are robust when based on dominant inferior vascular pedicle with a long reach and wide arc of rotation when designed transversely (as a TRAM flap). CONCLUSIONThis case also illustrates that definitive flap reconstruction of NF can be successfully undertaken in the emergent setting, thereby negating the need for large areas of skin grafting {{which can lead to}} contractures with consequent functional impairment and suboptimal aesthetic results...|$|R

40|$|Background. Cases {{have been}} {{reported}} in the literature of periprosthetic fractures associated with the use of bisphosphonates occurring in the long term following a Total Hip Replacement (THR). We report an interesting case of periprosthetic fracture secondary to bisphosphonate use only a few months after a THR. Case Report. A 72 -year-old lady (on bisphosphonates for 10 years) underwent a THR for osteoarthritis. She was pain-free in the first four months postoperatively. Thereafter, she developed spontaneous onset of pain in the lateral aspect <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>thigh</b> and groin and found it difficult to weight-bear. X-rays and blood tests were unremarkable. An ultrasound and MRI scan showed no evidence of effusion/collection or periprosthetic fracture. A radionuclide bone scan showed an abnormal appearance of the right femoral shaft. A subsequent CT scan showed an oblique vertical split on the anterior surface of the upper right femoral shaft. This stress fracture was managed nonoperatively with protected weight bearing. She has progressed well with good clinical and radiological signs of fracture healing. Conclusion. This case is an important addition to our knowledge that bisphosphonate-induced periprosthetic stress fractures can be a cause of hip pain only a few months following a THR. </p...|$|R
