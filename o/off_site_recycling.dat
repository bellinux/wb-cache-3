As of September, 2015, the span was gradually being demolished, with guardrails and lighting being removed. Afterwards, the span cut away in sections and hauled <b>off</b> <b>site</b> for <b>recycling.</b> Demolition work was completed as of July, 2016.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} provides {{performance standards}} that one, as a generator of hazardous chemical, radioactive, or mixed wastes at the Berkeley Lab, must meet {{to manage their}} waste to protect Berkeley Lab staff and the environment, comply with waste regulations and ensure the continued safe operation of the workplace, have the waste transferred to the correct Waste Handling Facility, and enable the Environment, Health and Safety (EH and S) Division to properly pick up, manage, and ultimately send the waste <b>off</b> <b>site</b> for <b>recycling,</b> treatment, or disposal. If one uses and generates any of these wastes, one must establish a Satellite Accumulation Area and follow the guidelines in the appropriate section of this document. Topics include minimization of wastes, characterization of the wastes, containers, segregation, labeling, empty containers, and spill cleanup and reporting...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES:This study {{aimed to}} analyze {{economic}} effect of recycled aggregate production on job-site airport pavement. METHODS: The validation of <b>site</b> <b>recycling</b> for waste concrete as economic efficiency is analyzed through {{the case study}} of <b>site</b> <b>recycling</b> at an O airport pavement construction. The break-even point {{for the cost of}} <b>site</b> <b>recycling</b> was estimated according to two different waste concrete processing methods such as job-site recycling and processing on commission (or plant). RESULTS: Job-site recycling cost decreases as the use rate of job-site recycled concrete aggregate increases, or the amount of concrete waste increases, but transporting distance decreases. It was shown in an O airport case that as the use rate of job-site recycled concrete aggregate exceeds 61. 4 %, the job-site recycling cost is cheaper than the processing cost on commission. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can utilize basic data of feasibility for <b>site</b> <b>recycling</b> of waste concrete on airport pavemen...|$|R

40|$|Regulations {{specify the}} maximum amount of waste that can be stored on site by a waste {{generating}} firm. When this regulatory threshold is reached, a polluting firm must move its on site waste to an <b>off</b> <b>site</b> recipient. In this setting, we analyse two questions in a stochastic framework from the viewpoints of a waste generator and a recipient that have received scant theoretical attention in the literature. First, given that <b>off</b> <b>site</b> storage is costlier than on site storage, we derive the long-run average cost incurred by a waste generating firm that stores waste both on and <b>off</b> <b>site.</b> Second, we compute the expected amount of time until the <b>off</b> <b>site</b> recipient's waste storage facility is full. ...|$|R

An initial survey suggested potential PCDD/F production at metal <b>recycling</b> <b>sites,</b> during cement manufacture, at munic-ipal waste incinerators and landfill sites and during the use of thermal oxygen lances. PCDD/F sampling, using static and personal air samplers, revealed that the highest PCDD/F exposures were found at metal <b>recycling</b> <b>sites,</b> particularly aluminium <b>recycling</b> <b>sites.</b> The reasons for these results and the possible consequential intakes are discussed...|$|R
