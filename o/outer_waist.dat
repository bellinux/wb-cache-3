40|$|Despite the {{exposure}} of the entire vasculature to the ath-erogenic effects of systemic risk factors, atherosclerotic plaques develop at specific regions of the arterial tree where disturbed and low flow occurs and progress focally and eccen-trically in an independent manner. 1, 2 Endothelial shear stress (ESS), the tangential stress generated by the friction of the flowing blood on the endothelial surface of the vessel wall, regulates much of endothelial function, and low ESS [<≈ 1. 0 Pascal (Pa) ] activates a myriad of intracellular pathways, leading to endothelial dysfunction, lipoprotein accumulation, and inflammation. 3 Autopsy studies and animal models have demonstrated that atherosclerotic lesions with vulnerable features preferentially develop in areas with low ESS, such as the inner curvature of coronary arteries, the <b>outer</b> <b>waist</b> of a coronary bifurcation, and downstream from a luminal obstruction. 4 – 6 In contrast, normal ESS (≈ 1 – 2. 5 Pa), occurrin...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the transmission spectrum of an optical microfibre coupler at high temperatures is investigated experimentally. Results show a temperature sensitivity up to 36. 59 pm/°C at a taper <b>waist</b> <b>outer</b> diameter of 2. 5 µm; such a temperature-dependent performance can be utilized for temperature sensing up to 1000 °C...|$|R
5000|$|Cooperalls were {{designed}} by Brian Heaton, the senior designer for Cooper Canada from 1972 to 1975. Promoted as [...] "a complete hockey uniform system" [...] it consisted of an elasticated girdle extending {{from the middle of}} the rib cage to the top of the knees, worn beneath a tracksuit-style woven nylon <b>outer</b> shell covering <b>waist</b> to ankle. The girdle had pockets in to which lightweight, compression moulded foam pads were placed and the close fitting nature of the garment ensured that the pads always stayed in contact with the areas of the body they {{were designed}} to protect. This replaced the traditional combination of short hockey pants and socks, and Cooper claimed that when combined with their own brand of extra light shin guards, shoulder pads and gloves the system weighed 40% less than a conventional uniform. As well as being considerably lighter, the system offered players greater freedom of movement and improved hip, pelvis and thigh protection.|$|R
60|$|The sun {{was high}} in the heavens when he awoke; for two hours it had looked down upon another heroic figure miles away--the figure of a godlike man {{fighting}} {{his way through the}} hideous morass that lies like a filthy moat defending Pal-ul-don from the creatures of the <b>outer</b> world. Now <b>waist</b> deep in the sucking ooze, now menaced by loathsome reptiles, the man advanced only by virtue of Herculean efforts gaining laboriously by inches along the devious way that he was forced to choose in selecting the least precarious footing. Near the center of the morass was open water--slimy, green-hued water. He reached it at last after more than two hours of such effort as would have left an ordinary man spent and dying in the sticky mud, yet he was less than halfway across the marsh. Greasy with slime and mud was his smooth, brown hide, and greasy with slime and mud was his beloved Enfield that had shone so brightly in the first rays of the rising sun.|$|R
