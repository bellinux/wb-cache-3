5|$|In January 1940, Miles was {{promoted}} to brigadier and seconded to the newly raised 2nd New Zealand Division as its commander, Royal Artillery. His command consisted of three field regiments, one for each brigade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division,</b> {{as well as an}} anti-tank regiment. In March 1940, he was dispatched to Egypt, where the first elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> had arrived, but was then sent to England, where he would {{spend the rest of the}} year. Here he commanded a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> that had been diverted there while in transit. An initial attempt to join the main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> in the Middle East in October 1940 was foiled when the ship he was travelling on was bombed and forced to return to England.|$|E

5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear}} of offending Adolf Hitler. By the time the invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A large portion of the strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E

The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he was worn out and in January was evacuated to England for treatment. On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division.

5|$|The divisional {{insignia}} was a {{sun with}} 16 rays, the ancient {{symbol of the}} Macedonian king Alexander the Great. A divisional collar patch bearing the insignia was intended, but it is unlikely it was ever issued. During their formation and training in the Bácska region {{during the summer of}} 1944, the soldiers often dressed in khaki tropical uniforms with shorts. The official headgear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> was the SS M43 fez: a field gray model to be worn with service uniform and a red model for dress uniform. Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> that had previously served in the 13th SS Division often continued to wear the divisional collar patch of that division, which showed an arm holding a scimitar over a swastika.

5|$|When {{a second}} Bosnian Muslim Waffen-SS {{division}} {{was to be}} raised in June 1944, the cadre {{was provided by the}} 13th SS Division and Raithel was appointed as the divisional commander. The 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian) never reached full divisional strength and did not see action as a formation, but elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> fought briefly in southern Hungary in early October 1944. The Bosnian Muslim members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> mutinied on 17 October 1944, but Raithel quickly gained control over the situation.
