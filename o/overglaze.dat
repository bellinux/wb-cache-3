40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} was aimed to assess the {{flexural}} strength of the porcelain Duceram Plus ® (Degussa GmbH & Co), through variation of surface treatment and exposure or not to corrosive environment. Fifty six samples with standardized dimensions were fabricated on refractory boxes and divided into four groups according to the surface treatment. Group 1 remained only ground. Group 2 was submitted to natural glazing by heating the specimen to the glazing temperature. The samples from group 3 were submitted to <b>overglazing</b> using the porcelain Duceram Plus Glaze Material®. Samples from group 4 were polished using silicon rubber and diamond paste of 3 and 6 mm grit. Half of the specimens in each group were stored for 16 h at 80 oC in a 4 % acetic acid solution (ISO 6872). Tukey’s test (p< 0, 05) showed that the samples not submitted to corrosion, <b>overglazing</b> and polishing provided an increased strength {{in relation to the}} other groups. In the samples submitted to corrosion, <b>overglazing</b> showed a higher strength than polishing, although both of them did not show significant differences when coMPared to the other groups. Student’s t test (p< 0, 05) showed that glazed and <b>overglazed</b> porcelains did not have their strengths altered due to corrosion effects.

25|$|The same {{techniques}} {{are used to}} paint {{the various types of}} porcelain and earthenware, both underglaze and <b>overglaze,</b> but different pigments are used due to the different body characteristics and firing temperatures.

25|$|The Japanese {{began to}} make {{porcelain}} early in the 17th century, learning from Chinese and Korean craftsmen how to fire the pieces and make underglaze blue cobalt decoration and <b>overglaze</b> enamel painting. In the mid-17th century the Japanese found a growing market from European traders who were unable to obtain Chinese porcelain due to political upheavals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Overglaze</b> decorations of earthenware, Faience or {{porcelain}} were traditionally {{made with}} carefully outlined designs that were then colored in. Later designs represented flowers, landscapes or portraits with little overpainting or blending of the colors. In the 20th century china painting techniques became more like oil painting, with blended colors and designs in which attention to light gives three-dimensional effects.

40|$|Surface {{treatment}} procedures such as {{grinding and polishing}} are needed to provide the ceramic dental restorative materials with proper fitting and occlusion. The treated surfaces are customarily glazed to improve the strength and smoothness. Though smoothness and wetting of the dental surfaces are important to minimize bacterial plaque retention, influence of the surface treatment and glazing procedures on the final surface roughness and its correlation to wettability are overlooked. In this work, effect of various treatment (diamond fraising, stoning, sanding and aluminum oxide and rubber polishing) and glazing (auto and <b>overglazing)</b> techniques on the final roughness and the resulting wettability of dental ceramic surfaces were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans, 75 scans per sample. The surfaces were characterized and assigned an average roughness measure, Ra. The wettability of the same surfaces was evaluated using micro-contact angle measurements (25 micro-bubbles placed on a grid on each surface) to correlate the final surface roughness and wettability. The results show that <b>overglazing</b> prevails over surface irregularities from different {{treatment procedures}} and provides homegeneously smooth surfaces with mean Ra < 10 nm. It also produces uniformly wetted surfaces with low contact angles around 20 °. The autoglazed surfaces are less smooth (mean Ra around 50 nm) and displays sporadic topographic irregularities. They display larger and less uniform contact angles ranging between 35 ° and 50 °. The results suggest that <b>overglazing</b> should be preferred after surface treatment to obtain a smooth and well-wetted dental ceramic surface...|$|R

25|$|An artist {{may prefer}} a medium that stays fluid for some time, may want one that dries hard, or may want a medium that remains {{somewhat}} sticky.

40|$|MastersStatement of Problem: The {{potential}} for color changes in dental ceramics clinically {{can affect the}} prognosis of dental restorations. Therefore, color stability of dental ceramic systems needs to be thoroughly investigated. Purpose: This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the color changes of two dental ceramic systems after being subjected to staining solutions. Material and Methods: Two dental ceramic systems (veneered IPS e. max and conventional porcelain fused to metal) were used. Fifty four specimens 15 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness were fabricated for each material (Total 108). Disks from each material were divided into three groups (18 disks each) according to the surface finishing technique applied (autoglazing, <b>overglazing,</b> polishing). Color measurement of disks was performed by using a spectrophotometer. Each group was then divided into three subgroups (6 disks each). Each subgroup was immersed for 24 hours at 37 °C in one of the two staining drinks: (coffee, strawberry juice) as test groups and distilled water as a control. Color measurements were recorded after immersion. Color differences were characterized using the CIE l*a*b* color space. The total color difference (ΔE) was statistically compared between groups of the same ceramic material and between the two ceramic materials using Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, α = 0. 05) between-unit factors (two materials, three surface finishing techniques, and three staining solutions) to verify the main effects and possible interactions between factors. Where significant differences were found, one-way ANOVA and Post Hoc and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were applied to each betweenunit factor. Results: Porcelain fused to metal group showed no significant difference between staining solutions or surface finishing techniques used (p= 0. 05), except for the autoglazed group which was more affected than <b>overglazed</b> and polished ones with coffee stain. For IPS e. max group, no significant difference was found between staining solutions, while for the effect of surface finishing technique used, <b>overglazed</b> surfaces gave the lowest ΔE values and where significantly difference from autoglazed and polished ones (p= 0. 05) with both coffee and strawberry juice stains. Most of the recorded ΔE values are perceptible (> 1) and are considered clinically acceptable (< 2. 75). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the results show that minimal color change was observed when porcelain samples were subjected to staining solutions, regardless of the ceramic material used or the surface finishing technique applied. Porcelain surface polishing can be considered as efficient as autoglazing or overglazin...|$|R
50|$|The {{emergence}} of enamelled porcelain near Arita in Kyushu began Kakiemon-style decoration in <b>overglazed</b> coloured enamels. The {{success of the}} Japanese {{was due to the}} failure of the Chinese industry under the Ming Dynasty until it was reestablished under the Qing dynasty. However, in this brief period Kakiemon emerged with this new technique and style. These elephants are thought to have been made in 1660 to 1690. They would have been made by casting into moulds and the remains of broken elephant shaped moulds have been found in modern excavations at Arita. Meissen porcelain, which was developed in the 18th century, is considered to have been strongly influenced by the Kakiemon Japanese imports.|$|R
50|$|Benjarong (Thai เบญจรงค์) ware {{is a kind}} {{of painted}} {{porcelain}} in Thailand. The name literally means 'five colors'. The painted decoration usually consists of 3 to 8 colors. For the decoration, repetitive forms, usually geometric or flower-based, are used. A design is usually named after the decoration base name and a background color (for example, Phum Kao Bin on dark blue). Enamel colors are applied and <b>overglazed,</b> creating a swelling effect over the surface of the piece. The production process is incredibly labor-intensive, as each color is applied individually, and the piece is kiln fired after the application of each color. The firing process brightens the colors of the finished piece and adds to its beauty. Gold is also used in painting the porcelain.|$|R
