40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{characterization}} and the valorization of plant genetic resources of fodder and pastoral interest in Algeria, fourteen natural populations of Hedysarum coronarium L. were subjected to a morpho-physiological study. Ecological factors (altitude and rainfall) of the <b>originating</b> <b>environment</b> of the different populations were considered. Thirty four characteristics related to seed weight, seedling emergence, vegetative development, flowering and formation of fruiting heads were included in the study. The results indicate the existence of variability within the species and between the populations, especially for the rate of seedlings at the second simple leaf stage, the development of the height axis, the end of the bloom and the full fruiting heads characteristics which are significant. This would be linked to the ecological factors of the environment of origin, especially the altitude which would constitute the most important factor. The results of principal components analysis show off some important characteristics, particularly the numbers of leaves and ramifications per plant, which oppose themselves to certain characteristics linked to the breeding (flowering and formation of fruiting heads). H. coronarium L. should be developed, particularly in the isolated and disinherited areas, where they could adapt themselves with advantage...|$|E
40|$|Background: According to the endosymbiont hypothesis, the {{mitochondrial}} {{system for}} aerobic respiration {{was derived from}} an ancestral Alphaproteobacterium. Phylogenetic studies indicate that the mitochondrial ancestor is most {{closely related to the}} Rickettsiales. Recently, it was suggested that Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique, a member of the SAR 11 clade that is highly abundant in the oceans, is a sister taxon to the mitochondrial-Rickettsiales clade. The availability of ocean metagenome data substantially increases the sampling of Alphaproteobacteria inhabiting the oxygen-containing waters of the oceans that likely resemble the <b>originating</b> <b>environment</b> of mitochondria. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present a phylogenetic study of the origin of mitochondria that incorporates metagenome data from the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition. We identify mitochondrially related sequences in the GOS dataset that represent a rare group of Alphaproteobacteria, designated OMAC (Oceanic Mitochondria Affiliated Clade) as the closest free-living relatives to mitochondria in the oceans. In addition, our analyses reject the hypothesis that the mitochondrial system for aerobic respiration is affiliated with that of the SAR 11 clade. Conclusions/Significance: Our results allude to the existence of an alphaproteobacterial clade in the oxygen-rich surface waters of the oceans that represents the closest free-living relative to mitochondria identified thus far. In addition, our findings underscore the importance of expanding the taxonomic diversity in phylogenetic analyses beyond tha...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} {{proposed and}} experimentally validated Equilibrium Model {{provides the most}} detailed description of temperature's effect on enzyme catalytic activity to date. By introducing an equilibrium between Eact, the active form of enzyme, and Einact, a reversibly inactivated form of enzyme, the Equilibrium Model explains apparent enzyme activity loss at high temperatures that cannot {{be accounted for by}} irreversible thermal denaturation. The Equilibrium Model describes enzyme behavior in the presence of substrates and under assay conditions; thus its associated parameters, deltaHeq and Teq, may have physiological significance. The Equilibrium Model parameters have been determined for twenty-one enzymes of diverse origins. The results demonstrated the wide applicability of the Equilibrium Model to enzymes of different types and temperature affinity. The study has also established deltaHeq as the first quantitative measure of enzyme eurythermalism and demonstrated the relationship between Teq and optimal growth temperature of organisms. The Equilibrium Model is therefore a useful tool for studying enzyme temperature adaptation and its role in adaptations to thermophily and eurythermalism. Moreover, it potentially enables a description of the <b>originating</b> <b>environment</b> from the properties of the enzymes. The Equilibrium Model has been employed to characterize enzymes isolated from bacterial episymbionts of Alvinella pompejana. A. pompejana inhabits one of the most extreme environments known to science and has been proposed as an extremely eurythermal organism. A metagenomic study of the A. pompejana episymbionts has unveiled new information related to the adaptive and metabolic properties of the bacterial consortium; the availability of metagenomic sequences has also enabled targeted retrieval and heterologous expression of A. pompejana episymbiont genes. By inspecting enzymes derived from the unique episymbiotic microbial consortium intimately associated with A. pompejana, the study has shed light on temperature adaptations in this unique symbiotic relationship. The findings suggested that eurythermal enzymes are one of the mechanisms used by the microbial consortium to achieve its adaptations. By combining metagenomic and enzymological studies, the research described in this thesis has lead to insights on the eurythermalism of a complex microbial system from an enzymological aspect. The findings have enhanced our knowledge on how life adapts to extreme environments, and the validation of the Equilibrium Model as a tool for studying enzyme temperature adaptation paves the way for future studies...|$|E

40|$|Plants {{from four}} populations of Hordeum spontaneum <b>originating</b> in {{distinct}} <b>environments</b> of Israel were compared for stress induced phenotypic plasticity. The environments ranged along a gradient of increasing rainfall amount and predictability from low (desert) to moderate (semisteppe batha) to high (Mediterranean grassland and mountain, the latter also experiencing frost stress). The plants {{were exposed to}} a set of four treatments: no stress (optimum water and nutrients), water, nutrient and both water and nutrient stress. Plants from the four populations (or ecotypes) exhibited different patterns of plasticity in response to the different stresses (water and nutrients) and in different trait categories (reproductive, fitness and resource allocation). The importance of plasticity in response to water stress appears to decrease, and to nutrient stress appears to increase along the increasing rainfall gradient. The mountain ecotype, growing in an area with high potential productivity (amount of rainfall) but experiencing periodic frosts, was the most plastic among ecotypes in resource allocation under both water and nutrient stress, but exhibited low plasticity in other trait categories. In contrast, the desert ecotype had low plasticity in resource allocation under water stress and the lowest plasticity among the four ecotypes in all trait categories in response to nutrient stress. The ecotype originating in Mediterranean grassland, a predictable and most favourable environment, was highly plastic in fitness and allocation traits in response to low nutrient levels which is likely to occur due to competition in productive environment. We discuss the observed differences in ecotype plasticity as part of their environmentally induced adaptive 'strategies'. We found no support for the hypothesis that plants <b>originating</b> in <b>environments</b> with greater variation and unpredictability are more plastic. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.

Two languages that feature such an interface to a common language can even interoperate by means of this common intermediate language. Smalltalk and Java, for example, both offer an interface to C and can therefore interoperate through a connection of these interfaces. However, the resulting interactions will need to occur {{at the level of}} abstraction offered by the (low-level) C interfaces, although both Java and Smalltalk are object-oriented languages. In this paper, we describe how the dynamic and reflective facilities of the Smalltalk language permits us to raise the level of abstraction of these inter-language interactions to seamless message passing between objects. In addition, we introduce and explore the concept of language shifting objects where Java objects are not only represented in Smalltalk but can partially or completely migrate from Java to Smalltalk. Language-shifting effectively migrates Java methods to Smalltalk methods such that original Java objects can end up “living ” in the Smalltalk environment without needing a connection to their <b>originating</b> Java <b>environment.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Large public screens are proliferating {{in public}} spaces.

However, {{it is not hard to}} imagine that these displays will soon be connected through the Internet, thus creating a global and powerful communication medium capable of providing rich, interactive applications. We believe that such a medium has the potential to foster connections within and between communities in public spaces. In this paper we present a research agenda for interacting places, i. e., public spaces that connect communities through public displays. We then report on our initial work in this space, in particular on using public displays for creating what we call identity cognition – increasing the sense of being connected between community members occupying the same space. We have investigated two options for achieving identity cognition: (a) through content that <b>originates</b> from the <b>environment,</b> and (b) through content that originates from people. Content <b>originating</b> from the <b>environment</b> portrays information about a display’s surrounding. For this type of content, identity cognition is usually being achieved implicitly by stimulating the effect of ‘triangulation’, an effect where particularities of the physical space act as links between people. Content originating from people, on the other hand, explicitly achieves identity cognition by promoting community values through content that expresses the attitudes, beliefs, and ideas of individual community members. We have built and deployed two public display applications that support identity cognition using environmentally-sourced content and people-sourced content, respectively...|$|R
