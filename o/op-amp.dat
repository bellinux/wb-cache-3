25|$|The <b>op-amp</b> gain {{calculated}} at DC {{does not}} apply at higher frequencies. Thus, for high-speed operation, more sophisticated considerations must be used in an <b>op-amp</b> circuit design.|$|E
25|$|The <b>op-amp</b> is {{one type}} of {{differential}} amplifier. Other types of differential amplifier include the fully differential amplifier (similar to the <b>op-amp,</b> but with two outputs), the instrumentation amplifier (usually built from three op-amps), the isolation amplifier (similar to the instrumentation amplifier, but with tolerance to common-mode voltages that would destroy an ordinary <b>op-amp),</b> and negative-feedback amplifier (usually built from one or more op-amps and a resistive feedback network).|$|E
25|$|Finite bandwidth: All {{amplifiers}} have finite bandwidth. To a first approximation, the <b>op-amp</b> has {{the frequency}} response of an integrator with gain. That is, the gain {{of a typical}} <b>op-amp</b> is inversely proportional to frequency and is characterized by its gain–bandwidth product(GBWP). For example, an <b>op-amp</b> with a GBWP of 1MHz would have a gain of 5 at 200kHz, and a gain of 1 at 1MHz. This dynamic response coupled with the very high DC gain of the <b>op-amp</b> gives it {{the characteristics of a}} first-order low-pass filter with very high DC gain and low cutoff frequency given by the GBWP divided by the DC gain.The finite bandwidth of an <b>op-amp</b> can be the source of several problems, including:Typical low-cost, general-purpose op-amps exhibit a GBWP of a few megahertz. Specialty and high-speed op-amps exist that can achieve a GBWP of hundreds of megahertz. For very high-frequency circuits, a current-feedback operational amplifier is often used.|$|E
25|$|CMOS <b>op-amps</b> (such as the CA3140E) provide {{extremely}} high input resistances, higher than JFET-input <b>op-amps,</b> which are normally higher than bipolar-input <b>op-amps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Operational {{amplifier}} (<b>op-amps)</b> swapping is {{the process}} of replacing an operational amplifier in audio equipment with a different one, in an attempt to improve performance or change the perceived sound quality. <b>Op-amps</b> are used in most audio devices, and most <b>op-amps</b> have the same pinouts, making replacement fairly simple. If the new device's parameters sometimes do not match it can lead to problems like high-frequency oscillation.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Op-amps</b> {{are among}} the most widely used {{electronic}} devices today, being used in a vast array of consumer, industrial, and scientific devices. Many standard IC <b>op-amps</b> cost only a few cents in moderate production volume; however, some integrated or hybrid operational amplifiers with special performance specifications may cost over [...] in small quantities. [...] <b>Op-amps</b> may be packaged as components or used as elements of more complex integrated circuits.|$|R
25|$|An {{operational}} amplifier (often <b>op-amp</b> or opamp) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output. In this configuration, an <b>op-amp</b> produces an output potential (relative to circuit ground) that is typically {{hundreds of thousands}} of times larger than the potential difference between its input terminals.|$|E

25|$|Op-amps are {{designed}} {{to operate in the}} linear mode with negative feedback. Hence, an <b>op-amp</b> typically has a lengthy recovery time from saturation. Almost all op-amps have an internal compensation capacitor which imposes slew rate limitations for high frequency signals. Consequently, an <b>op-amp</b> makes a sloppy comparator with propagation delays that can be as long as tens of microseconds.|$|E
5000|$|Classification by {{internal}} compensation: <b>op-amps</b> may suffer from high frequency instability in some negative feedback circuits unless a small compensation capacitor modifies the phase and frequency responses. <b>Op-amps</b> {{with a built-in}} capacitor are termed [...] "compensated", and allow circuits above some specified closed-loop gain to operate stably with no external capacitor. In particular, <b>op-amps</b> that are stable even with a closed loop gain of 1 are called [...] "unity gain compensated".|$|R

40|$|As CMOS {{technology}} {{continues to}} evolve, thesupply voltages are decreasing {{while at the}} same time the transistor threshold voltages are remaining relatively constant. Making matters worse, the inherent gain available from the nano-CMOS transistors is dropping. Traditional techniques for achieving high-gain by cascoding become less useful in nano-scale CMOS processes. Horizontal cascading (multi-stage) must be used in order to realize high-gain <b>op-amps</b> in low supply voltage processes. This paper discusses indirect compensation techniques for <b>op-amps</b> using split-length devices. A reversed-nested indirect compensated (RNIC) topology, employing double pole-zero cancellation, is illustrated for the design of three-stage <b>op-amps.</b> The RNIC topology is then extended to the design of three-stage fully-differential <b>op-amps.</b> Novel three-stage fully-differential gain-stage cascade structures are presented with efficient common mode feedback (CMFB) stabilization. Simulation results are presented for the designed RNIC fullydifferential three-stage <b>op-amps.</b> The fully-differential three-stage <b>op-amps,</b> designed in 0. 5 μm CMOS, typically exhibit 18 MHz unity-gain frequency, 82 dB open-loop DC gain, nearly 300 ns transient settling and 72 ° phase-margin for a 500 pF load...|$|R
25|$|None {{of these}} ideals can be {{perfectly}} realized. A real <b>op-amp</b> may be modeled with non-infinite or non-zero parameters using equivalent resistors and capacitors in the <b>op-amp</b> model. The designer can then include these effects into the overall {{performance of the}} final circuit. Some parameters {{may turn out to}} have negligible effect on the final design while others represent actual limitations of the final performance that must be evaluated.|$|E
25|$|Limited {{output current}}: The output current must be finite. In practice, most op-amps are {{designed}} to limit the output current {{so as not to}} exceed a specified level – around 25mA for a type 741 IC <b>op-amp</b> – thus protecting the <b>op-amp</b> and associated circuitry from damage. Modern designs are electronically more rugged than earlier implementations and some can sustain direct short circuits on their outputs without damage.|$|E

There were a few slight printed circuit board modifications and 7.1 audio support was added.|$|R

2500|$|Saturation:Output voltage {{is limited}} to a minimum and maximum value close to the power supply voltages. The output of older <b>op-amps</b> can reach to within one or two volts of the supply rails.

25|$|While the 741 was {{historically}} used in {{audio and}} other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare {{because of the}} improved noise performance of more modern <b>op-amps.</b> Apart from generating noticeable hiss, 741s and other older <b>op-amps</b> may have poor common-mode rejection ratios and so will often introduce cable-borne mains hum and other common-mode interference, such as switch 'clicks', into sensitive equipment.|$|R
