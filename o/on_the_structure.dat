5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} {{had a profound impact}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the past, {{considerable}} {{interest has}} been developed in the problems of expansive soil and its effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structures,</b> but comparatively very little has been studied to understand its behavior and effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structures.</b> A number of reports about the characteristics, behavior, stabilization and effects on structures of expansive soil have been published over the years but no comprehensive review has been published specially during the last decade. Thus {{the aim of this}} paper is to present a review on characteristics, behavior, stabilization of expansive soil and its effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structures.</b> Up to certain extant its nature and mechanics is understood and tried to stabilized by different techniques. Mainly this soil is stabilized with lime and fly ash and with the addition of certain chemicals gives very good performance even in the adverse conditions. But very little work has been done on its effects and remedial measures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structures.</b> <b>The</b> study will give technical overview and useful information to the engineers and researchers who will work for the betterment of research activities in this field in future...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom is that scale-free networks are prone to cooperation spreading. In this paper we investigate <b>the</b> cooperative behaviors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> scale-free network. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary of the {{conventional wisdom}} that scale-free networks are prone to cooperation spreading, the evolution of cooperation is inhibited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> scale-free network while performing the prisoner's dilemma (PD) game. Firstly, we demonstrate that neither the scale-free property nor the high clustering coefficient is responsible for the inhibition of cooperation spreading <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> scale-free network. Then we provide one heuristic method to argue that the lack of age correlations and its associated `large-world' behavior in <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> scale-free network inhibit the spread of cooperation. The findings may help enlighten further studies on evolutionary dynamics of the PD game in scale-free networks. Comment: Definitive version accepted for publication in Journal of Physics...|$|R

5|$|A {{cold front}} was located {{north of the}} Bahamas on August26, with a broad area of {{cyclonic}} turning located east of northern Florida. Atmospheric pressures were falling in the region, and gale force winds were recorded by 12:00UTC on August27. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure,</b> {{it is estimated that}} the frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18:00UTC that day. Ship reports in the region suggested peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). There was very dry air {{on the west side of}} the system, unusual for August, and the radius of maximum winds was around 115mi (185km), suggesting that the structure could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00UTC on August28. It spread rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around 35mph (55km/h). The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on August28 over eastern Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 {{had gone}} some way toward {{procedural}} reform, in February 1867, Roundell Palmer again brought {{the problem of}} having two separate court systems to Parliament's attention, and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single, unified High Court of Justice. The bill was a weak one, not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with the common law and which with equity, and was also silent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the court, as Hatherley believed {{the difference between the}} common law and equity was one of procedure, not substance. As a result, the bill was heavily opposed from two sides: those who opposed fusion, and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use. As a result, the bill was eventually withdrawn.|$|E

The charge transfer resistance at the counter cathode of DSCs based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> conical island <b>structures</b> was remarkably reduced compared to that of DSCs based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planar <b>structures.</b> <b>The</b> electron lifetime at the interface between the photoelectrode and electrolyte was longer for DSCs based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> conical island <b>structure</b> than that for DSCs based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planar <b>structure.</b> <b>The</b> conical island <b>structure</b> effectively enhanced <b>the</b> performance of DSCs based on TiO 2 nanotube arrays.

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{concept is}} that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after {{the removal of the}} gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{proposed}} mechanisms for Sedna's extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80AU). If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated {{in the same direction}} as the Solar System, then all of its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100–500AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Humberto was a {{moderately}} powerful hurricane that briefly affected Bermuda in September 2001. It was the eighth named storm of the season, {{as well as}} the fourth hurricane. It formed on September 21 between Puerto Rico and Bermuda, partially related to previous Hurricane Gabrielle. Humberto passed about 140 miles (225km) west of Bermuda, which spared the island with its strongest winds. After weakening and believed {{to be on the verge}} of dissipating, Humberto unexpectedly restrengthened to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. The intensification was short-lived and the storm dissipated on September 27.
