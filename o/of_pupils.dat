40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at image {{processing}} to obtain informations about the center <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> and iris,the pupillar and limbic boundary from grayscale images of the eye. An introduction describes general research in topic <b>of</b> <b>pupil,</b> iris and changes in size <b>of</b> <b>pupil.</b> There are mentioned articles dealing with the detection of the center <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> and iris. These articles were used as an inspiration for proposal of detection methods used in this work. The introduction ends with description of designed approaches of detection <b>of</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> and iris in images of CASIA-Iris-Interval database. The second, practical part of this work, is dedicated to description of acquisition system, which was compiled to obtain proper images of eye. Individual analysis of methods used to obtain parameters <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> and iris follows after that. There are two methods of detection <b>of</b> center <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> and pupillar boundary, one method determines center of iris and limbic boundary. Last method detects centers and boundaries <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> and iris at one time. The end of this work is dedicated to analysis of results of designed methods. Analysis includes score of successfulness of detection, statistical analysis, discussion of changes in pupillary diameter depending on the light conditions and changes in position <b>of</b> center <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> during constriction and dilatation <b>of</b> <b>pupil...</b>|$|R

5|$|Carre's is a state-run {{selective}} grammar school. It {{converted to}} an Academy and reopened on 1 August 2011; it {{is governed by}} Carre's Grammar School Academy Trust and converted without sponsorship. As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 pupils aged 11–18. The school admits boys on a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 girls on roll as of 2015. The majority <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English as an additional language. The number <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of students with learning disabilities. Pupils are allocated into houses based on their forms. The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E

40|$|The {{static and}} dynamic aspects <b>of</b> the <b>pupil</b> {{response}} associated with various amplitudes of far-to-near (accommodation) and near-to-far (disaccommodation) focusing responses were evaluated in this study. Dynamic refractive and pupillary changes were measured simultaneously during focusing responses to targets at real distances in 12 young (23 – 26 years) emmetropic subjects. The targets were presented alternately at far (6 m) {{and at one}} of six near positions from 1 D (1 m) to 6 D (16. 7 cm) in 1 D steps. The latency, magnitude and peak velocity <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> changes associated with accommodation and disaccommodation responses were calculated. The latency of refractive changes was shorter than that of pupillary changes. In general, the pupil constricted with accommodation and started dilating while accommodation was still maintained, resulting in reduced pupil dilation with disaccommodation. The magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>pupil</b> response increased linearly with that of accommodation and disaccommodation. The amount <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> change per dioptre of refractive change was invariant with various amplitudes of refractive change. The peak velocity <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> constriction was greater than that <b>of</b> <b>pupil</b> dilation for corresponding amplitudes. The pupil response is more closely associated with accommodation than with disaccommodation...|$|R
