40|$|The {{concealed}} information test (CIT) {{is often}} advocated {{as a method}} for detecting deception. Information about a crime that only a guilty person would recognise, typically a single <b>object</b> (<b>probe),</b> is presented within a sequence of similar but irrelevant objects. Participant’s physiological responses to stimuli are recorded and used to indicate concealed recognition. In the present study, we examined whether the CIT is applicable to the recognition of whole scenes as opposed to single objects. University students each completed 10 scene CITs presented on a computer monitor. Each CIT contained: a probe, a recognisable campus scene; a target; and four similar but unfamiliar scenes. Participants were instructed to conceal recognition of scenes from Warwick campus and only answer “yes” to the target scene. Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and reaction time measures were taken for each scene. The {{results showed that the}} target scene typically elicited the greatest electrodermal responses in each block. However, no significant difference was found in reaction time measures between probe, target and irrelevant scenes. Furthermore, although probe scene recognition using EDA was much more promising, it fell short of that found in typical studies using objects. These results raise new questions about: i) use of the CIT for concealed scene recognition, ii) the relationship between, and potential issues of measuring reaction time and EDA within the same test, and iii) future design considerations (such as the use of single vs. multiprobe techniques) {{in the development of a}} scene-based CIT. If valid, scene-based CITs can be developed this will offer a greater range of information for investigators to utilise during questioning. ...|$|E
40|$|Gibson (1950) {{proposed}} that optic flow provides {{information about the}} direction of self-motion (heading) relative to objects in the environment. Llewellyn (1971) pointed out that the change in egocentric direction of an object, "drift", also provides information about whether an observer is passing to the left or right of the object. We compared the precision of heading judgements with flow and drift cues, presented in isolation, and together. With flow alone, observers were quite precise (< 1 °), but observers were more precise with drift, and equally precise with drift alone and with both flow and drift. Next we examined how precision changed with display duration (0. 2 - 1. 6 s). There was evidence of cue-combination at 0. 2 s but at longer durations the precisions for the drift and both cue conditions were similar and lower than for the flow condition. To explore whether flow contributes at all with display durations longer than 0. 2 s, we replicated the 0. 4 s condition and also measured reaction times. Lower reaction times when flow was available suggested that flow does contribute. We next checked to see whether poorer precision in the flow condition was {{due to the fact that}} the <b>object</b> <b>probe</b> was presented after the stimulus display. We ran an experiment in which we added simulated gaze rotation noise in the range between - 1 and + 1 °/s in the display to perturb the drift signal. This led to a drop in the precision of heading judgements. We then added a simulated gaze rotation at + 1 or - 1 °/s. This led to not only a larger reduction in the precision but also a large systematic difference in the accuracy of heading judgments between the two rotation rates, suggesting drift dominating flow. We conclude that target drift is a surprisingly powerful cue for the perception of naturalistic object-relative heading. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015...|$|E

40|$|Single {{wavelength}} illumination {{is used in}} {{the traditional}} ptychography. Even though using multi-wavelength to improve image quality, it takes the scheme of illuminating in turn due to the requirement of coherence. So far, the addition of incoherent modes has been regarded as a nuisance in diffractive imaging. Here we propose a scheme of incoherent ptychography and an algorithm of information multiplexing that uses the multi-wavelength illumination simultaneously, which are demonstrated in experiment and simulation. Compared with the scheme of traditional ptychography, it can recover not only the object well, but also the spectral response of the <b>object,</b> <b>probes</b> of complex value and spectral weight of each wavelength respectively. This method obtains much information about the object and owns the multichannel and multispectral merits. Meanwhile, by means of color image coding, this method can retrieve true color images and enhance the image quality. The proposed algorithm has strong robustness.

The work may open up possibilities for information multiplexing in ptychography and multispectral microscopy imaging over various applications. </p...|$|R
40|$|Lensless, {{holographic}} X-ray microscopy is a non-invasive {{imaging technique}} that provides resolution on the nanometer scale. Therefore, a divergent, coherent and especially clean wave front impinging on {{the sample is}} needed. Yet, focusing X-rays by even the most advanced X-ray mirrors causes so called figure errors of high spatial frequency content. The results are strongly deteriorated intensity profiles that are often even more pronounced than the holographic image of the sample itself. A common strategy to compensate these figure errors is to divide the hologram by the pure intensity profile of the beam (the so called flat field). However, this division is only valid in the limiting case of an illumination focused down to a point source. In reality, {{as a consequence of}} a fi nite spot size, one has to accept a loss in resolution when performing the flat field correction. An approach different from the described straightforward procedure is necessary. Here, the simultaneous reconstruction of <b>object</b> and <b>probe</b> is proposed using holograms which were not flat field corrected before phase retrieval. To this end, a method has been developed that allows simultaneously reconstructing <b>object</b> and <b>probe</b> in amplitude and phase from holographic intensity recordings. The experimental way of proceeding was mainly inspired by well-established holographic full-field X-ray imaging techniques that require holograms defocused to different degrees. Consequently, the conclusion seems reasonable that diversity in the optical near-field arises mainly from variation of the propagation distance of light. This so called longitudinal diversity is used to properly phase the transmission function of the sample of interest. The algorithmic strategy of simultaneous phase retrieval for <b>object</b> and <b>probe</b> draws on far-field ptychography where lateral translations of the sample create diverse diffraction patterns. In view of the need for longitudinal diversity realized by shifts of the sample along the optical axis, ptychography has been generalized and adapted for the optical near-field. Hence, translations of the sample in all three dimensions of space need to be exploited to collect enough information about <b>object</b> and <b>probe</b> such that both can be reconstructed simultaneously in amplitude and phase. Concepts have been put into practice by simulations as well as by experiments with coherent visible light and hard X-rays from synchrotron sources. The presented approach offers the opportunity to perform high resolution imaging, to be extended to tomography and to be adapted to super-resolution experiments...|$|R

40|$|Many location-based {{applications}} are enabled by handling numer-ous moving queries over mobile objects. Efficient processing of such queries mainly relies on effective probing, i. e., polling the ob-jects to obtain their current locations (required for processing the queries).

Similar reductions in attentional costs were observed when the hands were placed closer together, suggesting that processing at one hand is less prioritized over that at another when the hands can be ''grouped'' by virtue of arising from the same spatial location or from the same <b>object.</b> <b>Probes</b> of perceived hand locations throughout the task showed that holding a common object decreased attentional separability without decreasing the perceived separation between the hands.
