25|$|On tandem {{bicycles}} the pedalling {{contribution of}} both riders is often combined and coordinated by the crank arms. There {{may be a}} second set of chainrings, often on the opposite side from the regular drive train, one on each crank set and connected by a separate chain. The most common implementation has both cyclists pedaling at exactly the same pace and usually in phase, although it is possible to configure the system for <b>out-of-phase</b> pedaling.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 FIFA {{ruling that}} a player can be {{registered}} {{with a maximum}} of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, {{as in the case}} of two former Ireland internationals. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with <b>out-of-phase</b> seasons.|$|E
25|$|Thermoacoustic {{devices are}} very {{different}} from Stirling devices, although the individual path travelled by each working gas molecule does follow a real Stirling cycle. These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling power piston, while <b>out-of-phase</b> acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling displacer piston. Thus a thermoacoustic device typically does not have a displacer, as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.|$|E
25|$|Optical phonons are <b>out-of-phase</b> {{movements}} of the atoms in the lattice, one atom moving to the left, and its neighbour to the right. This occurs if the lattice basis consists {{of two or more}} atoms. They are called optical because in ionic crystals, like sodium chloride, they are excited by infrared radiation. The electric field of the light will move every positive sodium ion {{in the direction of the}} field, and every negative chloride ion in the other direction, sending the crystal vibrating.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of <b>out-of-phase</b> {{supplies}} mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|E
500|$|The Commitments {{does not}} have an {{original}} film score, but features existing music tracks. Music supervisor G. Marq Roswell spent several months during the film's pre-production listening to and categorizing hundreds of R songs before travelling to Dublin, Ireland to help Parker finalize songs that would be used in the film. Parker and Roswell had created a [...] "short list" [...] of 1,000 possible song choices. From May to June 1990, Parker had listened to more than 300 songs from the 1960s before narrowing his choices down to 75 songs. The finished film features 68 different musical cues and 52 songs. 24 songs were chosen by the director to be performed by the cast. Roswell also organized and oversaw the recording sessions. The songs were recorded live on set, as Parker wanted to capture the reality of the band's rehearsals and performances. The filmmakers used <b>out-of-phase</b> speakers, which enabled them to play pre-recorded tracks at maximum volume, creating a live performance atmosphere. Each song was then recorded onto a 24-track recorder.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, the HKB model {{has become a}} widely {{accepted}} theory to explain the coordinated movements and behaviors of individual neurons into large, end-to-end neural networks. [...] Originally the model described {{a system in which}} spontaneous transitions observed in finger movements could be described as a series of in-phase and <b>out-of-phase</b> movements.|$|E
2500|$|Laverda three-cylinder engines up to 1982 [...] {{featured}} a 180-degree crankshaft arrangement, {{in which the}} center piston {{is at the top}} of its stroke when the [...] two outer pistons are at the bottom. This purposefully <b>out-of-phase</b> design gave the 1,000cc Laverdas a distinctive character. [...] The engine evolved into a smoother, rubber mounted 120degree configuration in 1982.|$|E
2500|$|Walking is {{characterized}} by an [...] "inverted pendulum" [...] movement in which {{the center of gravity}} vaults over a stiff leg with each step. [...] Force plates can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an <b>out-of-phase</b> relationship indicating exchange between the two. [...] Interestingly, this model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} this {{behavior}} was that the two pendulums were affecting each other through slight motions of the supporting mantlepiece. This process is called entrainment or mode locking in physics and is observed in other coupled oscillators. Synchronized pendulums {{have been used in}} clocks and were widely used in gravimeters in the early 20th century. Although Huygens only observed <b>out-of-phase</b> synchronization, recent investigations have shown the existence of in-phase synchronization, as well as [...] "death" [...] states wherein one or both clocks stops.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{description is}} based on the same B12(B12)12supericosahedron as in the YB66 structure. In the YB66 crystal structure, the　supericosahedra form 3-dimensional boron framework as shown in figure 5. In this framework, the neighboring supericosahedra are rotated 90° with respect to each other. On the contrary, in Sc4.5–xB57–y+zC3.5–z the supericosahedra form a 2-dimensional network where the 90° rotation relation is broken because of the orthorhombic symmetry. The planar projections of the supericosahedron connection in Sc4.5–xB57–y+zC3.5–z and YB66 are shown in figures 27a and b, respectively. In the YB66 crystal structure, the neighboring 2-dimensional supericosahedron connections are <b>out-of-phase</b> for the rotational relation of the supericosahedron. This allows 3-dimensional ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} HKB model experiments, {{subjects}} were asked to wave one finger on each hand in two modes of direction: first, known as out of phase, both fingers moving in the same direction back and forth (as windshield wipers might move); and second, known as in-phase, where both fingers come together and move away to and from the midline of the body. [...] To illustrate coordination dynamics, the {{subjects were asked}} to move their fingers out of phase with increasing speed until their fingers were moving as fast as possible. [...] As movement approached its critical speed, the subjects’ fingers were found to move from <b>out-of-phase</b> (windshield-wiper-like) movement to in-phase (toward midline movement).|$|E
2500|$|... flanger - {{to create}} an unusual sound, a delayed signal {{is added to the}} {{original}} signal with a continuously variable delay (usually smaller than 10 ms). [...] This effect is now done electronically using DSP, but originally the effect was created by playing the same recording on two synchronized tape players, and then mixing the signals together. [...] As long as the machines were synchronized, the mix would sound more-or-less normal, but if the operator placed his finger on the flange of one of the players (hence [...] "flanger"), that machine would slow down and its signal would fall <b>out-of-phase</b> with its partner, producing a phasing effect. [...] Once the operator took his finger off, the player would speed up until its tachometer was back in phase with the master, and as this happened, the phasing effect would appear to slide up the frequency spectrum. [...] This phasing up-and-down the register can be performed rhythmically.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{inventor}} Galileo Ferraris {{invented a}} polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The {{idea was that}} two <b>out-of-phase,</b> but synchronized, currents {{might be used to}} produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. [...] Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclone has a cold core, {{meaning it}} is stronger aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures. [...] This is explained by the thermal wind relationship. [...] It also means that a pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. [...] If both an upper tropospheric cold-core low and lower tropospheric easterly wave trough are in-phase, with the easterly wave near or to the east of the upper level cyclone, thunderstorm development (also known as moist convection) is enhanced. [...] If they are <b>out-of-phase,</b> with the tropical wave west of the upper level circulation, convection is suppressed due to convergence aloft leading to downward motion over the tropical wave or surface trough in the easterlies. [...] Upper level cyclones also interact with troughs in the subtropical westerlies, such as cold fronts and stationary fronts. [...] When the subtropical disturbances in the Northern Hemisphere actively move southward, or dig, the area between the upper tropospheric anticyclone to its west and cold-core low to its east generally have strong northeasterly winds in addition to a rapid development of active thunderstorm activity. [...] Cloud bands associated with upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices are aligned with the vertical wind shear. [...] Animated satellite cloud imagery is a better tool for their early detection and tracking. [...] The low-level convergence caused by the cut-off low can trigger squall lines and rough seas, and the low-level spiral cloud bands caused by the upper level circulation are parallel to the low-level wind direction. [...] This has also been witnessed with upper level lows which occur at higher latitudes. [...] For example, in areas where small-scale snow bands develop within the cold sector of extratropical cyclones.|$|E

5000|$|In {{electric}} power systems, inductive reactance (and capacitive reactance, however inductive reactance is more common) can limit the power capacity of an AC transmission line, because {{power is not}} completely transferred when voltage and current are <b>out-of-phase</b> (detailed above). That is, current will flow for an <b>out-of-phase</b> system, however real power at certain times will not be transferred, {{because there will be}} points during which instantaneous current is positive while instantaneous voltage is negative, or vice versa, implying negative power transfer. Hence, real work is not performed when power transfer is “negative”. However, current still flows even when a system is <b>out-of-phase,</b> which causes transmission lines to heat up due to current flow. Consequently, transmission lines can only heat up so much (or else they would physically [...] "sag" [...] too much), so transmission line operators have a “ceiling” on the amount of current that can flow through a given line, and excessive inductive reactance can limit the power capacity of a line.|$|E
5000|$|Oxygenation {{and mixing}} of liquid {{cultures}} further depend on {{rotation of the}} liquid [...] "in-phase", meaning the synchronous movement of the liquid with the shaker table. Under certain conditions the shaking process leads to a breakdown of liquid motion - called [...] "out-of-phase phenomenon". This phenomenon has been intensively characterized for shake flask bioreactors. <b>Out-of-phase</b> conditions {{are associated with a}} strong decrease in mixing performance, oxygen transfer, and power input. Main factor for <b>out-of-phase</b> operation is the viscosity of the culture medium, but also the vessel diameter, low filling levels and/or a high number of baffles.|$|E

Alignment of electric field and polarisation orientation (top right) results in an expansion of the domain, giving a positive deflection as measured by the photodiode. When the bias is negative the domain contracts giving a negative deflection as measured by the photodiode meaning that the piezoresponse will always be in-phase with the driving voltage. For anti-alignment of electric field and polarisation orientation (bottom right) a positive bias results in a contraction of the domain and so gives a negative deflection as measured by the photodiode therefore the piezoresponse is 180° <b>out-of-phase</b> with the driving voltage.
