As he traveled by rail to Lincoln, he saw farmers and others standing by the tracks, hoping {{for a glimpse of}} the new Democratic nominee. He received many letters from supporters, expressing their faith in him in stark terms. One Indiana voter wrote, [...] "God has sent you amongst <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> save the poor from starvation, and we no [...] you will save us." [...] A farmer in Iowa, in a letter to Bryan, stated, [...] "You are the first big man that i [...] ever wrote to." ...|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{of racism}} and {{segregation}} also permeate the episode. Sara Gwenllian-Jones in her book Cult Television argues that, throughout the entry, [...] "the blacks are equated with aliens," [...] turning them into {{a certain type of}} [...] "other" [...] that is [...] "never allowed to fit in or feel safe". Gwenllian-Jones highlights the scene in which Dales, late one night on the team bus, wakes to see Exley's sleeping body being reflected as an alien in a window {{as an example of the}} racial comparison. She points out that, despite coming to Earth, Exley has moved from one segregated society—that of the aliens—into another. She points out that Exley, after revealing his true form to Dales, says that [...] "my people guard their privacy zealously. They don't want <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> intermingle with your people". This quote expresses a similar sentiment to the segregated mentality of the 1940s.|$|E

500|$|On December 3, 2006, Bayh {{announced}} that he would form an exploratory committee in order for him to travel and raise funds more effectively for a presidential run. Upon this declaration, the candidate appeared on This Week, articulating that Americans [...] "need someone who can deal with the dysfunction here in this city (Washington D.C.) so that our government begins to empower <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> fulfill their potential...if I can be that individual, so be it." [...] His spokesman remarked that the committee would help [...] "to put an infrastructure in place" [...] for the campaign. Bayh immediately returned to the campaign trail following his announcement, traveling back to Iowa on December 4 with approximately $10.6 million to continue spreading his message. The next weekend, Bayh visited New Hampshire to discuss his views on energy independence, global warming and the war in Iraq. But due to the two sold out appearances to the state by Barack Obama, who was recently named a potential candidate, Bayh's trip did not garner much media attention.|$|E

2500|$|Willow Bunch is the Rural Municipality #42 in {{southern}} Saskatchewan. In 2006, the total Aboriginal population for the RM #42 was 407. The Métis in Willow Bunch “played {{a key role}} in maintaining the peace during the time that the Sioux and the other American tribes were forced from the United States into the area of Wood Mountain. ” The Métis had a strong relationship with the Sioux, especially with Chief Sitting Bull. “The fires of 1880 on Wood Mountain resulted in the movement of <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> other communities. It was at this time that the Métis pioneers moved to Willow Bunch at the suggestion of Andre Gaudry." [...] The Métis were already settled in Willow Bunch when the North West Resistance, led by Louis Riel, battled the Canadian government over land rights. It was in 1885, “the Resistance {{had an impact on the}} Métis of Willow Bunch...marked the end of the influence of the Métis on the development of Western Canada. ” ...|$|E

Although Pilla recognized that a unique [...] "quality of parish life is a reality in many places" [...] and [...] "richness and diversity are a treasure to be preserved" [...] and that many parishes [...] "founded with strong ethnic roots that were and continue to be important in sustaining people's faith," [...] he wrote that, [...] "We need catechesis in order for <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> understand and support this vision of vibrant parish life."

2500|$|Palestinian {{archaeologists have}} also {{discovered}} {{a number of}} sites of significance to Christianity. At Tell Umm Amer in 2001, a Byzantine-era mosaic was unearthed. Experts believe it forms part of the oldest monastic complex ever to be discovered in the Middle East, likely founded in the 3rd century by Saint Hilario. While the archaeologists working at the site are Muslim Palestinians, they see nothing unusual about their desire to protect and promote a Christian shrine in an area inhabited by only 3,500 Christians today. Said Yasser Matar, co-director of the dig: [...] "This is our history; this is our civilisation and we want <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know about it [...] First we were Christians and later we became Muslims. These people were our forefathers: the ancient Palestinians." [...] Dr. Moin Sadeq, {{director general of the}} Department of Antiquities in Gaza, has submitted an application to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to assign it World Heritage Site status and fund the site's protection, restoration and rehabilitation for visitors. Another Byzantine era monastery and mosaic, since named the 'Jabalya Mosaic', was excavated by the Palestinian Department of Antiquities after its discovery by labourers working on Salah ad-Din road in Gaza City.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{time after}} the start of Gheorghe Tătărescu's premiership and Ion Inculeț's {{leadership}} of the Internal Affairs Ministry, repression of the Legion ceased, a measure which reflected Carol's hope to ensure a new period of stability. In 1936, during a youth congress in Târgu Mureș, Codreanu agreed to the formation of a permanent Death Squad, which immediately showed its goals with the killing of Mihai Stelescu by a group deemed Decemviri (led by Ion Caratănase), neutralizing the Crusades campaign of exposing the Guard's weaknesses, and silencing Stelescu's claims that Codreanu was hypocritical in his official display of ascetism, politically corrupt, uncultured, and a plagiarist. In 1936, Codreanu published an essay entitled [...] "The Resurrection of the Race", where he wrote:"I will under underline this once again: we are not up against a few pathetic individuals who have landed here by chance and who now seek protection and shelter. We are up against a fully-fledged Jewish state, an entire army which has come here with its sights set on conquest. The movement of the Jewish population and its penetration into Romania are being carried out in accordance with precise plans. In all probability, the 'Great Jewish Council' is planning {{the creation of a new}} Palestine on a strip of land, starting out on the Baltic Sea, embraces a part of Poland and Czechoslovakia and half of Romania right across to the Black Sea...The worse thing that Jews and politicians have done to us, the greatest danger that they have exposed <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>to,</b> is not the way they are seizing the riches and possessions of our country, destroying the Romanian middle class, the way they swamp our schools and liberal professions, or the pernicious influence they are having on our whole political life, although these already constitute mortal dangers for a people. The greatest danger they pose to the people is rather that they are undermining us racially, that they are destroying the racial, Romano-Dacian structure of our people and call into being a type of human being that is nothing, but a racial wreck." [...] The year was also marked by the deaths and ostentatious funerals of Moța (by then, the movement's vice president) and Vasile Marin, who had volunteered on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War and had been killed in the Majadahonda battle. Codreanu also published his autobiographical and ideological essay Pentru legionari ("For the Legionaries" [...] or [...] "For My Legionaries").|$|E
