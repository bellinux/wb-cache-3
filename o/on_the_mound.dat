5|$|Kirby Higbe {{replaced}} Branca <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> {{and ended}} the inning with the Cardinals in the lead, 3–1. Both teams combined for one {{hit in the}} fourth inning, a single by Moore. In {{the top of the}} fifth, Reese and Bruce Edwards singled, and Schultz grounded out on a bunt. Stan Rojek pinch hit for Higbe, and walked, loading the bases. Stanky grounded into a double play, ending the inning without the Dodgers scoring any runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Hal Gregg replaced Higbe <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> and retired the side in order. The sixth inning contained just one baserunner — Schoendienst — who was stranded on first after hitting a single.|$|E
5|$|Sportsman's Park {{was filled}} with 37,708people on October 5 for Game3. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> for the Cardinals was {{right-handed}} knuckleball pitcher Jesse Haines, a future Hall of Famer with a 13–4 record and 3.25 ERA in 183innings in 1926. Starting for the Yankees was southpaw pitcher Dutch Ruether, who had a 14–9 record with a 4.60 ERA in 1926.|$|E
5|$|When Ruth {{signed with}} the Yankees, he {{completed}} his transition from a pitcher to a power-hitting outfielder.

5|$|As the Washington Nationals, {{the team}} played their home games at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium from 2005 to 2007; their only home opener {{there was a}} 92 loss in 2007 by starter John Patterson. Nationals Park is the team's current field, {{and it was the}} site of the team's 2008 season opener, with {{starting}} pitcher Odalis Pérez <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> in a game that the Nationals won 32 over the visiting Atlanta Braves.|$|E
5|$|Between 2007 and 2010, {{he pitched}} {{in the lower}} levels of the Philadelphia Phillies' Minor League system {{initially}} as a starter, and subsequently as a reliever. Although he initially saw success in 2007, posting a 2.72 ERA in 10 starts with GCL Phillies and Williamsport Crosscutters, he struggled in 2008, posting an ERA of 5.09 in 27 starts, split between Williamsport and the Lakewood Blue Claws. At the conclusion of both 2008 and 2009, he pitched in the Florida Instructional League to continue honing his skills <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, {{which may be the}} reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E
50|$|The deep-water coral systems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> are {{especially}} fragile. Unlike shallow-water coral reefs, {{they are not}} adapted to cope with minor disturbances such as wave action. <b>The</b> <b>mounds</b> also support significant populations of the xenophyophore Syringammina fragilissima. This is a giant single-celled organism (a protozoan) that is widespread in deep waters, but occurs in particularly high densities <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> and <b>the</b> tails. Individual xenophyophores can grow to be larger than 20 cm and are often very fragile. The corals themselves provide a habitat for a wide diversity of other marine life including sponges, worms, crustaceans and molluscs. Among these starfish, sea urchins and crabs. Various fish have been observed, including blue ling, roundnose grenadier, and the orange roughy.|$|R
50|$|The site {{consists}} of a platform mound which now measures 7 ft in height, with the base being 100 ft by 100 ft. Excavations at the site have produced charcoal from beneath <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> which dates to 700-1200 CE. A cemetery established in <b>the</b> 1850s <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> summit has helped preserve it.|$|R

He sees evangelism as a duty of Christians, and would like to go to seminary when he finishes his baseball career.|$|E
5|$|Houtteman {{remained}} a reliever during the 1956 Cleveland Indians season. He continued to get trade offers in 1956, though, as the Chicago White Sox {{were willing to}} trade outfielder Jim Rivera for him. A three-team, nine-player deal involving Houtteman again {{becoming part of the}} White Sox along with George Strickland was also scrapped at the last second. Houtteman finished the 1956 season having only made 22 appearances <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> earning a 2–2 record. However, he had a high ERA of 6.56, his highest since 1946, when he made one appearance.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{began the}} 2008 {{season as the}} third starter in the Yankees' rotation. In his first six starts, he had an 0–4 record and a 9.00 ERA. On April 30, he {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list with a strained oblique and cracked rib. On a May 2 visit to an optometrist, Hughes was found to be slightly nearsighted; as a result, he started wearing glasses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound.</b>|$|E

5|$|Red Sox closer Foulke came in {{to pitch}} {{the bottom of the}} ninth. Pujols led off the inning by hitting a single through Foulke's legs and into center field. After Foulke induced Rolen into a fly out and struck out Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder's indifference. Édgar Rentería then hit a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound.</b> Foulke threw it underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and secure the series.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the impact of termite <b>mounds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{vegetation}} of mopane (Colophospermum mopane) savanna in Northwestern Namibia. This area is a part of a mopane zone with a high distribution of termite mounds. Much previous research on termite mounds has been conducted in humid tropical areas. Such studies have found termite mounds to have high fertility and thus to be a key factor in vegetation dynamics. Few studies, however, have focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relationship between termite mounds and vegetation in arid or semi-arid areas, and the impact of <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> <b>on</b> savanna vegetation remains unclear. In the area where I conducted research, almost all termite mounds were found together with trees. The composition of tree species <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> reflected <b>the</b> composition in the surrounding vegetation, but Combretum spp. dominated slightly more than other species. The rate of withered trees, especially Terminalia prunioides, was higher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Moreover, termite mounds were extracted as one of the parameters of tree withering from a statistical model analysis using a generalized linear model (GLM). As a result of this study, termite mounds appeared to act as negative factors in vegetation growth <b>on</b> or near <b>the</b> <b>mounds.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mounds</b> should, therefore, be taken into account as one of the factors that disturb vegetation dynamics in mopane savanna...|$|R

5|$|Galehouse {{started off}} {{the game by}} quickly getting outs from Dale Mitchell and Allie Clark. American League MVP Lou Boudreau then hit a solo home run off Galehouse to make the score 1–0. After another out, Bearden came <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> {{in the bottom of}} the first. Johnny Pesky doubled, then scored on a hit by Vern Stephens to make the score 1–1 at the end of the first inning. Both {{pitchers}} allowed one baserunner the following inning; Ken Keltner reached base for Cleveland and Birdie Tebbetts reached base for the Red Sox. Both pitchers then got three quick outs in the third inning.|$|E
50|$|Period I is {{characterized}} by several mounds, mostly artificial, that supported living areas, and by circular ditches, which Sears interpreted as enclosing fields.

5|$|Game three {{was also}} {{held at the}} Polo Grounds. With each team having won one game, {{it was time for}} a matchup between the two teams' ace {{pitchers}}. Sal Maglie was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> for New York, while Brooklyn called on Don Newcombe; both pitchers had winning records against the opposing team heading into the matchup. After Maglie walked two batters in the top of the first inning, Jackie Robinson singled, scoring the game's first run when Pee Wee Reese crossed home plate. No further hits were allowed until the bottom of the second, when Whitey Lockman and Bobby Thomson singled; neither scored, and it remained 1–0 through two innings.|$|E
5|$|Henry II came to {{the throne}} in 1154 and built {{extensively}} at Windsor between 1165 and 1179. Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with a stone wall interspersed with square towers and built the first King's Gate. The first stone keep was suffering from subsidence, and cracks were beginning {{to appear in the}} stonework of the south side. Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in {{from the edge of the}} motte to relieve the pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support. Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation. Bagshot Heath stone was used for most of the work, and stone from Bedfordshire for the internal buildings.|$|E
5|$|Humber was {{assigned}} to start the year with the Omaha Royals of the PCL. On June 10, 2010, while pitching in a game for Omaha, Humber {{was hit in the}} face on a line drive by Luis Cruz. After lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> for a few minutes, he was able to get up and walk on his own to the dugout. He was then transported to a local hospital, where he received eighteen stitches. He earned the second PCL Pitcher of the Week Award of his career for play during the week ending August 1. He won the award based on having posted a complete game 4-hit 7-strikeout shutout against the Nashville Sounds on July 30.|$|E

40|$|Termite mounds {{comprise}} {{a significant part}} of the landscape in northwestern Namibia. The vegetation type in this area is mopane vegetation, a vegetation type unique to southern Africa. In the area where I conducted research, almost all termite mounds coexisted with trees, of which 80 % were mopane. The rate at which trees withered was higher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> termite <b>mounds</b> than outside them, and few saplings, seedlings, or grasses grew <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds,</b> indicating that termite mounds could cause trees to wither and suppress the growth of plants. However, even though termite mounds appeared to have a negative impact on vegetation, they could actually have positive effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> growth of mopane vegetation. Moreover, local people use the soil of termite mounds as construction material, and this utilization may have an effect on vegetation change if they are removing <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> that are inhospitable for the growth of plants. Consequently, both termite mounds and human activities should be taken into account as factors affecting mopane vegetation...|$|R
