25|$|Plant-based, or vegetarian, {{sources of}} Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy {{vegetables}} such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 {{than any other}} known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels <b>of</b> <b>EPA</b> and DHA than meat-eaters. While {{the health effects of}} low levels <b>of</b> <b>EPA</b> and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).|$|E

A purpose-designed questionnaire was mailed to all registered physiotherapists in Australia. A response rate of 27 % was obtained (n= 3, 538).

A total of 1662 adolescents (880 girls; 13. 0 - 18. 5 years) from 5 Spanish cities (Granada, Madrid, Murcia, Santander and Zaragoza) were included in this study. Structure (organised and non-organised) and number <b>of</b> <b>EPAs,</b> and participation at vigorous intensity during EPA were self-reported. Cognitive performance (verbal, numeric and reasoning abilities, and an overall score) was measured with the >SRA-Test of Educational Ability>. Results showed that vigorous EPA was positively associated with all cognitive variables. Adolescents who practiced an organised EPA had higher scores in 3 of the 4 cognitive variables than those who practiced a non-organised EPA (all P < 0. 05).

This report will then analyse the theoretical foundation <b>of</b> the <b>EPAs,</b> {{in order to determine the}} theoretical approach to the goals and means of the agreement. Furthermore, we will analyse the criticism <b>of</b> the <b>EPAs</b> raised by a number of internal sources, in the form of a number of ministers from the Sub-Saharan ACP countries, and external sources, in the form of International NGO’s, in order to determine the reasons behind this criticism.

This study will conclude that the differences between the EPAs and its supporters on one side, and the critics <b>of</b> the <b>EPAs</b> on the other, can be explained by fundamentally different theoretical views on how to best secure the development of the ACP-countries. Furthermore, a lack of resources and assistance of the ACP-countries has hindered the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>EPAs.</b> This leads to the conclusion, that it is not a reluctance to engage in a trade agreement between the EU and ACP that has made the implementations <b>of</b> the <b>EPA’s</b> so difficult, but instead it is the different theoretical views on how to best secure the development of the ACP-countries, as well as the technical difficulties surrounding corporation between two unequal partners, that has hampered the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>EPAs...</b>|$|R
