40|$|A {{successful}} career in {{football is the}} result of the appropriate interaction between different aspects of an individual’s life, since the various areas and phases of one’s life depend on each other. An endogenous causal relationship exists throughout a person’s entire history (Mayer, 1990). In particular, their family, work and sports career must be tuned to each other. The transition from the initial stages of education (compulsory schooling) to vocational training, which coincides with the beginning of the selection for the national youth teams, is a particularly critical phase (Wylleman, Theeboom, & Lavallee, 2004). In order to do justice to the overall life situation of a young sports talent during this transition phase, we have adopted a holistic perspective and follow Bergman, Magnusson and El-Khouri (2003) in using a person-oriented and systemic approach. In doing so, our main focus lies on the person-environment system. This overall system is made up of various subsystems, consisting of several <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> which interact with one another. The different levels to which these <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> are expressed lead to observable patterns, which can be summarised in the form of types. Particularly promising types can therefore be identified and the developmental process can be described. Former players on the Swiss U 16 to U 21 national football teams, born between 1981 and 1987 (n= 159), were interviewed concerning their careers, and the <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> school/vocational training, family support and sports environment were examined. With the help of the LICUR method (Linking of Clusters after removal of Residue) (Bergman et al., 2003), developmental types were identified which were promising in terms of achieving top performance in adulthood. A range of developmental types and anti-types emerge for the transition from the under- 15 phase to the over- 16 phase. One particularly promising type is observed in the over- 16 phase, for which the <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> education, family support and participation in national U 16 to U 18 teams have slightly above-average scores, with scores that are well above average in the sports environment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The framing into demand driven {{operations}} {{is because of}} the operations research modelling approach. The modelling approach requires continuous regressors and an independent response factor. The demand as an operating factor is considered as independent response factor in relation to the continuous regressors. The method validation is made along several longitudinal case studies to cover local, global and international industrial operations. The examined operational scope is from continuous operations to one-off production. Concerning scheduling, these examined demand driven, industrial operations are considered as open and dynamic, flow shop or job-shop operations. The examined managerial scope is from local work management to global industrial operations management. The theoretical framework of this study is based on operations management, productivity and controllability engineering. The strategical target is to improve productivity. The operational target setting is based on linear goal programming, streamlined demand driven material flow and specified <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> according to this study, Forrester effect diagnostics and replenishment models. The engineering of strategical target into exact operational schedule as a task target is hard to accomplish, because of the combinatorial dynamic job-shop problem. The {{purpose of this study is}} to simplify this managerial task. These study <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> are the heart in constructing a Decision Support System for the examined operations, alongside the method’s product flow diagnostics. This operations management method consists of the <b>operating</b> <b>factors,</b> specified in this study and these specified factors’ use in constructing a Decision Support System, by engineering current operations management system. The construct consist two parts. Firstly, the exact operational target alignment along this method diagnostics and secondly, the control mechanism according to this operational linear target.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{capacity}} expansion {{investment decisions}} on the provision of municipal sewerage are the central aspects of this analysis. The purpose is to present a methodology, utilizing a dynamic demand and supply model of sewerage, for recommending a set of values for the investment and pricing decision variables. The outcome of the investment decisions is an economically efficient time sequence of capacity expansions. The pricing decisions involves a departure from an economically efficient set of user charges, i. e. from marginal cost pricing. The model consists of a cost function, i. e. amount of capacity and variable <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> used per period times price; a set of production process equations transforming influent to effluent water quality standards; {{and a set of}} factors affecting influent, cost, and production. The factors taken into consideration are: Economies of size in capacity expansion costs, technological change, inflation, deterioration of capacity and economic life of capacity, discounting to present value, time horizon of model, changes in effluent water quality standards, and changes in the flow of influent due to an increase in users, price elasticity of the flow of influent and changes in water consumptive habits, formation of substitutes through technological change, as well as rainstorm drainage and infiltration. It is the investment decisions on timing of capacity expansions and mix of capacity types in each expansion which are of concern. These investment decisions must be considered simultaneously with those on economic amortization of capacity expansion costs and economic life of capacity, as well as use of, variable <b>operating</b> <b>factors</b> in the production process. Furthermore consideration for pricing in terms of user charges is given. By simultaneously solving a set of necessary marginal conditions associated with the investment decision variables and use of variable <b>operating</b> <b>factors,</b> the timing of capacity expansions and mix of capacity types in each expansion may be derived. With the existence of several capacity types, several variable <b>operating</b> <b>factors,</b> numerous feasible times for a capacity expansion, and a set of complex equations representing the production process; the use of a simulation analysis is imperative. Formulation of a simulation model should be {{on the basis of the}} equations developed in this analysis.

This type of measure can also assist external stakeholders, such as the hotel guests and regulatory entities, to gauge hotels’ environmental sustainability efforts. This report presents the results of an exploratory study that develops such a measure, using resource consumption records of 984 U. S. hotels over a period of eight years. The measure is based on an analysis of resource consumption–related expenses found in these hotels’ year-end operating statements, for electricity, water and sewer, maintenance other expenses, and laundry, linen, and supplies for both the rooms and for food and beverage services. Using a multivariate data analysis technique called exploratory factor analysis, the measure developed in the study consists of two parts: an <b>operating</b> <b>factor</b> that comprises large weights from electricity, water and sewer, and maintenance expenses, and a behavioral factor, which is largely driven by laundry, linen, and supplies for both rooms and F 2 ̆ 6 B operations.

By normalizing the average of each of these two factors at zero, hotels that score above zero on each factor are spending more than other hotels, and those with a score below zero are more efficient than others. These factors can be compared according to various hotel characteristics, such as chain segment, the involvement of a third-party professional management company in the operating structure, location (both in terms of the degree of urbanization and climate zone), and whether the hotel offers F 2 ̆ 6 B service.
