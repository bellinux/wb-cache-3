40|$|Abstract. The Stardust Mission {{collected}} {{samples from}} Comet 81 P/Wild 2 on 2 Jan 2004 and returned these samples to Earth on 15 Jan 2006. After recovery, a six month preliminary examination {{was done on}} a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> samples. Studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> in <b>the</b> samples were made by <b>the</b> <b>Organics</b> Preliminary Examination Team (PET) - a worldwide group of over 55 scientists. This paper provides a brief overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Organics</b> PET. <b>Organics</b> in <b>the</b> samples were studied using a multitude of analytical techniques including spatial deter-mination of C and heteroatom elemental abundances (STXM), functional group identification (micro-FTIR/Raman, C,N,O-XANES), and specific molecular identification of certain classes of organics (HPLC-LIF, L 2 MS, TOF-SIMS). Analyses were also made of spacecraft components and environmental samples collected near the recovered returned capsule to assess contami-nation issues. <b>The</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> (abundance, functionality, and relative elemental abundances of C,N,O) is heterogeneous both within and between particles. They are an un-equilibrated reservoir that experienced little parent body processing after incorporation into <b>the</b> comet. Some <b>organics</b> look like those seen in IDPs (and to a lesser extent, meteorites), while new aromatic-poor and highly labile organics, not seen in meteoritic materials, are also present. <b>The</b> <b>organics</b> are O,N-rich compared to meteoritic <b>organics.</b> Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> have an interstellar heritage, as evidenced by D and 15 N enrichments...|$|R

5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E

50|$|Decontamination {{of water}} with {{photocatalysis}} and adsorption: the removal and destruction of organic contaminants in groundwater can be addressed through <b>the</b> impregnation <b>of</b> adsorbents with photoactive catalysts. These adsorbents attract contaminating organic atoms/molecules like tetrachloroethylene to them. The photoactive catalysts impregnated inside speed up <b>the</b> degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organics.</b> Adsorbents are placed in packed beds for 18 hours, which would attract and degrade <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> compounds. <b>The</b> spent adsorbents would then be placed in regeneration fluid, essentially taking away all organics still attached by passing hot water counter-current to <b>the</b> flow <b>of</b> water during <b>the</b> adsorption process {{to speed up the}} reaction.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{existence}} <b>of</b> an ‘organics iceberg’ is {{a hypothesis}} {{rather than a}} fact. Nevertheless, reports in <b>The</b> World <b>of</b> <b>Organic</b> Agriculture that there are 37, 245, 686 certified organic hectares worldwide and that this accounts for 0. 86 % of global agriculture are lower bounds, in fact underestimates, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size and <b>the</b> achievements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> movement. While such statistics are seductively precise, they are merely <b>the</b> countable manifestation <b>of</b> a larger phenomenon, and perhaps a much larger phenomenon, which may be - an organics iceberg. Just how large is <b>the</b> uncounted ‘world <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> agriculture’, as compared to <b>the</b> counted world <b>of</b> certified organic agriculture, {{is a matter of}} speculation, but its existence is doubtless. In a recent study in India comparing <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> farmers and chemical farmers, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 350 <b>organic</b> farmers lacked certification. A fortress <b>organics</b> mentality denies <b>the</b> reality that there are many reasons to be non-certified organic, and they include cost, access, and size of operation, lack of market advantage, and there is a plethora of other reasons including independence, privacy, bother, paper-work, intrusion, bio-security, and farm sovereignty. Black-letter organics has its place, but it is a place at <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> table and it is not the whole table. Consumers can differentiate between ‘organic’ and ‘certified organic’. In a study of Australian consumers half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> price premium was attributed to the ‘organic’ claim and half was attributed to the ‘certified’ claim. <b>The</b> captain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Titanic, Edward Smith, may have wondered “Perhaps there is an iceberg?” In <b>The</b> World <b>of</b> <b>Organic</b> Agriculture, we may be getting a good view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip but how much ‘berg’ are we disregarding?

5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral reefs {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, because much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels {{of the food chain}} and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The kukersite {{oil shale}} of Ordovician age in Estonia {{is part of}} the Baltic oil shale basin and was {{deposited}} in shallow marine basins. The deposit is one of the world’s highest-grade deposits with more than 40% organic content and 66% conversion ratio into shale oil and gas. The oil shale is located in a single calcareous layer 2.5–3meters in thickness and is buried at depths from 7 to 100m. The total area of the basin is about 3,000km2. Oil yield from Kukersite is 30 to 47%. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> matter is derived from the fossil green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca, which has affinities to the modern cyanobacterium, Entophysalis major, an extant species that forms algal mats in inter-tidal to very shallow subtidal waters. Matrix minerals include low-magnesium calcite, dolomite, and siliciclastic minerals. It is not enriched in heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species.
