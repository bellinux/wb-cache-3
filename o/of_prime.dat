40|$|A {{study of}} the problem of {{recognizing}} the set <b>of</b> <b>primes</b> by automata is presented. A simple algebraic condition is derived which shows that neither the set <b>of</b> <b>primes</b> nor any infinite subset <b>of</b> <b>primes</b> can be accepted by a pushdown or finite automaton. In view of this result an interesting open problem is to determine the "weakest" automaton which can accept the set <b>of</b> <b>primes.</b> It is shown that the linearly bounded automaton can accept the set <b>of</b> <b>primes,</b> and it is conjectured that no automaton whose memory grows less rapidly can recognize the set <b>of</b> <b>primes.</b> One <b>of</b> the results shows that if this conjecture is true, it cannot be proved by the use of arguments about the distribution <b>of</b> <b>primes,</b> as described by the Prime Number Theorem. Some relations are established between two classical conjectures in number theory and the minimal rate of memory growth of automata which can recognize the set <b>of</b> <b>primes...</b>|$|R

Combining the theorem of Green and Tao on long arithmetic progressions <b>of</b> <b>primes</b> and estimates <b>of</b> exponential sums, we show that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions <b>of</b> <b>primes</b> on the nose.
