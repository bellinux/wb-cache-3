5|$|The Louisiana Purchase {{doubled the}} size of the United States, and today forms much of the center of the country. Desirous of honoring the centennial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase,</b> Congress passed authorizing {{legislation}} for an exposition; the bill was signed by President William McKinley on March 3, 1901.

5|$|The {{suggestion}} that the entire amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> money was not paid, and that such fact is {{in the way of}} supporting the claim to the Indian title, is not sustained. We are not called upon to consider the effect of default in payment of any portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> money. The treaty recites the payment of it, and as no such question seems ever before to have been raised, or full payment questioned, either by government or the Indians, it must at this late day be assumed, until the contrary is quite clearly made to appear, that the contract in that respect was performed.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to propose a {{framework}} for analysing the contextual influence on <b>the</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> processes for freight transport services. A conceptual model suggests that three contextual dimensions, purchase task, importance, and service type, influence <b>the</b> different stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process. Data from seven case companies are used to explore the links between contextual factors and how <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> freight transport is performed. Eight different types of context, and their implications for <b>the</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process, are presented. The framework offers guidance on <b>the</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process in specific contexts, highlighting, for example, that <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> detail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specification stage can depend on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> context...|$|R
40|$|Companies {{purchasing}} {{freight transport}} services may through <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process restrict or create opportunities for how transport service providers deliver the transport service. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this thesis {{is to explore}} how <b>the</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport services can influence <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> CO 2 emissions. This thesis is a compilation of three papers based on empirical data, collected mainly through interviews in three multiple-case studies. The results include descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport services. Influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual dimensions <b>purchase</b> task, importance, and service type on <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport is discussed, and eight different types of contexts and their implications for <b>the</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process are presented. Relationships between <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport and logistical variables, related to CO 2 emissions, are identified. In particular, time requirements and information sharing are highlighted as important underlying aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationships. Different configurations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport services facilitate or hinder consideration <b>of</b> such aspects. <b>The</b> results lead to increased understanding of how contextual variables influence <b>the</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process. <b>The</b> results also contribute to theory on reducing negative effects of freight transport on the environment, by connecting practices to logistical variables {{that are related to}} CO 2 emissions, combining a purchasing process model with an existing framework that depicts the relationship between logistics and environmental effects. The results can be used by companies purchasing freight transport to support discussions aiming to reduce CO 2 emissions...|$|R

5|$|Due to the team's struggles, Huggins made {{personnel}} {{changes during}} the offseason. The Yankees attempted to trade Pipp to another American League team, {{but could not}} agree on the terms with any team. They put Pipp on waivers, and he was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, who reportedly paid the Yankees a greater sum than the $7,500 waiver price. The Reds, who {{had not had a}} strong starting first baseman since Jake Daubert died in 1924, had attempted to acquire Bill Terry from the Giants, but refused to part with Edd Roush in the transaction, and so acquired Pipp instead.

5|$|More than 175 {{people showed}} up for a rancorous public hearing over the {{purchase}} on April6, 2011. During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income from the entire property was {{much less than the}} cost of renting part of it for parking. Residents brought up several issues, such as the liability the town would assume from falling rocks, and sinkholes. Other issues discussed were the lack of road access to the parking lot, and whether the property should be used commercially. An individual living adjacent to the property, Brett Hansen, expressed a strong desire to buy it and build additional parking lots, as well as an amphitheater. Proponents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with Main Street, and how property values near the mountain would increase. The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3–2 vote on April13.|$|E

40|$|In recent discussions it {{frequently}} occurs that <b>the</b> <b>Purchasing</b> Power Parity Theory {{is identified}} with Jevons law of one price.

In the present paper it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>Purchasing</b> Power Parity Theory in the relative sense holds even in a world without international trade in goods and that <b>the</b> propositions <b>of</b> that version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Purchasing</b> Power Parity Theory {{are not related to}} international trade in goods but are implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantity theory <b>of</b> money. Although on occasion oral references to this result are made, formal and rigorous demonstrations of its validity seem not to be available. <b>The</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Purchasing</b> Power Parity Theory in a world without international trade of goods is symmetric to the finding that interest rate parity to hold does not presuppose international capital movements...|$|R

5|$|Portland was platted in 1845, then Daniel H. Lownsdale {{purchased}} land {{south and}} west of the original platting. He drew up a plat in 1848 that included 11 narrow blocks, 100×200 feet, instead of the standard 200×200 feet. He then brought on Stephen Coffin and William W. Chapman as partners, and dedicated the South Park Blocks and midtown park blocks in 1852. This made them the first official greenspace in Portland. While they were dedicated to the city, they weren't owned by the city until September 22, 1870, when Mayor Bernard Goldsmith and Chapman agreed on selling the South Park Blocks and the two Plaza Blocks (Chapman and Lownsdale Squares) to the city for $6,250. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> price was for the Plaza Blocks, since the park blocks were {{at the edge of}} the developed city.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century salt {{evaporation}} ponds were dug in tidal marshes {{around the}} bay, producing salt for condiments {{and to be}} used as a preservative for meats. Today, due to the bay's location, east of Goose Island State Park and west of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, very little industry can be found. No industrial plants are located on the bay's shore, but a few gas and oil wells are present. The Continental Oil Company is allowed to obtain oil and gas from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> of St. Charles Ranch. Goose Island offers a few piers and campgrounds facing the bay, which encourage tourism. The privately owned St. Charles Bay Hunting Club is also found in this area, and allows hunting, boating and fishing on the bay, while striving to protect the ecosystem. The lack of coastal winds also attracts tourists interested in kayaking and wadefishing, however, boating is hindered by the general shallowness of the bay and the abundance of oyster reefs. Shellfish production is approved throughout the bay, but shrimping is prohibited due to the classification of St. Charles Bay as a nursery bay.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s the RNZAF {{considered}} options to replace or upgrade its A-4Ks. A team of senior RNZAF personnel visited France, the United Kingdom and the United States to assess new aircraft, and the New Zealand Government released a tender in May 1982 seeking proposals {{to upgrade the}} Skyhawks. After {{the decision was made}} to disband the RAN's fighter force, the Australian Government offered the ten surviving A-4Gs and spare parts for these aircraft to New Zealand for $NZ40 million. The Cabinet of New Zealand gave the RNZAF authority to begin formal discussions of this deal on 5 September 1983. A team of Air Force personnel inspected the A-4Gs at Albatross in November that year and judged that they were in generally good condition. The commander of the RNZAF, Air Vice-Marshal David Crooks, favoured purchasing the A-4Gs and then upgrading the entire A-4 fleet over the alternative of buying new aircraft, as this option was the cheapest way to improve the Air Force's capabilities. He recommended to Prime Minister Rob Muldoon that the deal be taken up, and a decision to acquire the aircraft was made in May 1984. As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> agreement, the New Zealand Government committed to return one of the Skyhawks to Australia for display after the type was retired from service.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{after eight}} years of private operation, the Pillsbury Company {{acquired}} the Burger King brand and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase,</b> the chain had grown to 274 restaurants in the United States. Pillsbury continued to grow the company utilizing the existing franchise system despite its flaws. The power of its independent franchises came to a head in 1973 when Chart House, owner of 350 restaurants and one of its largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100million (USD) which Pillsbury declined. When Chart House's bid failed, its owners Billy and Jimmy Trotter put forth a second plan that would require Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company. Again Pillsbury declined the proposed divestiture. After the failed attempts to acquire the company, the relationship with Chart House and the Trotters soured; when Chart House purchased several restaurants in Boston and Houston in 1979, Burger King sued the selling franchisees for failing to comply with the right of first refusal clause in their contracts. Burger King won the case, successfully preventing the sale. The two parties did eventually reach a settlement where Chart House kept the Houston locations in their portfolio. Chart House eventually spun off its Burger King holdings and refocused on its higher end chains; its Burger King holding company, DiversiFoods, was eventually acquired by Pillsbury $390million (USD) in 1984 and folded into Burger King's operations.|$|E

This again has caused a great increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> volume and therewith a higher impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> organisations to <b>the</b> company's profit. In addition many companies are suffering from a high cost pressure and therefore are forced to identify and realize potentials for cost reduction together with their suppliers.
