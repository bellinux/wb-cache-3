5|$|Finn pursues Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), {{trying to}} explain to her that {{he does not want to}} hurt her. However, Flame Princess, {{confused}} by Finn's aversion to fire, assumes that he merely wants to taunt her. She ventures to the Goblin Kingdom, intent <b>on</b> <b>turning</b> it into her new domain. Finn and Jake, meanwhile, return to the tree fort and, with the help of N.E.P.T.R. (voiced by Andy Milonakis), build flame-retardant battle robots.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recognized}} motor {{signs and}} symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as festination (rapid shuffling steps and a forward-flexed posture when walking with no flexed arm swing). Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem to get stuck to the floor, especially <b>on</b> <b>turning</b> or changing direction), a slurred monotonous quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.|$|E
5|$|A {{featured}} preliminary match <b>on</b> <b>Turning</b> Point's {{card was}} for the TNA X Division Championship, in which the champion, Petey Williams, defended the championship against Chris Sabin. The match was promoted for Turning Point on the November 12 episode of Impact!. In the weeks leading to the encounter, Sabin stated {{he had found a}} counter to Williams' finishing maneuver the Canadian Destroyer, which was thought to be uncounterable. The Canadian Destroyer involves Williams grabbing an opponent with his legs around their head, jumping over their back, causing them to perform a backflip, and forcing their head into the mat after they make the full rotation. Making true to his word, Sabin countered the move three times before Turning Point; one on the November 12, one of the November 19, and the last on the November 30 episodes of Impact!.|$|E
25|$|There was severe {{criticism}} from drivers about track conditions.

5|$|Route64 was {{designated}} originally as an alignment of Route31A, a spur off of State Highway Route31 (currently U.S. Route206) from Princeton eastward to Hightstown, where it met State Highway Route33. The state planned <b>on</b> <b>turning</b> the alignment into a full-fledged expressway for several decades, including constructing the alignment that Route 64 currently uses in 1939. The route was amended in 1941, and was renumbered from Route31A to Route64 in the 1953 renumbering. Route 64 was proposed {{to become part}} of the PrincetonHightstown Bypass (later designated New Jersey Route92), but completion never occurred. Currently, the route remains the bridge over the Northeast Corridor. However, it is not currently planned that Route64 will receive an extension of sorts from the proposed Penns Neck Bypass to U.S. Route1, a proposed realignment of County routes 526 and 571.|$|E
5|$|With India {{opting to}} field two spinners and two pacemen <b>on</b> <b>turning</b> {{tracks in the}} home Test series against Pakistan in late 2007, Pathan missed the first two Tests as Zaheer and Rudra Pratap Singh were the fast bowlers chosen. In the meantime, he took 11 wickets at 23.81 and scored 90 runs at 30.00 in two Ranji Trophy matches. Injury to both Zaheer and Singh in his colleagues {{resulted}} in his recall for the Third Test at Bangalore. Pathan scored his maiden Test century, reaching the mark with a six from leg spinner Danish Kaneria to move from 96 to 102 with only last man, paceman Ishant Sharma left to accompany him, before holing out in the same over. He made 21 not out in the second innings but was unpenetrative with the ball, taking a total of 1/110 as the tourists hung on for a draw.|$|E
5|$|With {{funding from}} the Office of Naval Research, Rainwater built a synchrotron, which became {{operational}} in 1950, at the Nevis Laboratories, on an estate on the Hudson River at Irvington, New York, willed to Columbia University by the DuPont family. He became a full professor in 1952 and {{was the director of}} Nevis Laboratories from 1951 to 1954 and again from 1957 to 1961. He worked with his student Val Fitch on studies of muonic atoms, atoms where an electron is replaced by a muon. After 1965, he worked <b>on</b> <b>turning</b> the Nevis synchrotron into a meson facility. When a reporter rang in 1975 to inform him that he had won the Nobel Prize in Physics, he initially thought that it was for his work on muonic atoms. Several hours passed before he discovered that it was for his was for his work on atomic structure, the Nobel Prize being shared with Bohr and Mottelson.|$|E

25|$|In 1975 the {{functioning}} of oncoviruses was clarified considerably. Until that time, {{it was thought that}} these viruses carried certain genes called oncogenes which, when inserted into the host's genome, would cause cancer. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus showed that the oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus is in fact not specific to the virus but is contained in the genome of healthy animals of many species. The oncovirus can switch this pre-existing benign proto-oncogene <b>on,</b> <b>turning</b> it into a true oncogene that causes cancer.|$|E
