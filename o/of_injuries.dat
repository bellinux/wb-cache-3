5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.|$|E

30|$|The LR {{results also}} showed the {{physical}} {{factors that influence}} the degree <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> Which are Respiration Rate (RR) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP). The higher Respiration Rate (RR) indicated the degree <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> is lighter. On the contrary, the lower Respiration Rate (RR) indicated the degree <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> is rising. While, the higher Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) explained the degree <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> is lighter, and the lower level of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) explained the degree <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> level increase.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Incomplete {{external}} cause <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> (E) coding {{limits the}} usefulness of hospital discharge data sets for injury surveillance and research. Hospital medical records were examined {{to determine whether they}} contained adequate cause <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> documentation to allow for more complete E coding <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> discharges. METHODS: Medical records for a sample of discharges involving a principal diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> from the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set for Rhode Island were selected. We assigned E codes to these discharges and compared our E codes with those of the discharge data set. RESULTS: Documentation <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> in the medical records was sufficient to allow assignment of a specific E code to 70 % <b>of</b> the <b>injuries</b> for which no E codes or vague E codes were submitted on the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set. It was estimated that specific cause <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> documentation is available in the medical records of 80 % <b>of</b> all <b>injury</b> discharges in Rhode Island; for approximately 90 %, an E code describing at least the broad cause <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> could be assigned. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of E coding can be substantially increased by making better use of existing documentation in medical records...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars).
