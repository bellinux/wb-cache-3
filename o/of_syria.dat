5|$|Abu Nidal {{began to}} move his {{organization}} out <b>of</b> <b>Syria</b> to Libya {{in the summer of}} 1986, arriving there in March 1987. In June that year the Syrian government expelled him, {{in part because of the}} Hindawi affair and Pan Am Flight 73 hijacking.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Saladin in 1193, his sons contested control of the sultanate, but Saladin's brother al-Adil became the {{paramount}} Ayyubid sultan in 1200, {{and all of the}} later Ayyubid sultans of Egypt were his descendants. In the 1230s, the emirs <b>of</b> <b>Syria</b> attempted to assert their independence from Egypt and the Ayyubid realm remained divided until Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored its unity by conquering most <b>of</b> <b>Syria,</b> except Aleppo, by 1247. By then, local Muslim dynasties had driven out the Ayyubids from Yemen, the Hejaz and parts of Mesopotamia. After his death in 1249, as-Salih Ayyub was succeeded in Egypt by al-Mu'azzam Turanshah. However, the latter was soon overthrown by the Mamluk generals who had repelled a Crusader invasion of the Nile Delta. This effectively ended Ayyubid power in Egypt; attempts by the emirs <b>of</b> <b>Syria,</b> led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo, to wrest back Egypt failed. In 1260, the Mongols sacked Aleppo and conquered the Ayyubids' remaining territories soon after. The Mamluks, who expelled the Mongols, maintained the Ayyubid principality of Hama until deposing its last ruler in 1341.|$|E

5|$|Because of the massacre, around 6,200 Assyrians left Nineveh Plains {{immediately}} for {{the neighbouring}} French Mandate <b>of</b> <b>Syria,</b> and were later joined by 15,000 refugees the following years.

5|$|Gaza {{was granted}} to Herod the Great by Roman emperor Augustus in 30 BCE, where it formed a {{separate}} unit within his kingdom; and Cosgabar, {{the governor of}} Idumea, {{was in charge of}} the city's affairs. On the division of Herod's kingdom, it was placed under the proconsul <b>of</b> <b>Syria.</b> After Herod's death in 4 BCE, Augustus annexed it to the Province <b>of</b> <b>Syria.</b> In 66 CE, Gaza was burned down by Jews during their rebellion against the Romans. However, it remained an important city; even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus the following year. Titus passed through Gaza on his march toward to Jerusalem, and again in his return. The establishment of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea restored trade links with Petra and Aila.|$|E
5|$|Judea {{was added}} to the {{province}} <b>of</b> <b>Syria</b> when Augustus deposed Herod Archelaus, successor to client king Herod the Great (73–4BC). Syria (like Egypt after Antony) was governed by a high prefect of the equestrian class rather than by a proconsul or legate of Augustus.|$|E

5|$|Nasib al-Bakri (1888–1966) was a Syrian {{politician}} and nationalist {{leader in the}} first half of the 20th century. He played a major role in establishing al-Fatat, an underground organization which sought the independence and unity of the Ottoman Empire's Arab territories. As the chief envoy between al-Fatat and the Hejaz-based Hashemites, al-Bakri became a close aide to Emir Faisal when the latter became King <b>of</b> <b>Syria</b> following the success of the 1916 Arab Revolt. Al-Bakri opposed the establishment of the French Mandate <b>of</b> <b>Syria</b> and became one of the chief commanders of the Great Syrian Revolt, leading the rebels' brief capture of Damascus. He escaped a death warrant in Syria in 1927, but returned the following year after being amnestied.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{proceeded}} by conquering Samaria, killing {{most of the}} Ayyubid garrison in Nablus, {{and then}} advanced south, as far as Gaza, unhindered. An-Nasir Yusuf was soon captured by the Mongols and used to persuade the garrison at Ajlun to capitulate. Afterward, the junior Ayyubid governor of Banyas allied with the Mongols, who had now gained control of most <b>of</b> <b>Syria</b> and al-Jazira, effectively ending Ayyubid power in the region. On 3 September 1260, the Egypt-based Mamluk army led by Qutuz and Baibars challenged Mongol authority and decisively defeated their forces in the Battle of Ain Jalut, outside of Zir'in in the Jezreel Valley. Five days later, the Mamluks took Damascus and within a month, most <b>of</b> <b>Syria</b> was in Bahri Mamluk hands. Meanwhile, an-Nasir Yusuf was killed in captivity.|$|E

5|$|After being {{recalled}} from Germania, Germanicus celebrated {{a triumph}} in Rome in AD17, {{the first full}} triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29BC.

Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor <b>of</b> <b>Syria,</b> of poisoning him.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{expulsion}} of the Fatimids from Egypt, al-Ikhshid had his troops occupy all <b>of</b> <b>Syria</b> up to Aleppo, allying himself, as Ibn Tulun had done, with the local tribe of Banu Kilab to strengthen his hold over northern Syria. As governor <b>of</b> <b>Syria,</b> his remit extended to the borderlands (thughur) with the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Thus in 936/7 or 937/8 (most likely in autumn 937) he received an embassy from the Byzantine emperor, Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944), to organize a prisoner exchange. Although {{carried out in the}} name of Caliph al-Radi, it was a special honour and an implicit recognition of al-Ikhshid's autonomy, since correspondence and negotiations for such events were normally directed to the caliph rather than provincial governors. The exchange took place in autumn 938, resulting in the release of 6,300 Muslims for an equivalent number of Byzantine captives. As the Byzantines held 800 more prisoners than the Muslims, these had to be ransomed and were gradually released over the next six months.|$|E
5|$|Gerrha – {{inhabited}} by Chaldean exiles from Babylon – controlled the Incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and exercised {{control over the}} trading of aromatics to Babylon in the 1st century BCE. The Nabateans exercised control over the routes along the Incense Route, and their hold was challenged – without success – by Antigonus Cyclops, emperor <b>of</b> <b>Syria.</b> The Nabatean control over trade further increased and spread in many directions.|$|E
5|$|Having {{pushed the}} Crusaders out of most <b>of</b> <b>Syria,</b> the Ayyubids {{generally}} adopted {{a policy of}} peace with them. The war with the Crusaders did not prevent Muslims under Ayyubid governance from developing good commercial relations with European states.
