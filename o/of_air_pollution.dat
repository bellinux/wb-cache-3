5|$|The {{incomplete}} combustion {{of fossil}} fuels (such as diesel) and wood releases black carbon into the air. Though black carbon, most of which is soot, is an extremely small component <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> at land surface levels, the phenomenon has a significant heating effect on the atmosphere at altitudes above two kilometers (6,562ft).

5|$|Mining {{oil shale}} {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. These include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals including mercury into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities. In 2002, about 97% <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution,</b> 86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the power industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked.

5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> is poorly vented heating and cooking fires.
