40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} historical human impact on the expansion of European oak stands in the past through scientific publications and to find existing limitations that affect the oak recovery ability. The European historical forest is characterized by coppicing, of which origins {{date back to the}} Neolithic period. The coppice featured vegetative renewal, in the coppice with standards there were left standards of the generative origin, often oaks. Both forms have a very long tradition in European countries. People used the sprouting capacity and the quick regeneration of oak especially for construction purposes and their need for firewood. Acorns secured the source of food for pig farming. Based on for example the ring width or pollen analysis, current methods of research permit {{to assess the impact of}} active management on the oak stands and outline the structure of primeval forests. It turned out that coppicing has a positive effect on the increment of oak standards and that the open landscape with a rich diversity of species, which features a picture of a primeval forest, was always maintained especially by a man starting forest fires. Since the mid- 20 th century, it was gradually transferred to the high shape of the wood, which favors generative way to recovery, and thus monocultures of often coniferous trees are created. Oak is currently health endangered tree species and its recovery is negatively affected by grazing deer (browsing), the influence of abrupt climate change, weed, pathogenic fungi of the genus Phytophthora, oak powdery mildew (Microsphaera alphitoides), tracheomycotic diseases or larvae of winter moth (Operophtera Brumata) and green <b>oak</b> <b>moth</b> (Tortrix viridana). Finally, it is inappropriately selected management that is not based on the rich history of this species and doesn´t preserve its characteristic natural properties...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the iconic}} {{association}} of palms with semi-arid regions, most are introduced and can invade natural areas. Along the San Diego River (San Diego, California, USA), the introduced Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) forms dense patches among native riparian shrubs like arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis). The structural {{differences between the}} palm and native shrubs are visually obvious, but {{little is known about}} palm’s effects on the ecosystem. We tested for the effects of the palm on a riparian invertebrate community in June 2011 by comparing the faunal and environmental variables associated with palm and willow canopies, trunks and ground beneath each species. The palm invertebrate community had lower abundance and diversity, fewer taxa feeding on the host (e. g., specialized hemipterans), and more taxa likely using only the plant’s physical structure (e. g., web-builders, <b>oak</b> <b>moths,</b> willow hemipterans). There were no observed effects on the ground-dwelling fauna. Faunal differences were due to the physical and trophic changes associated with palm presence, namely increased canopy density, unpalatable leaves, trunk rugosity, and litter accumulations. Palm presence and resulting community shifts may have further ecosystem-level effects through alteration of physical properties, food, and structural resources. These results were consistent with a recent study of invasive palm effects on desert spring arthropods, illustrating that effects may be relatively generalizable. Since spread of the palm is largely localized, but effects are dramatic where it does occur, we recommend combining our results with several further investigations in order to prioritize managemen...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{modifications in}} winter and spring temperature conditions may affect the survival of a spring-hatching Lepidoptera, the <b>oak</b> processionary <b>moth</b> Thaumetopoea processionea. Supercooling and chilling injury experiments indicate that eggs are especially cold hardy {{at the start of}} the winter period, although this ability is reduced later in the season. In the spring, young larvae are sufficiently cold hardy to ensure no direct mortality as a result of late frosts. A comparison of phenological models shows that neonate larvae may await the unfolding of new oak leaves for relatively long periods (e. g. 1 - 30 days). Under both low (4 °C after 5 days at 16 °C) and high temperature experimental scenarios (constant 16 °C), the majority of neonate larvae can survive starvation for more than 2 weeks. Larvae may also suffer from food depletion once their development has been initiated (e. g. during cold springs) if the threshold temperature for feeding is not reached for several consecutive days, or in the case of late frosts affecting foliage availability. When temperature is reduced to 4 °C, developing larvae become inactive and do not feed anymore; their starvation survival capability is reduced to approximately 2 weeks (cold spring hypothesis). At 16 °C, developing larvae that are deprived of food can only survive for 10 days (late frost hypothesis). We conclude that, in the <b>oak</b> processionary <b>moth,</b> neonate larvae are relatively well adapted to early hatching relative to budburst, ensuring them the highest foliage quality for development. In some years, however, phenological asynchrony or cold spring conditions may affect the persistence of populations at the limits of the species' range. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|AbstractAn {{artificial}} diet {{comprised of}} pig liver and tuna fish but devoid of insect components {{was developed for}} continuous rearing of the predator Arma chinensis Fallou. Our results demonstrated less desirable biological parameters in A. chinensis reared on this artificial diet compared to a secondary prey, pupae of Chinese <b>oak</b> silk <b>moth</b> Antheraea pernyi Guérin-Méneville. Weight of eggs and adults, fecundity and egg viability were lower for diet-fed A. chinensis compared to A. chinensis reared on pupae of A. pernyi. Developmental time from 2 nd instar to adult and the preovipositional period were significantly longer for diet-fed A. chinensis. Cannibalism was also higher with diet-fed A. chinensis. Over successive generations of rearing on the diet some of the characteristics improved, such as developmental time, survival from 2 nd instar to adult, sex ratio (♂:♀), adult weight, fecundity and fertility. These changes may indicate that the predators experience some degree of adaptation to, or genetic selection for, the diet after several consecutive generations. There were no changes in developmental time of egg and 1 st instar, or survival from 1 st to 2 nd instar with successive generations reared on the artificial diet. However, diet-fed adults did live longer than pupae-fed adults...|$|R
