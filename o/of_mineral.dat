5|$|Geophagy, the {{practice}} of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans.

Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.|$|E

5|$|Suillus americanus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, a mutualistic relationship {{where the}} fungus forms a sheath {{on the surface}} of the root from which hyphae extend outward into the soil, and inwards between the cortical cells with which they interface to form a Hartig net.
