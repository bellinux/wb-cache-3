For all Catholic schools and most other religious schools, {{a letter from the}} priest of the student's <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>parent's</b> parish is required for preferential enrolment, and obtaining such a letter usually requires a certain commitment to the religion, e.g. Catholic priests usually require a minimum of the student's (or at least one of <b>their</b> <b>parent's)</b> baptism into the Catholic faith. Schools may admit a limited number of non-preference students (usually no more than 5-10% of their total roll) after all preferential enrolments, up to the maximum school roll set in the school's integration agreement.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a debate}} during the 2010 campaign, O'Malley {{referred}} to undocumented immigrants as [...] "new Americans" [...] while endorsing stricter enforcement against undocumented immigration {{by the federal}} government.

2500|$|There are no university-sponsored {{scholarships}} in Germany, but {{a number}} of private and public institutions award scholarships—usually to cover living costs and books. There is a state-funded study loan programme, called BAföG (Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz, [...] "Federal Education Aid Act"). It ensures that less wealthy students can receive up to €649 per month for the standard period of study if they <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> cannot afford all of the costs involved with studying. Furthermore, students need to have a prospect of remaining in Germany to be eligible; this includes German and EU citizens, but often also long-term residents of other countries. Part (typically half) of this money is an interest-free loan that is later repaid, with the other half considered a free grant, and the amount to be repaid is capped at €10,000. Currently, around a quarter of all students in Germany receive financial support via BAföG.|$|E

2500|$|The Education Amendment Act 2000, {{enacted by}} the Fifth Labour Government, {{partially}} solved this problem by putting in place a new [...] "system for determining enrolment of students in circumstances where a school has reached its roll capacity and needs to avoid overcrowding." [...] Schools which operate enrolment schemes have a geographically defined [...] "home zone". Residence in this zone, or in the school's boarding house (if it has one) gives right of entry to the School. Students who live outside the school's home zone can be admitted, if there are places available, {{in the following order}} of priority: special programmes; siblings of currently enrolled students; siblings of past students; children of past students; children of board employees and staff; all other students. If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a randomly drawn ballot. The system is complicated by some state schools having boarding facilities for students living beyond the school's zone. Typically these students live in isolated farming regions in New Zealand, <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> may live or work partly overseas.

2500|$|Starting in 1902, Quaker Oats oatmeal boxes {{came with}} a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford. The lots, {{sometimes}} as small as [...] by 10 feet, were carved out of a [...] tract in a never-built subdivision called [...] "Liberty Park". A small number of children (<b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents),</b> often residents living near Milford, collected the deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the [...] "oatmeal lots". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several lots {{would need to be}} combined before building could start. Since the subdivision into small lots predated Milford's planning and zoning regulations, the deeds were entirely legal, although they created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from the lots.In the mid-1970s, when the town wanted to develop the area, town officials {{put an end to the}} oatmeal lots in a [...] "general foreclosure" [...] that avoided the enormous expense of individual foreclosures by condemning nearly all of the property in one legal filing.

The site is currently home to the BIC Corporation's lighter factory at 565 Bic Drive.

A very large proportion of the present population of New York is of New England origin. Perhaps one-third have this extraction, either as born there, or as the sons or grandsons of those who were. Now, in New England generally, great equality of condition exists, more especially when you rise above the lower classes; there being very few, out of the large trading towns, who would be deemed rich in New York, and scarcely {{such a thing as a}} large landholder at all. The relation of landlord and tenant, as connected with what we should term estates, is virtually unknown to New England; though Maine may afford some exceptions. This circumstance is owing to the peculiar origin of the people, and to the fact that emigration has so long carried off the surplus population; the bulk of those who remain being able to possess freeholds. There is a natural antipathy in men who have been educated in such a state of society to anything that seems to place others in positions they do not and cannot occupy themselves. Now, while the population of New York may be one-third, perhaps, of New England descent, and consequently more or less of New England notions, a much larger proportion of the lawyers, editors of newspapers, physicians, and active politicians, are of that class. We think little, and talk little of these circumstances; for no nation inquires into its moral influences, and what I may call its political statistics, less than the Americans; but they produce large consequences." ...|$|E
