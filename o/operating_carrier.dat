50|$|At {{the time}} of the repudiations, both Italy and Japan had colonial ambitions, {{intending}} on or already conducting military conquests. With the demise of the treaty limitations and the growing tensions in Europe, naval planners were free to apply both the lessons they had learned <b>operating</b> <b>carriers</b> for fifteen years and those of <b>operating</b> the Yorktown-class <b>carriers</b> to the newer design.|$|R

50|$|Due to a {{contract}} with Generali Insurance in 2010, travel agents are able to offer e-tickets via Hahn Air (HR-169) that include insurance {{in the event of}} an insolvency of the <b>operating</b> <b>carrier.</b> Since joining the Kosovo BSP in 2010, Hahn Air is present in all European markets.|$|E
5000|$|Under a {{code sharing}} agreement, the airline that administrates the flight (the one holding the {{operational}} permissions, airport slots and planning/controlling the flight and {{responsible for the}} ground handling services) is commonly called the <b>operating</b> <b>carrier,</b> often abbreviated OPE CXR, even though the IATA SSIM term [...] "Administrating carrier" [...] is more precise. The {{reason for this is}} that a third carrier is involved, typically in the case that the airline originally planning to operate the flight needs to hire a subcontractor to operate the flight on their behalf (typically a wet lease, meaning an aircraft is leased with crew and all facilities to fly, commonly due to capacity limitations, technical problems etc.) In this case, the airline carrying the passenger should be designated the <b>operating</b> <b>carrier,</b> since it is the one carrying the passengers/cargo.|$|E
50|$|Navies {{increasingly}} <b>operated</b> <b>carriers,</b> {{which had}} {{a limited number of}} aircraft available for attack, each with only a small bomb load. Targets were often likely to be a small or fast-moving and the need for accuracy made dive bombers essential.|$|R
50|$|Direct Air's {{flights were}} then {{operated}} primarily by Xtra Airways and Sky King, Inc. Boeing 737-400 aircraft. Occasionally, especially during peak travel periods, additional other <b>operating</b> <b>carriers</b> and aircraft types are used. These have included Virgin America, USA Jet, Dynamic Airways, Vision Airlines, and Miami Air.|$|R
50|$|From 1960 to 1974, the U.S. Navy also <b>operated</b> <b>Carrier</b> Anti-Submarine Air Groups (CVSG). These {{typically}} {{consisted of}} two fixed-wing anti-submarine squadrons (VS), a helicopter anti-submarine squadron (HS), and two smaller squadrons or squadron detachments of 3-4 aircraft for airborne early warning (VAW) and self-defense (VA, VMA, VSF, VF).|$|R

50|$|Interlining {{agreements}} {{differ from}} codeshare agreements in that codeshare agreements usually refers to numbering a flight with the airline's code (abbreviation) {{even though the}} flight is operated by another airline. However, codeshare relationships can affect whether an interline ticket (or e-ticket) can be issued since both the codeshare marketing carrier and codeshare <b>operating</b> <b>carrier</b> must have interline agreements with all other carriers in the itinerary to allow a single ticket to be issued.|$|E

Anchorage and Minneapolis/St. Paul, held dormant authorities to use Heathrow as their London terminal, grandfathered from {{use during the}} original Bermuda Agreement; but could only be operated non-stop by a British carrier. As such, Anchorage remained dormant during the latter years of Bermuda II, and Minneapolis featured service only to London Gatwick, as its <b>operating</b> <b>carrier</b> (Northwest Airlines) {{did not have the}} authority to operate into Heathrow.|$|E
50|$|The International Fuel Tax Agreement (or IFTA) is an {{agreement}} between the lower 48 states of the United States and the Canadian provinces, to simplify the reporting of fuel use by motor carriers that operate {{in more than one}} jurisdiction. Alaska, Hawaii, and the Canadian territories do not participate. An <b>operating</b> <b>carrier</b> with IFTA receives an IFTA license and two decals for each qualifying vehicle it operates. The carrier files a quarterly fuel tax report. This report is used to determine the net tax or refund due and to redistribute taxes from collecting states to states that it is due.|$|E
50|$|On April 6, 2016 OneJet {{announced}} that it would move its base of operations from Indianapolis to Pittsburgh and that Corporate Flight Management (CFM) would take over flight operations from Pentastar. In preparation for the move, all flights from Indianapolis to Milwaukee, Memphis, and Nashville were curtailed with only the flights from Pittsburgh running. The airline indicated that it would increase the frequency of its flights from Pittsburgh; and add destinations from the Pittsburgh focus city. After a short hiatus, CFM began OneJet operations on June 8, 2016 between Pittsburgh and Hartford, with flights to Indianapolis and Milwaukee commencing six days later. Since the transition to CFM as the <b>operating</b> <b>carrier,</b> flights between Pittsburgh and Indianapolis were briefly operated by IAI Westwind and Learjet 35 aircraft rather than the Beechjet 400A.|$|E

5000|$|Albert Greenberg is an American {{software}} engineer and computer scientist who is notable for {{his contributions to}} the design of <b>operating</b> <b>carrier</b> and datacenter networks as well as to advances in computer networking and cloud computing. At Microsoft, he is a Distinguished Engineer and the director of development for its Microsoft Azure service, which is a cloud computing infrastructure platform which coordinates data centers around the world. In contrast to hard-wired computer networks, firms such as Microsoft are turning increasingly to software-defined networking (or SDN) approaches to run its cloud computing networks by managing virtual networks across [...] "millions of servers". He oversees development of technologies that keep the network running in the cloud, so that when component failures happen, software systems pinpoint the failures and [...] "route around the faulty components;" [...] the technology permits data centers to be [...] "software-defined", allowing the cloud to grow rapidly while being flexible to meet changing needs, as he explained in 2015 in eWeek magazine. His research focuses on the infrastructure of cloud services, management of enterprise networks, data center networks, and systems monitoring. Greenberg has won numerous awards for his contributions: he is an ACM Fellow, received the Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award in 2015 for his [...] "fundamental contributions to large-scale backbone networks and data-center networks," [...] and won the prestigious SIGCOMM Award in 2015 for [...] "pioneering the theory and practice of <b>operating</b> <b>carrier</b> and datacenter networks."

5000|$|A codeshare agreement, {{also known}} as codeshare, is an {{aviation}} business arrangement where two or more airlines share the same flight. Sharing, in this sense, means that each airline publishes and markets the flight under its own airline designator and flight number {{as part of its}} published timetable or schedule. A seat can be purchased on each airline's designator and flight number, but is operated by only one of these cooperating airlines, commonly called the <b>operating</b> <b>carrier</b> or more precisely (and in line with definitions in IATA Standard Schedules Information Manual): [...] "Administrating carrier". The term [...] "code" [...] refers to the identifier used in flight schedule, generally the two-character IATA airline designator code and flight number. Thus, XX123 (flight number 123 operated by the airline XX), might also be sold by airline YY as YY456 and by ZZ as ZZ9876. Airlines YY and ZZ are in this case called [...] "Marketing airlines" [...] (sometimes abbreviated MKT CXR for [...] "marketing carrier"). Most of the major airlines today have code sharing partnerships with other airlines, and code sharing is a key feature of the major airline alliances. Typically, code-sharing agreements are also a part of the commercial agreements between airlines in the same airline alliances.|$|E
5000|$|Catapult-assisted {{take-off}} barrier arrested-recovery (CATOBAR): these carriers generally {{carry the}} largest, heaviest, and most heavily armed aircraft, although smaller CATOBAR carriers may have other limitations (weight capacity of aircraft elevator, etc.). All CATOBAR carriers in service today are nuclear powered. Two nations currently <b>operate</b> <b>carriers</b> of this type: ten Nimitz class and one Gerald R. Ford class supercarriers by the United States, and one medium-sized carrier by France, {{for a world}} total of twelve in service.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} codeshare agreements eliminate double marginalization that exists when unaffiliated airlines independently determine the price for different segments of an interline trip. Using a structural econometric model, this paper investigates whether codeshare contracts do eliminate double marginalization. The results suggest that both upstream and downstream margins persist when the <b>operating</b> <b>carrier</b> of a codeshare product also offers competing single-carrier product(s) in the concerned market. Furthermore, counterfactual simulations from the model suggest that efficient pricing of these codeshare products would lower their price, and yield nontrivial increases in consumer welfare...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the competitive {{effects of the}} merger between Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines (2009) in the domestic U. S. airline industry. Applying fixed effects regression models {{we find that the}} transaction led to short term price increases of about 11 percent on overlapping routes and about 10 percent on routes which experienced a merger-induced switch of the <b>operating</b> <b>carrier.</b> Over a longer period, however, our analysis reveals that both merger efficiencies and post-merger entry by competitors initiated a downward trend in prices leaving consumers with a small net price increase of about 3 percent on the affected routes. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} domestic codesharing alliances on airfares. Our analysis yields two novel and somewhat surprising findings {{that have yet to}} be documented in the literature. First, unlike international codesharing, we find that the overwhelming majority of domestic codeshare itineraries involve a single <b>operating</b> <b>carrier,</b> a phenomenon that we refer to as “virtual ” codesharing. Second, we find that these virtual codesharing itineraries are priced lower than itineraries operated and marketed by a single carrier in the same market. We suggest that carriers may be using virtual codesharing—in large part—as a “generic ” product to compete for the most price sensitive passengers...|$|E
