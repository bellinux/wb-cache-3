The following month, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy.

25|$|A rainbow {{party is}} an urban legend spread {{from the early}} 2000s. At these events, {{allegedly}} increasingly popular among adolescents, females wearing various shades <b>of</b> <b>lipstick</b> take turns fellating males in sequence, leaving multiple colours on their penises. Rainbow parties were covered on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2003, and {{became the subject of}} a juvenile novel called Rainbow Party. On May 27, 2010 the television program The Doctors discussed the topic with dozens of teens, parents, and professionals. However, sex researchers and adolescent health care professionals have found no evidence for the existence of rainbow parties, and as such attribute the spread of the stories to a moral panic.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} the lipsticks formulation according to the physical properties and sensory attributes and investigate the relationship between instrumental and sensory analyses and evaluate the influence of the main ingredients, beeswax and oil, with analysis <b>of</b> <b>lipsticks</b> properties. Central composite design was used to optimize the mixture of oils and beeswax and cocoa butter for formulation <b>of</b> <b>lipsticks.</b> Antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH free radical scavenging method spectrophotometrically. Physical properties <b>of</b> <b>lipsticks</b> melting point were determined in a glass tube; the hardness was investigated with texture analyzer. Sensory analysis was performed with untrained volunteers. The optimized mixture of sea buckthorn oil and grapeseed oil mixture ratio 13. 96 [*]:[*] 6. 18 showed the highest antioxidative activity (70 ± 0. 84 %) and was chosen for lipstick formulation. According to the sensory and instrumental analysis results, optimal ingredients amounts for the lipstick were calculated: 57. 67 % mixture of oils, 19. 58 % beeswax, and 22. 75 % cocoa butter. Experimentally designed and optimized lipstick formulation had good physical properties and high scored sensory evaluation. Correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between sensory and instrumental evaluations...|$|R
40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>lipsticks</b> {{has gained}} {{considerable}} importance {{in recent years}} and several cosmetic industries have geared up their marketing with different shades of colors to meet the demands <b>of</b> women. Many <b>lipsticks</b> often contain synthetic chemicals that are known to cause serious side effects upon prolonged use. In the present study, we have made an attempt to formulate lipsticks that contained only natural ingredients using extracts of the flowers of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, juice of the roots of Beta vulgaris and mica powder as colourants. Four different formulations (AA- 1, AA- 2, AA- 3 and AA- 4) were prepared and evaluated. Among the prepared lipsticks, formulations AA- 1 and AA- 4 revealed ideal characteristics <b>of</b> <b>lipsticks</b> with properties like shining, spreading and smoothness of lips after application. Further studies through a detailed clinical trial may be suggested to ensure safety of these formulations. Key words: Lipsticks, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Beta vulgaris, Mica powder, Formulation, Evaluatio...|$|R
2500|$|An {{album of}} B-sides, rarities and cover {{versions}} {{was released in}} 2003 entitled Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers), which contains the last song the band worked on with Edwards.

The only recurring criticism <b>of</b> <b>Lipstick</b> Traces was {{the exclusion of the}} fan favourite [...] "Patrick Bateman", from the [...] "La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)" [...] single. The band explained that it was excluded mainly because it was almost seven minutes long and simply would not fit on the album." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Lavender Prada dress Thurman wore at the 67th Academy Awards on March 27, 1995 was {{admired by}} the media; Stylecaster.com stated that, as a result, [...] "Thurman became {{known for her}} stellar fashion sense, while Prada got a huge boost from instant name {{recognition}} the world over." [...] Her Crimson Alberta Ferretti dress at the 72nd Academy Awards on March 26, 2000 remains among the most iconic dresses worn at the ceremony, with The Daily Telegraph voting it the 20th greatest red carpet gown of all time. In 2000, Thurman {{was selected as the}} face and spokeswoman of the cosmetics company Lancôme which named several shades <b>of</b> <b>lipstick</b> after her, though they were sold only in Asia. She sued the company in 2008 over the use of her image following her contract' expiration. In 2005, she became a brand ambassador for TAG Heuer and the French fashion house Louis Vuitton, appearing on both companies' advertisement and publicity campaigns. Thurman was chosen as the face of Parfums Givenchy in 2009, and fronted the campaign for the women's fragrance Ange ou Démon Le Secret.|$|E

5000|$|Lead {{and other}} trace metals {{are also found}} in many lipsticks. It is {{impossible}} to know whether these metals are in the lipstick by looking at the ingredient list because they are not an intentional ingredient added, but rather, an unintentional contaminant. These trace metals are naturally occurring and accidentally get taken up with other chemicals that are used in lipstick production. [...] Lead and other trace metals will not be listed in the ingredients section <b>of</b> different <b>lipsticks.</b> Look for lead acetate, chromium, thimerosal, hydrogenated cotton seed oil, sodium hexametaphosphate on the ingredients list <b>of</b> <b>lipsticks.</b> These chemicals contain trace amounts of naturally occurring metals, such as lead.|$|R
