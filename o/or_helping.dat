5|$|Emerson (1858) {{documented}} {{the presence of}} Vedar north of Eravur who subsisted by fishing <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> the traditional fisherfolk, as well by cutting wood for Muslim traders. He speculated that there were then at least 400 to 500 individuals in the group. He also recorded {{that it was the}} British colonial officers, as well as Weslyan missionaries who provided land for them to start cultivating yams and other vegetables.|$|E
5|$|In Greek Mythology, Canis Major {{represented}} the dog Laelaps, {{a gift from}} Zeus to Europa; or sometimes the hound of Procris, Diana's nymph; or the one given by Aurora to Cephalus, so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky. It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs, pursuing Lepus the Hare <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> Orion fight Taurus the Bull; and is referred to in this way by Aratos, Homer and Hesiod. The ancient Greeks refer only to one dog, but by Roman times, Canis Minor appears as Orion's second dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter. Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 Alfonsine tables.|$|E
5|$|Tinne bought {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the same item, often leaving them in the original tissue paper, with the original price labels and delivery dates. Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which would allow them to be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may have purchased excess items or high value items that she did not want, to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by the curator of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's social work in organising widows' pensions <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that she just enjoyed shopping.|$|E

5|$|Romney took a {{hands-on}} {{role in the}} Belmont Stake's matters, helping in domestic maintenance efforts, visiting the sick, and counseling burdened church members. A number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling for changes in the way the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too much from doctrine. In particular, he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems.|$|E

25|$|Euthanasia is {{a complex}} issue in Islamic theology; however, in general it is {{considered}} contrary to Islamic law and holy texts. Among interpretations of the Koran and Hadith, the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> one commit suicide. The various positions on the cessation of medical treatment are mixed and considered a different class of action than direct termination of life, especially if the patient is suffering. Suicide and euthanasia are both crimes in almost all Muslim majority countries.|$|E
25|$|Male mate {{guarding}} behaviour {{also needs}} {{to ensure that the}} mate does not leave the mateship as this would lose access to future chances that the male may have to reproduce. Moreover, the male would also lose any maternal efforts that the female would have invested in to any potential offspring. Additionally, access to any social benefits <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> networks that the female brought to the relationship could be lost. Finally, the female could also use information, such as strengths or weakness, about the male to exploit him in the future.|$|E
25|$|Herbivorous {{reptiles}} {{face the}} same problems of mastication as herbivorous mammals but, lacking the complex teeth of mammals, many species swallow rocks and pebbles (so called gastroliths) to aid in digestion: The rocks are washed around in the stomach, helping to grind up plant matter. Fossil gastroliths have been found associated with both ornithopods and sauropods, though whether they actually functioned as a gastric mill in the latter is disputed. Salt water crocodiles also use gastroliths as ballast, stabilizing them in the water <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> them to dive. A dual function as both stabilizing ballast and digestion aid has been suggested for gastroliths found in plesiosaurs.|$|E

The gospels of the New Testament, especially Luke, mention Jesus speaking to <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> women publicly and openly. Martha's sister Mary sat at Jesus' feet being taught, a privilege reserved {{for men in}} Judaism. Jesus had female followers who were his sponsors, and he stopped to express concern for the women of Jerusalem {{on his way to}} be crucified. Mary Magdalene is stated in the Gospels to be the first person to see Jesus after his resurrection. In the narratives, Jesus charged her to tell others of what she had seen, even though the testimony of a woman at that time was not considered valid.|$|E

His works have been referenced and idealized by many inhabitants of Verona throughout history, and his charters were frequently used as evidence in debates surrounding the authority of the bishops and archdeacons of the city. He was reportedly well educated on a variety of subjects and has been held up by some {{as an example of a}} Carolingian Uomo Universale. There is a street named after him in Verona.|$|E
25|$|Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an action-adventure game {{developed}} by Crystal Dynamics {{and published by}} Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android and, iOS through digital distribution. It {{is part of the}} Tomb Raider series, but unlike previous games, the game does not carry the Tomb Raider brand and has a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay. In multiplayer, players take the role as either Lara Croft or a 2,000-year-old Mayan warrior named Totec. They must work together in order to stop the evil spirit Xolotl and retrieve the Mirror of Smoke. A single-player campaign mode is available that does not include the non-playable character AI following <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> Lara.|$|E

25|$|With Arthur's dodgy schemes, the duo {{encounter}} undesirable underworld figures, {{many of whom}} Arthur {{deals with}} and many of whom turn nasty, leaving Terry to fight and outwit {{their way out of}} trouble. But for all Arthur's obsession with get-rich-quick schemes, he is never malicious, usually simply being blinded by greed, and the pair often end up putting some other wrong right <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> others in need or who have been done wrong by, even if it proves to be Arthurs's Achilles' heel to his latest scheme fully succeeding. Most of Arthur's schemes fail in the end, owing to his greediness, but he does occasionally have the odd minor victory and puts one over on the law or more serious criminals.|$|E
25|$|People {{who are not}} {{registered}} {{players are}} not allowed to interfere with gameplay. Under the original rules, this includes spying on the other team, <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> players stay in a safe area by bringing them food or doing something for a player which would otherwise require them to leave a safe-zone. If a non-player is shot with a Nerf dart or attacked by a player in any way, they should report the player(s) involved if the incident was intentional. Players who attack non-players will be banned under most rules. The original rules, and most University custom rules, stress the importance of safety in the game. The rules stress the safety of the players and non-players by not allowing realistic looking weaponry, weaponry which could hurt on impact, or dangerous behavior during gameplay.|$|E
25|$|If a firstborn {{attending}} a siyum does {{not hear the}} completion of the tractate, or if he does not understand what he hears, or if he is in the shiva period of mourning and is thus forbidden from listening to the Torah material being taught, some authorities rule that subsequent eating would not qualify as a seudat mitzvah and he would therefore be forbidden to break his fast (Ben Ish Chai 1:96:25; Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Elyashiv, Siddur Pesach K'hilchaso, p.168; Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Chazon Ovadiah, p.99). Other authorities allow a firstborn to break his fast under such circumstances (Minchas Yitzchak 9:45; Teshuvos V'hanhagos 1:300, 2:210 in the name of Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky). The Minchas Yitzchak (ibid.) suggests that a firstborn in such a position should at least try to contribute to the siyum in some way, such as by sponsoring <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> to prepare the meal.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the volunteers}} work in the visitor center helping to answer {{questions}} brought up by visitors. Restoration projects {{in the form of}} the removal of invasive plants or creating wood duck boxes for wood ducks is also an option. Bird and raptor surveys are also done at least once a year to get a population estimate on birds of prey and waterfowl that migrate or live within the Cosumnes River Preserve. Other volunteer options are available such as working with the paddle team, leading guided nature walks, <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> with the mountain lion research team. The paddle team takes visitors on tours of the Cosumnes River throughout the year. Some of the paddle tours include the bat paddle which allows visitors to witness tens of thousands of Mexican Free Tail bats feed during sunset right over the heads of the visitors. The mountain lion research team gets to access closed parts of the preserve and places or checks game cameras to observe mountain lions that reside around the preserve. There are many other volunteer opportunities available at the Cosumnes River Preserve.|$|E
25|$|After Jesse Owens {{returned}} from the 1936 Olympics, Robinson befriended him. Despite his fame from his four Olympic track wins, undermining Adolf Hitler's claims of Aryan supremacy, Owens found most of the offers {{that had been made}} to employ him had been nothing more than publicity stunts that had no substance. Robinson was the one exception, finding work for Owens within a few months of his return to the U.S. Robinson also introduced Owens to his manager, Marty Forkins, who secured a series of demonstration races for Owens which were viewed by many as degrading to the dignity of an Olympic athlete, most notably an event in Cuba in which Owens raced against a horse. As a result, Forkins and Robinson were viewed as having taken advantage of Owens. According to Forkins’ son, Robinson had told Owens that he should start running demonstration races that would both earn money for him and keep him in the public eye. Robinson had done many such races (including a race in which he set the world record for running backwards) and did not view them as undignified. Moreover, the events paid Owens well and provided him with a source of funds when no one else was offering him employment <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> him financially. Owens made a gift to Robinson of one of his four Olympic gold medals, as a gesture of gratitude for the help Robinson had given him.|$|E
500|$|Even {{the most}} respectable citizen women emerged on ritual {{occasions}} (primarily festivals, sacrifices, and funerals), {{where they would}} have interacted with men. The Thesmophoria, an important festival to Demeter which was restricted to women, was organised and conducted by Athenian citizen women. Athenian women also ventured outdoors socially. David Cohen writes, [...] "One {{of the most important}} activities of women included visiting <b>or</b> <b>helping</b> friends or relatives", and even wealthy women who could afford to spend their entire lives indoors probably interacted socially with other women outside in addition to the religious and ritual occasions when they were seen in public. According to D. M. Schaps (citing Cohen), the ideology of separation in classical Athens would have encouraged women to remain indoors but necessary outside activities would have overridden it.|$|E
