5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance <b>or</b> <b>measurements.</b> The western populations {{are known to be}} nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|E
25|$|One {{class of}} problem that {{can benefit from}} the fully quantum {{approach}} is that of 'learning' unknown quantum states, processes <b>or</b> <b>measurements,</b> {{in the sense that}} one can subsequently reproduce them on another quantum system. For example, one may wish to learn a measurement that discriminates between two coherent states, given not a classical description of the states to be discriminated, but instead a set of example quantum systems prepared in these states. The naive approach would be to first extract a classical description of the states and then implement an ideal discriminating measurement based on this information. This would only require classical learning. However, one can show that a fully quantum approach is strictly superior in this case. (This also relates to work on quantum pattern matching.) The problem of learning unitary transformations can be approached in a similar way.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} is [...] long and weighs [...] The {{nominate}} race has smoky-olive upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and buff underparts, heavily marked with poorly defined brown streaks. The legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish, {{and there is}} a pale eye-ring. The sexes are alike; although males average slightly brighter than females, the overlap is complete and birds cannot be sexed on appearance <b>or</b> <b>measurements.</b> Immature birds resemble the adult, although they may sometimes be browner and more streaked above, looking superficially similar to meadow pipits.|$|E

60|$|Whatever {{difficulty}} may be felt in {{the identification}} of Hindoos, is experienced in at least an equal degree in that of the Chinese residents in our Colonies and Settlements, who to European eyes are still more alike than the Hindoos, and in whose names there is still less variety. I have already referred (p. 26) to Mr. Tabor, of San Francisco, and his proposal in respect to the registration of the Chinese. Remarks showing the need of some satisfactory method of identifying them, have reached me from various sources. The British North Borneo Herald, August 1, 1888, that lies before me as I write, alludes to the difficulty of identifying coolies, either by photographs <b>or</b> <b>measurements,</b> as likely to become important in the early future of that country.|$|E
60|$|Little of this {{learning}} troubled {{me in my}} {{visits to}} the cathedral, or even the fact that, next to St. Peter's, {{it was the largest}} church in the world. It was sufficient to itself by mere force of architectural presence, without the help of incidents <b>or</b> <b>measurements.</b> It was a city in itself, with a community of priests and sacristans dwelling in it, and a floating population of sightseers and worshipers always passing through it. The first morning we had submitted to make the round of the chapels, patiently paying to have each of them unlocked and wearily wondering at their wonders, but only sympathizing really with the stern cleric who showed the ceremonial vestments and jewels of the cathedral, and whose bitter face expressed, or seemed to express, abhorrence of our whole trivial tourist tribe. After that morning we took our curiosity into our own keeping and looked at nothing that did not interest us, and we were interested most in those fellow-beings who kept coming and going all day long.|$|E
