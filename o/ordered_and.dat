To what extent do values as an aspect of <b>order</b> <b>and</b> discipline play a role in teacher competence and what is the opinion of teachers regarding this ? Is it possible to formulate a strategy regarding the use of values which will enhance <b>order</b> <b>and</b> discipline and improve teacher effectiveness, resulting in a more competent teacher ?

5|$|Chapter 8, Money, {{describes}} the internal debate at CBC regarding how {{to cover a}} $70 million loss in advertising revenue from the 2008-2009 recession with the government unwilling to cover the deficit or allow CBC to incur debt. Ultimately, they decided on cutting 400 jobs, {{reducing the number of}} episodes <b>ordered,</b> <b>and</b> selling excess real estate. Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the consolidation of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did not endorse Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process. In the final chapter Stursberg notes the changes that have occurred since his departure and predicts the demise of CBC Sports as it loses NHL rights to CTV/TSN.|$|E
5|$|During the 25th and 26th dynasties, the Book of the Dead was updated, {{revised and}} standardised. Spells were {{consistently}} <b>ordered</b> <b>and</b> numbered {{for the first}} time.

In the Late period and Ptolemaic period, the Book of the Dead remained based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated {{towards the end of}} the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity. The last use of the Book of the Dead was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{realization}} in February 1915 {{that the war}} would not be won quickly, the Navy department decided to replace the six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four ships were <b>ordered</b> <b>and</b> laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E

However, with the same initial conditions on an unbounded set of cells its configurations tend to organize themselves into several types of simple moving particles.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur was {{responsible}} for confirming and enforcing the sentences for war crimes handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. In late 1945, Allied military commissions in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March and Manila massacre. The trial in Manila of Yamashita was criticized because he was hanged for Iwabuchi's Manila massacre, which he had not <b>ordered</b> <b>and</b> {{of which he was}} probably unaware.
