In {{order to}} {{play a part in}} {{evaluation}} and manage of water resource for weather radar, the quantitative rainfall measurement of dual polarization doppler weather radar is developed. And based on the observed values of <b>ombrometer,</b> the differences of the measured values derived from different methods are analysed. The results show: The rainfall using KDP to calculate, i. e. R(KDP) method, is proximal to the data of ombrometer; R(ZH) and R(ZH, ZDR) method is underestimate rainfall obviously; R(ZDR, KDP) method is overestimate rainfall. With further analysis, rainfall measured by dual-polarization radar, especially from R(KDP) method, has higher precision, and provide the spatial distribution of the rainfall and the position of strong center well...|$|E
