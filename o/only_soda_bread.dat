50|$|In Europe, <b>soda</b> <b>breads</b> {{began to}} appear in the mid-19th century when {{bicarbonate}} of soda first became available for use as a raising agent. Breads, griddle cakes and scones with bicarbonate of soda, plus cream of tartar or tartaric acid became popular in Austria, Britain, Ireland and Poland. Traditional <b>soda</b> <b>bread,</b> eaten in Serbian cuisine, also uses bicarbonate of soda, particularly the traditional česnica (Serbian Cyrillic: Чесница), a <b>soda</b> <b>bread</b> made at Christmas.|$|R

50|$|In Ireland, {{the term}} {{generally}} refers to <b>soda</b> <b>bread</b> and to potato bread or cakes (potato farls). While <b>soda</b> <b>bread</b> {{can also be}} baked as a normal loaf, that used in an Ulster fry breakfast is made as farls (that is to say, flat rounds about 3/4 inch thick which are then cut into quarters). Modern commercially mass-produced potato farls, however, are often rectangular in form.|$|R

5000|$|Various {{forms of}} <b>soda</b> <b>bread</b> are popular {{throughout}} Ireland. <b>Soda</b> <b>breads</b> are made using wholemeal, white flour, or both. In Ulster, the wholemeal variety is usually known as wheaten bread and is normally sweetened, while the term [...] "soda bread" [...] {{is restricted to}} the white savoury form. In the southern provinces of Ireland, the wholemeal variety is usually known as brown bread and is almost identical to the Ulster wheaten. In some parts of Fermanagh, the white flour form of the bread is described as fadge.|$|R

5000|$|Biscuits, <b>soda</b> <b>breads,</b> and cornbread, among others, {{are often}} {{referred}} to collectively as [...] "quick breads," [...] to indicate {{that they do not}} need time to rise before baking.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Soda</b> <b>bread</b> (arán sóide, fardel, česnica / чесница) is {{a variety}} of quick bread {{traditionally}} made in {{a variety of}} cuisines in which sodium bicarbonate (otherwise known as [...] "baking soda") is used as a leavening agent instead of the traditional yeast. The ingredients of traditional <b>soda</b> <b>bread</b> are flour, <b>bread</b> <b>soda,</b> salt, and buttermilk. The buttermilk in the dough contains lactic acid, which reacts with the baking soda to form tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide. Other ingredients can be added such as butter, egg, raisins, or nuts. An advantage of quick breads is their ability to be prepared quickly and reliably, without requiring the time-consuming skilled labor and temperature control needed for traditional yeast breads.|$|R

50|$|In Ireland, as elsewhere, {{the exact}} {{constituents}} {{of a full}} breakfast vary, depending on geographical area, personal taste and cultural affiliation.

Sauteed field mushrooms are also sometimes included, as well as baked beans, hash browns, liver, and brown <b>soda</b> <b>bread.</b> Fried potato farl, boxty or toast is sometimes served as an alternative to brown <b>soda</b> <b>bread.</b> Limerick in particular has a long-standing traditional association with pork-based meat products.|$|R

2500|$|Since it {{has long}} been known and is widely used, the salt has many related names such as baking <b>soda,</b> <b>bread</b> <b>soda,</b> cooking soda, and {{bicarbonate}} of soda. In colloquial usage, the names sodium bicarbonate and bicarbonate of soda are often truncated; forms such as sodium bicarb, bicarb soda, bicarbonate, and bicarb are common. The word saleratus, from Latin sal æratus meaning [...] "aerated salt", was widely used in the 19th century for both sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate.|$|R

50|$|Rye flour is {{sometimes}} used in chemically leavened quick bread recipes as well, either batter-type or dough-type (similar to Irish <b>soda</b> <b>bread).</b> In such cases, {{it can be}} used in similar applications as whole wheat flour, since an egg matrix often provides the bread structure rather than the grain's gluten.|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} years of European {{settlement}} of the Americas, settlers and some groups of Indigenous peoples of the Americas used soda or pearl ash, more commonly known as potash (pot ash) or potassium carbonate, as a leavening agent (the forerunner to baking <b>soda)</b> in quick <b>breads.</b> In the US, <b>soda</b> <b>breads</b> were first publicised by Amelia Simmons as a quick and cheap method of bread making in her book American Cookery, published in 1796. By 1824, The Virginia Housewife by Mary Randolph was published containing a recipe for Soda Cake.|$|R
50|$|The cottage {{is open to}} {{the public}} from May to September.

50|$|Irish potato cakes are {{typically}} made from mashed potato and flour or baking soda, {{and are usually}} fried. This {{is not the same}} dish as boxty, because boxty is made using raw potatoes whereas potato cake is made using cooked potatoes.

50|$|Buttermilk can {{be drunk}} straight, {{and it can}} also be used in cooking. <b>Soda</b> <b>bread</b> is a bread in which the acid in {{buttermilk}} reacts with the rising agent, sodium bicarbonate, to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent. Buttermilk is also used in marination, especially of chicken and pork, whereby the lactic acid helps to tenderize, retain moisture, and allows added flavors to permeate throughout the meat.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} to The Gobbins - {{then as now}} - was nicknamed Wise’s Eye after the path’s creator. An oval shaped hole bored in the rock, it was manned by a railway company ‘toll collector’ from 10am to 5pm daily (including Sundays). Close {{to the entrance of}} the path two tearooms provided refreshments including strong tea, fried slices of ham, eggs, tomatoes, potato and <b>soda</b> <b>bread,</b> all of which were ‘much appreciated’ by visitors.|$|R
