[...] What will there be between us old codgers, aside of course from happy memories of skiing tours in the long distant past ... Will you come to me mainly to take receipt of the promised gift I have held for you in our cellar—that long cured Westphalian ham, and those patiently waiting bottles <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> nectar: Johannisberger 1937? [...] Could these things of the senses end up being all that there is between us? [...] I am so happy that the moment approaches, but my heart is heavy..." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} German {{leaflets}} which appealed to American troops {{was one that}} depicted a passionate kiss {{between a man and}} woman. The leaflet read: [...] "FAREWELL Remember her last kiss... ? Gee were you happy then... ! Together, you spent marvelous times..., lounging on beaches..., dancing, enjoying parties galore ..., listening to the tunes <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> band...". The leaflets back side reminds the soldier that his loved one is longing for him and that most of the men he had come with are now dead. In comparison, one Allied leaflet simply showed a picture of a large open field with thousands of German graves.|$|E

2500|$|After their two-week {{encounter}} ended, Abe became agitated {{and began}} drinking excessively. She claimed that with Ishida {{she had come}} to know true love {{for the first time in}} her life, and the thought of Ishida being back with his wife made her intensely jealous. Just over a week before Ishida's eventual death, Abe began to contemplate his murder. On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacks her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, 1936, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night, [...] "I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, 'Kichi, you wore that kimono just to please one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> customers. You [...] bastard, I'll kill you for that.' Ishida was startled and drew away a little, but he seemed delighted with it all..." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} I lunched with Mrs. Malcolm, daughter-in-law <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> traveller, Sir John Malcolm, of Persian memory. You {{should have been}} there. The house is a cabinet of Persian curiosities. There was the {{original}} of {{the picture of the}} King of Persia in Ker Porter's Travels. It was given to Sir John by the monarch himself. There were also two daggers which the king presented with his own hand. I think Sir John must somehow have mesmerized him. Then Captain M. showed me sketches of his father's country house in the Himalaya Mountains: think of that! The Alps are commonplace; but a country seat in the Himalaya Mountains is something worth speaking of. There were two bricks from Babylon, and other curiosities innumerable.|$|E

"How {{then comes}} it, we cannot but ask, that these ideas, {{displayed}} assuredly with no want of eloquence, vivacity or earnestness, have found, unless I am much mistaken, so little acceptance {{among the best}} and most energetic minds in this country? In a country where millions read the Bible, and thousands Shakspeare; where Wordsworth circulates through book-clubs and drawing-rooms; where there are innumerable admirers <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> Burns; and where Coleridge, by sending from his solitude the voice of earnest spiritual instruction, came to be beloved, studied and mourned for, by no small or careless school of disciples?--To answer this question would, of course, require more thought and knowledge than I can pretend to bring to it. But there are some points on which I will venture to say a few words.|$|E
60|$|With you, this {{silence of}} mine and of others was {{represented}} as factious, and as a discountenance to the measure of your relief. Do you think us children? If it had been our wish to embroil matters, and, {{for the sake of}} distressing ministry, to commit the two kingdoms in a dispute, we had nothing to do but (without at all condemning the propositions) to have gone into the commercial detail of the objects of them. It could not have been refused to us: and you, who know the nature of business so well, must know that this would have caused such delays, and given rise during that delay to such discussions, as all the wisdom <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> minister could never have settled. But, indeed, you mistake your men. We tremble at the idea of a disunion of these two nations. The only thing in which we differ with you is this,--that we do not think your attaching yourselves to the court and quarrelling with the independent part of this people is the way to promote the union of two free countries, or of holding them together by the most natural and salutary ties.|$|E
6000|$|I write {{first to}} you this morning {{to tell you that}} I gave {{yesterday}} the twelfth and last[22] of my course of lectures this term, to a room crowded by six hundred people, two-thirds members of the University, and with its door wedged open by those who could not get in; this interest of theirs being granted to me, I doubt not, because {{for the first time in}} Oxford, I have been able to speak to them boldly of immortal life. I intended when I began the course only to have read [...] "Modern Painters" [...] to them; but when I began, some <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> bits interested the men so much, and brought so much larger a proportion of undergraduates than usual, that I took pains to reinforce and press them home; and people say I have never given so useful a course yet. But it has taken all my time and strength, and I have not been able even to tell Susie a word about it until now. In one of my lectures I made my text your pretty peacock and the design[23] of him. But did not venture to say what really must be true, that his voice is an example of [...] "the Devil sowed tares," [...] and of the angels letting both grow together. My grateful compliments to the peacock. And little (but warm) loves to all your little birds. And best of little loves to the squirrels, only you must send them in dream-words, I suppose, up to their nests.|$|E

50|$|The song {{had mixed}} reviews by the Daily News and Analysis as they wrote,- The song’s lyrics, which are written by Arafat Mehmood and Tanishk Bagchi, are nothing beyond mediocre. And it is {{surprising}} because both of them have done some incredible work in the past. It {{reminds us of the}} strong connection between Shraddha and rains, they have been almost inseparable in all her films. We literally cannot think of a movie without a rain song picturised on Shraddha. What’s also amusing is {{the fact that she is}} under the rain but for most part of the song, she doesn’t get wet. Are you serious?This song is definitely not the best work of director Mohit Suri, who has musical hits like Aashiqui 2 and Ek Villain to his credit. But we are sure it would become one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorites,</b> especially if you are friendzoned or in a one-sided relationship.|$|R

Presented as “a multidimensional window,” it’s a remarkable musical journey that fills the listener with positive energy. I know, that sounds sooo new agey, so let me explain. I don’t listen to this record, I lose myself in it. For forty minutes, my grey little world becomes a technicolor landscape where flying saucers and octave doctors come to life on crackling waves of energy. Still not helping? Okay, then think about Pink Floyd. Remember how Dark Side and Wish You Were Here transported you to another place? Well, Motivation Radio does the same, only it’s a much friendlier place. The sounds, the melodies, the musicality of it all conspires to make me drop my guard, and before I know it I’m no longer listening to the music, I’m breathing it.
