25|$|The Test to Measure Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) is {{one method}} of {{determining}} upper limb apraxia through the {{qualitative and quantitative}} assessment of gesture production. In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, {{the reliability and validity}} of TULIA was thoroughly investigated. The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of non-symbolic (“put your index finger <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> nose”), intransitive (“wave goodbye”) and transitive (“show me how to use a hammer”) gestures. Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full apraxia evaluation.|$|E

50|$|Your baby's skull {{has seven}} bones. Normally, these bones don't fuse until around age 2, giving your baby's brain time to grow. Joints called cranial sutures, made of strong, fibrous tissue, hold these bones together.

Normally, the sutures remain flexible until the bones fuse. The signs of craniosynostosis may not be noticeable at birth, but they become apparent {{during the first few}} months <b>of</b> <b>your</b> baby's life. The symptoms differs from types of synostosis. First of all there is Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the suture at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head (sagittal suture) forces the head to grow long and narrow, rather than wide. Scaphocephaly is {{the most common type of}} craniosynostosis. The other one is called Coronal synostosis (anterior plagiocephaly). Premature fusion of a coronal suture — one of the structures that run from each ear to the sagittal suture <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head — may force your baby's forehead to flatten on the affected side. It may also raise the eye socket and cause a deviated nose and slanted skull. The Bicoronal synostosis (brachycephaly).
